		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Ayo, Dozy Doe, this shit crazy)

Man, I'm fucked up
Bitch, I'm fucked up
Look up to sky
Tell me why
I'ma fuck up
Man, I buck up
Got my buck up
Reminisce on times I fuckin' struggled, now I'm lucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Bitch, I'm fucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Bitch, I'm fucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Reminisce on times I fuckin' struggled, now I'm lucked up

Bitch, you fuckin' with the kid, I'm never turning my back
I'ma keep it pushing 'cause the mothafuckas bumpin' my tracks
The pussy pull up and I put a fuckin' bat to his cap
And I get him fed to rats
Never need 'em
Chasin' the stats
I electrify
Really wanna make it out the mothafuckin' mud
A brother comin' alive
It's a matter of time
'Til I'm really makin' it I find
I never really wanna be one to die
I try to rewind
But I gotta fight the fine line
It's finite
Thinkin' 'bout a night that I might
Grip the knife
Slice it right through the windpipe
Take a mothafucka to the back and tell 'em goodbye

Man, I'm fucked up
Bitch, I'm fucked up
Look up to sky
Tell me why
I'ma fuck up
Man, I buck up
Got my buck up
Reminisce on times I fuckin' struggled, now I'm lucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Bitch, I'm fucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Bitch, I'm fucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Man, I'm fucked up
Reminisce on times I fuckin' struggled, now I'm lucked up

Ayy, bitch, you don't really want smoke though
Switch blade rippin' through a mothafuckas torso
Step back
Hard to read like Norse code
Liquor stay hittin'
Mmm, feels like god mode
God mode, someone tell me where'd God go
Think I need help, oh well guess I got rope
Someone ask me for a feature, tell 'em god, no
I don't fuck with people man
Kick rocks, ho
