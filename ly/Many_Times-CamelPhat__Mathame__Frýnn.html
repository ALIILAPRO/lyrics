		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh-o-oh

Anxiety lures me like an enemy
No hiding when it comes for me
Creeping up inside

You show your love and I fake it
You give your heart and I break it
These games we play, I've lost you many times
Ooh, oh-o-oh

Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh

One of these days, something will break inside
We've been here before, I know we won't survive
And everything that you thought was true
Was truly just a lie

Wasn't amazed with only one way out
A clean cut away, I'm gonna leave without you
Time and time I lose the game
And I don't wanna play

Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
You show your love and I fake it
You gave your heart and I break it
These games we play, I've lost you many times

Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh

You show your love and I fake it
You give your heart and I break it
These games we play, I've lost you many times
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
Ooh, oh-o-oh
