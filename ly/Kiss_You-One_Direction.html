		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I just wanna take you anywhere that you would like
We could go out any day, any night
Baby, I'll take you there, take you there
Baby, I'll take you there, yeah

Oh, tell me, tell me, tell me how to turn your love on
You can get, get anything that you want
Baby, just shout it out, shout it out
Baby, just shout it out, yeah

And if you
You want me to
Let's make a move, yeah

So tell me, girl, if every time we touch
You get this kind of rush
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't wanna take it slow
And you just wanna take me home
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And let me kiss you

Oh, baby, baby, don't you know you got what I need
Lookin' so good from your head to your feet
Come on, come over here, over here
Come on, come over here, yeah

Oh, I just wanna show you off to all of my friends
Making them drool down their chinny-chin-chins
Baby, be mine tonight, mine tonight
Baby, be mine tonight, yeah

And if you
You want me to
Let's make a move, yeah

So tell me, girl, if every time we touch
You get this kind of rush
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't wanna take it slow (come on)
And you just wanna take me home
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And let me kiss you

(Let me kiss you)
(Let me kiss you)
(Let me kiss you)
(Let me kiss you)

Come on, na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, yeah

So tell me, girl, if every time we touch
You get this kind of rush
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't wanna take it slow
And you just wanna take me home
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Every time we touch
You get this kind of rush
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If you don't wanna take it slow
And you just wanna take me home
Baby, say yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And let me kiss you
