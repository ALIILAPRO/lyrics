		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Expectations and possibilities
Don't need no crystal ball
Across the probability, yeah
I plan to take you home
Do what you do to me
Come be my roller-coaster
Got you where we supposed to be

Watch out, I'm diggin' you
Wanna give it a try
Deep down, can you feel it?
You know I've arrived

Better hold tight
We're gonna turn it 'round and around
And around, and around, and around

Expectations of what you're givin' me
You've got me head to toe, yeah
When I hold your arm on me
Why don't you satisfy my curiosity?
Come be my Romeo
You've got me where I wanna be, yeah

Watch out, I'm diggin' you
Wanna give it a try
Deep down, can you feel it?
You know I've arrived

Better hold tight
We're gonna turn it 'round and around
And around, and around, and around

Watch out, I'm diggin' you
Wanna give it a try
Deep down, can you feel it?
You know I've arrived

Better hold tight
We're gonna turn it 'round and around
And around, and around, and around

Yeah

Watch out, I'm diggin' you
Wanna give it a try
Deep down, can you feel it?
You know I've arrived

Better hold tight
We're gonna turn it 'round and around
And around, and around, and around

Watch out, I'm diggin' you
Wanna give it a try
Deep down, can you feel it?
You know I've arrived

Better hold tight
We're gonna turn it 'round and around
And around, and around, and around
