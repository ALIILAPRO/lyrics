		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't do it to me
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no
Don't do it to me, oh no no, oh no no

Focused, I'm focused
She got a body like that
I ain't never seen nothing like that, ah
Like a fantasy in front of me, oh
I think that something special's going down
That's right I think she foreign
I think she foreign, got passports
Mi amor, started slow, got faster
She gon' work some more, work some more
No stopping her now, no stopping her now (no)

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, lipstick on my satin sheets
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time (ooh yeah, yeah)
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn (ooh yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (ooh yeah, yeah)
Something like a addict
Got me twisted (ooh yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it

Explosive, explosive (yeah, yeah)
(I could still smell her perfume)
It's not hard to notice, that I'm open (yeah yeah)
Hypnotized by the way she moves

Then she started dancing, sexual romancing
Nasty but she fancy, Mona Lisa masterpiece
What's your nationality? I wonder if there's more of you
She's got my attention (oh yeah, hold up)
Yeah, she's confident

Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
I could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time (ooh yeah, yeah)
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn (ooh yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (ooh yeah, yeah)
Something like a addict
Got me twisted (Chance) (ooh yeah, yeah) (the rapper)
But still I gotta have it

Tattoos, piercings and she just learned to twerk
She ain't gotta heart or a ass, just her brains, gotta ask cause her ass on a learning curve
And she love to earn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctors note
Real deep pockets like a doctors clothes
Stay fitted like Diddy hair back tryna rock the boat
She the first mate wanna rock the boat
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank blank, and rock & roll
She say, "I know, honey bunny that's a funny thing"
Watch her twerk for a goodfella
She money dance with the money team

She's confident
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident (yeah, yeah)
Oh no no, oh no no
And I'm down with it (oh yeah)
Oh no no, oh no no
She's confident
You could tell by the way she walks in the room

She said it's her first time (ooh yeah, yeah)
I think she might of lied
Feels so good damn (ooh yeah, yeah)
And I don't know why
I'm addicted (ooh yeah, yeah)
Something like a addict
Got me twisted (ooh yeah, yeah)
But still I gotta have it

But still I gotta have it (yeah)
But still I gotta have it (alright)
But still I gotta have it (yeah)
(Alright)
Oh no no, oh no no (yeah)
Oh no no, oh no no, no (alright)
Oh no no, oh no no (yeah)
Oh no no, oh no no, but still I gotta have it
