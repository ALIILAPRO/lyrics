		  That's Sheikh talk
Sheikh talk
Ha

Uh, left Dubai on a high note
Spent a million on myself, bitch, I'm goals
Nigga try to slide on me but I never froze
In the club 'til it close like Diplo
Outside and I'm post like Phil goes
Big rings like a nigga won the Super Bowl
Vegas two-story suites, I'm at the top floor
I'm in town for one night, let's link, ho
(Chalta rha me idhar udhar)
Yeah, let's link, ho
Hot nigga, she gon' blow me like Niso
Twenty thousand ones, left it at the Rhino (teri taraf chala gaya)
Richie like Lionel
Hoes still ain't loyal but what do I know?
Ayy, I can count the money with my eyes closed
Crypto millions, sittin' on a iPhone (chalta rha me idhar udhar)

Yeah, whole team winnin', that's your loss (loss)
She left you for a baller, that's your fault (your fault)
Move bitch, let the money walk (walk)
You wanna be a boss but you all talk (all talk, chalta rha me idhar udhar)
Three girlfriends and they all hot (hot)
Like a Flintstone, still make the bed rock (bed rock)
Move bitch, let the money walk (walk)
Bitch, I'm a boss, that's Sheikh talk (chalta rha me idhar udhar)

She left you for a baller, that's your fault (your fault)
Don't need complex, it's the simple things
I been cookin' twelve years, still sizzlin'
I'm tryna yin-Yang, twins whistlin'
I can hear snake niggas still hissenin'
In the Maybach, yeah, I'm back, mama
Papi in his bag, and it's all Prada (chalta rha me idhar udhar)
Not a Dre Beats, but she on a pill
She gon' leave the UK, summer in the Hills
I might fuck her on the Phantom, cummin' on the grill
A bitch don't drive me, don't even touch the wheel
I'm in the FR, Ferrari for real
And my new girl kinda like a big deal
Give me head for my headache, Advil
And she say she never do it but I know she will (chalta rha me idhar udhar)

Yeah, whole team winnin', that's your loss (loss)
She left you for a baller, that's your fault (your fault)
Move bitch, let the money walk (walk)
You wanna be a boss but you all talk (all talk, chalta rha me idhar udhar)
Three girlfriends and they all hot (hot)
Like a Flintstone, still make the bed rock (bed rock)
Move bitch, let the money walk (walk)
Bitch, I'm a boss, that's Sheikh talk (chalta rha me idhar udhar)

She left you for a baller, that's your fault (your fault)
Three girlfriends and they all hot
Like a Flintstones, still make the bed rock (bed rock)
(Chalta rha me idhar udhar)
That's Sheikh talk
