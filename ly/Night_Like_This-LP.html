		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo ooo

You are the one, you are the only one I was born to know
Beyond the crush of any summer lust and we dared to go
To chain our hearts and tear apart and come together again
A lover's bane forever will remain and I remember when

Ahoo stars are falling, are we falling too?
Ahoo dawn is coming, what's this coming to?
On a night like this
On a night like this
Ahoo stars are falling, are we falling too?

Doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo
Doo doo doo ooo

We are the ones, we were the lucky ones, and I will take the blame
And pay the cost for every lover's cross, heaven knows my name
The summer's touch? I loved so much I played again and again
And in the end I wasn't innocent, but we can still pretend

Ahoo stars are falling, are we falling too?
Ahoo dawn is coming, what's this coming to?
On a night like this
On a night like this
Ahoo stars are falling, are we falling too?

If we survive the storming and we're alive by morning
We'll never be the same I'll never be the same

Whistle

Ahoo stars are falling, are we falling too?
Ahoo dawn is coming, what's this coming to?
On a night like this
On a night like this
Ahoo stars are falling, are we falling too?
