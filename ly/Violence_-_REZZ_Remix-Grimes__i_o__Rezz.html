		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Violence, violence)
(Baby it's violence)
(You can't see what I see)

You can't see what I see 'cause you, ha ha
You feed off hurting me, love, hurting me

I'm, like, begging for it baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby it's violence, violence
Baby it's violence

But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see 'cause you, ha ha
You feed off hurting me, love, hurting me

(Oh)
You wanna make me bad
And I like it like that

I'm, like, begging for it baby
Makes you wanna party, wanna wake up
Baby it's violence, violence
Baby it's violence

But you can't see what I see
You can't see what I see 'cause you, ha ha
You feed off hurting me, love, hurting me, oh

You wanna make me bad, make me bad
And I like it like that, and I like it like that
You wanna pay me back, pay me back
Said I like it like that, said I like it like that

(Said I like it like)

Oh
You wanna make me bad

You wanna make me bad, make me bad
Said I like it like that, said I like it like that
