		<p>
		  Hee-hee
Hoo
Oh-oh
Oh-oh (hee)

Love ain't what it used to be
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (oh)

He wanna do something keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you, girl
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, doin' it right
He wanna jump back, half flap, doin' it right
He wanna lay you down, turn it up, shakin' it loose
He wanna fly high, nigh high, baby for you'se
He wanna motormouth, float around, baby the back
He wanna shake it up, shake it down, movin' 'round ha-ha

Love ain't what it used to be (hee)
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (oh)

Susie like to agitate
Get the boy and make him wait
Mother's preachin' Abraham
Brothers, they don't give a damn (oh)

He wanna do something keen to you
He wanna wrap his arms all around you, girl
He wanna glue it up, keep it high, deep in the night
He wanna eyeball, get hard, playin' it right
He wanna turn the key, hurt the sheets, move to the left
He wanna hot scrub, hot love, makin' it wet
He wanna give hot, jump shot, move to the left
He wanna time bar, slam dunk, ha-ha-ha

Hoo
Keep it goin' (hoo)
Party down
Hoo, hoo

Love ain't what it used to be (ow)
That is what they're tellin' me
Push it in, stick it out
That ain't what it's all about (oh)

Sister says she love him some (she's doin' it, she's doin' it)
Got his Jimmy on the run (hoo, hee)
Mother's preaching Abraham (hee)
Brothers, they don't give a damn (oh)

(What? Ho)

Johnny's begging pretty please (keep the brother on his knees)
Keep the brother on his knees (hoo-hee)
Susie likes to agitate (keep doin' it, keep doin' it, hee)
Get the boy and make him wait (oh)

Sister's married to her hood
Sayin' that she got it good 
Holy Mary, mercy me
I can't believe the things I see

Thinkin' that they got it made (hoo)
They doin' what they used to hate
Push it in, stick it out (keep doin' it, keep doin' it)
That ain't what it's all about (that ain't what it's all about)

Holy Mary, mercy me (she's holy Mary, moly Mary)
I can't believe the things I see (keep it goin' on now)
Mother's preaching Abraham (she's preachin' Abraham)
(She's doin' it she's doin' it)
Brothers they don't give a damn (hoo, hoo-hoo)
(Holy Mary, moly Mary)

Sister says she love him some (she goin' down, hee)
Got his Jimmy on the run (got his Jimmy, hee-hee)
Holy Mary, mercy me (she's holy Mary, moly Mary)
I can't believe the things I see (keep on goin', hee, hee)

You're doin' it
You're dirty
Keep doin' it
You're dirty
Keep nasty
You're nasty
You're doin' it
You're dirty
You're dirty
You're doin' it
You're nasty
You're doin' it
Keep dirty
Keep dirty
You really don't want it

Hoo
Hoo, ooh

Go on, now
Hoo

(Keep it goin')
(Close your eyes)
(I gotta make)
(Close the door)
(She's doin' it)
(She's dirty)
(She's, ooh)
(She's, hoo)
(Keep on goin')
(Party down)

Holy Mary, mercy me
I can't believe the things I see
Push it in, stick it out (stick it out)
That ain't what it's all about
