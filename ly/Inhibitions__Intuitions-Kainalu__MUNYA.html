		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time we listen to our inhibitions
Nothing ever comes to view
We can talk about it, overthink and doubt it
Only leaves us more confused
'Cause after we break the cloud cover
The feeling isn't naivety
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
We belong, call it crazy

Every time we listen to our intuition
Something always leaves us blue (always leaves us blue)
Try to call it pensive sad coincidences
Every time we're in a mood
But even with endless rain falling
The feeling never washes away
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
We belong, we belong
We belong, we belong

'Cause after we break the cloud cover
The feeling isn't naivety
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
Maybe we can't stop all of the signs
We belong, we belong
We belong, we belong

Oh baby, I want you to care for me, care for me
Oh baby, I want you to stay, stay
