		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah ah
I'll wait here, you're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should have never gone to Hollywood

They find you to time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should have never trusted Hollywood

I wrote you and told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should have never gone to Hollywood

They take you and make you
They look at you in disgusting ways
You should have never trusted Hollywood

(Ah ah)

I was standing on the wall feeling ten feet tall
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard

This is my front page. This is my new rage
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care

(Ah ah)

All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care

(Ah ah)

Phony people come to pay
Look at all of them, back to stay
Phony people come to pray

(The lines in the letter said)
Look at all of them, back to stay
(We had gone to reckon send)
Phony people come to pray

(Ah ah)
All you maggots smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard

(Ah ah)
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard

(Ah ah)
All you maggots smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard

(Ah ah)
You should have never trusted Hollywood
You should have never gone to Hollywood

(Ah ah)
All you bitches put your hands in the air and wave them like you just don't care

You should have never trusted Hollywood
