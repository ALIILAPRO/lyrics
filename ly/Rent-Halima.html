		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know I gotta pay my rent next week
Me and my ex don't talk don't speak
I don't really fuck with men no more
I just wanna be alone

I think about you when I'm thinking bout
I think about you when I'm thinking bout love
I sing about you when I'm singing bout
I think about you when I've had enough of
Reminiscing overload
And it's got me baked at the damn shows
Where I tell my mum I make enough
Got to pay rent

Know I gotta pay my rent next week
Me and my ex don't talk don't speak
I don't really fuck with men no more
I just wanna be alone

I hope you recognize you
Coz you really think you onto something
What more do you have to prove
Home boy you don't gotta pretend
You got daggers on your back
Go on write your sermon
Take that shit for certain
Coz I gotta bigger fish to burn
I gotta make rent

Know I gotta pay my rent next week
Me and my ex don't talk don't speak
I don't really fuck with men no more
I just wanna be alone

Don't think you know me yeah
Don't think I'll still be here
I think you don't see clear
Don't think you know me yeah

Don't think you know me yeah
Don't think I'll still be here
I think you don't see clear
Don't think you know me yeah

Know I gotta pay my rent next week
Me and my ex don't talk don't speak
I don't really fuck with men no more
I just wanna be alone
