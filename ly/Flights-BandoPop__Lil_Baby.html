		  (Decicco)
Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh
Uh-uh-uh, uh

I don't catch feelings, I'm catching my flights
They say what's done in the dark will come to light
Sippin' on gin, reminiscing all night
Blowin' them bands by the day, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Let 'em know I'll spray, baby
Let 'em know I don't play, baby
Anything for your love
I don't catch feelings, I'm catching my flights
They say what's done in the dark will come to light
Sippin' on gin, reminiscing all night
Blowin' them bands by the day, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Let 'em know I'll spray, baby
Let 'em know I don't play, baby
Anything for your love

(Baby)
I don't catch feelings, I only catch flights
Tryna get in your ho, only here for one night
She know I'm a dawg, but she know I won't bite
I'm on my shit, you ain't doin' it right
I done came up, I'm enjoying this life
I pop that shit that I know they don't like
Act like I'm plottin', let me hear from the mic
Free all the bros, I'm still sending them kites
Two tone AP, one half rose, one half white
Look like I'm rollin', I told her I might be
Louis, Supreme on my drip like a hypebeast
You know I'm slime, I'll fuck on his wifey
Diamonds they hit how they sittin' on my white tee
I get them checks everyday like a Nike
The Rolls-Royce truck, I know they don't like me
They on my swag takin' notes, tryna bite me
No feelin', got a flight in the mornin'
They been callin' for me, I feel important
All my cars foreign, gotta import 'em
He been poppin', but I hope he get more of 'em
I been poppin' Addys, I need some more of 'em
Ballin' hard every day like I'm Jordan
Cut her off 'cause she tried to record me
Preachin' to the streets, I guess I'm a poet

I don't catch feelings, I'm catching my flights
They say what's done in the dark will come to light
Sippin' on gin, reminiscing all night
Blowin' them bands by the day, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Let 'em know I'll spray, baby
Let 'em know I don't play, baby
Anything for your love
I don't catch feelings, I'm catching my flights
They say what's done in the dark will come to light
Sippin' on gin, reminiscing all night
Blowin' them bands by the day, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Let 'em know I'll spray, baby
Let 'em know I don't play, baby
Anything for your love

Let 'em know I don't play, baby
Adderall got me up late, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Buy her Louis and that Prada, baby
Drivin' me crazy, but it never faze me
When they try to play me, you won't let them play me
I know that they hatin', just look at they faces
Was dodgin' them cases, no more of them cages
Chain gang got me traumatized
If I go down, lil' baby you gon' ride?
Been through a lot, see the pain in my eyes
My feet on the ground and my head to the sky
Say you my rider, then baby, let's slide
Hold it down for me, don't tell me no lies
Reminiscing while we listen to Plies
I'll rather lay with you than chill with the guys

Fly high, fly high
I'm living right, right
Head to the sky, sky
Hello, goodbye, goodbye

I don't catch feelings, I'm catching my flights
They say what's done in the dark will come to light
Sippin' on gin, reminiscing all night
Blowin' them bands by the day, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Let 'em know I'll spray, baby
Let 'em know I don't play, baby 
Anything for your love
I don't catch feelings, I'm catching my flights
They say what's done in the dark will come to light
Sippin' on gin, reminiscing all night
Blowin' them bands by the day, baby
I just bought me a new K, baby
Let 'em know I'll spray, baby
Let 'em know I don't play, baby
Anything for your love
