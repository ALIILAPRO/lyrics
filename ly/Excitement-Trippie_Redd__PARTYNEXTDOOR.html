		<p>
		  Oh
Whoa, whoa

Sex ain't the only thing that's on my mind
But you get me so excited, whoa
Irreplaceable
Tattoos from your neck that drop down to your ankles
Droptop in the rain
Shawty, you wanna feel good, I wanna feel good too
Don't I make you feel good?
You get me so excited

Shawty wanna roll with a rockstar
Baby, let's go, we can go far
Yeah, watch the stars, and go far

Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
All in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident
Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
All in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident

Shawty (shawty), love me forever (love me forever)
Shawty (shawty), gotta love me forever, girl
(Gotta love me forever, babe)
Shawty, love me forever babe
Shawty (shawty), uh, yeah

Shawty wanna roll with a rockstar
Baby, let's go, we can go far
Yeah, watch the stars, and go far

Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
All in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident
Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
All in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident

Sex ain't the only thing that's on my mind
But you get me so excited, whoa
Irreplaceable
Tattoos from your neck that drop down to your ankles
Droptop in the rain
Shawty, you wanna feel good, I wanna feel good too
Don't I make you feel good?
You get me so excited, babe

How well should I feel about you? But crazy
Pushed the limits on my anxiety
When I'm inside it (ooh, ooh)
My excitement for you (ooh)
For you (ooh), for you
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah, oh

Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
All in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident
Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
All in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident
