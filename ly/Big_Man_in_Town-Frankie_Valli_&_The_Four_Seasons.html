		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big man in town
Each day as I grow older
The nights are getting colder
Some day the sun will shine on me
Money, I don't have any
I'm down to my last penny
But darlin' don't cry over me

[Chorus:]
I'll be a big man in town, honest honey
I'll be a big man in town, promise darlin'
I'll be a big man in town, just you wait and see
You'll be proud of me
Big man in town

They think that I'm a rover
But my rovin' days are over
Some day your folks will welcome me
I went away a small man
But I'll come home a tall man
Then what a pretty bride you'll be

[Chorus:]

Big man in town
I'm gonna make it, just wait and see
Oh, I'm gonna make it, just wait and see
Girl I'm gonna make it, just wait and see
