		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got the bitch dizzy
Yak and cheese whip
Yakaroni drip
Yak sauce, condiment
Drip store, condiment
I got the condiment, man
Know what I'm sayin' (Dzy on the beat)
The drip store
Condiment, Yak sauce

Baby, love got the fake job with the Botox
Yeah, nigga, don't paint job like butterscotch
I was 'cross town zootin' with my dude Pookaduke
Yeah, nigga, train different color like fruit loop
Favorite girl calls and she stay in Michigan
Drunk a lotta coffee and I gotta shit again
Niggas know they ain't seein' Yak 'cause they never did
Yeah, nigga, MAC can't suppress like the evidence
Made a lot of Haitians turn Jewish, told 'em, "God said"
I ain't got no phone to talk to Murda on a iPad
Switchin' up rentals, you ain't even know what car I'm in
Yeah, nigga, I got the sauce like condiment

Yeah, nigga, I been smokin' deuce with the camera crew
Yeah, nigga, I been drinkin' Goose like the animal
Furniture mahogany and the whole floor bamboo
Yeah, nigga, bitch soakin' wet, nigga, shampoo

Drop my last album same day a bitch overdosed
Next day, they found Jay Martin layin', caramel toast
Don't paint job butterscotch, seats butter toast
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck your wife, nigga got your number for?
Bakin' soda Pyrex, whippin' up a dope cake
Mix match designer, rockin' Gucci with the Dolce
Flees on fluffy and McQueen on '61
Kodak Black went Bodak Yellow on a Bentley truck
Cuban links so damn big, they like, "What the fuck?"
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck, why you think I got your number for?
Ain't nothin' sweet, keep a piece like buttercup
Snuck up in a club with the fire, that's a tummy tuck

Yeah, nigga, I been smokin' deuce with the camera crew
Yeah, nigga, I been drinkin' Goose like the animal
Furniture mahogany and the whole floor bamboo
Yeah, nigga, bitch soakin' wet, nigga, shampoo
