		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I’ve tried)
(Oh, I’ve tried)
I’ve tried to come to terms with my mind

Another night feeling down, tryna get by
I can’t believe what my life has become
And I can’t sleep, barely breathe
Need to get out
To clear my mind under the street lights

It’s all too much
Guess I’ll try to walk it off
They say tomorrow’s a new day
Well, I cannot fucking wait

Yeah, I cannot fucking wait

Always on the verge of giving up
Already given all I’ve got
It was not enough, I’ve clearly lost
‘Cause after all I’ve done, I’m just

Sleeping in to cope with the pain
Or lying awake and hating
Everything I ever felt that
Could have had a possible impact

(I’ve tried)
I’ve tried to come to terms with my mind
And I cannot put up a fight
I am outnumbered by demons
They’re laughing and screaming
And waiting to watch me go down
So fuck all of this shit
I am so over it, just let me be
Trust me, you don’t want to be on my team ‘cause I always lose everything that I hold dear

Always on the verge of giving up
Already given all I’ve got
It was not enough, I’ve clearly lost
‘Cause after all I’ve done, I’m just

Sleeping in to cope with the pain
Or lying awake and hating
Everything I ever felt that
Could have had a possible impact
