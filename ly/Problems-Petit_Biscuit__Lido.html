		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The amount of magnetism's perfect
She says she knows just how to cool down California, for me
Text at three AM because her roommate is back in Texas
I copy like "roger"
We could climb some trees and get perspective
Mirror right next to her bed
Motion perfected, all I can do is respect it
Why'd you wanna be around me in the first place?
She said "baby I've been down since third grade, you were satisfied with first base"
And I've been widely known to be providing earthquakes
You must not have heard

She likes the shark print with the zip-up
High hats with the hiccups
Dark tints on the pickup
Pineapples and liquor
She moves with the machine
Play the game to change it
This is how it is to be
This is what I'm made with
This is love

Love, love, love, love
This is what I'm made with
This is love
Love love

I watch the silhouette against the sunrise

She read my mind and poured some earl grey in a solo, for me
Asked me if I wanna go to Mars and watch the world end
I think I might love her
And she got everything I need
Playing Jodeci at noon
We might never leave her room

She likes the shark print with the zip-up
High hats with the hiccups
Dark tints on the pickup
Pineapples and liquor
She moves with the machine
Play the game to change it
This is how it is to be
This is what I'm made with
This is love

Love, love, love, love
This is what I'm made with
This is love
Love love
This is what I'm made with
This is

Love, love, love, love
This is what I'm made with
This is
Love, love
