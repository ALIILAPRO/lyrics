		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped by iron bars
Solitary ripping at me inside
A victim of this crazy ward
Must get out of here
No one gets out of here

Force fed medication
The more I take the sooner I'm free
Contributing to my mind's abduction
Can't they see it's tearing me
Can't they see it's killing me

[Chorus]
Welcome to the 3rd floor
It's a one way trip
Then they lock the door

More than just a crazy nightmare
Doors opened up and swallowed me
Banished from existence
Why'd they ever throw away the key
Will I ever be set free

[Chorus]
