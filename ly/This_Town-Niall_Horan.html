		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wakin' up to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow runnin' 'round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far from the stars

And I wanna tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playin' in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watchin', I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you, mm

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met, he's got his arms around you
It's so hard
So hard

And I wanna tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playin' in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

'Cause if the whole world was watchin', I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies, they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you, mm

And I know that it's wrong
That I can't move on
But there's somethin' 'bout you

'Cause if the whole world was watchin', I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you
You still make me nervous when you walk in the room
Them butterflies, they come alive when I'm next to you
Over and over, the only truth
Everything comes back to you, mm
Everything comes back to you, mm
