		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get lost in my thoughts
And for hours of time
And it's making me feel
Like I am not alone anymore
To be honest (to be honest)
I am trying to love
But I'm afraid to kill
And I never know when
When to search or stay still
So I fly
To be honest with you

Broken and yet tender
Always in and always out
Heading to the water
Drowning in what it can hide, hide
Kind of always cautious
Don't you, don't you break my heart
Feeling kind of loveless
Yet always ready to try

And I've been through so much
That sometimes it feels far
It is like a movie
Played by another star
She's a stranger
To be honest (to be honest)
Now I'm sitting alone
And I'm trying to listen
To the stories that could
Make mine a little softer and fine
To be honest

Broken and yet tender
(Douce et abîmé)
Always in and always out
(Toujours à côté)
Heading to the water
(Dans l'eau s'enfoncer)
Drowning in what it can hide
(Ne rien y trouver)
Kind of always cautious
(Toujours protégé)
Don't you, don't you break my heart
(Y a rien à casser)
Feeling kind of loveless
(J'ai rien à donner)
Yet always ready to try
(J'ai tout à donner)

Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away
