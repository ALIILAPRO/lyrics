		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Into this hole I sink
Nowhere to run for cover
It's trying to bury me
But I will not surrender
 
We will never be the same again

答えは苦痛の先に

From the dark
We walk to the light
From the shadows
We learn to survive
When there's nothing to hide we will find
What comes next
After light

Destroy, rebuild
Now, now
Destroy, rebuild
Now, now

I hear the angels sing
But I hear the demons louder
Destruction chasing me
Pulling me under

Pulling me under now
I'm dying to get out

We will never be the same again

From the dark
We walk to the light
From the shadows
We learn to survive
When there's nothing to hide we will find
What comes next
After light

Destroy, rebuild
Now, now
Destroy, rebuild
Now, now

答えは苦痛の先に 
I found my way

From the dark
We walk to the light
From the shadows
We learn to survive
When there's nothing to hide we will find
What comes next
What comes next

From the dark
We walk to the light
From the shadows
We learn to survive
When there's nothing to hide we will find
What comes next
After light

We will never be the same again
We will never be the same again
