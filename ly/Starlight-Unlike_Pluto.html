		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taking all the starlight from me now
Turning all my spotlight
Into Dark nights
Stolen from me now
Taking all my starlight

Taking all the starlight from me now
Turning all my spotlight
Into Dark nights
Stolen from me now
Turning all my starlight
Into dark nights

I don't wanna heart attack
I fear the worst
Is coming down, down on me (Is catching up to me)
I can't take this on my chest
I know I'm not my best
Rock bottom doesn't pay rent

I can't go and throw this all away
A stain on my name
not turning away
Thought you were invested into me
A fool's paradise
Look who paid the price

Oh No no, hey
Oh no no, hey
Oh now my Starlight starts to fade
Oh No no, hey
Oh no no, hey
OH no no Like a thief you're

Taking all the starlight from me now
Turning all my spotlight
Into Dark nights
Stolen from me now
Turning all my starlight
Into dark nights

Dreams are nightmares in a haunted mind 
I was left behind  
Can't wake my cloudy eyes 
Oh how the times have changed 
As the seconds tick away 
My life becomes detained 

I can't go and throw this all away
A stain on my name
not turning away
Thought you were invested into me
A fool's paradise
Look who paid the price

Oh No no, hey
Oh no no, hey
Oh now my Starlight starts to fade
Oh No no, hey
Oh no no, hey
OH no no Like a thief you're

Taking all the starlight from me now
Turning all my spotlight
Into Dark nights
Stolen from me now
Turning all my starlight
Into dark nights

Dreams are nightmares in a haunted mind 
I was left behind  
Can't wake my cloudy eyes 
Oh how the times have changed 
As the seconds tick away 
My life becomes detained 

You can't change a mind that's made 
A Bruise won't fade 
I know you'll pray that I'll just go away,
I'll go away 
Maybe I'll just go away
I'm gone today

Taking all the starlight from me now
Turning all my spotlight
Into Dark nights
Stolen from me now
Turning all my starlight
Into dark nights
