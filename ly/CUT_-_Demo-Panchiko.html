		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faster than light
To burn the stripes
 They forge this heart 
For you to play the part

Have I been cut again
Just to dodge sweet decent my friend

Spit now the fire 
Fantasies desire 
They forged this heart 
For you to fall apart

Have I been cut again
Just to dodge sweet decent my friend 
And I will reap what you’ve sown
Just to play these games alone.

Try to describe the voices in your head 
They’re hard to disguise
Or so somebody said
Come back to earth
you’ve gone too far this time 
They cut you too deep
You tread these thin white lines 
And we know the truth
We sit at home
We watch the girl in the booth
Who gives her services for thousands of yen 
She wonders where all the happiness went.

She’s cut cut cut 
Cut cut cut - backing 
She’s cut cut cut
Cut cut cut - backing

She’s cut cut cut 
Cut cut cut - backing 
She’s cut cut cut 
Cut cut cut - backing
