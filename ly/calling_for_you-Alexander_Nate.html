		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High hopes, low notes
Seems like we walk on tight ropes
But I know you too well
Fuss and we fight but oh well

If you tell me don't go
Then I'll stay but you and I know that
It's only a matter of time
Before you go

So come back to me my darling
Come back to me I'm calling for you
Do you hear me
Oh I'm kneeling, I'm falling for you
I'm all in for you, I'm calling for you

Heartbreak at the hotel
The last time I knew how love felt
I've been trying, to find peace
But I just keep running in circles

You tell me, don't go
And I'll stay but you and I know that
It's only a matter of time
Before you go

So come back to me my darling
Come back to me I'm calling for you
Do you hear me
Oh I'm kneeling, I've fallen for you
I'm all in for you, I'm calling for you

And I say
Come back to me my darling
Come back to me I'm calling for you
Do you hear me
Oh I'm kneeling, I've fallen for you
I'm all in for you, I'm calling for you
