		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""I'm flying high through the clouds on top of my wheels of steel you're trying to hide away from me I'm wearing my belt of strength along with my iron-gloves my power is strong and glorious Why the heavens scream my name i will tell you now cause i am thor (the thundergod) and i decide where the lightning strikes if you don't believe it my hammer will show you how When you sail through the seas in search for glory and gold winds carrying you away from home You better pray for you're life's and sacrifice to me now you better watch out cause i am near Why the heavens scream my name i will tell you now cause i am thor (the thundergod) and i decide where the lightning strikes if you don't believe it my hammer will show you how When you see clouds ahead and rain is pouring down there is no time for you to pray I'm raising my hammer high to swing it with all my might my power is strong and glorious Why the heavens scream my name i will tell you now cause i am thor (the thundergod) and i decide where the lightning strikes if you don't believe it my hammer will show you howin""
