		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like tight jeans, dark shades,
When I walk the ground shakes (boom)
Like an 808 (boom)
You appreciate my lean
Body nice shape,
Wanna take me on a date (move)
You've got what it takes (move)
You better have some cake.

I like, how I'm catching your eyes,
I like, how I don't even try,
I like you, I like you boy,
I like you, boy.

You might mistake me for heart breaker,
'cause there's blood on the floor,
I'm hoping you will see, there's something good in me,
Never seen before,
Might mistake me for a heart breaker,
'cause there's blood on the floor,
I know you're shaking me,
My heart is there for keeps, there's an open door.

I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.

I chew bubble gum and talk fast,

Switch up to high class (grooves)
On my day to day (grooves)
On these 28's,
My hydraulics bump hard,
But I can't kiss a car. (lose)
If you walk away (lose)
This could be your day

I like, how I'm catching your eyes,
I like, how I don't even even try,
I like you, I like you boy,
I like you, boy.

You might mistake me for heartbreaker,
'Cause there's blood on the floor,
I'm hoping you will see, there's something good in me,
Never seen before,
Might mistake me for a heartbreaker,
'Cause there's blood on the floor,
I know you're shaking me ,
My heart is there for keeps, there's an open door.

I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before
Good, good girl,
I know I can be a good, good girl,
I know I can be a good girl,
But I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.
Good girl, but I've been bad before.
