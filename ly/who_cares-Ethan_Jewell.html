		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight, I finally realized that nobody really gives a shit
I mean, I know it sounds harsh but often that's what reality is
You see, it started out slowly
Notifications on my phone became an uncommon occurrence
Sometimes my presence felt as though it was testing others' endurance
So I wondered if there was a remedy
A remedy for this isolation I began to feel
So I adapted
I got louder in conversations so I wouldn't get drowned out
I didn't tell if they asked how I was because what if they found out
It's not like they'd care
I mean, they would just judge, and then not be there
But that's okay
Because that's just how it goes
Then it started going quicker
Caring eyes strayed away from me
It felt as though there was no remedy
I longed to be held, but instead, I was shunned
But it's okay because he has so many invisible people out there for him
Lonely nights became far too common
I was painfully aware of my own thoughts
A few said that they would be there for me
But instead, I just turned to my pen
And you know why
Because I guarantee
If I stopped texting them first, I would never hear from them again
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
The empty lightbulb has burnt out
And the tears in my eyes refuse to leak out
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
I'm so alone
