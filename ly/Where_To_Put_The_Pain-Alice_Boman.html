		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where to put the pain
Sometimes I turn cold
So much to take in
Can I turn to you?

Can you feel it?
Can you see it too?
Can you feel it?
Can you see it too?

Sometimes lose control
Don't know how to be
Where to put the pain
Can I turn to you?

Can you feel it?
Can you see it too?
Can you feel it?
Can you see it too?
