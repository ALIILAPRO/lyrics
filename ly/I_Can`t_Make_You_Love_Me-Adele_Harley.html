		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices
Inside my head
Lay down with me
Tell me no lies
Just hold me close
Don't patronize
Don't patronize me

I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' it wont
Here in the dark,in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And feel the power if you wont
No you wont
Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't

I'll close my eyes
Then I wont see
The love you don't feel
When your holdin' me
Morning will come
And I'll do whats right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight
And I will give up this fight

I can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel
Somethin' it wont
Here in the dark,in these final hours
I will lay down my heart
And feel the power if you wont
No you wont
Cause I can't make you love me
If you don't
