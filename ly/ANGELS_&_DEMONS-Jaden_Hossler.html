		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two face, two face, yeah
Black white, left right, yeah
Up, down, all night, yeah
Can't escape it ever
Don't forget my name
I don't feel the same
On a trip, no train

And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden

So fuck me like a Rockstar
Dancin' on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a Rockstar
Ridin' in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now

Everybody said that I'm fallin', uh
Took another line I'm callin', uh
I'm so sick of the nonsense, uh
I'ma dive into the mosh pit
I don't really think I'm the problem
I don't really think it's a problem
Me plus me is a problem
One gun shot, I could solve 'em

Tell my friends I'm sorry though
T-T-T-Tell my sins to go

And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden

So fuck me like a Rockstar
Dancin' on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a Rockstar
Ridin' in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now

(Rockstar, Rockstar)

And all these angels and demons
Keep shoutin' and screamin'
I'm fallin' from Eden

So fuck me like a Rockstar
Dancin' on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a Rockstar
Ridin' in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now

So fuck me like a Rockstar
Dancin' on a cop car
Nothin' in the world can stop me now
Fucked up like a Rockstar
Ridin' in a cop car
No one in the world can help me now

Don't stop, drop
Rockstar
Fuck me like a Rockstar
