		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't try to blow out the sun for me baby
I'm not hoping for what I know can't be

All that I ask, is for a kiss each day
And I'll give you love that will never go away

Yes I will, yes I will, yes I will

Cause girl I wouldn't ask you to lift up this great big world little baby
I know that your not that kind of a girl

All that I ask, is for a kiss or two
And nothing in this world will be too good for you

Nobody(x7) knows, how deep my love for you really goes

Nevermind now , with your heart ,how much you say(x5) 
(on 6th line changes to)
Nevermind now how much you say, much you say
(or "what you say")

Oooooooh... (descending)

Cause girl, I want you to know
I wouldn't ask you to hold back the dawn by the dawn baby
That's just a little too much to ask of anyone

All that I ask, is for your loving ways
And I'll keep you happy for the rest of your natural born days
(or "natural warm days", whatever)

Nevermind now , with your heart ,how much you say(x3)
Nevermind now how much you say, much you say
