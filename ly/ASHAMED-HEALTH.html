		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I shouldn't have come here
But I got nowhere to go

I know I shouldn't call after dark anymore
But I got no one
No one in this world

I can't change
You can't change for me
I can't look at your face
(No one in this world)

They can't blame you
For blaming me
I've got nothing to say

I'm ashamed of being born
I'm ashamed of being born

I know shouldn't beg you anymore
But I've got no way to go on

I know I'm too young to die
But I'm old enough now
With no one in this world

I can't change
You can't change for me 
(No one in this world)
I can't look at your face
(No one in this world)

They can't blame you
For blaming me (this world)
I've got nothing to say

I'm ashamed of being born
(Nobody else, nobody else)
(Got nobody else, nobody else)
I'm ashamed of being born
