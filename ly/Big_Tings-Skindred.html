		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big tings running through my mind
I think about them all the time
I'm gonna do my ting the way I wanna do it
And everything will be alright
Big tings burning up my soul
I think I'm bout to lose control
Do I tell myself that I can get through it?
Maybe I'll never know

Big tings all in my brain
Big tings got me again

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself

Big tings gonna have their way
I think about them every day
Do I step inside and enjoy the ride?
To hell with what people say

Will I ever be satisfied?
Big tings still on my mind

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself

I can see them coming over the horizon
I don't think that I can trust myself
I can see them coming over the horizon
I don't think that I can trust myself

Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than you
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than me
I can't trust myself
Some things are bigger than you
I can't trust myself
