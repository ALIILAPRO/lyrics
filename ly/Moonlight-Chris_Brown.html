		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Levitate in the night, defy gravity
Meditate, vanilla skies, sex and therapy
Shooting stars sent from venus
Down to mars, right where you belong
In my arms, drifting outta space

Is it true that you never flew to nirvana?
Tonight you gotta
I love the view when you're in a mood
The weather's perfect where we lay

Let's make love on a cloud
You're the moonlight
Baby, feel your raindrops fallin' down, oh
Let's make love on a cloud
You're the moonlight
It's simple, we'll go where the wind blows (ooh)

In your supernova, lost control
Wanna elevate your high, make your soul
Let's go to a place of the unknown
Let's go to a place no one can go

Is it true that you never flew to nirvana?
Tonight you gotta (gotta)
I love the view when you're in a mood
The weather's perfect where we lay (lay)

Let's make love on a cloud (hey)
You're the moonlight (baby)
Baby, feel your raindrops fallin' down (ooh), oh (oh)
Let's make love on a cloud
You're the moonlight (girl)
It's simple, we'll go where the wind blows (ooh)

We can turn the lights down low (ooh)
It's the stars that make you glow
We can turn the lights down low
Girl, it makes you go (makes you go)
We can turn the lights down low
It's the stars that make you glow
We can turn the lights down low
Girl, it makes you go

(Let's make love on a cloud)
Let's make love on a cloud (ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
You're the moonlight (kissin' my baby, yeah)
Baby, feel your raindrops fallin' down, oh
Let's make love on a cloud (ooh)
You're the moonlight
It's simple, we'll go where the wind blows (yeah, yeah)
