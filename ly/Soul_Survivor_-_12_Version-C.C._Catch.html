		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lady lady Lai you hurt me
Oh, don't make me cry
Leaving me, oh girl, it's easy
He will say goodbye

It's a hard time for lovers
And a broken dream to you
Let me stay together, my love, forever
I never wanna, wanna feeling blue

Be my soul survivor
Oh, come on take me higher
Don't let me down, oh it's just too late girl

Soul survivor
It's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
Tonight, the night it's all right

Nothing, lady, hurts forever
Stop your lipstick lies
He will spend the night together
Just with me, don't try

'Cause my love is so precious
Love will never be the same
And I'm never lonely, 'cause he's the only
I never wanna, wanna play a game

Be my soul survivor
Oh, come on take me higher
Don't let me down, oh it's just too late girl

Soul survivor
It's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
Tonight, the night it's all right

It's the night, it's the night, yeah
He'll win my heart
It's the night of my burning dream
Secret love, secret love, oh I wanna start
I never wanna lose you baby
Oh, I'll never break apart

Be my soul survivor
Oh, come on take me higher
Don't let me down, oh it's just too late girl

Soul survivor
It's like a burning fire
He pulls the strings of my deep emotions
