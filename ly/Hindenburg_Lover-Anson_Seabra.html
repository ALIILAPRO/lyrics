		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were floating for days
We were flying the way
That doves do
And I loved you

We were sailing the sky
Watching the clouds passing by
Like a dreamland
Where should we land?

Yeah, we were invincible
That's what they said
So indivisible
Wherever we went
Higher and higher, yeah
I guess that we had it all
Light up the sky and then
We thought that we'd never fall

You were my Hindenburg lover, we were flying away
Then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames
And now I'm staring at the wreckage tryin' to make it okay
Oh, yeah
And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart
And I'd be lyin' if I said I didn't know from the start
That there was something in between us that would tear us apart
Oh, yeah

I can still see your face
Looking back through the flames
And I search it
Was it worth it?

No I don't mind the smoke
But your tears make me choke
Are you okay? 
Should I go away?

Yeah, we were invincible
That's what they said
So indivisible
Wherever we went
Higher and higher, yeah
We thought that we'd never fall
Light up the sky and then
I guess that we had it all

You were my Hindenburg lover we were flying away
But then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames
And now I'm staring at the wreckage tryin' make it okay
Oh, yeah
And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't know from the start
That there was something in between us that would keep us apart
Oh, yeah

You were my Hindenburg lover we were flying away
But then we took a wrong turn and it was all up in flames

Oh, yeah
And I guess I got burned from the scars on my heart
And I'd be lying if I said I didn't know from the start
That there was something in between us that would keep us apart
Oh, yeah
