		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mink Miu Miu boots got me tip toin'
Leather sweatpants, that's Rick Owens
Skinny so the blick showin'
Semi with the dick showin'
Private 757 big Boeing
Tell my pilot I said get goin'
Yellowbone with me, skin glowin'
Of course, her friend joined
They do what I say they be ten-fourin'
And ain't no VenMoin'
Light the J like I be Lin knowin'
The bay I'm ignorin'
Blow the paper like a vent blowin'
Just like some rent blowin
It's Tunechi, yo, Clarecuzio
Kitchen in the studio
Soft top double-R, that's the Ricky Rubio
Beautiful, diamonds dancin' like they in the musical
Optical illusional, Jordan Farmar, 'ceuticals

Uh, ooh
Uh, wait, wait
Fuck is my lighter?
Ooh, wait
Mm, yeah
Uh

And that's Lil' T on the audio, uh
We like Luigi and Mario, uh
Every bar be like a bar of soap, uh
Every floor be like a marble floor, uh
Used to buy weed by the corner store, uh
Buy a whole pint of some Master P, uh
I'ma roll me a Lil Romeo
Wait, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
That's Chef Boyar-T and he on the stove, yeah
We like Luigi and Mario, yeah
Every bar be like a bar of soap, yeah
Every floor be like a marble floor, yeah
We toast to our phones and we comatose, yeah
I bought a pint of some Master P, uh
I'ma roll me a Lil Romeo, wait

Last night I had a fight with my sleep
I guess the coke got in my pores from touchin' all the bricks
So I just wrapped 'em up and wrote Tyson on each
I got 'em bitin' ears and bitin' they teeth
I'm talkin' 'bout that good snow, temp low
Don't be surprised if I sneeze
Excuse me, God bless me, thank you
Socks on the coupe cover the ankles
I'm drivin' so fast, I might sprain 'em
They be tryna' bite the style, like a Caymen
But we know it's all Wayne, there's no Damon
Only God could judge me
Jesus piece on at my arraignment
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Explain it
Dang, the dang chains on, lookin' sweeter than a Danish
Paintin' pictures with his guts, artistic genius
I stand back and admire my art and kiss my fingers
"And in God I trust"
Mwah
My nina say she wanna get her body done
Before I load the gun, I told my bullets all we got is us
Lamb mignon, blaze propellors, blunt long as Coachella
Mother knows best and Daddy don't know no better
I know you' smell 'em, it's young Tunechi coca
My Uncle Rufus just ODed we burnin' down the dope house
This shit calamities, animals
And they all with the shit unanimous
I'm sicker than an ambulance
I'm shittin' like a baby that got sick of all the pamperin'
She foreign, Yugoslavian
I throw this dick and she gon' act like I just threw a javelin

Ooh, wait
Yeah, yeah
Uh, and that's Lil' T on the audio, uh
We like Luigi and Mario, uh
Every bar be like a bar of soap, uh
Every floor be like a marble floor, uh
Used to buy weed by the corner store, uh
Buy a whole pint of some Master P, uh
I'ma roll me a Lil Romeo
Wait, uh, yeah, uh, yeah
That's Chef Boyar-T and he on the stove, yeah
We like Luigi and Mario, yeah
Every bar be like a bar of soap, yeah
Every floor be like a marble floor, yeah
We toast to our phones and we comatose, yeah
I bought a pint of some Master P, uh
I'ma roll me a Lil Romeo, wait
