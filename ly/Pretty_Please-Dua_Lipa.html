		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kind of tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
But my mind is running wild, could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So baby, come try me, baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kind of tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
But my mind is running wild, could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty please
Every single night
I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Make me feel so pretty
Would you help me out please?

(Pretty)
(Pretty)
(Pretty)
(Pretty)

Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
But my mind is running wild, could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty please
Every single night
I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Make me feel so pretty
Would you help me out please?

Pretty please
