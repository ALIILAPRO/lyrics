		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay, I know you'll love a train wreck
It's not safe, to love someone that's dangerous

It's killin' me, killin' me, no
When, I'm killin' you, killin' you slowly
I wish that you would hate me

So, don't you kiss me, don't you hold me
Just take this as your final warnin'

I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna lie
I'm just fucked up so don't even try
If you wanna leave, then leave me behind
'Cause I'll never be perfect

Perfect, perfect
No, I'll never be perfect
Perfect, perfect
No, I'll never be perfect

Babe, you won't want this forever
It's too late, can't get my shit together

I hate that you, hate that you love me
I'm killin' you, killin' you slowly
Let someone love you better

So, don't you kiss me, don't you hold me
Just take this as your final warnin'

I'm gonna cheat, I'm gonna lie
I'm just fucked up so don't even try
You wanna leave, then leave me behind
'Cause I'll never be perfect

Perfect, perfect
No, I'll never be perfect
Perfect, perfect
No, I'll never be perfect
