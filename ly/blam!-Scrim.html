		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)
(Damn, son, where'd you find this?)

Blam (blam)
I just blammed on 'em (let's go)
Yeah, blam (yeah)
I just blammed on 'em (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, blam (yeah)
I just blammed on 'em (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, blam
I just blammed on 'em (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Too many cars, too many hoes, too many drugs (hype me up, up, up)
I just blammed on 'em
Too many bars, too many homes, too many guns
Yeah, I just blammed on 'em (let's go)
Yeah, top down in the coupe, bitch, we way past Mercedes
I got many women begging me for a baby
I got many men and they wishing death on me
Choppa by my side with a full clip on in it and it go

Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam, blam

Yeah
Grey cullinan inside macaroni
Ain't gotta watch the opps 'cause my gang watch for me
God by my side but I'm never ever lonely (too fucking lit)
Glock by my side so I'm always ridin' slowly
You know I push they buttons
They know I'm good for everything and they good for nothin'
Hit from the launchpad, you know blam the Dutton
That's like seven hundred horses taken off from nothin'
Yeah, blam, uh
I just be blammin' when I'm on the track
I just be blammin' the motherfuckin' pack
I just be blammin' the motherfuckin' bands
Yeah, blam, uh (yeah, blam)
I just be blammin' the motherfuckin' Glock
Yeah, blammin' the motherfuckin' block
Audemaur blammin' the motherfuckin' clock, yeah
Jump in, I hop in and I swerve
Pop me a xan for my nerves
I'm geekin' and geekin' and geekin' and geekin' 
And throwin' the percs in the purse (let's go, let's go)
Yeah, I just been winning, no L's, yeah
All my engines, they yell, yeah
Building my biz to the Heavens 
And flexing that I made it straight out of Hell, yeah
Blam on a dummy then I take his honey
And bend and fuck her on top of my money
My wrist is too sunny, my chain is too sunny
My cup is too muddy, my exe's one one knee
Beggin'-ass bitches, I'm laughing in stiches
I'm burning up bridges and building up riches
Blam on a witness, I blam with the stick
Blam on these bitches to suck on my dick

Blam
I just blammed on 'em (let's go)
Yeah, blam (yeah)
I just blammed on 'em
Yeah, blam
I just blammed on 'em
Yeah, blam
I just blammed on 'em (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Too many cars, too many hoes, too many drugs (hype me up, up, up)
I just blammed on 'em
Too many bars, too many homes, too many guns
Yeah, I just blammed on 'em (let's go)
Yeah, top down in the coupe, bitch, we way past Mercedes
I got many women begging me for a baby
I got many men and they wishing death on me
Choppa by my side with a full clip on in it and it go

Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam
Blam, blam, blam, blam, blam

Too many cars, too many hoes, too many drugs
I just blammed on 'em
Too many bars, too many homes, too many guns (damn, son, where'd you find this?)
I just blammed on 'em
Too many cars, too many hoes, too many drugs
I just blammed on 'em
Too many bars, too many homes, too many guns
Yeah, I just blammed on 'em
