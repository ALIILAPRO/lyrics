		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  yeah i’m using again, it takes all that i have
bold words from an addict
how can i pick myself up?
i’m past the breaking point and there is no way to stop - i’m giving in

this is a desperate cycle
the noose is closing in
vision disarray, i’m tired of failing to see clear

there’s no way of getting even with hell beneath my skin
pulling me in and in the blink of an eye i don’t feel anything

there’s no way of getting even with the taste of defeat
pulling me down from the gallow until my eyes turn opaque - eternal grey

desperate cycle
the noose is closing in
vision disarray, i’m tired of failing to see in the turmoil
losing friends, the only ones left are the spineless
so you’re starting out, you better get the fuck behind it

i’m the definition of a man that is never enough
i’m past the breaking point and there is no way to stop
