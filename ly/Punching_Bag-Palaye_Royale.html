		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go on, make my day
Go get high on my mistakes
Give me more complaints
You're real, I'm just a fake
I wake up, I'm so glad
I can be your punching bag
Go on, make my day
Go get high on my mistakes

Go ahead and mold me, bought me and they sold me
I'm smiling upside down
Now I'm all used up, ready for my close up
Am I pretty underground?
I can be your Barbie, I can say sorry
I can do whatever you want
Go ahead and slap me if it makes you happy
Use and abuse me till I'm gone

Go on, make my day
Go get high on my mistakes
Give me more complaints
You're real, I'm just a fake
I wake up, I'm so glad
I can be your punching bag
Go on, make my day
Go get high on my mistakes

If you want me, come and take me
Because I love the way you hate me

I didn't even notice, barely got a moment
Not a moment to myself
Heaven's what they sold me, but now I miss the old me
Before I got stuck in hell
Walking down the street, just a public enemy
My back's against the wall
I didn't even notice, barely got a moment
Build me up to watch me fall
(Watch me fall, watch me fall, watch me fall)

This is goodbye, you bled me dry
This is goodnight, my soul has died
I gave you my all, you built me up to fall
I gave you my all, I gave you my all

Go on, make my day
Go get high on my mistakes
Give me more complaints
You're real, I'm just a fake
I wake up, I'm so glad
I can be your punching bag
Go on, make my day
Go get high on my mistakes

If you want me, come and take me
Because I love the way you hate me
Someone find me, someone save me
Because I feel like I'm fucking dying
