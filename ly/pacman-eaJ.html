		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loving you's just getting harder and harder to do
Cause my head says no but my phone keeps calling you
And you never pick up unless you've got nothing to do
But you say that you want me
Much as I want you
Over and over
Like it's red rover
Will your games ever be through
Play me over and over
Pacman and lover
Hoping you run out of quarters soon
Don't hurt me
Leave me
No I don't mean that
Love me all the way to death

Oh it's killing me how
Fear is holding me down
But I wanna hold you
Oh I might burn to the ground
But see me burn with a smile
If I die it's with you
