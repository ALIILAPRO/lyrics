		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You a hoe when it comes to real life
Hot tub, what that coffee feel like?
Nice rug I ain't talking real pipe
Cyclops on the twelve, come near, I
I dress up when I hang with rich kids
I guess I'm hanging with rich kids, hey
I just thought of some new shit, yeah
And we still watching bootleg

Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?

You ain't ever seen a brown boy like this
I shoulda seen your lips through your eyelids
I shoulda bought some gas for the mileage
Now my whip hella stuck with no pilot
Indiana kinda hot for my biceps
I ain't really got no biceps
Why you always concerned who I kiss?
Yeah, I just wanna call for a ride in

My baby's calling me
I'm picking up like "hey babe"
Asking where I'm at
I just say "OK"
I just say "OK"

Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?

Fuck what you do to my head
You should step out before you find something bad
You should call the cops when you give me a lift
You should call the cops when you give me a lift

Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
Say you wanna make a scene?
Oh you wanna rock the beat?
