		  And I want you to be mine

Stand up in the club
Come on let's go
She want me to come
He want me to go

And if you wanna fight
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine

Stand up in the club
Come on let's go
And I want you to come
I won't let you go

So if you wanna dance dance
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine
Yeah I want you to be mine

Yeah I want you to be mine

Stand up in the club
Come on let's go
She want me to come
He want me to go

And if you wanna fight
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine

Stand up in the club
Come on let's go
And I want you to come
I won't let you go

So if you wanna dance dance
Let's start the show
'Cause I want you to be mine
Yeah I want you to be mine

Yeah I want you to be mine

Yeah I want you to be mine
