		  St. Louis (Heavy On It)
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

I'm out of town, thuggin' with my rounds
My coochie pink, my booty-hole brown
Where the niggas? Come lookin' for the hoes
Quit playin', nigga, come suck a bitch toe

Pound town, just left pound town
With my nigga, he just took a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga dick a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga eat me out
Pound town, just left pound town
With my nigga, he just took a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga dick a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga eat me out

(Uh, uh) I'm out here in Miami
Lookin' for the hoochie daddies (where they at?)
Where the niggas that get ratchet? (Where they at?)
My son need a new pappy
Too many bitches, where the niggas at?
I'm tryna get my coochie scratch (yeah)
I'm tryna get my coochie stretched (yeah)
You know them dread heads do it the best (oh, yeah)
I like a nigga with a check
All my niggas give me neck
You know I'm sexy, I'm the best (Sexyy)
I'm the shit, lil' bitch, I'm that (you know it)
I-I-I can't say his name 'cause he be cheatin' (I love you, baby) 
Yeah, and I'm the reason
Ahahaha, niggas love a bad bitch (yeah, yeah)
What Suki say? Nut on my tits (Sexyy)

Pound town, just left pound town
With my nigga, he just took a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga dick a bitch down (haan)
Yeah, that nigga eat me out (haan)
Pound town, just left pound town
With my nigga, he just took a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga dick a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga eat me out (haan)

Ayy, yo, Red, my name is Pink, I made him go get that ink
Let him eat this pretty pussy, now he keep trying to link
I-I'm pimpin', pinky ring, his exes is rinky-dink
I'm 'bout to pop a thingy then sip on this drinky-drink
Get a grip, 'fore my bitches dip, nigga, where my tip?
I'ma flip like a hundred bricks, get back on my licks
I'm a bitch, I want fish and grits, throwin' hissy fits
I ain't talkin' about chicken when I jerk it with my tits (oop)
I be twerkin' on that dick, plus, I'm slurpin' every drip
When I ride it, choke his neck (ooh) 
Or missionary (ooh, brrt), doin' splits (ah)

Hello
Girl, guess who baby daddy poppin' they bussy in my motherfuckin' DM's
Anyway, I'm out in Miami, ho
He like feet, suck on his camel toe
Eat the pound cake down
I'm waxed up, booty-hole waxed down

Pound town, just left pound town (wop, wop)
With my nigga, he just took a bitch down (wop)
Yeah, that nigga dick a bitch down (haan)
Yeah, that nigga eat me out (haan)
Pound town, just left pound town (yeah)
With my nigga, he just took a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga dick a bitch down
Yeah, that nigga eat me out (haan)

Oh, oh, oh
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
