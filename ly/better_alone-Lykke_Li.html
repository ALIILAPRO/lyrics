		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody wants to be
Nobody wants to be the one to walk away
Nobody wants to see
Nobody wants to see the truth, then let it in, run away
Nobody wants to know
Nobody wants to know the ways they don't love you right
They don't love you right

So when you hold me tightly, all night
Ooh, baby, I feel like something's not right
When you hold me tightly like that
Ooh, baby, I know, mmm

I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely

Nobody wants to bleed
Nobody wants to bleed, but everybody hurts
Nobody wants to blame
Nobody wants the shame of knowing they're the ones that made it worse
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do when makin' love don't make it right?
It don't make it right

So when you hold me tightly, all night
Ooh, baby, I feel like something's not right
When you hold me tightly like that
Ooh, baby, I know

I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely

And it's gonna be a long night
Nobody to hold tight
I'm waking up on your side
And I can't decide
It's gonna be a long night
Nobody to hold tight
I'm waking up on your side
And I can't decide

I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, lonely)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, I'm better all alone)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely (lonely, I'm better all alone)
I'm better alone than lonely here with you
So lonely here
I'm better alone than lonely

Lonely, I'm better all alone
Lonely, I'm better all alone
