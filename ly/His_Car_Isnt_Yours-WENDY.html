		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met you in the summer
What a bummer that the timing killed the mood
Didn't overthink it
It felt easy moving far away from you

But now looking back
I looked at you like nobody else
Am I supposed to find someone
Makes me feel how I felt?
I'm trying think it's time that
I try again with someone new

Now it's eight o'clock and I'm waiting on
This good guy to come pick me up
I just wanna have a good night
He's pulling up, oh, my God, I see the headlights
And he opens my door but his car isn't yours

Now I see that black Jeep
Parked on my street
And it's messing with my head
Lying to my mind that you might come back
Try to win me back again, hmm, yeah

And I should be okay
Driving 'way with somebody else
So why do I wish it were you here in front of my house?
I shouldn't keep on hoping so I'm going out instead

Now it's eight o'clock and I'm waiting on
This good guy to come pick me up
I just wanna have a good night
He's pulling up, oh, my God I see the headlights
And he opens my door but his car isn't yours

It's not you anymore in my driveway
It isn't you drivers seat on the highway
It isn't you on your way every Friday
And I hate that it hurts that his car isn't yours, yeah

But that car isn't yours
No, his car isn't yours, yeah

Now it's 2 A.M.
He just dropped me off asked if he could come in
I told him maybe not then he asked what he did
I said that nothing's wrong
It wasn't your car

Now it's eight o'clock and I'm waiting on
This good guy to come pick me up
I just wanna have a good night
He's pulling up, oh, my God I see the headlights
And he opens my door But his car isn't yours, hmm 

But that car isn't yours
No, his car isn't yours (hmm-mm, yeah, yeah, mm, yeah)
