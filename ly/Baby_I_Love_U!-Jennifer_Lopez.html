		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boy I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt the way
You were feelin' me baby
I'm so outta control yeah
Every time you look my way, I
Realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless baby

What I wanna know is
Are you willing to try
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night oh

(Baby I love you) Love you
(Baby I need you) Need you
(I gotta have you) I gotta have you baby
(Can't be without you) Be without you

(Baby I love you) Yeah
(Baby I need you) Need you
(I gotta have you) I gotta have you baby
(Can't be without you)

Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me, such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know that everyone around you knows
That everything has changed
Your're not the same, it's a new day
Oh what I wanna know is
Are you willin' to try
There's gotta be more meaning to this
Than what meets the eye

(Baby I love you) Baby I need you
(Baby I need you) Gotta have you baby
(I gotta have you) Can't be without you
(Can't be without you) Baby I love you

(Baby I love you) Yeah yeah
(Baby I need you) I gotta have you
(I gotta have you) yeah yeah yeah
(Can't be without you)

Oh I love the way you kiss me
Oh baby please
I'm about to loose my mind
Oh talk to me, oh
'Cause I'm beggin' for you and I'm down on my knees
Baby I know your the one that I need

Baby I love you
You know why I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you
Baby I love you
You know why I need you
Gotta have you
Can't be without you

Baby I love you (baby I love you)
Love you (baby I need you) I need you
(I gotta have you) I gotta have you baby
Can't be without you

Yeah baby I love you
(Baby I love you) Oh oh I swear I do
(Baby I need you) There is no big love like this
(I gotta have you)
(Can't be without you)

(Baby I love you)
(Baby I need you) Ladies
(I gotta have you) Do you know what I'm talkin' about you
(Can't be without you) Huh

(Baby I love you) When a man gets inside your soul
And it takes hold (Baby I need you)
And it won't let go
(I gotta have you)
Can't be without you
