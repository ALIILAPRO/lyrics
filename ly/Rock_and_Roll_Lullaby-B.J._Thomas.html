		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was just sixteen and all alone when I came to be
 So we grew up together, my mama-child and me
 Now things were bad and she was scared but whenever I would cry
 She'd calm my fear and dry my tears
 With a rock and roll lullaby

 And she'd sing
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, it'll be all right
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, just hold on tight
 Sing it to me, mama
 My, my, my, my mama
 Sing it sweet and clear, oh mama let me hear
 That old rock and roll lullaby

 We made it through the lonely days but, Lord, the nights were long
 And we'd dream of better mornin's when mama sang a song
 Now I can't recall the words at all, it don't make sense to try
 'cause I just knew lotsa love came through
 In that rock and roll lullaby

 And she'd sing
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, it'll be all right
 Sha-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, just hold on tight
 I can hear ya, mama
 My, my, my, my mama
 Nothin' moves my soul like the sound of the good old
 Rock and roll lullaby

 Just hold on tight
 My, my, my, my mama
 Nothin' moves my soul like the sound of the good old
 Rock and roll lullaby
