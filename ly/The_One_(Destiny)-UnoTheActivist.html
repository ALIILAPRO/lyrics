		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitches ain't shit
Now, when these hoes get horny, niggas die
Hoes get horny, niggas die
Watch, every time, every funeral you go to
It's a bitch that was horny the night before
So you need to start checkin' these bitches
(Raybands) (What, what, what, what?)
(Get that bag and make 'em mad)
(Get that bag and make 'em mad)
(Get that bag and make 'em mad)
(Uno, I killed it)

Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night
Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night

Have my heart, can't have my heart
Have my heart, can't have my heart
People play like they in love with you
Just to they tear that shit apart
They take L's and I take W's
Because I'm playing my part
She told me she want my nut
I told her I play it smart (Tonight-night)
I got diamonds on my pinky ring
Can shine all in the dark
I'm gon' take your ho and paint her
Face and call it work of art
Before niggas try to take my drip
I tell you will not make it far
They be like, "I take a drug", I be like
"Where do I start?" (Tonight-night)
I got big plan, bad plans, bad mans
Diamonds dance, my diamonds dance
Diamonds dance
I'm a big man, big, I'm in the bag, man
Talkin' 'bout forty thou' on my wrist
I am Ben 10 forty thou', hit the bitch
Get her transplant
She wanna nod off, sorry miss
I got other plans
Ain't no lights on, diamonds hit
Come from the Motherland
She wanna nod off, sorry bitch
Go to another man (She said)

Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night
Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night

Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
(Get that bag man, get that bag man)
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight, night
(Get that bag man, get that bag man)
Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night

I get in that bag and make 'em mad
Get in that bag and make 'em mad
Baby girl say that she wanna spend the night
I had to leave her sad (Tonight-night)
Walk around here
Look like a thotty-body 'cause she
Ain't have a dad
Walk around here, won't fuck with
Me and my partner, i'm not into that
(Tonight-night)
All that hate on the internet
Get that game, we gettin' the bag
They screamin' my name, you listen to that
They takin' your chain, you listen to that
(Tonight-night)
I give on the gang, it's getting her wet
I give up the fame, they give me some racks
I get up in range, I get up and aim
Then forget they came like Men In Black
(Tonight-night)
I get the safe where the millions at
I pull up and air it out, then pullin' back
Hit your ho from the back and her hair
Pull it back
Know I make up for whatever you lack
She wanna kick it, I told her, "Relax"
I got up and, listen, I'm coming right back
She ask
"Do you love me?" It's not even that
I need the bitch to get up the racks
I need a bitch who got money to match
These tricking ass hoes ain't
Got nothing to hatch
Leave her on seen, she was fast
These hoes get dangerous, watch your sack
And she lyin', put the hell in the cat
I double my cup, what the hell is in that?
Turn a opp into a pack
Turn his bitch into a snack

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(thgin-thginot, nu-u-u-uf emos evah s'teL)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(eno, enoemos tn-a-a-a-aw uoy, ybaB)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(thgin-thginot, nu-u-u-uf emos evah s'teL)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(eno, enoemos tn-a-a-a-aw uoy, ybaB)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(thgin-thginot, nu-u-u-uf emos evah s'teL)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(eno, enoemos tn-a-a-a-aw uoy, ybaB)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(thgin-thginot, nu-u-u-uf emos evah s'teL)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(eno, enoemos tn-a-a-a-aw uoy, ybaB)

Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night
Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night

Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night
Baby, you wa-a-a-a-nt someone, one
Let's have some fu-u-u-un, tonight-night
