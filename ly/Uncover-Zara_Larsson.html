		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other

In the daylight, in the daylight
When the sun is shining
On the late night, on the late night
When the moon is blinding
In the plain sight, pain sight
Like stars in hiding
You and I burn on, on

Put two and to-gether, forever will never change
Two and to-gether will never change
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
That's when we uncover, cover, cover

My asylum, my asylum is in your arms
When the world gives heavy burdens
I can bear a thousand times
On your shoulder, on your shoulder
I can reach an endless sky
Feels like paradise

Put two and together, forever will never change
Two and together will never change
Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is, that's how it goes
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
That's when we uncover, cover, cover

We could build a universe right here
All the world could disappear
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care
We can build a universe right here
The world could disappear
I just need you near

Nobody sees, nobody knows
We are a secret, can't be exposed
That's how it is (it is), that's how it goes (it goes)
Far from the others, close to each other
That's when we uncover, cover, cover
That's when we uncover, cover, cover (ooh yeah)
That's when we uncover
