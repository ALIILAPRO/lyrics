		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grandma’s drunk again passed out in her soup 
The rats are singing 
There’s asbestos in the roof 
Mr. Perkins in the front yard with his gun 
The kids are crying as he points it at the sun 

I smell pollen where the grass still lives 
Standing on the mezzanine 
Choking on my spit 
I still wonder why they live like this
It seems like everyone’s dying 

Hmmmm
Hmmmm


She killed her husband 
Cuz he loved her like a whore 
They say the flowers grew 
The day she dumped the corpse 
She drowns herself inside her Tylenol and pills 
says she could have been an actress in a film 

I smell pollen where the grass still lives 
Standing on the mezzanine 
Choking on my spit 
I still wonder why they live like this
It seems like everyone’s dying 

Hmmmm
Hmmmm

This town is dying 
Why are they like this 
God keeps on lying 
They’ll try to hide it
Their setting fire to the churches tonight 
The shadows dance on the wall 
Waiting for the answers to their call
