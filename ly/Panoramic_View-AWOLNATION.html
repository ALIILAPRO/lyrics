		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hurt my head, it's personal
I'm bleeding blue with panoramic view
My taste in you is personal
Look ma, no hands in panoramic view

Somewhere out there, still I believe in magic
Let the monsters loose, I believe in magic
I won't let them hurt you
Lay your hands on me, I believe in magic
A romantic fool, I believe in magic
I won't let them hurt you

 I'm getting old, it's personal
 I'll take my toll in panoramic view
 Please love this song, it's personal
 I'll right my wrongs in panoramic view

 Somewhere out there, still I believe in magic
 Let the monsters loose, I believe in magic
 I won't let them hurt you
 Lay your hands on me, I believe in magic
 A romantic fool, I believe in magic
 I won't let them hurt you

I won't let them hurt you
I won't let them hurt you

My shirt don't fit, it's personal
I wrote this song in panoramic view

Somewhere out there, still I believe in magic
Let the monsters loose, I believe in magic
I won't let them hurt you
I won't let them
I won't let them
Lay your hands on me, I believe in magic
A romantic fool, I believe in magic
I won't let them hurt you
I won't let them
I won't let them 

Somewhere out there, still I believe in magic
Let the monsters loose, I believe in magic
I won't let them hurt you
I won't let them
I won't let them
Lay your hands on me, I believe in magic
A romantic fool, I believe in magic
I won't let them hurt you
I won't let them
I won't let them
