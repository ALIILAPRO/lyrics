		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a "wreck me" week
Sixty-plus from dawn to dusk
In the red dirt heat
Busting it up for a couple of bucks
But it ain't no thing
Just another day 'til I'm on my way
To them cool, cool sheets and you and me

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Gonna rock it right
No need to talk, I know what you want
And what you like
'Cause I do too, yeah
I love how you leave on the lights
Not a thing between you and me
And it feels so nice when you and I are

Working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby

Yeah
Yeah, yeah
It's been a "wreck me" week
Oh, but who needs sleep?

When you're working on the night shift, baby
Dying for your touch like crazy
Racking up the overtime hours
Loving how we're working on the night shift, baby
Loving how we're working on the night shift
Loving how we're working on the night shift
Working on the night shift, baby, yeah
