		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Die, die, die, yeah

Radical rather than rhetorical
Babble like an oracle
Why am I always in your debt?
Father and the son and the holy ghost
Communist comatose
Show me all the wagers are a bet
The middle of a nuclear winter
Is a modern achievement of the retro apocalyptic horde
Satan? You must be mistaken
There are no more Satans
Only the bosses on the board
Forget, deny, ignore, nice try, it's you
Regret, rely, remorse inside of you
Yeah

Maybe you've been down too long
Maybe you've been down too long

The heart begins to suffer
When the soul has given up
And the flesh is barely more than bone
When no one else is listening
Only when you've had enough
Time to sing this dying song alone
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Die, die, die, yeah

Maybe you've been down too long
Maybe you've been down too long

Think hard, you bastards
You're gonna tell me why
If I don't get an answer
You're gonna sing and die
Think hard, you bastards
You're gonna tell me why
If I don't get an answer
You're gonna sing and die

The heart begins to suffer
When the soul has given up
And the flesh is barely more than bone
When no one else is listening
Only when you've had enough
Time to sing this dying song alone
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
Put your hands into the water
Let your mouth go sick and dry
Put your life into your death now
Let them sing until you die
