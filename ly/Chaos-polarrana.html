		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m lying on the floor
Waiting for stars to fall
The ceiling’s not the door
For starry night you know

The days are passing by
I’m passing by the days
As there is no surprise
For what the future lays

Stop! The time is way too loud
The melody of thoughts
Is drowning in the sound
Of some unwanted words
They flaw chaos

Chaos! Aha! Feels like the
State of the total mess
Nothing left to suppress
Chaos! Aha! Seems like from
All the ways to express
I found the one I guess.

The stars fell in the floor
From ceiling where I lie
Don’t need them anymore
As world is upside down

The order’s too prosaic
It’s not enough for me
To keep the mess within
Till the eternity

Stop! The time is way too fast
The present of my own
Is drowning in the past
Of somebody unknown
It forms chaos

Chaos! Aha! Feels like the
State of the total mess
Nothing left to suppress
Chaos! Aha! Seems like from
All the ways to express
I found the one I guess.

Don’t hide it, how did
They become so frightened,
Blinded by the reality they made up
The hybrid inside me
The quite one and violent
The story behind it
Turned up my inner riot
