		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And all at once I knew
I knew at once
I knew he needed me

Until the day I die
I won't know why
I knew he needed me

It could be fantasy, oh
Or maybe it's because

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me

It's like a dime a dance
I'll take a chance
I will because he needs me

No one ever asked before
Before because they never needed me 
(But I do)
But he does

Maybe it's because he's so alone
Maybe it's because he's never had a home

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me

For once, for once in life
I've finally felt
That someone needed me
And if it turns out real
Then love can turn the wheel
Because

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me 
He needs me, he needs me 

He needs me, he needs me
He needs me, he needs me 
He needs me, he needs me
