		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sixteen lines)
(Blow and I'm fine)
(You're wasting your time, wasting your time)
(Please don't cry)

Sixteen lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
Wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
Sixteen lines to make me feel fine
Ten years ago, went blind
I been on my own since age nine

Sixteen lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
Sixteen lines to make me feel fine
Ten years ago, went blind
I been on my own since age nine

I been on my own for two nights
I been in my zone, I've been high
Now she wonder why do I lie
I can't tell my wrongs from my rights

Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (hate it when you fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (girl, I know you hear me)
Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me

Sixteen lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wasting your time
Sixteen lines to make me feel fine
Ten years ago, went blind
I been on my own since age nine

Is anybody out there? (Is anybody out there?)
Can anybody hear me? (Can anybody hear me?)
I hate it when you fake care (fake care)
Girl, I know you hear me (hear me)
