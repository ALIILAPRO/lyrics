		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think a lot about the words I know that we both let go unsaid
I found myself feeling every word, the weight of my regrets
No more regrets
No more words left to leave unsaid to a bitter end because you won't speak to me
We should fight until this feeling's dead, we should fight until there's nothing left to give 
When nothing's left, there's no regrets
I hope you choke before you come to your senses
What's done is done, get over it
But I get the feeling you won't let go of it
Get it off your chest, I'm sick of you second guessing it
We lie, we cheat, we steal, we blame and then we leave
Then find our way to get right back in to end up on our knees
Practice the words you preach, give fucking everything to the bitter end
Stand for something
We should fight until this feeling's come and went,
we should fight until there's nothing left to give 
Nothing left, No regret
I hope you choke before you come to your senses
What's done is done, get over it
But I get the feeling you won't let go of it
Get it off your chest, I'm sick of you second guessing it
Why don't you just say what needs to be said
I'll never know what goes on in your head
