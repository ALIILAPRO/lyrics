		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put that record on
Girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again

You're in every line
Takes me back in time
Yeah, tonight I'm wondering

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band in some college town bar?
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

Or is it something to get you through?
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fallin' and hearts still breakin'

'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new?
What are you listening to?

I like to believe
That you're just like me
Trying to figure out how a good thing goes bad

I don't know
I can't let it go
Yeah, it's about to drive me mad

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band in some college town bar?
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

And is it something to get you through?
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fallin' and hearts still breakin'

'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new?
What are you listening to?

Is it a feelgood song gets you driving too fast?
The one that gets you moving on past the past
Or the kind that you can't help singing along
Singing, whoa

Is it headphones on on a downtown train?
Or a window seat on an outbound plane?
Is it LA sunny and Memphis blue?
I wish I knew, I wish I knew

What are you listening to?
Is it a cover band in some college town bar?
Where it's na-na-na's and air guitars

And is it something to get you through?
Just a sad song playing on the radio station
Tears still fallin' and hearts still breakin'

'Cause you're hanging on
Or is it a love song about someone new?
What are you listening to?

I put that record on, girl, you know what song
And I let it play again and again
