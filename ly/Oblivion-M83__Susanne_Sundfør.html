		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since, I was young, I knew I'd find you
But our love, was a song, sung by a dying swan
And in the night, you hear me calling
You hear me calling
And in your dreams, you see me falling, falling

Breathe in the light
I'll stay here in the shadow, oh
Waiting for a sign, as the tide grows
Higher and higher and higher

And when the nights are long
All those stars recall, your goodbye, your goodbye

And in the night, you'll hear me calling
You'll hear me calling
And in your dreams, you'll see us falling, falling
And in the night, you'll hear me calling
You'll hear me calling
And in your dreams, you'll see us falling, falling

Breathe in the light and say goodbye
Breathe in the light and say goodbye
