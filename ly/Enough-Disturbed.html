		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (We don't want men, We want everything)
(We've chosen to want everything)

We don't want men, who want everything
We've stolen in this suffering
And we told them to want everything
But use caution in what you believe
And we're haunted, deny everything
Controlling in this suffering
And they're broken, and lost everything
It's so much easier to leave

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Feeling nothing left inside

When your own have died
And there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

We are don't want men, we take everything
I'm taunted in this suffering
And our forces surround everything
Make it impossible to see

Take their hope away
Take their life away
Feeling nothing left inside

When your own have died
And there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

Haven't we suffered enough now, haven't we suffered enough now
Haven't we suffered enough damage's then I can bear
Haven't we suffered enough now, haven't we suffered enough now
Haven't we suffered enough damage's then I can bear

Did they even tell the reason why
Countless sons and daughters sent to die
Can you even comprehend the pain

When your own have died
And there's no more pride
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough
When your heart is broken
A thousand times
With every moment
Is that enough?

When you're out of time
In this lullaby (In this lullaby)
When your soul is frozen
It's had enough (It's had enough)
When your heart is broken
A thousand times (A thousand times)
Will that be only?
Is that enough?
