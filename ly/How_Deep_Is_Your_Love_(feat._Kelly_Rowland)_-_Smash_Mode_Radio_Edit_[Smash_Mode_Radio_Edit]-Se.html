One thing me want you know me well, well prepared
Give me the ting girl and make me shift if it in gear
She pull me close up and give me the stare
She whisper inna my ear

How deep is your love? (you should know)

You are the magnet, I am the steel
Strong connection, me know you feel it
So make we seal it

I don't wanna be your cool friend (no, it's a wrap girl)
I don't wanna be the chick

To share your bed with ('round the clock girl)

'Cause mine run down to the ocean floor (Du-dutty yeah)
Oh whoa-oh

Down to the ocean floor

Deeper than the ocean
Deeper than the sea
You and me girl
