		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much
Too much trouble for me
Too much
You're too harmful for me
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Too much
Trouble
Too much
Trouble
Too much
Trouble
Too much
I got to leave her the fuck alone
Had to replace with a brand new hoe
Bad ass bitch
Bad ass bitch
With a ass that bounce all the way to the floor
Labels
They're trying to sign me
Funny how Shorty came back in my life right now
It's perfect timing
Whatever I tell you better stay inside your mouth
You keep it private
Wherever I walk inside that room
They know I'm winning we shining
It's just me and all my bros
We don't care what you got going on
Trying to steal the swag I notice
That shit is not going to put you on
It's just me and all my bros
We don't care what you got going on
Trying to steal the swag I notice
That shit is not going to put you on
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Trouble
Too much
Trouble
Too much
Trouble
Too much
Trouble
Too much
I got to leave her the fuck alone
Had to replace with a brand new hoe
Bad ass bitch
Bad ass bitch
With a ass that bounce all the way to the floor
