		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break of dawn, break of dawn
Baby, you can be my rider bitch
All you ladies pop yo' pussy like this
Shake your body, don't stop, don't miss 
All you ladies pop yo' pussy like this
Shake your body, don't stop, don't miss 

Uh-huh, yeah
You know me, I don't need no introduction in this
I know niggas up north that be pumpin' the bricks 
I know niggas down south that be dumpin' the clips
I know niggas on the east that's never lovin' a bitch 
And she ain't lovin' them niggas, make five, six figures
Back it up, don't stop, like I could hold that liquor 
Back it up, don't stop, like I could hold that too
Two million dollar home, we can go back to 
Couple thousand on the watch, that's a throwback, boo
Hundred fifty on the whip, like, "Oh, that's cute"
She said she like the stick hard, I gave the ho bamboo 
She said she like the good beef, I gave the ho wagyu (ooh)
She gon' get freaky if the bread right
And if the head right, I'll be there every night
And if the pussy good, I'll be there everyday
Face down, ass up, roll play, anime

And that pussy so swole
Shake that ass to the floor
Baby, I'm a little hit
'Cause I love a nigga that's rich (baby, you can be my rider bitch) 
Pop it like this, if you a bad ass bitch
I be the best you ever had (Santana)
Make a nigga want it bad (baby, you can be my rider bitch) 

Bad bitch, white toes, that's the energy (ow)
Started gettin' money, bitches turned enemy (tuh)
Bein' broke ain't a win to me (bye)
Can't fuck no nigga with no broke dick energy
Now he pushin my buttons, he thinkin' 'bout sex
But all my time gon' cost you a check
This highway curve gon' cause you a wreck
These are size forty-two, on top of yo' neck
I just want the face first, eat it 'til your face hurt
Pussy for dessert, ass clappin' like a church
Runnin' up a check, so my feelings don't work (feelings don't work)
Applyin' major pressure and you gon' need a Perc' (it hurt)
I'll get freaky if the bread right (ow)
And if the head right, I'll be there every night
If the dick good, I'll be there every day
Face down, ass up, roll play, anime

And that pussy so swole
Shake that ass to the floor
Baby, I'm a little hit
'Cause I love a nigga that's rich (baby, you can be my rider bitch) 
Pop it like this, if you a bad ass bitch
I be the best you ever had
Make a nigga want it bad (baby, you can be my rider bitch) 

I'm a boss ass bitch, might walk ya bitch
I ain't droppin' off shit, Icebox my wrist
I'ma put it on his face, make him talk to it
I'ma spray him like some mace, nigga, better not squint
Raw bitch, but, nah, I can't be your baby momma
I'ma ride it like a llama if your dick anaconda
Told him, "Play with the P like you play with the numbers"
Submarine in my stream, ooh, the way he go under
Girl, don't be scared, gon' pop yo' cat
Fuck all that, gon' pop yo' cat
If he got them ends, girls, bend yo' back
Gotta babysit his kids if he on a private jet
Too good, I'm no good, toxic
For the streets, I'm in yo' hood, drop it
I cream, he got cheese, cottage
And when I leave, won't hear from me, he on the blocklist

Bend yo' back
Bend yo' back
