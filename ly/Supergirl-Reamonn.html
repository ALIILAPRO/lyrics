		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can tell by the way 
She walks that she's my girl 
You can tell by the way 
She talks she woos the world 
You can see in her eyes 
That no one is her change 
She's my girl
My supergirl 

And then she'd say it's OK
I got lost on the way 
But I'm a super girl 
And super girls don't cry
And then she'd say it's alright
I got home late last night 
But I'm a super girl 
And super girls just fly
 
And then she'd say 
That nothing can go wrong 
When you're in love 
What can be wrong? 
And then she'd laugh 
The night time into day 
Pushing her fear 
Further alone 

And then she'd say it's OK
I got lost on the way 
But I'm a super girl 
And super girls don't cry
And then she'd say it's alright
I got home late last night 
But I'm a super girl 
And super girls just fly

And then she'd shout 
Down the line 
Tell me she's got no more time 
'Cause she's a supergirl 
And supergirl's don't cry 

And then she'd scream in my face 
Tell me to leave
Leave this place 
'Cause she's a supergirl 
And supergirl's just fly 

Yeah she's a supergirl
A supergirl 
She's so in seeds, she's burning trees
She's so in seeds, she's burning streams
Yeah she's a supergirl 
A supergirl 
A supergirl 
My supergirl
