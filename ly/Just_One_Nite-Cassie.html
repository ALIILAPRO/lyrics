		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just one night to be with you again, 
'Cause I miss the way 
That it felt when we made love oh
Just one night to be with you again,
'Cause I miss the way 
Miss the way we made love. 

I ran across a picture, a picture of us, I admit I almost cried oh
It made me realize how much I miss ya 
How my life ain't been the same since you're gone, 
Left on my own--left with an empty space 
Can't hide everything reminds me of you, 
Next thing I know that's when I see your face. 

And I know all I need, 

Just one night to be with you again, 
'Cause I miss the way 
That it felt when we made love, 
Just one night to be with you again, 
'Cause I miss the way miss the way we made love. 

Uh I hope that you've been,
That you've been missing, missing me the way I miss you, 
Its so confusing my mind I'm losing, and I hide it everyday, 
Left on my own--left with an empty space 
Can't hide everything reminds me of you, 
Next thing know that's when I see your face. 

And I
And I know all I need is, 

Just one night to be with you again, 
'Cause I miss the way 
That it felt when we made love love love love
Just one night to be with you again, 
'Cause I miss the way miss the way we made love 

Listen I miss you I'm scared I'll be real with it
Nights get cold but I deal wit it
Me in the club with an ill fitted 
I know you feel me though uh
Can't sleep at all in my bed right 
You can try today get my head right, 
It's like I'm trapped in some head lights I can't make moves, 
I'm thinking back to the days we were so tight 
No lights make love right all night 
I'm having ill flashbacks like a strobe light
I know ya feel me girl. Huh
See I understand what you run for
So your eyes don't cry but you're unsure
All you really need is one more just one more
I'll give it to ya!! 

Just one night to be with you (One night to be with you) again, 
'Cause I miss the way 
I miss the way we made love love love 
Just one night to be with you again, 
'Cause I miss the way miss 
The way we made love 
Yeah uh haahhhhhhhhh whoooo ahhhhh
