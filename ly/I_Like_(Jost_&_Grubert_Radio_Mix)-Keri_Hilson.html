		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun down, Friday night
Uptown city lights
Here I go start it out
I like
Dressed up out the door
So damn ready for one night maybe more
I like, I like
With strobe light hot coarse dirty minds
When you cross my way
I like, I like
Just you and I touch at first sight
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like
We're caught in this moment I won't let you go
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like, I like, I like
Hey there pure star let's go way too far come a little closer
I like
Heart flips up and down
Dancing on sleazy ground
Betcha' want to get it on
I like, I like

You've got me downright electrified
Don't stop the rides
I like I like
Just you and I
Here and now what a night
I, I, I, and the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like
We're caught in this moment I won't let you go
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like, I like, I like
Dance all night don't stop the music
I like I can't refuse it
Dance all night don't stop the music
I like I can't refuse it
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like
We're caught in this moment
I won't let you go
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like, I like, I like, I like
