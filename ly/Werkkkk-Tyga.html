		  Mustard on the beat, ho

I been up 'til morning through the late night
I can't get no sleep, the money all mine
I like that dress on you when it's skintight
I'ma work your body into overtime
I'ma work your body (body)
I'ma work your body (body)
Baby, I won't tell, no, I won't tell
Baby, I won't tell nobody

It's the freak in you, so thotty
With that tongue you get so naughty
How you ride it like Ducatti
Don't give that to anybody
Baby, I kiss it gentle, get in your mental (yeah)
Stretch your body out like a limo (yeah)
One on one, teach you fundamentals
I like that thong but I'm not like SisQÃ³
And you got my rocket hard like a missile (bah)
I load my clip, shoot it like a pistol (bah)
I can get that pussy, I'm optimistic (yeah)
Rush that foreplay, right to lickin'
Yeah, I'm creepin' (creepin'), and I'm deep in (deep in)
Yeah, it's slippery (slippery), and it's leakin' (leakin')
You're my freak (freak, freak), for the weekend (for the weekend)
Don't tell nobody, it's a secret

I been up 'til morning through the late night
I can't get no sleep, the money all mine
I like that dress on you when it's skintight
I'ma work your body into overtime
I'ma work your body (body)
I'ma work your body (body)
Baby, I won't tell, no, I won't tell
Baby, I won't tell nobody (it's a secret)

Go missy (go), go easy (go)
Bounce that ass like you doin' it for TV
We made a sextape, got it on repeat
And it's our little personal thing, thing
Bet I make the shit hot, got it on spring bling
He can get you promise ring, I can get you everything
You know I'm a big dawg, niggas know my pedigree
I'ma stunt hard 'til I'm old in my seventies
And the watch so bright, niggas say it's heavenly
And you know the way I make her cum, she won't ever leave
Fuck her like it's two of me, I don't need a tag team
Know your friend is a groupie, we can make this shit a group thing
I don't need nobody else
Way you ride that dick, you gon' need a seatbelt, woah, woah

I been up 'til morning through the late night
I can't get no sleep, the money all mine
I like that dress on you when it's skintight
I'ma work your body into overtime
I'ma work your body (body)
I'ma work your body (body)
Baby, I won't tell, no, I won't tell
Baby, I won't tell nobody (it's a secret)
I'ma work your body (body)
I'ma work your body (body)
Baby, I won't tell, no, I won't tell
Baby, I won't tell nobody (it's a secret)

I been up 'til morning through the late night
I can't get no sleep, the money all mine
I like that dress on you when it's skintight
I'ma work your body into overtime
I'ma work your body
I'ma work your body
Baby, I won't tell, no, I won't tell
Baby, I won't tell nobody

I'ma work your body into overtime
(I'ma work your body)
I'ma work your body into overtime
