		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's got to be automatic
In your electrico romantico
Try to find head way through the static
Got to get myself some peace
Nobody wants that grief, come on

You and me, yeah
We gonna find a way, yeah
And you need me, so
Unplug yourself, let go of the electrico romantico

I don't wanna leave without you anyway
Nobody does it better
I don't wanna leave without you anyway
Nobody does it better than me

You only live online
Unplug yourself, let go, come be a friend of mine
I'll keep your tan alive
The water's warm and beautiful, just come outside

Ah, you and me, yeah
We gonna find a way, yeah
And you need me, so
Unplug yourself, let go of the electrico romantico

I don't wanna leave without you anyway
Nobody does it better
I don't wanna leave without you anyway
Nobody does it better than me

Nobody does it better than me (nobody)
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better
Nobody does it better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better

Come on
I don't wanna leave without you anyway
Nobody does it better
I don't wanna leave without you anyway
Nobody does it better than me
