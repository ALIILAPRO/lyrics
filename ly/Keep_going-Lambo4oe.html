		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said baby keep going
She don't wanna stop keep going
She like baby do it right there
Took her to the top keep going
She know I'm uh ride yea I'm Rolling
Took her to the top got her going
She dont wanna stop keep going
she dont wanna stop keep Going
She said baby keep going
She dont wanna stop keep going
She said baby keep going
She dont wanna stop keep going
She like baby do it right there
Took it to the top got it going
She know I'm uh ride yea I'm Rolling
Took it to the top got it going
She know I'm uh ride yea I'm Rolling
Caught her on a late night
Trynna get the cake right
She ain't never ever seen a nigga Like me
Told me how she feel she like baby What's the deal
And everytime we touch yea my Body get the chills
Feeling yo vibe trynna see how u Live we can get away maybe
Get up out of here
Told her I'm with it
The way you move yo body made
A young nigga feel it
She ain't really made no love in
In a minute
Swoop in the coupe on you late Night
She started from the bottom
Now she way up over there she go talk to me while she dance in the
Air drop it to the flow run
Down on it
Cause she know I keep it g an
She ain't for the fame she go
Ride lowkey said something Bought my eyes yea they talk to Her
Baby buss it open told me walk to
It I'm like talk to me
I won't sit and wait he go stock to
It talking in my ear like
She said baby keep going
She don't wanna stop keep going
She like baby do it right there
Took her to the top keep going
She know I'm uh ride yea I'm Rolling
Took her to the top got her going
She dont wanna stop keep going
she dont wanna stop keep Going
She said baby keep going
She dont wanna stop keep going
She said baby keep going
She dont wanna stop keep going
She like baby do it right there
Took it to the top got it going
She know I'm uh ride yea I'm Rolling
Took it to the top got it going
She know I'm uh ride yea I'm Rolling
