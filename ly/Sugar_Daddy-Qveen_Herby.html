		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it's my right to taste the riches of the Earth
(These bitches better let me work)
A private host, a private toast to new horizons
Nevermind what I had to do to get these diamonds

He love me
He give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy

He love me
He give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy (hahaha, haha)

He love me
He put no one above me
These bitches wanna judge me
But I don't care (hahaha, haha)

Looking back on the boys that I dated
All the popular boys overrated
Gimme brains, money bags if he's ancient
I'm a young lady takin' donations (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
CEO might take me on trips (on trips)
Pack a suit, might have a few ships (few ships)
Love a waitress chasing them tips (them tips)
But I'ma escort counting his chips

Got a lot, bitch
On a yacht, bitch
In the tropics (ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

He love me
He give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy (hahaha, haha)

He love me
He put no one above me
These bitches wanna judge me
But I don't care (hahaha, haha)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Other girls hang around for some cheap wine
Used to think I was down but I do mind
It's really kind but for me love is really blind
Only wanna love where the card never decline
Never had no complication (complication)
And the terms stay clear as my skin (my skin)
Caviar in the yard for the win (for the win)
Which car do I take for a spin?

Got my new hips
And my new tits
New life, who dis? (ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If he's paying (if he's paying), I'll take the oysters
I'm saying (I can say), I got some pointers
My baby (my baby, uh, uh) is my employer
My baby (my baby, uh, uh, uh) knows how to spoil her

My bae, my bae, my baby love me
My bae, my bae, my baby love me

He love me
He give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy (my sugar daddy, hahaha, haha)

He love me (oh yeah)
He put no one above me
These bitches wanna judge me
But I don't care (hahaha, haha)

He love me
He give me all his money
That Gucci, Prada comfy
My sugar daddy (hahaha, haha)

He love me
He put no one above me
These bitches wanna judge me
But I don't care (hahaha, haha)

If he's paying (if he's paying), I'll take the oysters
I'm saying (I can say), I got some pointers
My baby (my baby) is my employer
My baby (my baby) knows how to spoil her
