		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lemme provide you a life raft
I know you're alive, but you could be livin'
If they try to bite, then I bite back
I got everything that your life be missin'

Come and share with mama bear, I got you, boy
Ain't nobody ever gonna touch my baby
If I have to mess somebody up, I don't play

When you got one life left inside of you
And you got too much on your plate
What you need is someone to carry you
I'ma hold it down for you

Jump into me, jump, jump into me
Already know what you need
Already know I could be

I could be your shelter
I, I could be your shelter

I'll be your blanket when it's cold
And I'll be your coffee when it snows
And if you get offbeat, I got flows (flows)
I'll be on it, keep it honest, ooh, I promise

When you got one life left inside of you
And you got too much on your plate
What you need is someone to carry you
I'ma hold it down for you

Jump into me, jump, jump into me
Already know what you need
Already know I could be

I could be your shelter
I, I could be your shelter
I, I, I could be your shelter
I could be your shelter

Jump into me, jump, jump into me
Already know what you need
Already know I could be

When you got one life left inside of you (inside of you)
And you got too much on your plate
What you need is someone to carry you
I'ma hold it down for you

Jump into me, jump, jump into me
Already know what you need
Already know I could be

I could be your
