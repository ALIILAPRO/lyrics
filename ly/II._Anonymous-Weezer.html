		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even know your name
No, I don't know the words to say
So I call you Anonymous
I don't even know your name
No, I don't know the words to say
So I call you Anonymous

Anonymous

So I look at my love, look at my friends
Look in the eyes of my enemy
It's all just a gift that I'm
Going to give to you

I don't even know your name
No, I don't know the words to say
So I call you Anonymous
I don't even know your name
No, I don't know the words to say
So I call you Anonymous

My anonymous, my anonymous
My anonymous, my anonymous

Now I know, know what to call you
Now I know, know what to call you
Now I know, know what to call you
Now I know, know what to call you

What to call you! What to call you!
What to call you!
