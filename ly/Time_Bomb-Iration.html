		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've seen her at a party, yeah, she's doing her rounds
She likes to get it started, she likes to get loud
She's poppin that champagne, she's taking shots down
She's living for the moment
She's a time bomb trying to take you out
The ticking of her heart is the only sound
She's a time bomb 'bout to detonate
Try to cut her wires but you're too late
Whisky stain on her dress now, she's wearing it proud
And there's nothing you can tell her 'cause she's starting to shout
Now she's spraying that champagne all over the crowd
She's living for the moment
She's a time bomb trying to take you out
The ticking of her heart is the only sound
She's a time bomb 'bout to detonate
You try to cut her wires but you're way too late
She's a time bomb trying to take you out
The ticking of her heart is the only sound
She's a time bomb 'bout to detonate
You try to cut her wires but you're too late
She's a time bomb trying to take you out
The ticking of her heart is the only sound
She's a time bomb 'bout to detonate
You try to cut her wires but you're way too late
She's a time bomb trying to take you out (take you out)
The ticking of her heart is the only sound
She's a time bomb 'bout to detonate ('bout to detonate)
You try to cut her wires but you're way too late (way too late)
She's a time bomb trying to take you out (take you out)
The ticking of her heart is the only sound
She's a time bomb 'bout to detonate ('bout to detonate)
You try to cut her wires but you're way too late
