		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-christ or the iron man
I have a vision that I just can't control
I feel I've lost my spirit and sold my soul

Got no control

I try to entertain you the best I can
I wish I'd started walking before I ran
But I still love the feeling I get from you,
I hope you'll never stop 'cause' it gets me through yeah
It gets me through yeah

The feelings that I hide behind
Sometimes reality's unkind
The nightmares stalk for me at night
I dread the long and lonely nights

I'm not the kind of person you think I am
I'm not the anti-christ or the iron man
But I still love the feeling I get from you
I hope you'll never stop 'cause' it gets me through yeah

I'm just trying to live yeah
I'm just trying to live yeah
I'm just trying to live yeah
I'm just trying to live yeah
