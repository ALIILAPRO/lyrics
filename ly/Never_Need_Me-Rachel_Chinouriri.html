		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A call in the dead of the night
It's strange, but it's such a delight
To hear your voice again
It's been a long time since I last saw you
You never swim, you drown in your drink
Revealing the secrets you think
You need me 'cause you're scared
What the hell am I supposed to do?

If you can't change, I doubt that I can help you
I've made plans and sorry they're without you

In my head, you can do what you like
Oh, no, I couldn't care what you do with your life
I hope you just take it easy
I hope that you never need me
And maybe I'll regret not sticking around
But how can I swim if you're pullin' me down?
Just promise you'll take it easy
I hope that you never need me

You say I'm the love of your life
But now just isn't the time
You're doing it again
This is why your cycle never ends
You're addicted to trouble you choose
I'm surprised you're even confused
I know you'll never learn
What the hell am I supposed to do?

If you can't change, I doubt that I can help you
I've made plans and sorry they're without you

In my head you can do what you like
Oh, no, I couldn't care what you do with your life
I hope you just take it easy
I hope that you never need me
And maybe I'll regret not sticking around
But how can I swim if you're pullin' me down?
Just promise you'll take it easy
I hope that you never need me

I'll love you if you let me
I'll love you if you let me, come on (ah)

Without you in my head you can do what you like
Oh, no, I couldn't care what you do with your life
I hope you just take it easy
I hope that you never need me
And maybe I'll regret not sticking around
But how can I swim if you're pullin' me down?
Just promise you'll take it easy
I hope that you never need me

Just promise you'll take it easy
I hope that you never need me
Just promise you'll take it easy
I hope that you never need me
