		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm really close tonight 
And I feel like I'm moving inside her 
Laying in the dark 
And I think that I'm beginning to know her 
Let it go 
I'll be there when you call 

And whenever I fall at your feet 
You let your tears rain down on me 
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain 

You're hiding from me now 
There's something in the way that you're talking 
The words don't sound right 
But I hear them all moving inside you, go 
I'll be waiting when you call 

Hey and whenever I fall at your feet 
You let your tears rain down on me 
Whenever I touch your slow turning pain 

The finger of blame has turned upon itself 
And I'm more than willing to offer myself 
Do you want my presence or need my help 
Who knows where that might lead 
I fall 

Whenever I fall at your feet 
You let your tears rain down on me 
Whenever I fall, whenever I fall
