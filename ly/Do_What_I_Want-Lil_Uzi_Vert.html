		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uhm, I'm on some shit like
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want

Everybody know I'm better, yeah
Yeah, I'm better, yeah
It don't matter, ay, pocket fatter, aye
Nowadays I'm on my haters, they got sadder, aye
That's money longer
Different song but
Different producer
I can do anything and I won't lose her
She got right with a winner, left that loser, aye
Talking shit, boy make me get my Ruger, yeah, I said my Ruger
All my niggas, they shooters
Rocking them grills all the way 'til my tooth hurt, yeah
Oh, he cold? Well, I swear that I'm cooler
That ain't no Rollie, bitch, this is a Franck Muller
Yeah, a Franck Muller

Boy, I started on the bottom, made my way to the top
Boy, I'm gon' keep winning, no I cannot stop
'Member I had a little (I did) turned that shit to a lot
Always been one hundred, put that on my block
Used to want a 4-door, now I want that drop, yeah
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want

Girl, you see me getting this money, whoa, please don't front
Hunnid Fish Club where I'm eating, whoa, what's for lunch?
And them boys back home be talking but I won't get touched
Stay to myself how I survive knowing who I trust
Knowing who I trust
Who them niggas? No, they not with us
All these girls, yeah they ride with us
I don't pay em' no mind, because I just want the bucks

Boy, I started on the bottom, made my way to the top
Boy, I'm gon' keep winning, no I cannot stop
'Member I had a little, turnt that shit to a lot
Always been one hundred, put that on my block
Used to want a 4-door, now I want that drop
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
Now I do what I want, now I do what I want
