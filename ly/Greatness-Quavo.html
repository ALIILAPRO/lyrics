		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Al Geno on the track)
Yeah, yeah
Huncho, yeah

My chain, my watch, my wrist
My motherfuckin' house, my rise and grind (grind)
I'd give away all this shit just to see my dawg just one more time
Look up at the lights one time (one time)
Hit the stage, rock the mic one time (one time)
Roll one, get right one time (hey)
Two cups, two cups, two cups (ooh)
You remember them MCM backpacks? 
We was runnin' around with them racks (racks)
No Wock', no Wock', I ain't never took Wock' to Poland 
I was drinking that Act' (on God)
Came in, swept the game like a storm with the motherfuckin' flow 
Nigga, Take' did that (on God)
So don't ask about the group, he gone, we gone 
Young nigga, it can't come back (damn)
I'ma make sure mama straight (mama)
Especially Mama Take' (sheesh)
I can't kick it with a fake (nah)
And I won't sleep with the snakes (snakes)
I'd rather eat with the greats (greats)
I wanted peace but I can't (peace)
I gotta get somethin' straight
Hold on, wait, huh (pew, pew, pew)
Tryna move forward but I don't got all the answers (I don't got the answers)
But I know I can't look backwards, that's dangerous (that's dangerous)
Uh, I had to go read the bible and take a few pages (take a few pages)
Huncho on floors, lil' nigga, now I turn the pages, I turn the pages (uh)
Never forget that the Migos amazin' (Migos)
Look at the ice and the knot in my pants, you know that them young niggas made it (ice)
Get your mind right, lil' nigga, you never know, you could be famous (you)
I got this shit out the mud and caught a lil' buzz, then QC changed it (QC)
Faces, faces (faces), all kinda faces (for real)
All kinda faces (on God), we all God's babies (on God)
We all built with greatness (built), we all came in dangerous (dangerous)
We bound to fall, against the odds, we get up and go crazy
And we face it (face it), we face it (c'mon)
Whatever time, we face it (whatever)
The time it takes to get it (time), the time it take to make it (to make it)
The time to take to lose it (time), the time it take to take it (take it)
The time to take to win (time), the time you made the greatest (greatest, yeah)

Yeah, you made the greatest time with your life
Right now it's greatness
You pick the perfect time in the world, it's right now
That time is greatness
I don't care how long it take, I don't care what storm you been through
It's greatness
This how legends was born, greatness
I couldn't do it without the greatest group in the world
Hmm, greatness
I couldn't do it without the greatest nephew in the world
Greatness
I love my mama, I love my sister (greatness)
My niece (greatness)
Lingo (huh, greatness)
To infinity, the strongest link in the world (greatness)
