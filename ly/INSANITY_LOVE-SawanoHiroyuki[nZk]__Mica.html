		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Load have a mercy
I feel this words of meaning
There're something to say
It's brings me down
into my fate
How many times you made me
lonesome
How could I reach
over the mountain of snow
You and I to think
that for unfeeling
To look into your secret
in your heart
For this strange
complex thing of my love
Made me laugh,
Ice cubes in the desert
Don't hurt yourself
with scissors
Like a different moon
I've seen before in my life
Insanity love

The Load have a mercy
I feel this words of meaning
There're something to say
It's brings me down
into my fate
How many times you made me
lonesome
How could I reach
over the mountain of snow
You and I to think
that for unfeeling
To look into your secret
in your heart
For this strange
complex thing of my love
Made me laugh,
Ice cubes in the desert
Don't hurt yourself
with scissors
Like a different moon
I've seen before in my life
Insanity love
You and I to think
that for unfeeling
To look into your secret
in your heart
For this strange
complex thing of my love
Made me laugh,
Ice cubes in the desert
Don't hurt yourself
with scissors
Like a different moon
I've seen before in my life
Insanity love
