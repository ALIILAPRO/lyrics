		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They can't be too upset (hey)
I could've kept it to myself, they can't be too upset (myself)
I done broke bread, cut checks, they can't be too upset (hey)
I took that rope off my neck, they couldn't be too upset (let's go, woo)
Niggas still bite my style, they can't be too upset (uh-huh)
I done laid low for a while, they can't be that upset (hey)
Niggas lost all my respect, they can't be that upset (uh-uh)
Niggas point fingers at Set, and I ain't even done none' yet

Fuck it, fuck it (hey), fuck it (hey), fuck it up (hey)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up)

I been a menace, in the lab, I'm a cook like a chemist (chemist)
Tryna fuck 'fore I end the first sentence (hey)
By myself, I done strained my business (strain)
If I fuck her, I got on a Jimmy (Jimmy) 
I'ma sniper, my target, I hit him (snipe)
They got mad 'cause I didn't want the minimum (uh-uh)
No, "I love 'em," I had to get rid of 'em (bye-bye)
Man, your house is the size of my livin' room
Kill a opp and I pay for his funeral (hey)
Takin' notes, they was watchin' my visuals (notes)
Niggas hate when they can't get rid of you (can't)
Tryna get me a bank and middle school (bank)
Tryna get me some rank, I had shot at dude (bow)
Every time that I move, the game follow suit (move)
Niggas know that I'm comin', I never lose (let's go)

They can't be too upset (hey)
I could've kept it to myself, they can't be too upset (myself)
I done broke bread, cut checks, they can't be too upset (hey)
I took that rope off my neck, they couldn't be too upset (let's go, woo)
Niggas still bite my style, they can't be too upset (uh-huh)
I done laid low for a while, they can't be that upset (hey)
Niggas lost all my respect, they can't be that upset (uh-uh)
Niggas point fingers at Set, and I ain't even done none' yet

Fuck it, fuck it (hey), fuck it (hey), fuck it up (hey)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up)

I ain't goin', no denial, they know I'm the one (I'm the one)
Walked away, you can't go where I'm goin' (walked away)
What he say? Yeah, the show must go on (what he say?)
Tryna play like you right but you wrong (you wrong)
Save my money, I bought it to own (let's go)
Why the fuck they be hatin' on holmes?
Only one brought a number one song (only one brought a number one)
Better than who? They ain't better than me
I'ma keep that shit humble, I keep that shit P
They fucked up, they fumbled, the dog off the leash (grr)
Count up my commas, I'm worried 'bout me (me)
Ronald McDonald, got M's, Mickey D's (M's)
Thank you, your honor, I'm free and released (free)
Fuck this shit up, I'ma fuck this shit up
My foot on they necks, I ain't lettin' 'em breathe (let's go)
I ain't even do shit yet (nah)
But when I get started I'm goin' the farthest
Don't try to come back, fuck with me? (Uh-uh)
They thought it was over but I'm playin' poker
These niggas ain't smarter than me (ain't smarter)
I lost all my heart in the streets (hey)
I'm grown, I know how it be (let's go)
I'm gone, it's best that I leave (I'm gone, hey)

They can't be too upset (hey)
I could've kept it to myself, they can't be too upset (myself)
I done broke bread, cut checks, they can't be too upset (hey)
I took that rope off my neck, they couldn't be too upset (let's go, woo)
Niggas still bite my style, they can't be too upset (uh-huh)
I done laid low for a while, they can't be that upset (hey)
Niggas lost all my respect, they can't be that upset (uh-uh)
Niggas point fingers at Set, and I ain't even done none' yet

Fuck it, fuck it (hey), fuck it (hey), fuck it up (hey)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up), fuck it up (fuck it up)
Fuck it up (fuck it up)
