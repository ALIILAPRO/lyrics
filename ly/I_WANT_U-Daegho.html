		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye you know, what the fuck going on
(Aye) Yeah
Oh she a ground shaker, bone breaker
Leave you off the radar
Crazy mamacita, you know she a trouble maker
For the thrill of it
She loves to live up in the danger
Living life on the edge
Ain't a thing that can tame her
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (I love the way)
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (You move that thang)
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (So throw it back)
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (Ooh)
I want you, like
I want you, like
Only you and
Only you, like
I want you, like
I want you, like
Only you and
Only you, oh
So turn the lights down low (turn em low baby)
And bring your body close (bring it close, aye)
So turn the lights down low (turn em low baby)
Can never get enough of your love
Oh na-na
She got an attitude
The way her body move
Like she got something to prove (ooh)
Oh na-na
Ain't got nothing to lose
So while the night's still young
Let's go and break some rules (so)
Take a sip of that potion
Watch your body move in slow motion
Steady smoking up on that potent
Feeding off of these raw emotions
But I know who you are
Got a vendetta
Against complacency
I see you stand out from the crowd
You wild
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (I love the way)
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (You move that thang)
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na,oh-na (So throw it back)
Oh-na-na, oh-na
Na-na-na, oh-na (Ooh)
I want you, like
I want you, like
Only you and
Only you, like
I want you, like
I want you, like
Only you and
Only you, oh
So turn the lights down low (turn em low baby)
And bring your body close (bring it close)
So turn the lights down low (turn em low baby)
Can never get enough of your love (Yeah, yeah)
