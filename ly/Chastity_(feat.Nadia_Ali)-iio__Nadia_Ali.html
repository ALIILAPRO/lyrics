		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet little chaste woman
Why are you holding your breath in an ocean
Where the abyss is infinitely deep
Skiing mountains dangerously steep

Collecting all the dainty roses
Envisioning the one who proposes
I pray your garden's always filled with seeds
That it's not bothered by the stem of the weed

You keep your jewels in a safe
And only one set of keys
Careful to only bestow
The one who gets on his knees

Don't believe in what is wrong, keep your night light on
You're confusing lust for love
Learn it will be gone
Don't believe in what is wrong

Keep your eyes open
You thought love and lust were one...
No! They're so different
Only love remains

Lust is all a game
Once you learn the truth
All will come to you
Chastity, I hope you're listening

The point I'm making is the one you're missing
I'm only telling you so that you don't have to
Make the decisions that I once had to
I'm not a preacher who has practiced

I'm not a teacher but you are still an apprentice
My only fault is that I see this view
You're not guilty, you're beyond your youth
If you're not prepared for this ride

I say you should close your eyes
These fields of no innocence
You couldn't bare this blackened side
I only mean well, I only mean well, I promise

I won't steer you wrong
It's only a simple request
