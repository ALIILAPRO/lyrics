		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (We're just strangers)
(We're just strangers)

Lookin' at you, I can't believe
You are those things I wanted you to be
Out of my chest, out of my sleeve
Why is it getting so hard to breathe?
I was not the girl you wanted
I was not the girl you see
Out of my chest, out of my sleeve
Why is it getting so hard to breathe?

Can't you hear me calling?
(Yeah, I'm found, tied to the ground)
Can't you hear me calling?
(And the wind is picking up)

You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, you're cascading down my veins
You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, my breath is a hurricane
Feels like heaven, now that we're severed
And I'm spinning down (spinning down)
You breathe me in, I breathe you out

We're just strangers
We're just strangers

Try to forget, no way to unsee
That I was different, drunk isn't me
Say no regrets, no guarantees
But how could you do that when you were with me
I am not the girl you want now
I am not the girl you see
Say no regrets, no guarantees
But how could you do that when you were with me

Can't you hear me calling?
(Yeah, I'm found, tied to the ground)
Can't you hear me calling?
(And the wind is picking up)

You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, you're cascading down my veins
You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, my breath is a hurricane
Feels like heaven, now that we're severed
And I'm spinning down (spinning down)
You breathe me in, I breathe you out

We're just strangers
We're just strangers

So this is heaven
Now that we're severed
(We're just strangers)
So this is heaven
Now that we're severed
(Yeah, my breath is a hurricane)

You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, you're cascading through my veins

You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, you're cascading down my veins
You breathe me in, I breathe you out
Yeah, my breath is a hurricane
You breathe me in, I breathe you out
You breathe me in, I breathe you out
(We're just strangers)
