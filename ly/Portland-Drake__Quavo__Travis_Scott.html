		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Murda on the beat, so it's not nice

It's a Habibi's ting, ya?

Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days, got a torch tryna light the way
Biting everybody which is ironic 'cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Half assed but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you nigga's gettin' down
I'm so high up I'm like, how is nigga's really gettin' down?
I could never have a kid then be out here still kiddin' around
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a hundred fifty thousand dollars for an after party and I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up then they might take you down
Fake fuck with me back then but it's gettin hard for you to fake it now
Fuck being rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now

Hell nah
Never let these nigga's ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these nigga's ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe (Skrrt, skrrt, oh)
Michael Phelps with the swim moves (Skrrt, skrrt, oh)
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes (Skrrt, Skrrt)

(Quavo)
Young nigga, I invented you
Ike Turner with the left hand
Griselda Blanco with the trap moves
Gangland with the right hand
Undertaker with the tattoos
Never listen to the class rules
Switch it up would be the last move (Let's go)
I'm a magnet for bad bitches (Magnet)
You got the going out sad bitches
I spent a fifty on the chain (Racks)
You spent your last fifty (Ugh, cash)
I got the keys to the streets (Keys)
You got the key to defeat (Defeated)
I got the keys to the warzone (Brrrapt)
You got the key to the bees (Ugh)

Hell nah
Never let these nigga's ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these nigga's ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just the ride the Wraith (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe

We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
We gon' go live, we gon' go live, yep
Gettin' loose, off Henny rock and Henny Goose
Ocean deep in my swimming pool
Throwin' dead pres in my living room
Takin' shots, feelin' bulletproof
Flood my Rollie, told my bitch, "let's go snorkelin'"
Out in Portland tryna get in her organs
No I did not sign with Jay, but I still send a Tidal wave
Yep, I might just go get the fade buy the du-rag and just tie the waves
It's lit at the crib, you could stay, me and Drake kick like Kid N' Play
The way that she servin' that cake, I gotta sit back and digest
I guess, fuck the fuck shit, I'm biased
I mix, double the cup with Nitrous
Got my momma out the basement
That's a different type of face lift
Free Mase' me about the bracelets
Don't hit us askin' what the wave is

Hell nah
Never let these nigga's ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Never let these nigga's ride your wave
Nope, no way, nah
Park the Benz just to the ride the Wraith (Skrrt, skrrt)
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe (Skrrt, skrrt, oh)
Michael Phelps with the swim moves (Skrrt, skrrt, oh)
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes (Skrrt, Skrrt, oh)

Michael Phelps with the swim moves (Skrrt, skrrt, oh)
Michael Jordan with the tennis shoes
