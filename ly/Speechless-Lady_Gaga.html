		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How, how, how, how, how

I can't believe what you said to me
Last night when we were alone
You threw your arms up
Baby you gave up, you gave up

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your James Dean glossy eyes
In your tight jeans with your long hair
And your cigarette stained lies

Could we fix you if you broke?
And is your punch line just a joke?

I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless
And I'll never love again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I can't believe how you slurred at me
With your half wired broken jaw
You popped my heart seams
All my bubble dreams, bubble dreams

I can't believe how you looked at me
With your Johnnie Walker eyes
He's gonna get you and after he's through
There's gonna be no love left to rye

And I know that it's complicated
But I'm a loser in love
So baby raise a glass to mend
All the broken hearts
Of all my wrecked up friends

I'll never talk again
Oh boy you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

I'll never love again
Oh friend you've left me speechless
You've left me speechless, so speechless

How? Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow
Ha-ooh-wow? H-ow? Wow

And after all the drinks and bars that we've been to
Would you give it all up?
Could I give it all up for you?

And after all the boys and the girls that we've been through
Would you give it all up?
Could you give it all up?

If I promised boy to you
That I'll never talk again
And I'll never love again
I'll never write a song
Won't even sing along
I'll never love again

How, how, how so speechless
You left me speechless, so speechless baby

Will you ever talk again?
Oh boy, why you so speechless?
You've left me speechless, so speechless

Some men may follow me
But you choose "death and company"
Why you so speechless? Oh oh oh
