		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back then, I didn't know enough
I had many scars, truly a work of art
I've been scared to open up
Be gentle with my heart, sensitive and start to turn me on

Baby don't ask me, how do I want it
Don't leave marks but make me a target
Like what you see? Then yeah you can part this
I'll be the canvas, you be the artist
Trace my skin with your touch, I want it all
Baby hold me close, 'cause I've been so lonely
Didn't know where I belonged but I feel at home here

I just feel safe in your touch
I just feel safe in your touch
I need somewhere for my love
Tell me that you'll stay
Tell me that me you'll stay
I just feel safe in your touch

I know my assignment
When we get in private
My cards on the table
Don't get too excited
When I'm caressing every curve and line
I want you to practice staying quiet
Let me tease you 'til you lose your mind
No, I'm not like anybody

Baby don't ask me, how do I want it
Don't leave marks but make me a target
Like what you see? Then yeah you can part this
I'll be the canvas, you be the artist
Trace my skin with your touch, I want it all
Baby hold me close, 'cause I've been so lonely
Didn't know where I belonged but I feel at home here

I just feel safe in your touch
I just feel safe in your touch
I need somewhere for my love
Tell me that you'll stay
Tell me that me you'll stay
I just feel safe in your touch (I just feel safe in your touch)

So when she call back, I hope that I'm ready
I'm ready, yeah
If she come back, I hope that I'm ready
I know I'll be ready
Call back, I hope that I'm ready
I'm ready, yeah
If she come back, I hope that I'm ready
Yeah, I know I'll be ready
