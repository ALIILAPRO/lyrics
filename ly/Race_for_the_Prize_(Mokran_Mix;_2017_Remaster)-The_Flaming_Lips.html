		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, one!

Two scientists are racing
For the good of all mankind
Both of them side-by-side
So determined

Locked in heated battle
For the cure that is their prize
But it's so dangerous
But they're determined

Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just humans
With wives and children

Upwards to the vanguard
Where the pressure is too high
Under the microscope
Hope against hope

Forging for the future
But to sacrifice their lives
Both of them side-by-side
So determined

Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just humans
With wives and children

Theirs is to win
If it kills them
They're just human
With wives and children
