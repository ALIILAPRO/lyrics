		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have to remember 
What it all means 
I need to see 
How it could be 

But baby tomorrow 
I'll be good enough to let you go 

Causing damages or not 
It is only for the night 
It will always be this one time 
Where you could play along with me 
Until I realise 
It is only for this one night 

More I deny 
It's all so real 
I don't want you to know 
What defines my being 

I don't want you to know 
What defines my being 

Causing damages or not 
It is only for the night 
It will always be this one time 
Where you could play along with me 
Until I realise 
It is only for this one night
