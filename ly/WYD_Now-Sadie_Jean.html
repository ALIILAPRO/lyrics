		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you in the back of my show last night
Standin' underneath the exit sign
I know it wasn't really you, though
'Cause you were always in the front row

And I've been lookin' for love online
And maybe some of them are real good guys
They're never gonna be like you though
You set the bar above the moon, so

I don't wanna be twenty-somethin'
And still in my head about
Seventeen in my bedroom talkin'
You said that by now we'd
Paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?

Now that you finally got the job you like
I'm makin' money off the songs I write
I know you said that I could call you
I wonder if you wanna call too

Now that the future doesn't feel so far
It doesn't seem as wrong to want what's ours
And after everything that's happened
I wanna put it in the past tense

'Cause I don't wanna be twenty-somethin'
And still in my head about
Seventeen in my bedroom talkin'
You said that by now we'd
Paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?

Are you with somebody?
Should I even care?
Know you're not as happy
As when I was there
In your faded t-shirt
That I've kept this long
I still hear you laughin'
When I put it on
I know

I don't wanna be twenty-somethin'
And still in my head about
Seventeen in my bedroom talkin'
You said that by now we'd
Paint the walls of our shared apartment
You're still everything I want and
I think we could work it out
So what are you doin' now?
