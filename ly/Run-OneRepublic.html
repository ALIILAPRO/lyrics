		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a young boy living in the city
All I did was run, run, run, run, run
Staring at the lights, they look so pretty
Momma said, "Son, son, son, son, son
You're gonna grow up, you're gonna get old
All that glitter don't turn to gold
But until then, just have your fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run"

Yeah, run, run, run
Run, run, run

When I was a young kid living in the city
All I did was pay, pay, pay, pay, pay
And every single dime that good Lord gave me
I could make it last three, four, five days
Living it up, but living down low
Chasing that luck before I get old
And looking back, oh, we had some fun
Boy, run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

Yeah, one day, well, the sky might fall
Yeah, one day, I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun

And run, run, run
Run, run, run

Didn't get everything that I wanted
But I got what I need, yeah, yeah
I see that light in the morning
Shining down on me
So take me up high, take me down low
Where it all ends, nobody knows
But until then, let's have some fun, yeah
Run, run, run, run, run

They tell you that the sky might fall
They'll say that you might lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

Yeah, one day, well, the sky might fall
Yeah, one day, I could lose it all
So I run until I hit that wall
If I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun and run, run, run

Run, run, run
Yeah, run, run, run

Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun

Yeah, I learned my lesson, count my blessings
Look to the rising sun

Yeah, if I learned one lesson, count your blessings
Look to the rising sun, yeah, run, run, run
