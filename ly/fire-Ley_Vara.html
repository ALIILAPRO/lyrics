		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I trust what you say
Counting words I'm feeling faded off the D'usse
I can't argue when you try to keep your cool babe
Got your back to me and speaking are you too faced

Got the feeling that you're tired of me
Tired of me
Tied to me
Fuck keeping your peace so baby fight for me
Satisfy you cravings now you're high give me

You keep burning me I'm on fire
I sleep on both sides keeping me high
Help me through your desire and I'll
Get along without feeling
l can go so long without feeling

So if I share what feel
Oh what's playing in my head
I can give you everything you crave
Are the lows that I give enough
It's attractive to just give up
And if I'm calling your phone
In the middle of the night
When you know that I've been driving you crazy
And there's the lack to communicate
And it's enticing enough oh enticing enough to

You're tired of me
Tired of me
Tied to me
Fuck keeping your peace so baby fight for me
Satisfy your craving with a high give me
Said you'd like to love me one day
Never know when it's the next one okay
Argue with the hand
Now I'm trusting you to deal with it
Keeping you around 'cause I know you like the thrill of it

You keep burning me I'm on fire
I sleep on both sides keeping me high
Help me through your desire and I'll
Get along without feeling
l can go so long without feeling
