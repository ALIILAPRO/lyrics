		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember?
You and me against the world
Do you remember?
It seems like forever
We held on to each other like
we held on to life
Now why
Would you send me out to sea
On this battered ship alone?
If this is what it seems..

You're burning your bridges down
You're burning them to the ground
You're burning your bridges down
What goes around
Must come around
And you burn your bridges down

Do you enjoy it?
Fighting fire and gravity
It's painful to see
So why would you set to self destruct
Aim to annihilate 
You are burning
You are burning

You're burning your bridges down
You're burning them to the ground
You're burning your bridges down
What goes around
Will come around
And you burn your bridges down

All my bridges are falling apart
I've got a torch
With a thorn that fits
In your heart
Can you hear me?
Can you see me?
Standing on your high ledge
Hear me, See me:
There is a way between jumping and burning
