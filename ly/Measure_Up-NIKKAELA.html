		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still need you here
Imagine a life so dim you ain't around
To escape my fears
You were taken for granted
Cause you deserve the world baby
A world I couldn't give to you
When I thought I couldn't measure up
You never switched up
And I can't thank you enough
Your love was enough
When I felt like I couldn't measure up babe
Your love was enough
Your love was enough
Oooo
Never felt so clear
Had to walk it out and make sure
My heads in check before you come near
Didn't want to cause more damage
Cause you deserve the world baby
A world I couldn't give to you
When I thought I couldn't measure up
You never switched up
And I can't thank you enough
Your love was enough
When I felt like I couldn't measure up babe
Your love was enough
Your love was enough
Tried letting go of how I felt
Heard you were seeing someone else
Thought this can't be real but I can't be mad
The thought of you with her keep rushing back
The temperature's rising
It hits deep inside my chest
The love you provided
Is still the best I must confess
Ooo
Hey
Cause you deserve the world baby
A world I couldn't give to you
When I thought I couldn't measure up
You never switched up
And I can't thank you enough
Your love was enough
When I felt like I couldn't measure up babe
Your love was enough
Your love was enough
Cause you deserve the world baby
A world I couldn't give to you
When I thought I couldn't measure up
You never switched up
And I can't thank you enough
Your love was enough
When I felt like I couldn't measure up babe
Your love was enough
Your love was enough
