		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much nostalgia for someone so small, they say
But I reminisce on the past again anyway
I know I should save it up for when I grow
Returning to the books I never really read
Reliving life I never really led
But I still dance barefoot alone in my room
I still turn on my fairy lights and twirl cross the floor with my broom
I still huddle in bed when the rain starts to fall
I still stand on my toes, I still wish I was tall
Maybe it's called something different now
Maybe I'm careless or wild
But in my mind's eye
I'm still a child
Time to grow up, time to be more realistic, they say
But what's the purpose of vision unmagical
Keeping the fairies at bay
I know it all might seem silly
But I so long for escape to the way it was
Picking buttercups just because
So I still write letters to you in my room
I still spray my wavy hair with lavender perfume
I still hope this isn't over too soon
I still turn my gaze out the window and smile at the moon
Maybe it's called something different now
Maybe I'm careless or wild
But in my mind's eye
I'm still a child
I'm still a child
