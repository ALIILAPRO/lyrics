		  (Your thottie gon' give me the brain)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)

Walked inside this bitch, I'm just two steppin', ball on everyone
Went and got a bag, I ran it up, then flipped off everyone
I just got these racks, I boosted up 'cause I'm not real or some
Shooter ready to go, they ready to blast, they hit up everyone
Every time I didn't give a shit, I still went number one (one)
And my pockets filled with money, bitch, they fuckin' shmunked (yeah)
I just pulled up out to Paris, then hit Saint Laurent (West)
We heard you still live with your parents, you a fuckin' bum (lil' bum)
No, you not been smokin' no gas, you not smokin' no Runtz (huh)
I ain't never gon' tell you twice, only gon' tell you once
Rollin', I'm just rollin', I'm just rollin' off the molly
Rollin', I'm just rollin', I'm just rollin' in the big body
Rollin', I'm just rollin'
Bought a Motorola for my yola I was sellin' (yeah)
I heard you was tellin', we heard you was just snitchin' 
Can't rock with us, we too felonious (yeah)

Everything I do be goin' viral 
My fans just like a cult, they read my Bible
Bitch you think you really rich, you just been lied to (why?)
I'm just swervin' in the coupe, just hit up the block (yeah)
Fuckin' on my thot, made her sip the Wock'
She suckin' on my cock, she do that a lot
Yeah, I can't fuck with you at all
We might test you, I just wanna vibe
Yeah, I just wanna flex, but I'm not gon' crawl
Yeah, a thief in the night, bitch, that pussy gon' call
Yeah, even though you was a hater, you still at my show
Pulled my shit out on her back, then I bust a nut, yeah, then I told her to go
Yeah, I don't be fucking with no nobody, they just be sniffin' that shit like its snow
They snipin' that shit like a globe 
FN my finger, that bih like a pole
Yeah, I'm about to blow
Time for me to go up, I'm about to explode
I'm 'bout to expose 'em
Osama bin-Laden, my bro
No, I can't wife me a ho
Chill with my brother, my twizz, my bro
Big body stizz, or the Benz, or the big body Lamb', boy, that bitch 'bout to (brrt)
Yeah, I just pulled up like a yankee 
In London might shank you, the bitch 'bout to (brrt)
Yeah, I'm 'bout to slice you, I'm 'bout to dice you, it's not nice yeah
Put you inside of a bag, then fill it with rice, set it alight
I just went doubled my money, then I fucked it up again, made it go thrice
Yeah, I ain't even roll with nobody at all, so stop callin' my phone, no advice
All of my diamonds, they smackin' the shit out of you like the motherfuckin' lights
All of y'all really been buggin' me, yeah, like some motherfuckin' lice
Me and my twizzies insane, we are not nice
Your thottie gon' give me the brain, she suck it all night

(Your thottie gon' give me the brain)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)

Walked inside this bitch, I'm just two steppin', ball on everyone
