		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel my soul creeping out my fucking window
Locked inside my room got the stick under my pillow
Staring down the barrel lullaby inside that hollow
Follow, follow me up into my terror
How you thinking you the one when you a fucking clone yeah?
How do I become a better person in my soul yeah?
All my homies in the crib and I be home alone yeah
Put me in the corner let me stare up at my phone yeah
I'm fucking sick
A fucking shamed
You still up in my fucking brain
You're gonna pay
I watch your body fucking shake
I levetate
Over top your fucking grave
As I dig mine
Next to you so we can lay
That reverie
Eternally you fucking waste
Ain't worth the pain
I separate my fucking angst
Coughing in my coffin
Fill my body up with toxins
Send me to rot in the earth
Six feet of dirt I'm finna box it
Another fucking day I lay to waste
I'm here too often
Steadily fiend for the drip
Crushing the script and shoot Suboxone
99 cutting ties so get the fuck out my face
Always be switching and doubling back
Just admit that you a fake
Why is you fidgety had an epiphany
You ain't ever hold the K
How is you claiming you running the block when you ran away from the fade?
I ain't gang bang
I'm ignorant I let my nuts hang
99 flipping the pack and he spending it back on the same thing
I think I'm going insane
Railing a line straight to my brain
Everyday it's the same
Falling in love with the pain
I cross my heart, I hope I die
I stick the needle in my eye
Filling my head with the drugs I look dead
It's the only time I feel alive (Fuck!)
