		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wandering child, so lost, so helpless
Yearning for my guidance 

Angel or father, friend or phantom
Who is it there, staring? (Have you forgotten your angel?)

Angel, oh, speak
What endless longings echo in this whisper?

Too long you've wandered in winter (once again she is his)
Far from my far reaching gaze (once again she returns)
Wildly my mind beats against you (you resist)
Yet your soul obeys (to the arms of her angel)

Angel of Music (angel or demon?)
I denied you (you denied me) (still calls her luring)
Turning from true beauty (her back from the grave)
Angel of Music! (Angel or dark seducer?)
My protector (do not shun me) 
Come to me, strange angel (who are you, strange angel?) (come to your strange angel)

I am your Angel of Music
Come to me, Angel of Music 

Angel of darkness, cease this torment

I am your Angel of Music (Christine, Christine listen to me)
Whatever you may believe, this man, this thing
Come to me, Angel of Music (is not your father)
Let her go, for God's sake, let her go
Christine!

Oh, Raoul!

Bravo, monsieur, such spirited words!

More tricks, monsieur?

Let's see, monsieur, how far you dare go!

More deception, more violence

Raoul, no!

That's right, that's right, monsieur
Keep walking this way!

You can't win her, not by making her your prisoner

Raoul
No, stay back!

I'm here, I'm here, monsieur
The angel of death
Come on, come on, monsieur
Don't stop, don't stop!

Raoul, come back!

Don't go!
So be it
Now let it be war upon you both!

Here the sire may serve the dam
Here the master takes his meat
Here the sacrificial lamb
Utters one despairing bleat

Poor young maiden 
For the thrill on your tongue of stolen sweets
You will have to pay the bill, tangled in the winding sheets

Serve the meal and serve the maid
Serve the master so that when tables, plans and maids are laid
Don Juan triumphs once again!

Passarino, faithful friend
Once again, recite the plan

Your young guest believes I'm you 
I, the master, you, the man

When you met you wore my cloak
With my scarf you hid your face
She believes she dines with me
In her master's borrowed place
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff
Stealing what, in truth, is mine
When it's late and modesty
Starts to mellow, with the wine

You come home! I use your voice
Slam the door like crack of doom!

I shall say
"Come, hide with me!
Where, oh, where? Of course, my room!"

Poor thing hasn't got a chance!

Here's my hat, my cloak and sword
Conquest is assured, if I do not forget myself and laugh
Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha-ha

No thoughts within her head, but thoughts of joy
No dreams within her heart, but dreams of love

Master?

Passarino, go away
For the trap is set and waits for its prey

You have come here in pursuit of your deepest urge
In pursuit of that wish, which 'til now has been silent
Silent

I have brought you, that our passions may fuse and merge
In your mind, you've already succumbed to me
Dropped all defenses, completely succumbed to me 
Now you are here with me
No second thoughts, you've decided
Decided
