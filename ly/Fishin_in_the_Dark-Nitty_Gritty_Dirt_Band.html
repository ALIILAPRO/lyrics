		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs
Are floatin' on a breeze
Baby get ready

Across the field where the crick turns back
By the old stump road
I'm gonna take you to a special place
That nobody knows
Baby get ready, ooh-ooh

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with you

Spring is almost over and the summer's comin'
And the days are gettin' long
I waited all winter for the time to be right
Just to take you along
Baby get ready

And it don't matter if we sit forever
And the fish don't bite
We'll jump in a river and cool ourselves
From the heat of the night
Baby get ready, ooh-ooh

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Stayin' the whole night through
It feels so good to be with 

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow

You and me goin' fishin' in the dark
Lyin' on our backs and countin' the stars
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moon light
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
