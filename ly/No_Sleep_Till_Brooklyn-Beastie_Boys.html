		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No sleep 'til
Brooklyn

Foot on the pedal
Never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job
It's a damn good time
City to city, I've been running my rhymes
On location
Touring 'round the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger
But a stable turntable
I do what I do best
Because I'm willing and able
Ain't no faking
Your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast to watch all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine to five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden
Cold kickin' it live

No sleep 'til

Another plane
Another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl
Another fight
Another drive all night
Our manager's crazy
He always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world
You rock around the clock
Plane to hotel
Girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way
'Cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezin' with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
(White boys got more rhymes)

No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn, no sleep 'til Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
MCA get on the mic, my man
Born and bred Brooklyn
The U.S.A.
They call me Adam Yauch
But I'm MCA
Like a lemon to a lime
A lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Limos, arenas and TV-shows
Autograph pictures and classy hoes
Step off Holmes
Get out of my way
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A.
Waking up
Before I get to sleep
'Cause I'll be rockin' this party eight days a week

No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn (yeah)

No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
