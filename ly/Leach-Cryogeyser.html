		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could be a hero in a different time or place
You could be my savior I cant even see your face
and your other faces showing you always end up growing 
Sucking all the life out will you be my life spout

Different, I wish you told me it would be different 
We were just friends then
I wish that I had never had met you things would be different
Things would be simple

Freedom finally leaving my body
(Free finally from leaving my body)
Freedom finally leaving my body
(Free finally from leaving my body)

Make a silent exit being here causes you pain
Always say I love you I fear I say it in vain
My hearts in other places, going, you always end up showing
up at all the wrong times
Did i say the wrong line?

Different, I wish you told me it would be different 
We were just friends then
I wish that I had never had met you things would be different
things would be simple

Leach leave this hand, sucking blood, leaving my blood
Leach leave this hand, sucking blood, leaving my blood
(Crossing veins like climbing mountains incantation made of doubt)
