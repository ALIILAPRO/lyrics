		  What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Yeah

No, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Gimme a sign

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh

Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say? It's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh

What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

I want no other, no other lover
This is our life, our time
If we are together, I need you forever
Is it love?

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
Yeah, yeah

Whoa, whoa, oh
Whoa, whoa, oh

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more

What is love?
Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more (whoa, whoa)

Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more (whoa, whoa)

Oh baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
