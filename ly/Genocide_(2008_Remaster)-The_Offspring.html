		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our lives run different ways
Through the rain I see you in the sun
Our star shines anyway
If you wish upon it, we are one
(One, two, three, four)

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide

I find it such a shame
Through the pain, I see things as they are
We're served up on a plate
Pedestal is high enough to fall
And if in time we can see the errors of our ways
Would anyone change it anyhow?
Our time is up
(One, two, three, four)

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide

I bet you'd only run
If you saw what goes inside our own
I bet you'd lead the way
If it were up to you to decide
But it's not

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide

Dog eat dog, every day
On our fellow man we prey
Dog eat dog, to get by
Hope you like my genocide

Like a silver flame
Like suicide
Like you're giving more
(One, two, three, four)

Mm, I especially enjoyed that one
Let's see what's next
