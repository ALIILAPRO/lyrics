		  Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't

Tell me why i'm waiting
For some- for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me oh, oh
Tell me why i'm waiting
For some- for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me oh, oh

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
Oh, oh you wouldn't tell me
Tell for
For someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
