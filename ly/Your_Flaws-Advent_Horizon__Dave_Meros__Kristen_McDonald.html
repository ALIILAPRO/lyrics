		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we fall
It's easy to lose who we are
cbove all
The madness can tear us apart
Until we lose sight of the flame
That warmed a brighter day
Kept the storm at bay 

Your flaws
They might let this fall apart
Your flaws
Can we hope to heal these scars

How you drive me to my knees
Such a beautiful disease
I've come down with you 
cnd yes, I know you're all
That I could ever want
But that won't help the pain
Won't seal me from the rain
Or the fear that we're insane

Your flaws
They might let this fall apart
Your flaws
We can overlook these scars 

In my heart there's a symphony
Guiding me
To the thought of eternity 
Spent alone
No companion's hand to hold
I don't know 

Is my heart as cold as stone?
cre we better off alone?
I don't know

I don't know if I can make it on my own
If there's hardship either way
Why choose the lonely road?

Better to walk with you than face the unknown

Better in fire than cold as stone
Best we should reap what we have sown
Better in fire than cold as stone
Better to be chained than die alone
