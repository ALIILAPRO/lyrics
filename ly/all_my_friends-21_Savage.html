		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

Lost a few friends chasin' hand money (On God)
Had the same friends when I was bummy (Straight up)
They should've went and did stand-up
'Cause when the money come, niggas act funny (True)
Crocodile wrist band, 21 Dundee
Yo' bitch skate so fast to the dick
That she'd even go and get a job at Sonic (On God)
Made it from the bottom, I'm a star (21)
Playin' with the stick like a guitar (21)
Why you got a 12 car garage? (Why?)
'Cause I bought six new cars (No lie)
I remember times was dark (I do)
Now I'm backstage with a bar (Big dog)
Couldn't pay the light bill, it was dark (Yeah)
Now I can shine in the dark (On God)
Lost a couple friends, I ain't even really mad though (On God)
I ain't even really mad though (21)
Hard to tell the real from fake
'Cause nowadays, they got masks on
Who gon' be around when the fame and the cash gone?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in a Lambo' truck
VVSs on me, fightin' icy like a hockey puck
If she wanna dance, let her dance, watch her pick it up
I don't need no friends, what's a friend if it ain't no trust?

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

I lost all my friends countin' bands and I copped a Benz
Pulled up with no army, just the guap and I'm spendin' it
No, no, never lendin' it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, givin' no 'pologies
All these mans with they fuckin' hands out, tryna spare some
I don't never stress, no, I got plenty peso
I been all alone, on my own in my new mansion
Everybody says I went ghost, jump in my Phantom
Paparazzi always tryna press up on me
Ever since I blew up, I don't know nobody (Know nobody)
Yeah, I blew 80 bands only for you to leave
Hey, I know somewhere that my mama prayin' for me (For me)

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe (For me)
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth (For me)
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth

I lost all my, I lost all my
(Really wanna know the truth)
Hey
