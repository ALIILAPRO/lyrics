		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm just on some slime shit 
I'm back on that slime stuff, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't care nothin' 'bout this superstardom shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, yeah
That's on God

Yeah, yeah
All my hoes gettin' slimed in 
Niggas ain't on no slimy shit
All my hoes from Thailand
Ho know a nigga got a water wrist
All my hoes in the widebody
Pick my ho up in the widebody

Eat it right up and don't cry 'bout it
All my hoes get time out
All your hoes gettin' slimed out
The AP store, we buy 'em out
Marni on Marni, go head first
All my hoes wear Chanel sandals
White on your toes, that's good manners
Chanaynay black, goin' bandana
All my hoes take the whole thing
High-top Maybach, cocaine
2025 on the leg trip
Scorchin' fire, no Pyrex
Hit me on WhatsApp, direct
Kitkat pant, went chocolate
Patek water, I train her
Pass that bag, I train her
Cuban, let's link, I chain her
She throwin' up rackies, I train her
All my hoes they gang members
All these pures got 'caine in 'em
Dog food, probably got pain in 'em
Curved that goofy, he ain't him
Told you these hoes on my time
Put him on ice, go Einstein

Yeah, yeah
All my hoes gettin' slimed in 
Niggas ain't on no slimy shit
All my hoes from Thailand
Ho know a nigga got a water wrist
All my hoes in the widebody
Pick my ho up in the widebody

Lil' bitty ho, I sign shit
Yeah, yeah, ask these niggas who run shit
Lil' bitty ho, I sign shit
All my hoes love convicts
Ain't no love, we chop shit
Passport stamp, exhausted
Lounge on the island, a bad one
Sand on the beach, I bag one
Walk through the store like ransom
Clutchin' the gat, go blast it
Benjamin Franks, elastic
Bury your dog, casket
Buyin' out the mall, trappin'
Go against the laws, a thousand percent
Squeeze and don't stall, one thousand percent
It's over, you fall, one thousand percent
Stand over your dog, one thousand percent
I'm over this shit, one thousand percent
I'm slimin' out shit, one thousand percent
I get it, I print it, one thousand percent
Bitch love how I'm livin', one thousand percent

I'm just on some slime shit 
I'm back on that slime stuff, you know what I'm sayin'?
I don't care nothin' 'bout this superstardom shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, yeah
That's on God

Yeah, yeah
All my hoes gettin' slimed in 
Niggas ain't on no slimy shit
All my hoes from Thailand
Ho know a nigga got a water wrist
All my hoes in the widebody
Pick my ho up in the widebody

Richer than a ho, she a bird bitch
Call her up now, she workin'
Pull up to the stu', she twerkin'
I'm poppin' my big one, you know that
Steppin' on a nigga like doormat
All my shooters run a four flat
Wideboy skrrt through, Hellcat
Walk a nigga down for a tall stack
