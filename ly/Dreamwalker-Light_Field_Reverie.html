		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moment I saw you in the field
I lived in the skin of someone else like me
Face to face with one I call my own
But I don't know you
'I only came to say I'm sorry
That I'm not here
I was never meant to find you'
Now I'm torn between another world and this one
I'm missing in your line of time
I don't recall which life is real
But all I know is what I feel for you
She closes her eyes
And everything changes
Even in two worlds
I couldn't save us
Renn... Renn... Renn...
I'm not the same
Since I saw her face
And I know I barely even met her
'I came to say
I won't forget your name
And I'll find you one day in the aether'
She closes her eyes
And everything changes
I had to let go
I couldn't save us
She closes her eyes
And everything changes
Even in two worlds
I couldn't save us
Renn... Renn... Renn...
I'm not the same
Since I saw her face
And I know I barely even met her
'I came to say
I won't forget your name
And I'll find you one day in the aether'
