		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie oogie oggi, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink drink and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now baby give a booty naked, take off all your clothes,
and light the roof on fire
Tell her baby baby baby baby
I'm in fire
I tell her baby baby baby
I'm a fireball

Fireball

I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, I saw I conquered, I came
They say the Chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin' he runnin' the game
Now big bang boogie
Get that kitty little noogie
In a nice nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way

I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you've never had
If you think I'm burning out, I'm never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Fireball

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don't care what y'all say
'Cause as the world turns, y'all boys gonna learn
That Chico right here don't play
That boy's from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A U.S.A
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said
Walk this way

I was born in a flame
Mama said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best you've never had
If you think I'm burning out, I'm never am
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire
I'm on fire

Fireball

We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down
We're taking it, we're taking it
We're taking it down

Now we're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back
We're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back
We're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back
We're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back
We're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back
We're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back
We're bring it, we're bring it
We're bring it back

Fireball

Fireball

Tell her baby baby baby baby
I'm in fire
I tell her baby baby baby baby
I'm a fireball
