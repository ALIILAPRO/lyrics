		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shut up, count your calories
I never looked good in mom jeans
Wish I, was like you, blue-eyed blondie, perfect body
Maybe I should try harder
You should lower your expectations
I'm no quick-curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen
If I get more pretty, do you think he will like me?

Dissect my insecurities
I'm the defect, surgical project
It's getting hard to breathe
This plastic wrap in my cheeks
Maybe I should try harder 
You should lower your beauty standards
I'm no quick-curl Barbie
I was never cut out for Prom Queen
If I'm pretty, will you like me?
They say beauty, makes boys happy
I've been starving myself
Carving skin until my bones are showing

Teach me how to be okay
I don't want to downplay my emotions

They say beauty is pain
You'll only be happy
If you look a certain way

I wanna be okay
I wanna be okay
