		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (And oh, you're gonna love me)
(You're gonna wanna hug me and squeeze me)

Yeah, it's gettin' late, don't keep me waitin'
I need company and relaxation
Yeah, all these girls the same, but I'm patient
I need sex and good conversation
Question mark, I don't got time for that
I need me a shorty who gon' write right back
Pull up to the crib, where you park it at?
Don't worry, I'll pay the fine for that

Ice all on her wrist, yeah, it's frozen
Yeah, I pull up with the Rolls, not roses
Got the angel on the hood and it's posin'
Joe Burrow with the cash how I throw it
Put a diamond choker on you, rock and roll it
Yeah, you mine and you already know it
And your friends actin' like they don't know this
Yeah, say we just friends, but you told them
But we know the truth to that
Keep it on the low, I know you used to that (that)
Couple days passed, think I'm fallin' back (back)
Gotta slide on you, yeah, I'm missin' that
I know I got a past, but it's different now (different now)
How so?
I gotta figure it out (figure it out)
Real soon

Yeah, it's gettin' late, don't keep me waitin'
I need company and relaxation
Yeah, all these girls the same, but I'm patient
I need sex and good conversation
Question mark, I don't got time for that
I need me a shorty who gon' write right back
Pull up to the crib, where you park it at?
Don't worry, I'll pay the fine for that

Hella fine, hella mine, top shelf like wine
Come take a real nigga out these Calvin Kleins
Ayy, I be treatin' her house like it's mine
White spots on the couch she sit on all the time
Bitin' on her neck, she said it tickle her spine
Ayy, that's what's up, but don't be ticklin' mine
She wanna fuck more than me, be blowin' my mind
She'd be doin' life in jail if sex was a crime
And I'm likin' that
I love you, that's what she write me back
I put some ice on that
Bitch better give me her life for that (life for that)
Pull in the Ferrari, babe, not no Uber
Blicky on me, bae, tonight, I'm my shooter
Just popped a sex pill, I'm gon' do you

Yeah, it's gettin' late, don't keep me waitin'
I need company and relaxation
Yeah, all these girls the same, but I'm patient
I need sex and good conversation
Question mark, I don't got time for that
I need me a shorty who gon' write right back
Pull up to the crib, where you park it at?
Don't worry, I'll pay the fine for that

I'll pay the fine for that
I'll pay the fine for that
