		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey

Look at the sky turn a hell fire red
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down
Down, down, down

Well I asked my friend where is that black smoke comin' from
He just coughed and changed the subject and
said oh wa I think it might snow some
So I left him sippin' his tea an' I jumped in my chariot
And rode off to see just why and who could it be this time

Sisters and brothers daddys mothers standin' 'round cryin'
When I reached the scene the flames were makin' a ghostly whine
So I stood on my horse's back an' I screamed without a crack
I say oh baby why'd you burn your brother's house down

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down
Look out the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burnin' down down, down down down

Well someone stepped from the crowd he was nineteen miles high
He shouts retired and disgusted so we paint red through the sky
I said the truth is straight ahead so don't burn yourself instead
Try to learn instead of burn, hear what I say, yeah, yeah

So I fin'ly rode away but I'll never forget that day
'Cause when I reached the valley I looked way down cross the way
A giant boat from space landed with eerie grace
And came and taken all the dead away

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

What'd I say
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky turn a hell fire red Lord
Somebody's house is burning down down, down down
Look at the sky, look at the sky

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby
