		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish I was too dead to cry
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my creator
Masochists to which I cater
You don't need to bother
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I was too dead to care
If indeed I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason
My flaws are open season
For this, I gave up trying
One good turn deserves my dying

You don't need to bother
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

Wish I'd died instead of lived
A zombie hides my face
Shell forgotten
With its memories
Diaries left
With cryptic entries

And you don't need to bother
I don't need to be (I don't need to be)
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go 'til it bleeds

You don't need to bother
I don't need to be, yeah (I don't need to be)
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on (once I hold on)
Never live down my deceit
