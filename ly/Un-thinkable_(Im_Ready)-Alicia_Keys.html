		<p>
		  Moment of honesty
Someone's gotta take the lead tonight
Who's it gonna be?
I'm gonna sit right here
And tell you all that comes to me
If you have something to say
You should say it right now (you should say it right now, yeah)
(You ready?)

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I think I deserve it (and it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
And I can't take it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
(Make us look crazy)
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready (yeah, uh)

I know you said to me
"This is exactly how it should feel when it's meant to be"
Time is only wasting, so why wait for eventually?
If we gon' do something 'bout it
We should do it right now
(We should do it right now) ay, oh

You give me a feeling that I never felt before
And I deserve it, I know I deserve it (and it go)
It's becoming something that's impossible to ignore
It is what we make it

I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable, would it make us look crazy?
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready
Yeah, yeah, say

Why give up before we try?
Feel the lows before the highs
Clip our wings before we fly away (fly away)
I can't say I came prepared
I'm suspended in the air
Won't you come be in the sky with me?

I was wondering maybe?
Could I make you my baby?
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy?
(Make us look crazy)
Or would it be so beautiful? Either way I'm sayin'
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready
If you ask me, I'm ready
