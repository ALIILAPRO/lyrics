		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember you used to stand by my side
But since you've been gone I've been lost inside
I feel I've lost the light of my life
It feels so empty and cold inside

kertosäe:
And tonight my head is filled with memories
Broken memories full of her
Tonight I drink, I feel so weak
Yeah I know we're never gonna meet

In my dreams I can see you, and tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can feel you, and it feels so real
In my dreams I can see you, and tell you how I feel
In my dreams I can hold you, and I wake so alone

If this time is the last time
Could I hold you for the last time?
Last time
Since this is.. the last time
Lay your head down for the last night
Last time

Remember we made love in the moonlight
I felt you shake so deep inside
Seemed like everything was all right
We made a blaze so high it lit up the night

kertosäe
