		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The nights are frightful, and nothing goes right. 
My life just keeps letting go again.
The pressure of civilization - does it even exist? I can't take it anymore

When I'm trying to stop the pain 
no matter how hard that seems 
the dark ages embrace me
My fate
When I'm trying to stop the pain 
no matter how hard that seems 
the dark ages embrace me
My fate

feel like my hope is gone, 
and all but one voice's left, 
seems like the only way is grey; 

I'm inclined to serve myself 
no regret for what I did
just had to face reality

When I'm trying to stop the pain 
no matter how hard that seems 
the dark ages embrace me
My fate
When I'm trying to stop the pain 
no matter how hard that seems 
the dark ages embrace me
My fate
