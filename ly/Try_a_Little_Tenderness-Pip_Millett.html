		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, she may be weary
Young girls, they do get weary
Wearing that same old shaggy dress
Yeah yeah yeah but when she gets me weary
Try a little tenderness nah, nah, nah, nah
You know she's waiting, just anticipating
Things that she'll never, never
Never possess but while she's there waiting
Try a little tenderness
That's all you've gotta do

It's not just sentimental, no no no
She has her grieves and cares
But these soft words, they
All spoke so gentle, yeah
It makes it easier, easier to
You won't regret it, no, no
Some girls, they don't forget it
Love is their only happiness

But it's all so easy, all you gotta do is
Try a little tenderness
That's all you gotta do
Squeeze her, don't tease her
Never leave her
Gotta try a little tenderness
All you gotta do, you gotta do
You gotta squeeze her, don't tease her
Never leave her, gotta try
Try a little tenderness
Tenderness, tenderness
All you gotta do, nah nah nah
You gotta know how to love her now, real good
And try a little tenderness
Try a little tenderness a little tenderness
All you gotta to do is
