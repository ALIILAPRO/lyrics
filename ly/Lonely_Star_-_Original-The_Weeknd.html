		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you'll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Every Thursday

It seems like pain and regret are your best friends
Ooh, oh yeah
'Cause everything you do leads to them, why?
Run, run, yeah
But baby, I could be your best friend (ooh)
And baby, I could fuck you right (ooh, whoa)

Baby, you could have it all (ooh, yeah)
Baby, you could have it all (ooh, yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star (ooh yeah)
Baby, you could have it all 
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa (ooh)
Whoa

Whoa, you're blaming all your sins on your best friends
Ooh, yeah nothing's ever, ever your fault
Nothing's your fault baby, no
Well baby, you don't need your best friends (whoa, ooh/whoa)
'Cause I got everything you want (ooh ooh, yeah)

Baby, you could have it all (ooh baby)
Baby, you could have it all (ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, baby you could be a star
Baby, you could have it all (ooh)
Baby, you could have it all (ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star (ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Yes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you will remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me
Every Thursday
I'll wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist
Only on Thursday

(What day is it?)
(Sunday? Thursday)
(Thursday, Thursday, Thursday)
(What day is it?)
(Sunday? Thursday)
(Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday)

Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Sunday)
But on Thursday (ooh)

I love the guitars
