		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep inside the silence staring out upon the sea
The waves are washing over half forgotten memory
Deep within the moment laughter floats upon the breeze
Rising and falling dying down within me
And I swear I never knew, I never knew how it could be
And all this time all I had inside was what I couldn't see
I swear I never knew, I never knew how could be
All the waves are washing over all that hurts inside of me
Beyond this beautiful horizon lies a dream for you and I
This tranquil scene is still unbroken by the rumors in the sky
But there's a storm closing in voices crying on the wind
The serenade is growing colder breaks my soul that tries to sing
And there's so many many thoughts when I try to go to sleep
But with you I start to feel a sort of temporary peace
There's a drift in and out
Drift in and out
Drift
