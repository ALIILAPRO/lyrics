		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Feel real good

Mirrors on the ceiling
Cameras on the corners of my bed
I barely know you but I'm feeling
Like you really did something to my head (yeah)

It's close to midnight
And I just wanna be up with you here (yeah, right on)
And I'll be alright
As long as I feel your body right there

It seems so crystal clear, I know that

Everybody's
Somebody's
Freak

(Say it again, say it again)

Everybody's
Somebody's (yeah)
Freak

The question is, whose are you (Right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your (freak)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your (freak)

Don't need no television
I'll just watch your body going down (yeah)
I'll touch you with precision
Go crazy when you make those sounds
Feels like the best dream
But this time baby you can be the star
A freaky sex dream
Read your lines, make sure you play your parts
And when you get next to me, turn the lights off

Everybody's
Somebody's
Freak

(Say it again, say it again)

Everybody's
Somebody's (yeah)
Freak, freak, freak

The question is, whose are you (Right on)
Can I be your, your, your (Right on)
Your freak
Can I be your, your, your, your, your (freak)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your (freak)
Can I be your, your, your, your, your (freak)

The vases, chandeliers
Glass of wine, can of beer
Alcohol can interfere
Here's the wheel can you steer
Don't need to get senalier
You perform, I will cheer
You can scream, no one hears
Feature face, no one cares
The floor appears to be yours
Go ahead, pop the champagne
It's like were on a world tour
The sex will be your campaign 'cause

Everybody's (yeah)
Somebody's (what)
Freak (right on)

(Say it again, say it again) (turns the light on)

Everybody's
Somebody's (yeah)
Freak, freak freak

The question is, whose are you (yeah hands in the air now)
Can I be your, your, your, your
Your freak (hands in the air now)
(Hands in the air now) can I be your, your, your
Your Freak (right on)
Can I be your, your, your, your
Your freak
Can I be your, your, your, your
Your freak

I think that's enough (yeah)
Turn the lights on
