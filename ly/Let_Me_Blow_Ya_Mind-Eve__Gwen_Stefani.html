		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh, huh
Yo, yo

Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one, pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weavin' through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writin' well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

Knew I had to give you more
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me

Now why you grittin' your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see, I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteen's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressin', chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishin' I wrote your rhymes

Knew I had to give you more
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Back track, think back, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to, I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know, now I'm complete (uh huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die, bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

Knew I had to give you more
It's only been a year
Now I got my foot through the door
And I ain't goin' nowhere
It took awhile to get me here
And I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear
Now let me blow ya mind
