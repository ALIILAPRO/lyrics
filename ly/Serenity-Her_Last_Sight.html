		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is nothing to say, we must go our separate ways

Through the fire and the rain
Through the heartache
I'm reaching for a better way of life

Don't mistake my sorrows for a weakness
There's a flame burning in my heart, it's guiding the way

I won't give up when the tide takes me under
Believe in me, and I'll show you a better world
Let me find (a place I'll finally be set free)
Serenity
Don't let me be a memory

There's a whisper in my ear, leading me to you
You're the piece I've been searching for
You are the truth, so set me free

We all born alone, searching for a place to call our own
I'm breaking out of my skin , breathe life into me
Don't let me be a memory

I won't give up when the tide takes me under
Believe in me

I won't give up when the tide takes me under
Believe in me, and I'll show you a better world
Let me find (a place I'll finally be set free)
Serenity

Through the pain of it all, it gets better
Time's a test, and you're the story teller

There was a darkness in my heart, the day you walked away
There's nothing to say, we must go our separate ways

The story never stays the same, but this life we must embrace
