		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen hell rise out of your eyes
Creep up at night to your demise
You've gotta fight, I've gotta fight
Been thinkin' that I need isolation
All this devastation
Head needs renovation, alright

If you had to choose, would you ever let me go? Ooh
I can't stop the monster, I'm losin' my control, oh oh

Could someone please, save my life?
Could someone please, save my life?
Could someone please, save my life?
'Cause I've gone cold

Save my life
Could someone please, save my life?
Could someone please, save my life?
'Cause I've gone cold
And I'm stuck in the abyss all on my own

Save my life
Could someone please, save my life?
Could someone please, save my life?
'Cause I've gone cold
And I'm stuck in the abyss all on my own
