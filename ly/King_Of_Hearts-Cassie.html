		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the Prince of Charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my King of Hearts
You are my King of Hearts

If you with it
You might as well admit it
And you can come and get it
Or you can just forget it, forget it
If you with it
You might as well admit it
And you can come and get it
Boy you can just forget it, forget it

You are the Prince of Charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my King of Hearts
You are my King of Hearts

You are the Prince of Charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my King of Hearts
You are my King of Hearts

Hear what you sayin'
Baby why you blamin'?
It's obvious you playin'
But you can just keep blamin', keep blamin'

Keep playin',
Baby why you playin'?
It's obvious you gamin'
But you can just keep blamin', keep blamin'

You are the Prince of Charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my King of Hearts
You are my King of Hearts

You are the Prince of Charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my King of Hearts
You are my King of Hearts

And we go
And we go go (go go go go)
And we go
And we go go (go go go go)

King of Hearts
King of Hearts
King of Hearts
King of Hearts

You are the Prince of Charm
Seduction is your art
You'll never play my love
You're just my King of Hearts
You are my King of Hearts

And we go
And we go go (go go go go)
And we go
And we go go (go go go go)
