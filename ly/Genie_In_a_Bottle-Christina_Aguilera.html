		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on, come on
Uh, yeah
Come on, come on, uh

I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're lickin' your lips
And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)

Oh, oh, oh
My body's sayin' let's go
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is sayin' no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression (oh yeah)
Gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then we're good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me
Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, baby)

Oh, oh, oh
My body's sayin' let's go
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is sayin' no (but my heart is sayin' no)

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (oh)
I can make your wish come true (your wish come true oh)
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come come, come on and let me out
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Gotta rub me the right way, honey
(If you wanna be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come come, come on and let me out

Oh, oh, oh
My body's sayin' let's go
Oh, oh, oh
But my heart is sayin' no

If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me
I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression 
Gotta like what you do
If you wanna be with me
Baby, there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (in a bottle baby)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (if you wanna be with me)
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free, baby
And I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle, baby
Come come, come on and let me out
