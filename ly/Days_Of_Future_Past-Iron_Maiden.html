		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A war in heaven in God's rage
He put me in this burning cage
Holy fury locks me in
Imprisoned by my deadly sin

Every hour the shadow king
Wonders what his cloth will bring
I've lived and loved and that's for sure
My fatal quest forevermore

The days of future past, to wander on the shore
A king without a queen, to die forevermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

Once crucified, you forgave it all
But my own life condemned to fall
Where's the glory in your name?
My twisted soul still burns in flame

Hark you angels, hear my call
Father, witness to my fall
Between the lines of sin and pain
I walk the earth now doomed again

The days of future past to wander on the shore
A king without a queen to die forevermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The days of future past, to wander on the shore
A king without a queen, to die forevermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends

The days of future past, to wander on the shore
A king without a queen, to die forevermore

To wander in the wasteland
Immortal to the end
Waiting for the judgement
But the judgement never ends
