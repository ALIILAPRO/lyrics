		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Voice of the jungle, and the ghetto youth
If a nigga touch my brother then my nigga shoot
I don't ever bother, I don't got nothing to prove
Just fight for yourself don't put yourself in my shoes (yeah)
I put work all day in everything I do
And there is a lot that's happening I swear I wish I knew
Sky forever blue, the day forever new, ye
Mehn I wish that I could live forever

Hope you would miss me?
I got shawty on me tryna please me
Please don't leave me
When it gets hard please be with me
Put my song on repeat
Cause I'm the hottest boy in my city
Stand, when I'm sitting (when I'm sitting, when I'm sitting, yeah)
I got real people tryna be me

Money money long
Money over love
And love make you invisible under the sun
Money give you company anytime you feel alone
I ain't even out there I'm just staying in my zone
Whoa whoa whoa, oh no no no
I keep to myself, even everything I know
Taking all this zaza meh it hurt me in my soul
We fly all day, we don't miss out

But tell my girl I love her when you see her
Rip osha mehn I feel am
In my family, I'm the only bread winner
And I pray one day I'ma pull up in a beamer
Pull up in a beamer puff puff pass
All my pain gone at last
When I drop bars bars bars
Little do you know, hard times don't last
Been depressed, so it kept me on a low down
Been so fast, so it's hard for me to slow down
I've been on the road now
Shutting on shows down
Well
I guess you know now

Voice of the jungle, and the ghetto youth
If a nigga touch my brother then my nigga shoot
I don't ever bother, I don't got nothing to prove
Just fight for yourself don't put yourself in my shoes (yeah)
I put work all day in everything I do
And there is a lot that's happening I swear I wish I knew
Sky forever blue, the day forever new, ye
Mehn I wish that I could live forever

Hope you would miss me?
I got shawty on me tryna please me
Please don't leave me
When it gets hard please be with me
Put my song on repeat
Cause I'm the hottest boy in my city
Stand, when I'm sitting (when I'm sitting, when I'm sitting, yeah)
I got real people tryna be me

Money money long
Money over love
And love make you invisible under the sun
Money give you company anytime I feel alone
I ain't even out there I'm just staying in my zone
Whoa whoa whoa, oh no no no
I keep to myself, even everything I know
Taking all this zaza meh it hurt me in my soul
We fly all day, we don't miss out
But
