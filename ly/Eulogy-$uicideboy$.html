		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I-when I-when I-when I- (You did good, $lick) 
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
When I-when I-when I-when I-
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
When I-when I-when I-when I- When I die

3 AM drinking with this pistol on my lap
Six medications, guess there ain't no fixing that
It's that broken motherfucker, knuckling until I relapse
If I die they might cry until they inherit my stacks, uh
Cold fucking world, tell me what's the word
Only time I speak my heart is when the message come out slurred
People pleasing always eager to fix a motherfucker's problems
Leave me at the bottom, all comfortable with Gomorrah Sodom
I chew on fent and rot my teeth off
Moments of peace and slow heart beats, God offered
God I dissed, who gon save me?
All I can do is laugh and say "C'est la vie"
Uh, yeah, woe was me, I know you get the picture
This type of pain will earn you seven figures
Check my DNA, my RNA come with predictors
This shit is scripture and for what I got, there's no elixirs
Feel like I'm not enough, find myself playing my day
Like Honey Boy and Shia LaBeouf
My momma crying as she watch the clock
Text my bro I love him even though he got my number blocked
I would give up everything to see my brothers clean
No second thoughts, it's fuck the cost or take me, leave 'em be
Take my money, say you love me even if it's lies
That connection so depressing but it's all I got

When I die just play this fucking song
I was never meant for this, been tortured just to carry on
Couple coupes, lotta zeros and a couple homes, none of it is shit to me
Cock the pistol and now I'm

Ayy, head in the clouds it look like it might rain again
Always holding back tears, it's how I manage to pay the rent
Pay the bills, place the bets so I don't have to chase the check
Verified through suicide, the glitz and glamor came and went
Wash my fucking soul, there's still that one stain is kept
I just wanna be loved, the root of all my pain
Except the type that comes with age and death
I can finally lay and rest, I'm owed a lil' peace
And I'm ready to erase the debt
I never planned on showing the world the face that hides behind the mask
I always thought the last thing I would hear would be the guns blast
Fill in the black hole in my chest with sex and drugs
But it never lasts, it never lasts
Shit, 2 years ago Big Pharma should have just cashed me out
Now I got a deviated septum, I'mma just wrap me out
Pat me down, ask me how I'm still depressed, all they see is my set
All they see is lack of debt, all they see is what they wanna see
Calling me a wannabe, I don't wanna be in misery except a pharmacy
Tell that girl I wanna see, I wanna see her heart bleed
When she rips out my fucking heart, enter the pharmacy
I'm a private person and take pride in my verses
Fuck your whole opinion, I don't care if it worsens
I'll ruin my reputation and make sure it's on purpose
Fuck this shit

When I die, just play this fucking song
I was never meant for this, been tortured just to carry on
Couple coupes, lotta zeros and a couple homes, none of it is shit for me
Cock the pistol and now I'm gone

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
When I-when I-when I-when I-
When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
When I-when I-when I-when I-when I die
