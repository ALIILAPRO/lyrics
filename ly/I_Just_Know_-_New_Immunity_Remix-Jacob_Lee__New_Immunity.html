		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Teach my lungs to breath underwater,
Teach my heart to beat without her,
I taught her, I taught her,
Guide my feet towards the alter,
Close my hands & wait for an answer,
I caught her, I caught her
Keep my secrets close, our hearts aligned,
I see darkness where you see light,
Emotions fold, our blood runs dry,
I see a future inside your eyes,
We're fading out again
We're fading out again
The world isn't big enough to live it on your own,
I see fire in your eyes & I feel fire in my soul,
You're gonna make it baby I just know
Keep it in your heart, it's buried deep within your bones,
Don't you come home, or I will never let you go,
You're gonna make it baby I just know
Keep my secrets close, our hearts aligned,
I see darkness where you see light,
Emotions fold, our blood runs dry,
I see a future inside your eyes,
We're fading out again
We're fading out again
The world isn't big enough to live it on your own,
I see fire in your eyes & I feel fire in my soul,
You're gonna make it baby I just know
Keep it in your heart, it's buried deep within your bones,
Don't you come home, or I will never let you go,
You're gonna make it baby I just know
The world isn't big enough to live it on your own,
I see fire in your eyes & I feel fire in my soul,
You're gonna make it baby I just know
Keep it in your heart, it's buried deep within your bones,
Don't you come home, or I will never let you go,
You're gonna make it baby I just know
