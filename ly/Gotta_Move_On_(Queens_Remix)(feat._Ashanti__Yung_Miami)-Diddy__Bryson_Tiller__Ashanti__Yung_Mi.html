		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it, love is in the air tonight
Move on
Woo, come on
And we've been waitin' for this moment
All our lives
Move on (let's go)
Move on (we off the grid)
Ayo, bring some DeLeón in her (this is the)
Ayo, turn it up (keep on movin', let's go) (remix, yeah)
Ron Browz, yeah (let's go)

Get to the bag (yeah), where that money at?
Get to the bag (yo), where that money at?
Get to the bag (yeah), where that money at?
Get to the bag (yeah), where that money at?
Let's go

She don't want my love (come on)
I guess I gotta move on (Love Records)
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah 
(Ayo, I like the way this sounds, stay on that frequency)
Oh but, if she don't want my love (and ladies, report to the dancefloor)
I guess I gotta move on (report to the dancefloor, the frequency is here)
Oh yeah, oh no (ayo, Caresha, talk to 'em)

Step one, I can't stress me a nigga (yeah)
Forty point necklace, I can buy me a nigga (that's right)
Deleón sipper but my new nigga richer (facts)
He hit like his tequila, I can feel it in my liver (take that)
He ain't movin' on, he ain't had enough of me (nah)
Half a mil' on a shoppin' spree ain't enough for me (go)
Ex-nigga think I'm trippin'
Hot tub on a yacht, only time I'm trippin' (let's go)
Concierge and a butler is how I'm livin' (come on)
We just went missin' (oh), Dior Christian (everything expensive)
He on my body real bad (teal bad)
Too fly, bitch, I ain't never jet lag (come on)
Hop on this PJ, his other hoes mad (chill)
Caresha, please, he love it when I brag (love it when you brag, don't stop)

(Get in your bag, stay in your bag) ayo, this is the remix 
Get in my bag, stay in my bag (ayo, Ashanti, talk to 'em, come on)
Baby, I tried

You know I tried to warn you, baby (come on)
If I put this on you, it drive you crazy, yeah (Ashanti)
I was loyal, why would you betray me? (Come on)
All you tried to do is fuck me and play me, yeah (this for the ladies)
And it get so frustratin', yeah
You be playin' all these games and I ain't got time
You be out here like these niggas ain't crazy 'bout mine (come on) 
Like I can make a call and have 'em pull up on site (let's go)
You thought that you could have it on the weekends (Come on)
Now you mad 'cause I told you I was leavin' (let's go)
Nigga, I'm gone, nigga, I'm done, nigga, move on (ooh-wee)
I'm finished with it, she can have your little dick
It's givin' obsessed, it's givin' you stressed, it's givin' you pressed
It's givin' this nigga missin' the best (let's go)
But it's been twenty years, nigga, please, say less
We can see all your tears while you beating on your chest (ladies, sing)

Got a new man, yeah, you gotta move on (new man, ohh)
Yeah, I got a new agenda with someone you probably know (let's go, let's, what?)
And you know I ain't wrong, yeah, I had to move on
Yeah, yeah, yeah (come on)

Yeah, she (let's go)

If she don't want my love (Come on)
I'm guessin' I gotta move on (that's right)
I guess, I guess, I guess
I came a little too strong, I guess (let's go, take that)
She don't want my love (as we proceed to give you what you need) 
I guess I gotta move on, I guess (this is the remix)
Don't wanna waste your time but (the frequency is back)
I guess I gotta move on (yo, check this out, yeah)
I guess (listen to me, come on)

Somebody shine a light on 'em (yeah)
Shine a light on 'em (come on)
Somebody shine a light on 'em
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (shine a light on 'em, oh, yeah)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag, yeah (hold up)

We goin' up, we goin' live (come on)
Can't stop, won't stop, told y'all (let's go)
See me pull up, no problem (yeah)
I can never ever be no one option (come on)
Pull up on me but no blogs (no blogs)
Now you wanna say you wanna talk (you wanna talk?)
Now you wanna say you wanna talk (you wanna talk?)
Now you wanna say you wanna, let's go
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (she don't want my love)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (and I won't be the one who run)
(Ayo, the frequency is back)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (ooh, yeah)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag
Love Records
