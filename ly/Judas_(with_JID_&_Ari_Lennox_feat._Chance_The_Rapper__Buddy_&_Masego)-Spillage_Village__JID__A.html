		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, ooh
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack and don't you come back no more, ooh

(My baby) My baby why you treat me so cold?
You, put me out on the side of the road
I had my own thing going way before you came along
Now it's 3:45 in the morn' and I've been up callin' you phone (uh)

Spillin' drinks on my clothes
She throwin' hands 'bout some hoes in my DM's, tryna be low
I gotta go, I got goals, I got shows, for sure
They out sold, I don't sell my soul
My soul sales, no parasails
My paragraphs jail, well life real
Life, know real, I persevere from out the lion grip
To my defense you just offended, 'cause you ride the bench
I'm sidin' with God, ridin' with y'all, got me in problems
Fidin' my flaws, I feel a force, I'm, built for it, fortified
It ain't 1954, I ain't your nigga, boy
One hand Glock, John Hancock
Want a signature?
Send the coordinates, drop a pin, I'm feelin' immature
Centaurs rumblin' through the forest, check your temperature (fuck nigga)

brighten your day
brighten your day
brighten your day

We're always fighting (fighting)
You always leave (always leave)
Mentally drowning (mentally drowning)
Eventually (eventually)
Her mind's on money (money)
My mind's on green (mind's on green)
Yeah, you're enticing (enticing)
Yes indeed (yes indeed)

Ah, runnin' through the maze like lab rat
Or an Indian in the field with an hazmat
Runnin' away from small pox, packin' like backpacks
Stack up your Andrew Jacks, 'til you come back like clapbacks
No cap, no capitalist billionaire back tax
No black Batman, countin' Benjamin Afflecks
But once you get that money they gon' say you don't act black
I say I might be lightskin, bitch, but I'm matte black
I know many moochers like Cab
They like to use us like movers in Ubers and cabs
Uncle Sam is the one that really could use a hijab
It's hard to face it when you used to usin' ghostfaces
I could hardly blame my people for confusin' bags
You should brag, I refuse to beg
I'm a hollow wolf, pull up in that chest ruckus, who's your dad? (Skrrt)
I know my freedom papers ain't my payment stubs
but how could you blame a nigga just for chasin' tubs

We're always fighting (fighting)
You always leave (always leave)
Mentally drowning (mentally drowning)
Eventually (eventually)
Her mind's on money (money)
My mind's on green (mind's on green)
Yeah, you're enticing (enticing)
Yes indeed (yes indeed)
