		  Hee hee
Ooh
Gon', girl
Ow
Hee

Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me, baby, and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

The way you make me feel (the way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (you really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet (you knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (my lonely days are gone)

I like this feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side

I never felt so in love before
Just promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

The way you make me feel (the way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (you really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (you knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (my lonely days are gone)

Gon', girl!
Gon'!
Hee hee, ow!
Gon', girl!

I never felt so in love before
Promise, baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me

Way you make me feel (the way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (you really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (you knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (my lonely days are gone)

The way you make me feel (the way you make me feel)
You really turn me on (you really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet now, baby (you knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone (my lonely days are gone)

Ain't nobody's business (the way you make me feel)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business (you really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business but mine and my baby (you knock me off of my feet)
Ooh! (my lonely days are gone)
Give it to me (the way you make me feel)
Give me some time
Come on, be my girl (you really turn me on)
I want you to be mine
Ain't nobody's business (you knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business but mine and my baby (my lonely days are gone)

Gon', girl! Ow!

Hee hee! Ooh!
Chika, chika
Chika, chika, chika
Gon', girl!

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

Give it to me (the way you make me feel)
Give me some time
Come on, be my girl (you really turn me on)
I want you to be mine
Ain't nobody's business (you knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business but mine and my baby (my lonely days are gone)
Gon', girl!
Give it to me (the way you make me feel)
Give me some time
Come on, be my girl (you really turn me on)
I want you to be mine
