		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way (ha ha ha)
Bells on bob-tails ring
Making spirits bright
Oh what fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Oh jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh

A day or two ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And soon miss fanny bright
Was seated by my side
The horse was lean and lank
Misfortune seemed his lot
We ran into a drifted bank
And there we got upshot

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on the snow
And on my back I fell
A gent was riding by
In a one-horse open sleigh
He laughed at me as
I there sprawling laid
But quickly drove away

Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls along
And sing this sleighing song
Just bet a bob-tailed bay
Two-forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And, crack, you'll take the lead
