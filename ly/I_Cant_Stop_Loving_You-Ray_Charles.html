		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you're leaving in the morning 
On the early train 
Oh, I could say everything's alright 
And I could pretend and say good bye 

Got your ticket 
Got your suitcase 
Got your leaving smile 
Oh, I could say that's the way it goes 
And I could pretend and you won't know 
That I was lying 

'Cause I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you 
No, I won't stop loving you 
Why should i?

We took a taxi to the station 
Not a word was said 
And I saw you walk across the road 
For maybe the last time, I don't know 

Feeling humble 
I heard a rumble 
On the railway track 
And when I hear the whistle blow 
I'll walk away and you won't know 
That I'll be crying 

'Cause I can't stop loving you 
No, I can't stop loving you 
No, I won't stop loving you 
Why should i?

(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind

So you're leaving in the morning 
On the early train 
Oh, I could say everything's alright 
And I could pretend and say good bye
But that would be lying

Because I can't stop loving you (can't stop loving you)
No, I can't stop loving you (i won't stop loving you)
No, I won't stop loving you 
Why should i? (Why should i? Even try)

Because I can't stop loving you (can't stop loving you)
No, I can't stop loving you (it's all I can do to keep from crying)
No, I won't stop loving you 
Why should i? (Why should i?)
Why should i? (Tell me why)
Why should i? Even try
