		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-oh
Uh, oh

She my best friend in the whole world
On the mood board, she's the inspo
And she dressed in really cute clothes
Kawaii like we're in Tokyo
Devon Lee smile, teeth a white row
Got a classic, real deep, Van Gogh
She got loyalty, she says, "I love you, girl"
I love her more

Ah-ah, Barbie, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
Jump into the driver's seat and put it into speed drive
Hot, ridin' through the streets, on a different frequency
Know you know just what I mean, we're runnin' through the red lights
Ah, Barbie, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
Jump into the driver's seat and put it into speed drive
Hot, ridin' through the streets, on a different frequency
Know you know just what I mean, we're runnin' through the red lights

Li-i-i-i, i-i, i-i, i-ights
Red lights, red lights, red lights, red lights, yeah

Oh, got the top down, tires on fire (on fire)
Who are you? I'm livin' my life (uh-huh)
See you lookin' with that side eye
Wow, you're so jealous 'cause I'm one of a kind
What you think about me, I don't care (I don't care)
I'm a classic, real deep, Voltaire
The girls who need to know, well, they already know
They're over there

Ah-ah, Barbie, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
Jump into the driver's seat and put it into speed drive
Hot, ridin' through the streets, on a different frequency
Know you know just what I mean, we're runnin' through the red lights
Ah, Barbie, you're so fine, you're so fine you blow my mind
Jump into the driver's seat and put it into speed drive
Hot, ridin' through the streets, on a different frequency
Know you know just what I mean, we're runnin' through the red lights

Li-i-i-i, i-i, i-i, i-ights
Red lights, red lights, red lights, red lights, yeah
Li-i-i-i, i-i, i-i, i-ights
Red lights, red lights, red lights, red lights, yeah

Red lights, red lights, red lights, red lights, yeah
