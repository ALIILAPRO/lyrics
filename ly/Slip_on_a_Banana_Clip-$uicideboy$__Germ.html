		  Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in this ho!
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot
In this bitch!
(Lil Remains gon' make a stain)
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in this ho!
(Lil Remains)

We be them gorillas creepin'
Inside your motherfucking mind
Germ got the axe watch him lift it up
And just swing it from behind

Who is he? That fucker a beast
Came with the fleet
Knock you out your fleece
Cold summers, long winters if need be
Fuck the world, bitch, I'm balls deep

Demons surround me, I'm drownin'
I'm fiending for opiates, schemin'
I hope it gets colder
The seasons they change
But we holdin', defeating the opposition
Opposite of the competition

We start a fucking riot, don't try me
I strike like lightning or Tyson
Do drive-bys ridin' on bikes, man
I swear that murder exciting
I'm expediting your life's end
We multiplying alliance
You bitin'? Well, I'm delighted
Welcome to Hell, I'm your guidance

Hold on, call on me diamonds dancing, homie
Running for office, offensive and lawless
Balls of the rawest in jaws of the new elect
Fucked up be my set
Like ratchets with hatchets
Wylin', catching necks
I'm 'bout Bad Shit, like where the Plague at?
That guy with the lost cause, 51-50
Spazzing, screaming, "where the flame at?"

Flame on plague calm, stained palms
Pop eight pills, now the fucking pain's gone
Slayin' y'all, chain flawed
Same song, change long, long mane
Raised kong, trained kong to
Slay them broads, reign strong

DIRTYNASTY, up the ante drop top, dat way
Mister pop off on a banny

I got a bottle of Thompson
Bunch of shitty whiskey in me
Gentilly with the 7th Ward Lord
Razor blades slice the vocal chords

From New Orleans to Atlanta
Sip a dirty Big Shot, fuck a Fanta
Sell out a show in Santa Ana
DIRTYNASTY propaganda

Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot in
This bitch! When we
Let's start a motherfuckin' riot
In this bitch!
