		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, I got an auntie who be raisin' her daughter's kids
She's 46, one is 1, one is 2, others 4 and 6
Baby dad ain't really with that supportive shit
I come to town iced out with the foreign drip
I got another cousin, she the same age as me
Our lifestyles completely different and basically
Her baby dad beat her ass, what I hate to see
Her black eye as I cried, it's a daily thing, uh
And here I am chasin' dreams
Ignorant with bliss, worryin' 'bout plays and streams
The crazy part is they don't even say a thing
They don't want me to worry, just go and make the cream
I got an aunt with a cheatin' husband, always knew he bogus
Used to wear turtlenecks and some Louis loafers
Comin' home to family struggles got me losin' focus
I don't know how else to deal so it's too late now
I got a brother out there who like 5 years old
I don't know why daddy tried to hide your soul
No blood test needed 'cause it just might be
Seen the picture, lil' man lookin' just like me

It be the ones that's closest
That go through the motions
Maybe it's me that's been selfish
Don't know why I can't help it
And it's been hard for me
To see what you been goin' through, it's tirin'
'Cause you've been sufferin', you've been sufferin'
No more sufferin' in silence

And they don't even ask for shit
When I was broke, grandma MoneyGram-ed me cash and shit
And she wasn't even the one that was havin' it
Family be matterin' most, but as a catalyst
I got another cousin buggin' who addicted to Xans
Said it was her substitute for never gettin' a man
Said we all need love, only if it's in the plan
Forced love the worst love, throw that shit in the can
I got an auntie who a prostitute, it hurt my soul
Promise you sellin' your body ain't worth that gold
Reverse that role, you don't gotta swerve that road
Searching for the answers, I don't wanna search that low
'Cause I done been through a lot, my family goes through worse
Cryin' on this airplane how I wrote this verse
They be sufferin' in silence, they don't tell me a thing
All they tell me is, "Nigga, go excel in your dreams"

Yeah, it be the ones that's closest
That go through the motions
Maybe it's me that's been selfish
Don't know why I can't help it
And it's been hard for me
To see what you been goin' through, it's tirin'
'Cause you've been sufferin', been sufferin'
No more sufferin' in silence
It be the ones that's closest
That go through the motions
Maybe it's me that's been selfish
Don't know why I can't help it
And it's been hard for me
To see what you been goin' through, it's tirin'
You've been sufferin', been sufferin'
No more sufferin' in silence
