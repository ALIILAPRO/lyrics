		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Aye-aye-aye-aye-aye
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

Leave me on read, you must be out of your head
Leave me for dead, you must be out of your head
Swarovski on diamonds, but I be on prima donnas (hundred)
Swarovski on diamonds, you already know what time it is
I put stones, both hands, that's a full flex
Played the hand I was dealt, that's a royal flush
I make grandmaster plans that are complex
Drop some cash on land and it's all plush (huh)

Pinstripes on my jeans, they designer-cut (yeah)
Black, red, and yellow bitches, I', Jamaica's up
Yellow strands from the land like I'm smokin' Xans (ah, ah)
'Quiped with lasers on my hands, I got bags of cash (racks)
Harriet Tubman twenty-dollar bills in the stash (oh-oh)
I been ballin' like a athlete, I'm Spalding bag (oh-oh)
I'ma prince, she just cool, she just Juliet (Juliet)
Told that bitch, "Tie my shoes," they cost a couple bands (woo)
How you gon'

Leave me on read (woo), you must be out of yo' head (be out of yo' head)
Leave me for dead, you must be out of yo' head
Swarovski on diamonds, but I be on prima donnas (hundred)
Swarovski on diamonds, you already know what time it is
I put stones, both hands, that's a full flex
Played the hand I was dealt, that's a royal flush
I make grandmaster plans that are complex
Drop some cash on land and it's all plush (ayy, ayy)

Lou' Vuitton for a king, I got royal blood (woo)
I just bust down a Patek, now that's a cold front (woo)
I just shit on my ex, now that's a royal flush (no flex)
Fool fightin' on the 'net, that bitch was throwin' subs (ew)
I was just broke, now I'm in the Ghost
She say I'ma drug, I gave her the dope
My diamonds vaccinated like a ho (a ho)
That mean they even colder than before
I got the strong pack, Mighty Joe (Mighty Joe)
One for the money and two for the show, ayy
Eenie, meenie, minie, moe
I flew a bitch to Tupelo (hello?)

Leave me on read (yee), you must be out of yo' head (yeah)
Leave me for dead, you must be out of yo' head
Swarovski on diamonds, but I be on prima donnas (hundred)
Swarovski on diamonds, you already know what time it is
I put stones, both hands, that's a full flex
Played the hand I was dealt, that's a royal flush
I make grandmaster plans that are complex
Drop some cash on land and it's all plush
