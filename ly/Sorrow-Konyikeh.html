		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She sings about loss
He sings about sorrow 
She sings about yearning 
He sings about tomorrow
I sing about loss
I sing about regret
Only cause
I haven't found those other feelings yet
This is not another sad story 
No love lost, no love found 
Some people find it boring 
And though 
I can't feel much 
What you did to me
I can never forget your touch
Oh the priest is praying for me
In the chapel
Mamma begged but I did ask him not to
I said Father please
Don't waste your breath
You don't want God to think any less of you?
He said well that's true
She sings about loss
He sings about sorrow 
She sings about yearning 
He sings about tomorrow
I sing about loss
I sing about regret
Only cause, I haven't found those other feelings yet
