		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-uh

Hiking in the sun the happiness that you mourn
You know the kids still dance, so we supply all the songs
If I'm wrong, you hit the Superman like Soulja at war
You grew your hair an inch longer for the clerk at the store
Growing up man, Pok√©mons in book bag
Can't you believe it if the panties never soaking
You said Jesus made sense to the chosen
If I'm wrong, the shell's stuck beneath the sides that you're on
To choose the quickest solution don't equate to your flaws
I know my black hearts sinking to the bottom of soles
I know my cheese stinks sitting by your highness en vogue
Ch-ch-chicken Little, who you telling secrets to, bro?
The pain made a new summer where the vegetables grow
We get it on (yeah), do the grown stuff, now play with this sword (okay)
You know what I'm saying?

Twistin' Indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in my blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day 
Ohh-oh, hey

The power you've given me
The crack of dawn sweet cheer to the clipped wing
The planes fly and we the youngest in the stampede
To climb the slippery slope a decade old of doing me
L-l-look, I got the black man balled in my fist
You laugh now, cry later, just empower the kids
Growing pains, monsters all under my bed
Sweats when you sweating me, you looking real cute
You got a dimple under eyes, I bet you never knew
You look the thickest I've seen since the last time
Got us tickets for the show by the alibi
And all the things, all the things, all the days that we scorned
I can fly, I'm a dove, I'm a butterfly, yo (yo)
I'm a butterfly, yo, fuck (yeah-yeah)

Twistin' Indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in my blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day 
Ohh-oh, hey

It's inadequate, this elaborate floral display
They paid for bad habits, gaul and moral decay
To say what's unforgiveness, it'll all go away
Lay a plot to book a yacht out on the water today porque
Is it so compelling, the rebel with all the yelling?
Now it's overwhelming, you're swelling melon, bruh, who you telling?
Dumb lust overflowing in love stuff hush
Heart crushed like a bag of dust, bum rush
Black beanie, freak out at night like Whodini
Creep out the back and
Who coulda seen a G, easily? Blue weenie
She chouldn't dig it if it was too teeny
Bless her with the kundalini and plus the zucchini
Always been a plan to mush a heart melt, bird
It takes a steady hand to push these heartfelt words
I heard you heard, trapped in delirium
Thoughts of a queen to throw off your equilibrium
A few jokes, but the underlying fact goes
It's still a ray of hope to live happily ever after though
Disaster's what I asked her for
Now we stuck like plaster, yo, I has to go

Twistin' Indica while the sunrise
Sticky like the rain in the summer
Twilight in my blunt and I'm gone flyin'
Way up high where the kites stream away
Cloudy in my truck sitting dumb high
I know I'm gonna see the golden light of day 
Ohh-oh, hey
