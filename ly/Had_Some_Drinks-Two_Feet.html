		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been around, brought you down, it's true
I had some drinks and said some things to you
If I said too much, I know you're mine to lose
I had some drinks and said some things to you

I think too much, I'm outta touch, it's true
Don't give a fuck, yeah actually I do
If I said too much, I know you're mine to lose
Don't give a fuck, yeah actually I do

I come my town
I come my closest
I come my lover too
I come my town
I come my closest
I come my lover too
I come my town
I come my closest
I come my lover too
I come my town
I come my closest
I come my lover too
