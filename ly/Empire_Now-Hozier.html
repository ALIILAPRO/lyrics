		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from

Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from

After all, darling, I wouldn't sell the world
The way that things are turning
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'

Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from

The martyrs of our revolution
Their spinning caused the earth to shake
The problem brought it's own solution
They power now the world we've made

After all, darling, I wouldn't sell the world
For all the gold or sterling
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'

Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from
One hundred years from
