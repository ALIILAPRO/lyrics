		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah)

Hunnid stacks, all in cash, got the bag on me
Big dawg, I'm a boss, type of energy
Got the club goin' up, they all fuck with me 
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Champagne and Cîroc and some Hennessy
If you keep on makin' problems, you gotta leave
Got the club goin' up and they fuck with me, ooh (ooh)

Why you so uptight? You came in the wrong place
You know what you like, girl, you know you wanna stay
Them girls they be tired, they too busy being fake
And I don't fuck with that shit
Girl, you know you should be livin' your life
You know that you got it
Mercedes, you drivin'
You should be excited
Three shots of that white, we finally vibin'
Oh yeah

The way you workin' them red bottom heels, girl it's heavenly
Baby, you decide if you fuck with me
Showin' all the signs, girl, I know you're freaky
Oh-whoa (yeah, yeah)

Hunnid stacks, all in cash, got the bag on me
Big dawg, I'm a boss, type of energy
Got the club goin' up, they all fuck with me 
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Champagne and Cîroc and some Hennessy
If you keep on makin' problems, you gotta leave
Got the club goin' up and they fuck with me
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)

It is what it is, yeah
The way that you walk, the way that you talk
And you 'bout the business
You and your girls can pour up a cup
You know what it is, yeah
'Cause it's the weekend, I'll make it easy
It's all on me, yeah
I can see you coming 'round
'Cause I ain't comin' down, no
Girl, you know what I'm about
We're goin' up in here, right now

The way you workin' them red bottom heels, girl it's heavenly
Baby, you decide if you fuck with me
Showin' all the signs, girl, I know you're freaky
Oh-whoa (oh-whoa, yeah, yeah)

Hunnid stacks, all in cash, got the bag on me
Big dawg, I'm a boss, type of energy
Got the club goin' up, they all fuck with me 
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
Champagne and Cîroc and some Hennessy
If you keep on makin' problems, you gotta leave
Got the club goin' up and they fuck with me
(Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)

Ooh, ooh (oh-oh)
Ah-ooh, ooh
