		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait for me
Stay for me
Pray for me
Stay for me

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know

Why does it burn from the inside
Why did you face away
What am I supposed to do now
What am I supposed to say
I know what a tragedy is
I know how it always ends
I know what losing is
I hope you're watching

I'm so sorry
Let em see
I burned your body
To set you free
I lose my way now
Day to day now
Stumbled forward
Relentlessly
But don't be sorry
Don't ever be
There's nothing to say now
Just want you to wait for me
But sometimes
It feels like you forgot about me

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know

I know what a tragedy is
I know how it always ends
I know what losing is
I hope you're watching
