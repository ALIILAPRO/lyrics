		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I done made my peace
With the younger me just last night
He done made me see the stubborn ways in a past life
Everything he knows, reminiscent of the bad times
Still a ways to go, you just gotta make it through this last time like

I don't want this pain no more
I done walked through the fire alone
So for' the flames come and take a hold
Rain down on me, rain down below

(Rain on me)
No more tears on the floor (Rain on Me)
Gotta let it go let it go (Just rain)
Let the choir sing, when I feel low
Rain down on me, rain down below like

No more tears on the floor
Gotta let it go let it go
Let the choir sing, when I feel low
Rain down on me

How do I cope in the moment
At my lowest, never know how to show it
Everything I touch, is heartache or heroic
It's two sides to the story love just depends on how you told it
No more tears on the floor

I don't want this pain no more
I'm done walking through the fire alone
So for' the flames come and take a hold
Rain down on me, rain down below

(Rain on me)
No more tears on the floor (Rain on Me)
Gotta let it go let it go (Just rain)
Let the choir sing, when I feel low
Rain down on me, rain down below like

No more tears on the floor
Gotta let it go, let it go
Let the choir sing (Oh) when I feel low (Oh)
Rain down on me, rain down below like

No more tears on the floor
