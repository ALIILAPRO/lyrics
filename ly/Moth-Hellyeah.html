		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been cast out, sequestered
Pushed the fuck around
Blindsided, beaten, locked up and bound
Always thought I was human but maybe I was wrong
I've been treated like an animal since the day I was born

The wounds that I wear are like the crown upon a king
So heavy they lie, with all the pain that they bring
My life is full of longing, but for what I'll never know
I've been drawn in to the fire as I reap what I sow

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces,
The more that you love me insecurity releases,
And I'll be the one that's to blame,
So I'll sell my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame
(Like a moth to a flame)

The ruler of the kingdom that ends up the pawn,
So tired of thinking of where it all went wrong,
Friendships they come and go and sometimes they end,
Wouldn't dream in a million years that this would be one of them

Faith in the life, belief to the end,
Failure's not an option, but the options exist,
I gave up my everything, I give till I bleed,
Take it all, take everything just take it from me

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces,
The more that you love me insecurity releases,
And I'll be the one that's to blame,
So I'll sell my soul to blaze

You're pushing me, I'm pushing back,
Falling down my heart attacks,
Compassion is lost,
No more hope, no more trust,
I tore it down and burnt it up,
All faith is gone

Respect, devotion
Dead
Disgust, hate
Lies

I'm not a hero, or a villain,
Not a god, I'm just a man,
Staring through the hourglass,
At the footprints in the sand,
I'm stripping off my armor,
My battles here are done,
Wave my white flag to surrender and fly into the sun

Like a moth to a flame, my wings burn away,
When things are too beautiful, I smash them to pieces,
The more that you love me insecurity releases,
And I'll be the one that's to blame,
So I'll sell my soul to blaze
Like a moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
Moth to a flame
