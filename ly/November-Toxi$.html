		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fell in love in November
We fell in love in November 
We fell in love in November 

We fell in love in November
We fell in love in November 
We fell in love in November 

I’ve been going fast 
But I can’t 
Because of you and your love to me
I’ve been going fast again 
But I can’t 
Because of you

I love you so much 
But can’t treat you better 
Than now

We fell in love in November
We fell in love in November 
We fell in love in November 

We fell in love in November
We fell in love in November 
We fell in love in November 

It’s the most wonderful time of the year 
Why can’t u understand 
I love you so much 
I love you so much
I love you so much 

We fell in love in November
We fell in love in November 
We fell in love in November 

We fell in love in November
We fell in love in November 
We fell in love in November
