		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) 
(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) 
(Oh, not another take)

Oh, it's like that, I'm your dream come true
When it's on a platter for you
Then you pulled back when I try to make plans
More than two hours in advance, mm

I slam the door, I hit ignore
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, after this, an afterthought
I finally cut you off

I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (ah)
Floating through the memories like whatever, you're a waste of time (ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch 
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather with you out my life
With you out my life

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) 
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather, yeah

It feels so good
Not caring where you are tonight
And it feels so good
Not pretending to like the wine you like

I slam the door (slam the door), I hit ignore (hit ignore)
I'm saying, "No, no, no, no more"
I got you blocked, excited to never talk
I, I'm so sorry for your loss

I feel so much lighter like a feather with you off my mind (ah)
Floating through the memories like, whatever, you're a waste of time (ah)
Your signals are mixed, you act like a bitch (a bitch)
You fit every stereotype, "Send a pic"
I feel so much lighter like a feather, with you out my life
With you out my life

(Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do) ah, mm
Like a feather, like a feather, like a feather

You want me? I'm done
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at
You want me? I'm done (I'm done)
You miss me? No duh
Where I'm at, I'm up (I'm up) where I'm at

You want me? I'm done (I feel so much lighter) 
You miss me? No duh (like a feather)
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at (with you off my mind)
You want me? I'm done (I feel so much lighter) 
You miss me? No duh (like a feather with you off my mind)
Where I'm at, I'm up where I'm at (like a feather, like a feather) 
(Like a feather, yeah)
