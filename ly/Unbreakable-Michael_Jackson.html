		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm just wondering 
Why you think that you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd know by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through
I'm still around

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me (come on)
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable

Now you can't stop me even thought you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughing, while surfacing

Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes (yeah)
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby (I'm too much for you baby)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (you can't break me)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (you can't touch me)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (yeah)
You'll never break me
You can't let it break, 'cause I'm unbreakable

You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same, I'm (uh) unbreakable (uh, what? uh)

A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringing in 10 G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly .9's and MAC's
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them? Hello?
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any telly you in
Crack bragging, sick of bragging how my mink be dragging
Desert Eag's, street sweeper inside the Beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messing with the devil
What

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (yeah)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable (untouchable)
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (yeah)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it (you, you, you, you, you)
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it (woo)
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable (I'm unbreakable)

You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me
You can't touch me, you can't break me
You can't stand it, babe, 'cause I'm unbreakable (woo)

Gone
