		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where have you been?
Do you know when you're coming back?
'Cause since you've been gone
I've got along but I've been sad

I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've but you never did
Wish you wanted it a little bit
More but it's a chore for you to give

Where have you been?
Do you know if you're coming back?

We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I sold my soul for you)
I see my reflection in your eyes

I know you're sick
Hoping you fix whatever's broken
Ignorant bliss
And a few sips might be the potion

I tried to put it out for you to get
Could've, should've but you never did
Wish you wanted it a little bit
More but it's a chore for you to give

Where have you been?
Do you know if you're coming back?

We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I sold my soul for you)
I see my reflection in your eyes (tell me you see it too)

So close, so close
Yet so far away (so far)
I don't know (I don't)
How to be solo (no)
So don't go, oh, no, just stay
You and I were bright, shooting through the sky daily (yeah)
Lighting up the night, wasn't always right, baby (mm-hmm)
Yeah, every time that we realized it's crazy
And you save me

We were too close to the stars
I never knew somebody like you, somebody
Falling just as hard
I'd rather lose somebody than use somebody
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise (I sold my soul for you)
I see my reflection in your eyes (I sold my soul for you, I know you see it too)

Yeah, I brought same ones too
I know you're tired, I know you're tired
Just say it, I agree with you
Sick of all the poison in me
What did I do wrong for me, babe?
Uh, I see myself in you, I see myself in you, baby
I see myself in you, alright
I see myself in you, maybe you should too
