		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doing too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no, we destined

And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it

Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low (oh)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it 
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches
Living life so trill

Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision (the vision)
I think these hoes deserve another fixin' (fixin')
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin' (oh, oh)
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo, I still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches (on bitches)

And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin' (fuckin')
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin' (fuckin')
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute (been a minute)
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle

Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen (oh)
How I roll, how I get it on the low (oh, woah-oh, oh)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it 
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches
Living life so trill

Roll some, roll some
Roll some
Roll some
Roll some
Roll some

Yeah
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual (unusual)
She tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems (Queen street anthems)
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon (in that wagon)
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke (so broke)
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless (na, na, na, na)
Me and my Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix

Now we get faded when we want girl, we got choices (we got choices)
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices (we got choices)
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices (they got choices)
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless (pointless)
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless (pointless)
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen (oh)
How I roll, how I get it on the low (woo)
Go tell your friends about it (woo)
Go tell your friends about it 
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches
Living life so trill

Life so trill
Ah, yeah
Life so trill
Life so trill
Oh
Life so trill
Na, na, na, na, na
Life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill
