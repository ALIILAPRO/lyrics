		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's another night
Stumbling around the town
Lookin' for action
Totally wasted
And trying to find a date
I could be killed
I could be arrested
But I don't care no more
I just wanna find the thrill
That I felt once before
I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain

Maybe I'll find the answers
In one of these night clubs
And one of the people I meet
Maybe they'll tell me that everything's gonna be fine
And we can't quit
The wild life we know
We've reached the finish line, honey
Now we can go home
I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain

I'm running out of energy
And I have to lie down
Right here on the sidewalk
Next to the shoe town
I hope nobody bothers me
'Cause I'm so tired
And empty
Life means nothing anymore
I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain
I'm losing my mind
I'm going insane
I'm watching my life go down the drain
I'm watching my life go down the drain
