		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll

Can you see where you call in the juke box hall
When the music played
And the world sang rounds to a pretty sound
No sorrow base

And them blue swede shoes, they will scream and shout
I guess they sing the blues, let it all hang out

Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll 

Little Queenie popped in my high school rock
Dancin' to the beat
With the U.S. male and a pony tail
She looked so sweet

Times have changed in the past but we won't forget
Though the age has passed they'll be rockin' yet

Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll

Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and ro-o-oll, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock, rock and roll
Rock and roll, rock
