		  Spinning
Spinning
Spinning inadvertently
Grinning of no concern to me
Churning my gullet turns in me
Burning
A metal furnace
Earnestly I deserve it
I sit in silence
Cuz my mind is
Lacking accurate wordage
Or maybe courage
With a flourish
Writ it spit it
It finished
And then release it
Plays increase it
Rinse repeat and
Don't be cheating
Deleting comments
And buying interaction
By packing that on the backend
Impacting finances
Only through hacking
You niggas wacker than
A sack of some yack
And Jack Daniels in fact
Throw it out
Slowing down
What is my plan of attack?
Growing sound
Louder than a pound of that
Gasoline when it's slapping me
You lacking tree
Passing these spiffies that I been packaging
And packing in wax
Wack rappers eat crap
Flack jacketing
Incase he shat
Plastering the wall
And splattering us all
It's happening
I smoke the shatter til I fall bitch

I am addicted to drugs and I'm sick of it
Smoke away the stress and then roll up another stick of it
I am addicted to drugs and I'm sick of it
Needle full of happiness I tap the skin and then stick it in
We all addicted to drugs and we wired
Johnny at work off a xan-xan-xanax tired

Yeah motherfucker
Coughing up black in the shower
Motherfucker
Pucker up and huck a lougey
Hopefully there's nothing ruby in it
You diminish truly finished
I got no time for that
Niggas who's rhymes are wack
And lines or crack
In tiny sacks

Spit the facts that bit ya neck
A diamond back
Take a sec and check to see ya
Spine intact
Find the pack and tear it open
Seratonin mind attack
Dopamine is soaking in
Like hocus pocus take a toke again
And then
Rewind the track
Rewind the track
Rewind the track

When I was a youngin I suffered for being different
But isn't it
Funny how by sticking out I'm fitting in
I think it is indicative
Of solid qualities
And honestly the fliest niggas stick to shit
I like to knit a bit and sew a little
My flow is brittle
Where is darkie nigga?
Spit a riddle
Fuck with a fiddle
Like the name implies
Patience high
Complacent eyes
Racing I
You'll never buy enough time
Rough riding
Tough hide or thick skin
"I stick my dick in a pig pen"
And piss ya mom off
I tell her I'm soft
But I be at attention
Keep the tension in my trousers
I'll arouse her then allow her
All my power in the shower nigga!

This is an elegy to celery
A tribute to the green
Cuz it's the only thing these
Mother fuckers need
Is getting money
But ain't it funny
That I like the veggie better
I be chilling off the marijuana bumping Eddie Vedder
Fed up
With righty bozos
And lefty homos
Fuck with em no mo
I go go
No fucking gadget
You getcho bag yet?
So big you drag it!
Your hearts has maggots
I'm eating celery
Lil darkie is a faggot magnet

This is an elegy to celery
A tribute to the green
Ride a stick of celery until you cream
This is an elegy to celery
A tribute to the green
Fuck your culture what you say and how you mean
To seem!

I am addicted to drugs and I'm sick of it...
