Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, yeah
Yeah, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh

Co-Come thru with the image too sick
Got the whole pit moshing when I drop them hits
And I make-make case and I get them quids and I don't waste time wanna spend that shit
And I'm loo-looking for the prick who can't get me outta their head, l'm a fucking nightmare
I-I got no patience, stop fucking with me

I got, I got five figures from fuckin screaming
Wassup, wassup with you, bitch? Go clean the kitchen
I got, I got, diamonds on my teeth they glisten
BVD-BVDLVD V Britain, which-which side you picking?

Huh, just signed a deal
Worth a bit more than a Tesco meal for real, and I'm real ill
Just go pop a blue pill, dick go beww
Pussy like ah
Th-This life too surreal
I'ma see you cry once I hit that mill, huh
Dickheads-Dickheads will get got-got
You ain gonna get that top spot you finna get dro-dropped (ugh)
All of this hater shit, eat it up for my lunch
I'm playin this game till quits, if you wanna win then punch
1, 2, 1, 2, left, right, uppercut, hook, jab, jab, punch kick, I'ma hit him with a book
Look at them man, there they shook eww, all them pills they took, huh
Noone will admit that was me one time but I ain't on that drug life
Man l'm sat here on this cash grind gotta get, gotta get that bag down

I got, I got five figures from fuckin screaming
Wassup, wassup with you, bitch? Go clean the kitchen
I got, I got, diamonds on my teeth they glisten
BVD-BVDLVD V Britain, which-which side you picking?

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
