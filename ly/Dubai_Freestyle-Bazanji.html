		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye
Hop on the plane land in a new city
Back to my roots and they call me habibi
In the Middle East and I got my girl with me
Always knew that my life be so pretty
Hotel room and the view so vivid
I keep it real I don't do no gimmick
First gotta dream it then I go live it
And I made the beat so let me go switch it
I'm at the top of the pinnacle
Too many bars and my flow be too criminal
Get in the whip and the dashboard is digital
Told my accountant we don't do division
The money additional
I do my job and the damage is critical
My shit for real, I don't do nothing fictional
Flow be too perfect I don't skip a syllable
If you been sleeping on me then you miserable
Wake up
2016 had to go and get my cake up
Got my mom a new whip, had to repay her
All the long nights that she had to go stay up
So I could do this now, her son came way up
She ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing
Everything good in my life I ain't frontin'
Went all in with my cards I ain't bluffin'
Baz don't miss and they know that
Came too far I cannot go back
Spend every minute like it's my last
Don't wait for nobody I move past
I put in my time and it paid off
I never really cared what they thought
Record anywhere no days off
Got too many hits like, you know
