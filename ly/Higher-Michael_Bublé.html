		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you have it, mm
You take a moment, make it magic, yeah
The way you move is so dramatic
I think I might make you a habit, yeah, uh

See all these faces, mm
So many numbers on your wait list, mm
You make me want to make some changes
Ya drive me to drink, I'm draining cases, yeah

Every step you take
Everyone ever knew ya sing hallelujah

Whoa, because when you go low and I get higher
When you move that slow, it lights my fire
I might be falling for ya, I don't know (high)
I think it might be what you came here for
Whoa, when you go low and I get higher
When you move that slow it lights my fire
I'm at attention, I ain't got no shame (high)
No inhibition, I'm just glad you came, whoa

(A-ooh) take a step into the light and flaunt it
(A-ooh) leavin' everybody broken hearted
(A-ooh, ooh, ooh) God, it's a sauna, so hot
The way you slide across the floor
I think you know
That I'm only going to beg for more

Every step you take
Everyone ever knew ya sing hallelujah

Whoa, because when you go low and I get higher
When you move that slow, it lights my fire
I might be falling for ya, I don't know (high)
I think it might be what you came here for
Whoa, when you go low and I get higher
When you move that slow it lights my fire
I'm at attention, I ain't got no shame (high)
No inhibition, I'm just glad you came

Stuck in this game you've started
Don't leave me broken hearted
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose

Whoa, because when you go low and I get higher
When you move that slow, it lights my fire
I might be falling for ya, I don't know
I think it might be what you came here for
Whoa, when you go low and I get higher
When you move that slow it lights my fire

The way you slide across the floor (the way you slide across the floor)
I think you know (I think you know)
That I'm only going to beg for more (that I'm only going to beg for more)
