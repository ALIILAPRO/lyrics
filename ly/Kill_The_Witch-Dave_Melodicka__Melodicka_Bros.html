		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young little thing
She doesn't know about the mystery
Spent all her life
Between madness and misery
She's giving in to little pleasures
When they're looking away

But people they speak
When they see that you're different
Whispering rumors
About magic and witchery
They need somebody to
Sacrifice in the altar of fear

See the pyre standing tall in the night
And the evil being cleansed in fire

Oh, ayayayayay
Young Rose is gonna die
Nobody's gonna miss her
Nobody's gonna cry
Oh, ayayayayay
She's running out of lies
She cannot run forever
See the light leaving her eyes

So you think you can kill the witch?
Set the fire and get away with it?
Do you think you can save your soul
And hope she will not make it burn?
Do you think she's gonna let you go
After the things you've done?
Witches never die so go and try
She'll feast with your flesh and your blood

See her rising in the cold dead of night
And the people staring up in fright

Oh, ayayayayay
Young Rose is gonna die
Nobody's gonna miss her
Nobody's gonna cry
Oh, ayayayayay
Death words by candlelight
She won't be gone forever
See the fire in her eyes

Ayayayayay
Young Rose is gonna die
Nobody's gonna miss her
Nobody will survive
Oh, ayayayayay
They're running out of time
They cannot hide forever
See them running for their lives
