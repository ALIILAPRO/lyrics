		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more
Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say?, it's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more
I want no other, no other lover
This is our life, our time
When we are together, I need you forever
Is it love?
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more
What is love?
What is love?
What is love?
