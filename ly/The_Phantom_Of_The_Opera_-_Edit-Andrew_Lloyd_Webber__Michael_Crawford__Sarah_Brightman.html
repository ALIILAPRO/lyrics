		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
My spirit and my voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

In all your fantasies 
You always knew
That man and mystery 
Were both in you
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside my mind

Sing my angel of music

He's there
The phantom of the opera

Ah
Ah
Ah (sing for me)
Ah (sing my angel of music)
Ah, ah, ah, (sing for me) 
Ah
