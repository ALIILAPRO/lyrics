		  Yeah
La la la la 
I lost myself but hey i'm back again
Gonna do that shit again 
Gonna make you feel it
Baby i'm so sorry i'm so numb
Just blame that novocaine 
Make me feel something 
Before I fuck it up again 
Maybe I should take a picture it'll last longer
Baby take a picture it'll last longer  

They hate to see me on it
So mad they tryna clone it 
Dog ass nigga, throw a bone 
And start a wave, then watch them chase it
And they can copy or repeat
Stealing personalities 
Tryna fit in with a crowd thats fake
Why you hate
Stay in your lane
They be praying on my downfall shit
You mad you can't, be the same
But baby you can just try your best

I lost myself but hey i'm back again
Gonna do that shit again 
Gonna make you feel it
Baby i'm so sorry i'm so numb
Just blame that novocaine 
Make me feel something 
Before I fuck it up again 
Maybe I should take a picture it'll last longer
Baby take a picture it'll last longer
