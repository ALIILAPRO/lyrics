		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, have you got no soul?
Is your heart a gaping hole?
How come I didn't see that in you? Oh oh
How come I can forgive you?

And if you loved me
You'd never do this
No oh, if you loved me
You wouldn't put me through it

That makes you a killer, a killer, oh a killer
That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer

Forever is for dreamers (for dreamers)
And it's foolish to not know you're a schemer
It's silly, I think of our unborn children
'Cause all I'm really thinking about right now 
Is how I'll never know them

And if you loved me
You'd never do this
Our future's battered and bloody
You're so fucking ruthless

That makes you a killer, a killer, oh a killer
That makes you a killer, a killer, oh a killer
That makes you a killer, a killer, a killer
That makes you a killer, that makes you a killer
