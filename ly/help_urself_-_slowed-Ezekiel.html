		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate you though

I hate you though
We gon' make this work through
Gone broke again off the dro'
Headaches when I'm coming home
When the suns out I'm gone
Mistakes on someone
Getting tired of being had
They're getting tired of me being sad
Bottom of the lake in a bag
I feel it's time now, any day
Been a while since I felt this way
Under skin and the flesh decay
'Bout time someone took my place
And it's time I met myself
It's a broke life in a cell
Stay in don't help yourself
