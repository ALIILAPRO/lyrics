		  Welcome to the twenty-seconnd century

Welcome to the twenty-seconnd century

Welcome to the twenty-seconnd century 
Who who whoo who, who who whoo who
Welcome to the twenty-seconnd century 
Who who whoo who, who who whoo who
Welcome to the twenty-seconnd century 
Who who whoo who, who who whoo who 
Everybody's dancing cing cing 
Everybody's dancing dancing cing cing
