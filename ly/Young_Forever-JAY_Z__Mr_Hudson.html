		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's dance in style
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young

So we live a life like a video
When the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold
And the music is always good
And the pretty girls just happened to stop by in the hood
And they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today
'Cause there is no tomorrow
Just some picture perfect day
To last a whole lifetime
And it never ends
'Cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed
Drink some wine,
Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark that can't erase neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut
I'll be fine
I'm forever young

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Fear not when, fear not why
Fear not much while were alive
Life is for living not living up tight
See ya somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye
So not for legends, I'm forever young
My name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves
Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here
Shorty, the nigga from here
With a little ambition just what we can become here
And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears
Younger kid, younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever and ever
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever

Slamming Bentley doors
Hopping out of Porsche's
Popping up on Forbes lists
Gorgeous
Hold up
Niggas thought I lost it
They be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit
They nauseous
Hold up
I'll be here forever
You know, I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't waiting for closure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars
Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet
I'm painting you a portrait of young

Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever young
Forever young I wanna be
Forever young
Do you really want to live forever?
Forever, forever young
Forever and ever
