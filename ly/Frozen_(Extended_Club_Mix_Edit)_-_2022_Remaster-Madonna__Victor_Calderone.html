		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be? You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret. You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mm, hmm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, hmm
We'd never be apart
Mm, hmm
Give yourself to me
Mm, hmm
You hold
The key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same, if I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die, you're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mm, hmm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, hmm
We'd never be apart
Mm, hmm
Give yourself to me
Mm, hmm
You hold
The key

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be? You're frozen
When your heart's not open

Mm, hmm
If I could melt your heart
Mm, hmm
We'd never be apart
Mm, hmm
Give yourself to me
Mm, hmm
You hold the key (mm, hmm)

If I could melt your heart
Mm, hmm
We'd never be apart
Mm, hmm
Give yourself to me
Mm, hmm
You hold
The key
If I could melt your heart
