		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot, hot (hot)
Baby, your love is so hot, hot (hot)

Pull up, she been purring like a kitten
Cravin' your love
I've been counting on the days you been gone
A little too long, patient
Knowing exactly what it is
It lasts, time, and now
When you, come and lay between it this time
Take the ice cube (boy, you know what)
Sit it right below my navel
And watch what I do
And that's my favorite angle
My legs are numb now
Your loving be giving me chills

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot (hot)
Baby, your love is so hot hot (hot)

Uh, ice ice, baby
Shake that ass just like dice, baby
You hot, and I'm Tunechi
I beat that cat, animal cruelty
I'm colder than your man
He should be your ex
Now throw that ass back like we playing pitch and catch, fuckin' right
And all your hear is what's my name, this your pussy
Sweet tooth roll tussy
If you are what you eat I'm so pussy
I'm skating on thin ice
I put in her windpipe, we do it 'til we both exhausted
Twin pipes, pillow under her stomach
The other pillow she bite
Would you like anything?
'Cause I'll do anything you like
Um, I make her freeze up
Pick her knees up, she want a maid nigga
Watch me clean up, I know where to put it
I put it in her life
I leave that pussy smoking
Smoking like ice

You're like ice (Tunechi)
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me (young moula, baby), you're so hot, hot (hot)
Baby, your love is so hot, hot (hot)

You put the pillow (right there)
Underneath my back
Got me up against the window (right now)
We ain't got no shame, we going in
He hates it when I use my hands
He got me saying, "Damn, my man knows what he's doin'"

The mirrors, the mirrors
Up on the ceiling, got things so visual, so visual
And babe, I ain't never felt so right, yeah
Here comes again, my body going numb
Hot as ice, can't get enough

You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot, hot (hot)
Baby, your love is so hot, hot (hot)
You're like ice
