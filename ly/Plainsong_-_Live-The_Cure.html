		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain," you said
"And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world," you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second

"I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain," you said
"And it's all running out like it's the end of the world," you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second

Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
"It's just the way I smile," you said
