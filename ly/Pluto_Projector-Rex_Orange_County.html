		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The great protector
Is that what I'm supposed to be?
What if all this counts for nothin'
Everything I thought I'd be?
What if by the time I realize
It's too far behind to see?
Seventy mil' projector
I can show you everything, yeah
And we're on our way to glory
Where the show won't ever end
And the encore lasts forever
And it's time we're due to spend

Spendin' the years together
Growing older every day
I feel at home when I'm around you
And I'll gladly say again
I hope the encore lasts forever
Now there's time for us to spend
And it's sublime with you, my friend
This right here still feels like the honeymoon
When you say my name, nothing's changed
I'm still a boy inside my thoughts
Am I meant to understand my faults?

I don't think so
I don't think I'm meant to understand myself
Maybe you do, and that's good for you
And maybe in time, maybe one day
I'll do the same

I'll do the same
I'll do the same
I'll do the same

I'll do the same as you, I'll try and hold it up
Soon I hope, or as soon as I'm old enough
(Old enough to understand)
(Old enough to understand)

Stay forever
You know more than anyone, yeah, whoa
And it's you that knows my darkness
And you know my bedroom needs
You could blast me and my secrets
But there's probably just no need
