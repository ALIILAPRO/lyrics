		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Now my love is locked inside)

(Verse)

Now it’s done will I ever find another one?
With a knife in my back I am holding on
And everything that we once were fighting for
Is burned up, all gone and I’m on the floor

We used to kick it in the summers at my pops place
You made me red velvet cake at my birthday
I still go down to our place and it still hurts
I wonder if you still got my Mayday Parade merch

 

(Pre)

I wonder could we ever get it back
I don’t know, no, I don’t know
Would everything be better if we tried?
I don’t know now, fuck if I know now

(Chorus)

And I don’t know where I am now
After all this time, yeah, I've
lost all sort of control that
Well, I thought I had back when

We walked down by the pier where you ended
Everything I thought I believed in
Guess the sun is just as deceiving

And I could never say goodbye
Now my love is locked inside

 

(Verse)

Now I’ve moved all the way to the other side
I wake up in the morning, got me a life
And yeah, I try to be happy but I’m hella tired
Nowadays I’m just hoping I’mma be alright

You know I still run up to that hilltop
To see the view of the place where we grew up
It’s messed up cus they building like a city
On the fields where we used to kiss, pretty

(Pre)

I wonder could we ever get it back
I don’t know, no, I don’t know
Would everything be better if we tried?
I don’t know now, fuck if I know now

(Chorus)

And I don’t know where I am now
After all this time, yeah, I've
lost all sort of control that
Well, I thought I had back when

We walked down by the pier where you ended
Everything I thought I believed in
Guess the sun is just as deceiving

And I could never say goodbye
Now my love is locked inside
