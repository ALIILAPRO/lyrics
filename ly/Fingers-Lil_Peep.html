		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyone hates me, but nobody knows me
Where did the time go, could somebody show me?
Get in and ride slow, you know where I'm going
Back at the club girl, your feelings are showing
How can I not stare, the way that you're glowing
I am your nightmare, you don't wanna know me
Running my fingers through your hair makes me remember everything
Why don't you hate me?

I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here
I'm not gonna last long
I will be right here
I'll buy you a flight here
I'll give you a night here
We gotta move on

Everyone hates me, but nobody knows me
Where did the time go, could somebody show me?
Get in and ride slow, you know where I'm going
Back at the club girl, your feelings are showing
How can I not stare, the way that you're glowing
I am your nightmare, you don't wanna know me
Running my fingers through your hair makes me remember everything
Why don't you hate me?
Why don't you hate me?

I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here
I'm not gonna last long
I'll be the first there
And I'll be the last there
I'm not gonna last here
I'm not gonna last long
