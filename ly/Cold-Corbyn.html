		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You found me in the lost again
I'm broken but you're in my head
I know it's hard to let me in
All the fire but you're in my bed
And I don't know if it's wrong or right
But you met me at the strangest time
Can we make it through the other side
After all I'm sure that you'll decide
And I know you hated all the silent nights
Maybe I was selfish not too dignified
But I couldn't say couldn't say couldn't say
Everything I tried so hard to hide

Cuz I didn't have the heart to tell you what I've been going through
And I didn't have the fucking heart to take you to a place that's been so blue
I couldn't tell you why
Why
I lie
Lie

Everyday was something new and the further I kept falling down
If something so beautiful can turn on me
Then what would stop the bleeding right now
So I know you going to hate this fucking part
But I needed to find myself in something else so I
Wouldn't break apart
And I never thought I'd see you again

Cuz I didn't have the heart to tell you what I've been going through
And I didn't have the fucking heart to take you to a place that's been so blue
I couldn't tell you why
Why
I lie
Lie

So go ahead and tell me everything you want
I'll be just fine
I can hardly put together all the pieces
But give me the sign
Yeah I'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be in just to what you want to say
I'll figure it out
I'll figure it out
You deserve to know before I break

Cuz I didn't have the heart to tell you what I've been going through
And I didn't have the fucking heart to take you to a place that's been so blue
I couldn't tell you why
Why
I lie
Lie
