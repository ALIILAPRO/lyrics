		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born to love
To feel that touch
I was born to love
Fill up my heart
I was born to love
To feel that touch
Give the whole of my heart
I was born to love
Can't get enough
Never too much
Come fill up my heart
I was born to

I was born to
I was born to

You know how to set me free
You were born to love like me
We were born to love
We were born to
You know how to set me free
You were born to love like me
We were born to love
We were born to

Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
I was born to

I was born to love
To feel that touch
Give the whole of my heart
I was born to love
Can't get enough
Never too much
Come fill up my heart
I was born to

You know how to set me free
You were born to love like me
We were born to love
We were born to
You know how to set me free
You were born to love like me
We were born to love
We were born to

You know how to set me free
You know how to set me free
You know how to set me free
You know how to set me free
Set me free, set me free
We were born to
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free
I was born to
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free
Set me free, set me free

I was born to
