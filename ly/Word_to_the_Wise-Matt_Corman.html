		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (yeah)
I just tripled last month in this whole week
(You know exactly what it is and you know)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
(And you know exactly what it isn't, boy)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
(Little bitch, keep talkin')
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me
I just tripled last month in this whole week
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me (yeah)
I ain't grow up in the hood ain't no thug life (whoa)
But I grew up by the beach racin' dirt-bikes
Had a couple of my friends lose their damn life
Why I look into the mirror every single night (whoa)
Am I livin' for myself, or am I livin' for you?
Started livin' every day, and now I do what I do
I'm pursuin' everythin' I always wanted to do
Doesn't start with anybody, man, it's startin' with you (yeah)
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep (yeah)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me (ayy)
Word to the wise, I just popped, but I'm okay ('kay)
This month, 10K in the damn bank (bank)
Self-employed lil' bitch, now I do this shit
Full-time, wonder how the fuck I got this lit
Young boy, shit, I ain't even 25 (five)
24 and you ain't never met another guy (yeah)
I quit my job last month to pursue this biz
Big risk, big balls, bitch I run this shit, yeah
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me
I just tripled last month in this whole week (aight)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Shorty kissin' on my neck like she know me
Fuck boy, I don't wanna be your homie
Shorty comin' to the crib, wanna blow me
Wanna see that ass in person? Come and show me
Word to the wise, comin' outside
Say I want a taste as I'm kissin' on her thighs
Put it on my face, I might give that ass a ride
Send me pictures wearin' lace, call an Uber, up in five, bitch, yeah
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (aight)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (yeah)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (yeah)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (kn-kn-know)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (aight)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (yeah)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (yeah)
Shorty kissin' on my neck, say she know me (ayy)
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me
Word to the wise, I'ma G, you don't know me (aight)
I just tripled last month in this whole week (yeah)
Double time, 06 in an old Jeep
Shorty kissin' on my neck, says she know me (yeah)
