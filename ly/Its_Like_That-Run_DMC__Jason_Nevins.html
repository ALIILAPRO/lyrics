		  Then it goes a little something like this

Unemployment at a record high
People coming, people going, people born to die
Don't ask me, because I don't know why
But it's like that, and that's the way it is

People in the world try to make ends meet
You try to ride car, train, bus, or feet
I said you got to work hard to want to compete
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Huh!

Money is the key to end all your woes
Your ups and your downs, your highs and your lows
Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes?
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Bills fly higher every day
We receive much lower pay
I'd rather stay young, go out and play
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Huh!

War's going on across the sea
Street soldiers killing the elderly
What ever happened to unity?
It's like that, and that that's the way it is

Disillusion is the word
That's used by me when I'm not heard
I just go through life with my glasses blurred
It's like that, and that's the way it is

Huh!

You can see a lot in this lifespan
Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
You notice one time he was your man
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade
But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
It's like that, and that's the way it is
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like

Run DMC and Jam Master Jay, run
It's Run DMC and Jam Master Jay, run
It's Run DMC and Jam Master Jay, run

One thing I know is that life is short
So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is
If you really think about it times aren't that bad
The one that flexes with successes will make you glad
Stop playing, start praying, you won't be sad
It's like that (what?) and that's the way it is

Huh!

You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
You know it's like that, and that's the way it is
Because it's like that, and that's the way it is
