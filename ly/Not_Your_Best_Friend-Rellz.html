		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your mine
Your mine
Your mine

Lost in your eyes
Your hips dont lie
I keep having these flashbacks, wanna see you again, gotta see you again

You like to link when the lights getting low
Tucked to yourself, so nobody gotta know

Can't tell your girlfriends bout me
Cause you wanna be more sure

That I'll be here, to the very end
You don't want embarrassment
Last man you were wit', had you sufferin'

That is not part of my plan
Gonna' graduate
Take you on some better dates

Make sure that I show you off
Bring you to a better place, yea

I'm not your best friend
I'm the one you call to get to get mixy
Get away from the function and go missing
You cant act like you don't know what the deal is, 
Do you know the difference?

I am not your best friend
I'm the one you gon' wanna have some kids with
Grab me up, make a movie in the kitchen
This ain't lust, this is something you can build with
Something you can live with, yea

Your mine, I'm yours
Your mine, I'm yours

Your mine, I'm yours
Your mine, I'm yours

Your mine, I'm yours
Your mine, I'm yours

Your mine, I'm yours
Your mine


What I'm insuatin'
Is that I'm the one you want
No need to keep waitin'
We both know that this more than just the love we makin'
This is destined, we got a connection
Nothing you should mess with, yea

You shouldn't feel like keeping my face on the low
I swear I can't wait to let bout' everyone know
That I got me a little angel at home,that I'm feigning to show
I want my people to know


I'm not your best friend
I'm the one you call to get to get mixy
Get away from the function and go missing
You cant act like you don't know what the deal is, 
Do you know the difference?

I am not your best friend
I'm the one you gon' wanna have some kids with
Grab me up, make a movie in the kitchen
This ain't lust, this is something you can build with
Something you can live with, yea
