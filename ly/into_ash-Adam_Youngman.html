		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember
The night
When it all
Burned down
And the words
From your mouth
That just seared
Through my ground
That we built
With our hands
Through the years
And our plans
As I watched
It all crumble
And wither away
Into ash
Into ash
Into ash
And I tried
To rebuild
With the rubble
And dust
Stack them up
One by one
As you pushed
Them all down
And I'm here
On my knees
Still
Wondering why
I
Wasted our time
Just
Pretending it's fine
When it's not
It's not
Oh it's not
