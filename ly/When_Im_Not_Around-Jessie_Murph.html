		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't sleep, I've been up all night, you didn't miss me
Maybe that's the truth or just what I think
Truth is, you don't give a fuck what I think

I'm lonely, You're out with your friends drinking Bacardi
Probably with those girls who talk about me
Truth is, you don't give a fuck about me
You're not sorry
All you ever wanna do is hurt me
You don't really know how much your words mean
They cut me

Say I'm the only one you need right now
Say you can't live without me now
Not what you're saying when I'm not around
Not around
Not around

Think it's funny how you tune me out
When I'm crying, when I need you now
Say you love me and I love the sound
Not what you're saying when I'm not around
Not what you're saying when I'm not around

So insecure, you're the one who's gotta cheat
Call me a whore, you should think before you speak
I always knew you had a thing for fire
But I ain't finna let you burn me twice
There's nothing like gasoline
Running down my face like tear stains
Everything I felt going down in flames
Can't take back your mistakes

Say I'm the only one you need right now
Say you can't live without me now
Not what you're saying when I'm not around
Not around
Not around

Think it's funny how you tune me out
When I'm crying when I need you now
Say you love me and I love the sound
Not what you're saying when I'm not around
Not what you're saying when I'm not around

Say I'm the only one you need right now
Say you can't live without me now
Not what you're saying when I'm not around 
Not around
Not around

Think it's funny how you tune me out
When I'm crying when I need you now
Say you love me and I love the sound
Not what you're saying when I'm not around
Not what you're saying when I'm not around
