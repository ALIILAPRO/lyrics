		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Four, five shots, do the running man, uh
Running to the bag like a businessman, uh
Got a fake ID, I'm another man, uh
W W Wild West pistol like I'm Dirty Dan, uh
Y-Y-You not making money
What's your business plan? Uh
On the internet, uh, need a middleman, uh
Got a south side shooter
If he listened to your music
He gon' say, "That shit is trash
So are you better yet?" Uh

She got scared, she saw my gun
I can't fuck no fucking ho
You a actor, that's for sure
Speed dial always calling, hello
Speed dial always calling my phone
Think I'm dumb, but I'm not slow
You done switched up on his bro
We gon' have to take his soul
Been there, had to take it slow
Never made to lose control
They say twiki' on a roll
I think that I cracked the code
Bitches want my serial
Like, are you serious? He think he the shit
Somebody tell him he gon' wanna flush

I'm like take it, take it, take it
I'ma take it 'til I'm famous, famous, famous
Yeah, I'ma take it, I'll
Replace it, 'place it, 'place it
I'll replace it 'til I make it, make it
Make it

I I got my ice from my jeweler
That shit is so cold
I don't think I can cool it no more
Like, why is you spreading those rumors?
You spreadin' those rumors each time when
I go to the store
A blessing, every time I buy
Every so often, I spend some more
That money go dumb, but I got so much
Hotel lifestyle, can't be poor

I might just take over the
World just like Giygas (Tss)
You don't like it
I might be biased, but you might not like it
(Like it)
I might just buy it, this new car, I drive it
(Drive, yeah)
I'm movin', I pivot, I jump all these divots
I count all my digit's, I count it so fast
Wait, you got a lot of cash
Wait, you got a lot of cash (yeah)
Dash, dash, dash
I just be movin' like so fast
I hope that I don't crash (Bitch)
Bet that I don't last
They see I'm famous (Okay)
They want it bad (Need it bad)
Right now they're nameless (Hey)
I make 'em mad, mad (Achoo)
Rappin' 'bout money, I'm rappin' 'bout mine
Mind over matter, yeah, I ain't got time
(yeah)
Reach to the nine for my peace of mind
A piece of me is a piece of you
Electricity like Pikachu (Ahh)
Got double V's, it's a W (yeah)
You still wanna PvP? (Damn) i pity you

She wan' take a pic', yeah
You act like a bitch, yeah
Maybe you's a bitch, yeah
You think I'm a dickhead
If I really gotta make a bag, I got a trick
Yeah that shit in my sleeve, yeah
Tell me, did he leave? yeah
Okay, like oh, for sure i got another code
Like, what's a sound for soul?
You know you did the most
Oh, I know you like to boast
You did that shit for show
Well, was it worth it, bro?
You think you're perfect, no

I seen 'em hate when I was down
They never thought that I would blow
Up and get them racks (On gang)
Wake up, get myâ€• parapapapapapapa
Paparapapapapapa paraapapapapapa
(I just wanna fuckin' die)
