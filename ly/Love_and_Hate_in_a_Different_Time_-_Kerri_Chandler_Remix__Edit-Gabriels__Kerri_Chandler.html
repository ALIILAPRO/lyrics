		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last few years that I have seen
Walking dead all around me
Silent fears, neatly folded dreams
Catacombs, Black Sea surrounding
Catacombs, Black Sea surrounding

Even in the valley
The rod and staff they comfort me
It's rushing through my veins
Moving faster than a hurricane
Moving faster than a hurricane

We lost it in the fire
Love and hate in a different time
We lost it in the fire
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine

Rapture comes, the angels sing
Neon signs above integrity
See the judge, but where's the Jury?
Primal screams, whisper silently
Primal screams, whisper silently

Even in the valley
Children smile through the misery
Diamond tears hide the casualties
Grace and mercy, do you follow me?
Grace and mercy, can you hear me?

We lost it in the fire
Love and hate in a different time
We lost it in the fire
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine

We lost it in the fire
Love and hate in a different time
We lost it in the fire
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine

What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine
What I did

What I did to make you mine
We lost it in the fire
Love and hate in a different time
We lost it in the fire
What I did to make you mine
What I did to make you mine
