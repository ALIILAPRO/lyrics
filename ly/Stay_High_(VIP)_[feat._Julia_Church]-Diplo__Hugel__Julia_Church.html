		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh

Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, oh
Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, oh
Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay

Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain, oh
Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Gotta stay high all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
High all the time
To keep you off my mind

You're gone and I gotta stay

Stayin' in my play pretend, where the fun ain't got no end, oh
Can't go home alone again, need someone to numb the pain
