		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A change of scenes, a change of style.
A change of hopes, with no regrets,
A chance to watch, admire the distance,
Still occupied, though you forget.
Different colors, different shades,
Over each mistakes were made.
I took the blame.
Directionless so plain to see,
A loaded gun won't set you free.
So you say

We'll share a drink and step outside,
An angry voice and one who cried,
I gave you everything and more,
The strain's too much, can't take much more
I've walked on water, run through fire,
Can't seem to feel it anymore.
Because we're, yay
Hoping for something more,
Hoping for something else
We're, yay
You seeing me this way,
You're hoping for something more
When our love goes wrong
