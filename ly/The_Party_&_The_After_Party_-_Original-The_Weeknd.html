		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I understand, your body wants it
I know your thoughts, oh you 'bout it, 'bout it
You're a big girl and it's your world
And I'ma let you do it how you wanna
Girl, now ride wit' it, ride wit' it
I know you know, I know you wanna (ride) wit' it
Don't be shy wit' it, I'll supply wit' it
I got you, girl, oh, I got it, girl

With your Louis V bag, tats on your arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby, don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the parties (oh, oh)
To pluck the feathers off all the birds (oh)
You always come to the parties (ride, ride)
On your knees
I will not beg you, please

Girl, pick up them shoes, I'll race your ass up all them stairs
Just grab a room I swear no one will interfere
Girl, bring your friends if you want we can share
Or we can keep it simple baby we can just
Ride wit' it, ride wit' it
I know you know, I know you wanna, wit' it
Don't be shy wit' it, I'll supply wit' it
I gotchu, girl, oh, I got it, girl

With your Louis V bag, tats on your arms
High heel shoes make you six feet tall
Everybody wants you, you can have them all
But I got what you need
Girl I got your bag, I got it all
Hold your drink baby, don't you fall
Be there in a minute baby just one call
You don't gotta ask me

You always come to the parties (oh)
To pluck the feathers off all the birds
You always come to the parties
On your knees
I will not beg you, please
I will not (I will not)

Ride wit' it, ride wit' it
I know you know
I know you wanna line wit' it
Don't be shy wit' it
I'll supply wit' it
I got you girl
Oh, I got it girl
Won't you line wit' it? Line wit' it
I know you know
I know you wanna (wanna)
Ooh (ooh)
Ooh-whoa (whoa-ooh)
I got you girl
Oh, I got you girl
Oh, oh, oh, oh (ohh-ooh)
Oh, I got it girl (oh)
Oh, I got it girl (oh)
Oh, oh

I think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet 
I'll get on it after four more 
Sessions of the strong on your floor
Shoulda fuckin' rolled, but I fuckin' pulled
Feelin' like a billion bucks before 
I walked through this door
When I walked through your door
Can't believe I made it
But I made it that's for sure
For sure
Your lovin'
I need more
I need yours
She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on?
They want what I'm sittin' on
They don't want my love
They just want my potential
Fuck it
I'll be sippin' on this, baby livin' off bliss
Got me drownin' in your love
Got me drownin' in the mist
Gimme right attention
Or I'll start drownin' from my wrist

Baby, if you knew
The feelin' I would give to you
Oh you, you
Oh you
'Cause I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me, with me
Whoa you
Oh you
Whoa you
Oh you
Oh I got it girl
Oh I got it girl
With me, with me

I got a brand new girl
Call her Rudolph
She'll probably OD before I show her to momma
All these girls try to tell me she got no love
But all these girls never ever got her blow job
Ringtone on silent
And if she stops, then I might get violent
No call is worth stoppin'
So, momma please stop callin'
We can play all night
It just takes one night
To let me fuckin' prove
This feelin' I'ma give to you

Oh you, you
Whoa you
Oh I got it girl
Yeah, I got it girl
With me, with me, with you
Oh you
Oh you
Oh you
Oh I got it girl
Yeah, I got it girl
With me, with me
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh I got it girl
