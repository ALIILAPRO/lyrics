		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brooklyn, uh, uh, uh, uh
Huh, huh, uh-huh, do it, yeah, do it now, come on
Uh, uh, uh, uh, what y'all want? Uh

Rollin', gold two seater
Stash in the dash hold two heaters
Blocka put holes through beaters
Ghetto Fab stroll through Cheetahs
Ballin', Brooklyn don
Addicted to Cris' hooked on Dom
50 G's, hook and song
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs
Hustlin', guys that send Po's
'Cause I chop rocks the size of Mentos
Blame me, I charge the hen hoes
Look at the hurt your eyes will squint close
Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Now listen to the two way alert
It goes
Let's go V.I.P., boo, raise your skirt

Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)

I'm gangsta
Y'all just wannabe's
Federal agents on their P's
30 a gram, 28 on the keys
Got a good lawyer, I'm gonna squeeze
Thuggin', jeans and Tim's
Fitted to the front lean the brim
Ride but never on teenage rims
And I keep a chick's face between limbs
Stylin' y'all heard about my kick game
I'm on the parquet, you see me at the Knick game
Probably seen this tatted on your chick frame
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Ridin' y'all know as well I do
That's the way you can tell I flew
So I got a deal, I sell pies too
'Cause before I hit the pens I'm gettin' bailed by Clue

Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)

Cruisin', top on the 'Cedes low
Turn us up when you hear this on the radio
Blastin' with the nineteen eighty flow
Make the necks on the ladies go
Holla that's what a pretty thug will do
Hit Branson, get a fifty jug or two
Y'all throwin' on them gritty mugs for who?
Like y'all don't know what fifty slugs will do
Hatin' I just bought the Uz'
I put y'all in them front page articles
I got 'em lookin' at the Billboard charts confused
And I still freestyle to start the Clue's
Reppin' I'm that kid who 'bout the dough
I done copped coke and started droughts before
Shit platinum out the door
Now I drop the top down just to shout to hoes

Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back (wooo-wooo)
Holla back young'n (wooo-wooo)
Holla back, back, back, back
(Wooo-wooo)
(Wooo-wooo)
(Wooo-wooo)
(Wooo-wooo)

Uh
Yeah
Yeah
(Wooo-wooo)
