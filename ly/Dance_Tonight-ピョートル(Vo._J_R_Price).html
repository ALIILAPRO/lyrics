		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strolling around the town without you lately
World seems to have some vacancy
You will not, answer my calls tonight, tonight
Miles separating us you're still with me, might be only in my dreams
What on earth have I done to you baby, baby

When the night falls, I wanna dance with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance, dance dance

When the night falls, feel like dancing with somebody
When the night falls, feel like dancing with somebody
When the night falls, feel like dancing with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance-dance-dance

Alone in my room, I still think of you,
I need a distraction, take away my mood, these blues

Music makes me, I wanna dance with somebody
Music makes me, I wanna dance with somebody
Music makes me, I wanna dance with somebody
Music makes me, I wanna dance dance dance

Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
Music makes me, I wanna dance, dance dance

When the night falls, I wanna dance with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance with somebody
When the night falls, I wanna dance-dance-dance

Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
Music makes me feel like dancing with somebody
