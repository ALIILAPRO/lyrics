		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silicone, saline, poison inject me
Baby, I'm a free bitch, I'm a free bitch

Some girls won't dance to the beat of the track
She won't walk away but she won't look back
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a mess
She's a mess she's a mess
Now the girl is stressed
She's a mess she's a mess
She's a mess she's a mess (Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)

Run, run her kiss is a vampire grin
The moon lights her way while she's howlin' at him
She looks good but her boyfriend says she's a tramp
She's a tramp she's a vamp
But she still does her dance
She's a tramp she's a vamp
But she still kills the dance
(Tell 'em, girls)

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin' she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)
Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance, dance in the dark (Tell 'em, girls)

In the dark she loves to dance in the dark
In the dark she loves, she loves to dance in the dark

Marilyn, Judy, Sylvia
Tell 'em how you feel girls!

Work your blond (Jean) Benet Ramsey
We'll haunt like Liberace
Find your freedom in the music
Find your Jesus, find your Kubrick
You will never fall apart
Diana, you're still in our hearts
Never let you fall apart
Together we'll dance in the dark

Baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark
Baby, baby loves to dance in the dark
'Cause when he's lookin', she falls apart
Baby loves to dance in the dark in the dark
