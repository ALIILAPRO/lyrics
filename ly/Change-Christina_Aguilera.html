		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was young I would look in the mirror
Didn't know it then but now it couldn't be clearer
That I remember being filled with such wonder
Before learning that the world can be harsher

Ooh, ooh
Who you love or the colour of your skin
Or the place that you were born and grew up in
Shouldn't decide how you will be treated
'Cause we're all the same when everybody's breathing

Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
Waiting for hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change
Change, change

For all the brave and the souls who went before us
Stand tall, then proudly lift your voices
Let 'em know who we are and our choices
And one day we won't have to sing this chorus

Waiting for a change to set us free
Waiting for the day when you can be you and I can be me
Waiting for hope to come around
Waiting for the day when hate is lost and love is found
Waiting for a change, waiting for a change
Change (oh), change (hold on)
Waiting for a change, change

When I was young I would look in the mirror
Didn't see it then but now it couldn't be clearer
