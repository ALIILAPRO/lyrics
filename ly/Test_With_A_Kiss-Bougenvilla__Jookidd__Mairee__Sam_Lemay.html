		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a plan, it's the worst one ever
Yeah, I've got a plan, I know I should know better
You can call me crazy, but I think we should be together
I've got a plan

Shall we test with a kiss to find out if our lips fit together?
Test with a kiss to find out if our walls will shatter
Shall we test with a kiss to find out if our lips stay together?
Test with a kiss to find out if our walls will shatter
Maybe we'll find out

Maybe we'll find out
Maybe we'll find out

I've got a plan, it's the worst one ever
Yeah, I've got a plan, I know I should know better
You can call me crazy, but I think we should be together
I've got a plan

Shall we test with a kiss to find out if our lips fit together?
Test with a kiss to find out if our walls will shatter
Shall we test with a kiss to find out if our lips stay together?
Test with a kiss to find out if our walls will shatter
Maybe we'll find out
Maybe we'll find out

Shall we test with a kiss to find out if our lips fit together?
Test with a kiss to find out if our walls will shatter
Find out
