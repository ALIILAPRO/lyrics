		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby sneezes
Mummy pleases
Daddy breezes in
So good on paper
So romantic
But so bewildering

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

You pay the grocer
You fix the toaster
Kiss the host good-bye
Then you break a window
Burn the souffl√©? 
Scream the lullaby

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It's coming around again
So don't mind if I fall apart
There's more room in a broken heart

And I believe in love
But what else can I do
I'm so in love with you

I know nothing stays the same
But if you're willing to play the game
It will be coming around again

Baby sneezes (I believe in love)
Mummy pleases (I believe in love)
Daddy breezes in (I believe in love)

I know nothing stays the same (I believe in love)
But if you're willing to play the game (I believe in love)
It will be coming around again (I believe in love)

I do believe 
I do believe (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)
I believe in love (I believe in love)

Coming around again
Coming around again
Nothing stays the same (I believe in love)
But if you're willing to play the game (I believe in love)
It will be coming around again (I believe in love)

Oh, I believe in love (I believe in love)
Oh, I believe in love (I believe in love)
And it's coming around again (I believe in love)
