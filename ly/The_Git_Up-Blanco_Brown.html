		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right now
I just need you to get real loose
Get comfortable
Grab your loved ones or grab your love partner
And if you're by yourself no worries
Just follow after me

Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back put your hips in it (whoo, whoo, whoo) let's have some fun

To the left, to the left now (to the left, to the left)
To the right to the right (to the right)
Now take your left hand and put it on your side (put it on your side)
Go on, roll your shoulders (roll your shoulders)
Do the slip and slide (do the slip and slide)
This next part's my favorite part 'cause its time to shine

Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back put your hips in it (it's simple, you can do it)

Slide to the left, slide to the right
Now cool down, have a good time
Slide to the left, slide to the right
Do the butterfly and have a good time
'Round, 'round, 'round and 'round you go
It's time to show out right now and take it to the floor

Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back put your hips in it (whoo, whoo, whoo)

(To the left)
Take it down now, take it, take it down now
Take it down now, take it, take it down now
(To the right)
Bring it up now, bring it, bring it up now
Bring it up now, bring it, bring it up now
(To the front)
Take it down and crisscross
Bring it up now crisscross
(To the back)
Do whatever you like right here (get down)
Just have fun

Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back put your hips in it (whoo, whoo, whoo)

Uh, that was not so bad, that was that, that was not so bad, was it? (hey)
That was not so bad, that-that, that was not so bad, was it?
That was not so bad, that was-that was not so bad, was it? (hey)
That was not so bad, that was not so bad, was it?

Gon' and do the 2 step then cowboy boogie
Grab your sweetheart and spin out with 'em
Do the hoedown and get into it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
Take it to the left now and dip with it
Gon' throw down, take a sip with it
Now lean back put your hips in it (whoo, whoo, whoo)
