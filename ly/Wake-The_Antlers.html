		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With the door closed, shades drawn, the world shrinks
Let's open up those blinds
But someone has to sweep the floor
Pick up her dirty clothes
That job's not mine
Now that everyone's an enemy, my heart sinks
Let's put away those claws
I don't blame them for their curtains-calls
Because I pulled the rope
I want to call them back out for applause

Spring and Thompson on the first of May is horrible
We hid in catacombs
So now I'm sleeping next to mousetraps
In a bed of all our clothes
While I hope that she won't come home
It was easier to lock the doors and kill the phones
Than to show my skin
Because the hardest thing
Is never to repent for someone else
It's letting people in

Well you can come inside
Unlock the door, take off your shoes
But this might take all night
To explain to you I would have walked out those sliding doors
But the timing never seemed right
When your helicopter came and tried to lift me out
I put its rope around my neck
And after that you didn't bother with the airlift or the rescue
You knew just what to expect

That with the door closed, shades drawn
We're dead enough
They don't open from outside
And someone has to speak with their teeth behind their tongue
To never let that right be denied
We can't rely on photographs and visitation time
But I just don't know where to begin
I want to bust down the door
If you're willing to forgive
I've go the keys, I'm letting people in

Don't be scared to speak
Don't speak with someone's tooth
Don't bargain when you're weak
Don't take that sharp abuse
Some patients can't be saved
But that burden's not on you

Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
Don't ever let anyone tell you you deserve that
