		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me

Kinda sad that you always been like that
See me making waves and you don't like that
Driving through your puddles goin' splish splash
(Splish, splash, splish, splash)

Stressing over nothing, baby, relax
While you gettin' angry, I'ma kick back
Only thing I think about is big stacks
(Racks, racks)

Negative days, negative nights
Baby, you're wasting all your time

I can't relate, I keep it light
No, no, no drama in my life

Wake up, yeah
Makeup, maybe
I need you, nah
I been good lately
Blowin' up
Workin' busy

You ain't worth my love
If you only love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

You ain't worth my love 
If you only love to hate me

I'ma let you fade into the background
Baby, all my shows are gettin' too loud
Keep on turin' it up when you want me down (me down, me down, me down)

Negative days, negative nights
Baby, you're wasting all your time

I can't relate, I keep light
No, no, no drama in my life

Wake up, yeah
Makeup, maybe
I need you, nah
I been good lately
Blowin' up
Workin' busy

You ain't worth my love
If you only love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

You ain't worth my love 
If you only love to hate me

Love to hate me, you hate to love me
I'm takin back what you've taken from me
You're mistaken, honey, this something that
Remind me why I be alone, on my own
If I needed you, I'd have you that I know, hold up
I could do bad by myself, don't need help
One of a kind, the hand that I was dealt, like oh, well
Felt, Cupid was stupid, I should have knew it
'Cause I been through it, you wouldn't do it if it ain't foolish, stupid
(Stupid, stupid)

You ain't worth my love
If you only love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

You ain't worth my love 
If you only love to hate me

Love, l-l-love, l-l-love
How you love to hate me
Love, l-l-love, l-l-love

You ain't worth my love
If you only love to hate me
