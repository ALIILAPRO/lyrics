		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money, get away
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay
Money, it's a gas
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash
New car, caviar, four-star daydream
Think I'll buy me a football team

Money, get back
I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack
Money, it's a hit
Don't give me that do-goody-good bullshit
I'm in the high-fidelity first class traveling set
And I think I need a Lear jet

Money, it's a crime
Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie
Money, so they say
Is the root of all evil today
But if you ask for a rise it's no surprise
That they're giving none away
Away, away, away
Away, away, away

I was in the right
Yes, absolutely in the right
I certainly was in the right
I was definitely in the right, geezer was cruising for a bruising
Why does anyone do anything?
Yeah
Why does anyone do anything?
I don't know, I was really drunk at the time
I was just telling him it was in, he couldn't get into number two
He was asking why it wasn't coming up on fader eleven
So after our yelling and screaming
I'm telling him why it wasn't coming on fader eleven
