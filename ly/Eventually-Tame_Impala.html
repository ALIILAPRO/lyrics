		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If only there could be another way to do this
'Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah

Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life
You wouldn't have to change it

But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah

And I know just what I've got to do
And it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will too
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah
Eventually, ah
Eventually
Eventually
