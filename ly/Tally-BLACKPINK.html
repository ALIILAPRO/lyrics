		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I say, "Fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally, I do what I want with who I like
I ain't gon' conceal it
While you talkin' all that shit, I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine

Don't apologize for my behavior
If you're offended, I don't care
Starin' at me 'stead of starin' in the mirror
Little weird how

Everybody tells me to play nice
Everybody judge, but looking twice
But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though
And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so

I say, "Fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally, I do what I want with who I like
I ain't gon' conceal it
While you talkin' all that shit, I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine
Yeah, I say, "Fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally, I do what I want with who I like
And I ain't gon' conceal it
I'll just do it like the boys say, I'm gettin' mine, gettin' mine

Told me to play it cool, I break the rules
I'm breakin' hearts in two
Warned me to make the rules or play the fool
It ain't that hard to choose
Take apart the do's and don'ts
And lose the won'ts, I'm gettin' mine
Mines is mine, yours is mine
This is mine, get in line

Sometimes I like to go play dirty
Just like all of the fuckboys do
That's my choice and there's no one I'm hurting
But that's not girly

Everybody tells me to play nice
Everybody judge, but looking twice
But my body don't belong to, nah-uh-uh, none of them though
And I'm not gonna change 'cause you say so

I say, "Fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally, I do what I want with who I like
I ain't gon' conceal it
While you talkin' all that shit, I'll be gettin' mine, gettin' mine
Yeah, I say, "Fuck it" when I feel it
'Cause no one's keepin' tally, I do what I want with who I like
And I ain't gon' conceal it
I'll just do it like the boys say, I'm gettin' mine, gettin' mine

(Yeah, I say, "Fuck it" when I feel it)
(And I ain't gon' conceal it)
