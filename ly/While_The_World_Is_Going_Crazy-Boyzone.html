		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are  just the two of us 
Far away from the crazy rush 
And while the storm is raging 
It's safe and warm inside 
Close the door and forget about time 
Ease the river runnin' through your mind 
Lay your body next to me 
Let your secret's all be mine 
Take my hand and believe me 
That love will guide us through 
Anytime that you need me 
Girl I'll be there for you 

[Chorus]
While the world is going crazy 
While the sky is falling down 
One thing you can depend on 
I will always be around 
While the rain outside is pouring 
I will make the sun shine through 
While the world is going crazy 
You can count on me 
Cause I'll be loving you 
Cause I'll be loving you 

I turned on the news today 
But I don't want to hear a word they say 
Outside the world is breakin' down 
But we don't have a clue 
Like a scream in an empty room 
It's gettin' harder just to find the truth 
Let's forget it 'till the night is through 
It's all about me and you 

We can make our own heaven 
It's not so hard to find 
Cause girl I will protect you 
Until the end of time 

[Chorus]

It doesn't really matter 
If you win, lose or draw 
I will be your shelter 
I will catch you when you fall 
All you do is just trust in me 
I will keep you satisfied 
Close your eyes and enjoy the ride 

While the world is going crazy 
(crazy) 
While the sky is falling down 
(falling down) 
One thing you can depend on 
I will always be around 
(I'll be right there for ya baby) 
While the rain outside is pouring 
(pouring down) 
I will make the sun shine through 
While the world is going crazy 
You can count on me 
(you can count on me girl) 
Cause I'll be loving you 
(cause I'll be loving you) 
(cause I'll be loving you) 
I'll be loving you 
All you do is call 
I will catch you if you fall
