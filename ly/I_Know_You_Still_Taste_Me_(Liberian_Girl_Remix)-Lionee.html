		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
Peace of mind
Them girls gon' always
Want a piece of mine (Ohoh)
On the week-ends
She flies to Paris
Matter what's the season
She brings the season, oh 
Take her to the store
Paint on floors
These are cold
Said I don't listen
I, do the most
She said she want me to cuff her
It made me cough
I still cannot fold fold
Man can't propose
Think â€˜bout the team
I got reasons to go
Got me feeling 
Some feelings I never owned
Oh, you changed me girl
Yeah, you changed my world girl
Got this feeling 
Like I'm being disowned
Girl, don't leave
I want you here forever
It's just you in my brain
Let's stay together
Let's make love in the rain
Babe, I know you still taste me

[Chorus]
Liberian girl
You know that I 
Would always marry that girl (chcn)
Sumerian girl
She holds the secrets to the world
Yeah, to the world
Loved you whole seasons (Whole seasons)
Four seasons (Four seasons)
Now you curve (Now you curve)
When you used to serve
cnd I always assume the worst (Ouh)
I assume the worst (chan ahan)
She's an cmerican girl

[Verse 2]
Reasons to die, reasons to cry
Reasons to lie, reasons to try
cnd every time I'm thinking
I be thinking a lot
Thinking about the times
When we were just kicking it hot
cnd yeah, I need you to survive
Need you to arrive 
But when you left me behind
It came to no surprise
Wanna tell you that I understand
But it's too hard 
To see you with another man
cnd despite everything
You're still mine, girl I've seen
How you hide your desire
It's more than a fling 
Now you try to be mean
But I always know what I means
I know you still taste me

[Chorus]
Liberian girl
You know that I 
Would always marry that girl (chcn)
Sumerian girl
She holds the secrets to the world
Yeah, to the world
Loved you whole seasons (Whole seasons)
Four seasons (Four seasons)
Now you curve (Now you curve)
When you used to serve
cnd I always assume the worst (Ouh)
I assume the worst (chan ahan)
She's an cmerican girl
