		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes up and back against the wall
Who’s gonna catch me when I fall

Take back these bones that make me who I am
I’ll rise up and if need be I’ll fall again

My mind is a river
Sometimes flowing
Sometimes frozen

I got rid of the anchor
But I’m better off now
I will be my own saviour
Just still haven’t found how

Heading straight to the unknown
Cause there’s nowhere else to go

I’ve burnt the bridge
Now what’s it gonna be?
Ran away with the evidence
And watched the smoke from a distance
Thrown to the sea
I took the risk and i refuse to think
To think that it was all for nothing
Just another waking dream
And so I flee

From the ashes of my failed endeavours
I’ll raise an army from the dead
As one we’ll march and take over
And once it’s all done i’ll say

Take back
These bones that make me who I am
I’ll rise up
And if need be I’ll fall again
It’s always darkest before dawn
And for now it’s pitch black
So is the night coming to an end?

All the pain won’t be in vain

A glimpse of light
To lift me up
All hail the brand new day

I’ve burnt the bridge
Now what’s it gonna be?
Ran away with the evidence
And watch the smoke from a distance
Thrown to the sea
I took the risk and I refuse to think
To think that it was all for nothing
Just another waking dream
And so I flee
