		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you feel me shivering
In the corners of your heart?
Just a frozen memory
To remind you who we were
All this time I burned alive
'Til you found someone else
So every time you think of me
Can you feel me shivering?

So lost in your memory
Feels like an echo in the dark
You see what you wanna see
Fingertips wrapped around my heart
I know yours is the wandering kind
Cold blood when it opens and closes
I'm a sickness inside of your mind
And nothing can be when I'm frozen

Can you feel me shivering
In the corners of your heart?
Just a frozen memory
To remind you who we were
All this time I burned alive
'Til you found someone else
So every time you think of me
Can you feel me shivering?

Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
So every time you think of me
Can you feel me shivering?

Can you feel me shivering?

Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
Can you feel me shivering?
So every time you think of me
Can you feel me shivering?

Can you feel me shivering?

Can you feel me shivering?

I know, I know you're scared to see
Why we became a tragedy
I know, I know you're scared to see
Why we became a tragedy
I know, I know you're scared to see
Why we became a tragedy
I know, I know you're scared to see
Why we became a tragedy

So every time you think of me
Can you feel me shivering?

Can you feel me shivering
In the corners of your heart?
Just a frozen memory
To remind you who we were
All this time I burned alive
'Til you found someone else
So every time you think of me
Can you feel me shivering?

(Shivering, shivering, shivering, shivering)
(Shivering, shivering, shivering, shivering)
