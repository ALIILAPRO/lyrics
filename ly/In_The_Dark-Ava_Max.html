		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you only love me in the dark?
Why do you promise underneath the stars?
Our hearts will never, ever be apart
Only in the dark
Only in the dark, dark, dark

I can feel the heat across the bar
But you give me chills across my arms
Why do I always pick the wildest cards?
Oh why, oh why?

Always giving up my heart to break
So you're never gonna change your ways
Every time I tell you stay away
You keep calling, keep calling
Never out in the light of day
Tell me why I've never seen your face?
Every time you tell me I'm not safe
I keep falling into the

Twilight, exhilaration
You say I'm your inspiration
But baby, I'm so frustrated
The lights turn on, when I wake up you're gone

Why do you only love me in the dark?
Why do you promise underneath the stars?
Our hearts will never, ever be apart
Only in the dark
Only in the dark, dark, dark

Why do you only love me in the dark?
Why do you promise underneath the stars?
Our hearts will never, ever be apart
Only in the dark
Only in the dark, dark, dark

I step into your world
See inside out
But when the music stops
I'm upside down
Am I the only girl you dream about?
Just say you're mine, mine

In the twilight, exhilaration
You say I'm your inspiration
But baby, I'm so frustrated
The lights turn on, when I wake up you're gone

Why do you only love me in the dark?
Why do you promise underneath the stars?
Our hearts will never, ever be apart
Only in the dark
Only in the dark, dark, dark

Why do you only love me in the dark?
Why do you promise underneath the stars?
Our hearts will never, ever be apart
Only in the dark
Only in the dark, dark, dark
