		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know I miss my brother, yeah (aye)
You know I miss my brother, yeah 
Know I miss my brother, yeah
It's 5ive
Know I miss my brother, yeah (yeah, I'm in the studio)
Know I miss my brother, yeah (aye)
I know I miss my brother, yeah
Twin

Who I'm gone call when its time to ride? (When its time to ride) (aye)
Who gone pull up when its time to slide? (When its time) (aye)
Me and my brother we stick together no other
We blowing up like a bubble and we took over no other (aye)

Who I'm gone call when its time to ride? (When its time to ride) (aye)
Who gone pull up when its time to slide? (When its time) (aye)
Me and my brother we stick together no other
We blowing up like a bubble and we took over no other (aye)

Say this how I'm livin' (how you livin'?)
The pain in my eyes the hurt and the struggle (struggle) (aye)
Since I lost my brother (aye) now the family wanna huddle
But I can't say fuck, nah (nah)
We thinkin' we strong, we summin' like a muscle (muscle)
In the world, yeah, we gots each other (yeah)
Only thing I want in this world is my brother
They ask me I'm okay
Fuck no, I ain't okay
See my twin brother die in my face (he die right in my face, yeah)
Got a lot on my plate, never thought it would be this way
Never question God to this day
Lord, why you gotta take, why you gotta take my brother
I 'member them nights we was thuggin'
Just me and my brother, robbin' 'cause we ain't had nuttin'
Know we had to get some money
'Member robbin' niggas for they tool
Brother asking, "what you wanna do?"
I said, "fuck it, I'ma ride with you"
We wash them niggas, we gone play it cool
Spot 'em got 'em and I get on his ass
Me and my brother, yeah we thicker than glass?
I miss my nigga, yeah I 'member them last
Call my brother, he gone get on yo ass

Who I'm gone call when its time to ride? (When its time to ride) (aye)
Who gone pull up when its time to slide? (When its time) (aye)
Me and my brother we stick together no other
We blowing up like a bubble and we took over no other (aye)

Who I'm gone call when its time to ride? (When its time to ride) (aye)
Who gone pull up when its time to slide? (When its time) (aye)
Me and my brother we stick together no other
We blowing up like a bubble and we took over no other (aye)

Said who I'm gone call?
I swear I can hear you from afar
But its fucked up that I can't see
Yeah, I just got it all
I swear I wanna give you my all
But damn lil bruh I can't believe
See it might sound petty
We was two eyes no fetty
Ed ed with no eddy
See you was my nig, used to do everything wit' ya
Hard head never listen
Lost my brother, yeah, this shit be so crazy
Momma never thought she bury her baby
Since he die shit ain't been the same lately
Heart aching, and it feeling so painful
Momma said "son keep yo head up"
No derez but I'm getting fed up
Foot on niggas and I'm not lettin' up
Watch on 5ive, bitch, I miss my brother

Who's gone slide? Yeah, it's gone be you
Who's gone ride? Yeah, it's gone be you
Who's gone slide? Yeah, it's gone be you
Pull with the 5ive, you know he gon' shoot
And that was my brother, aye (brother, aye)
And I loved him, aye (and I love him, aye)
See that was my brother, yeah (that was my brother, yeah)

Who I'm gone call when its time to ride? (When its time to ride) (aye)
Who gone pull up when its time to slide? (When its time) (aye)
Me and my brother we stick together no other
We blowing up like a bubble and we took over no other (aye)

Who I'm gone call when its time to ride? (When its time to ride) (aye)
Who gone pull up when its time to slide? (When its time) (aye)
Me and my brother we stick together no other
We blowing up like a bubble and we took over no other (aye)
