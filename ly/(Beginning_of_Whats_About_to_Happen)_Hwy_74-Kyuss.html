		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the middle of the Highway,
As you ride down the road,
Just get that feeling,
It's all so black and bald.
And then there's my face,
When you're drivin' the desert sand,
Well open my hand,
Well open up the land.

Yeah.

Well everyone now bring your car to me.
From the mother of earth to the depth of the sea.
Well don't raise any hand for me,
When ya na na na na need me.

Yeah.

In the middle of the Highway,
As you ride down the road,
Just get that feeling,
It's all so black and bald.
And then there's my face,
And a-drivin' the desert sand.
Well open my hand,
Well open up the land.

Yeah.

Well everyone now bring your car to me,
From the mother of earth to the depth of the sea.
Well don't raise any hands for me,
no no,
When ya na na na na need me.

Yeah.
