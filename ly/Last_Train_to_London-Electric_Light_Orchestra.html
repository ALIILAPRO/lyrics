		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was 9:29, 9:29 big street, big city
The sun was going down, there was music all around
It felt so right

It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel the world stop turning
You were standing there, there was music in the air
I should have been away 
But I knew I'd have to stay

Last train to London, just heading out
Last train to London, just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

It was one of those nights
One of those nights when you feel the fire is burning
Everybody was there
Everybody to share
It was so right

There you were on your own
Looking like you were the only one around
I had to be with you
Nothing else that I could do
I should have been away
But I knew I'd have to stay

Last train to London, just heading out
Last train to London, just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

Underneath a starry sky
Time was still but hours must really have rushed by
I didn't realize but love was in your eyes
I really should have gone 
But love went on and on

Last train to London, just heading out
Last train to London, just leaving town
But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight

But I really want tonight to last forever
I really wanna be with you
Let the music play on down the line tonight
