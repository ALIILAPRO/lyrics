		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's takin' her time makin' up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside, guess she knows
From the smiles and the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory 'bout the bitter one, they're sayin'

"Mama never loved her much and
Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection", but
Somewhere in a private place
She packs her bag for outer space
And now she's waitin' for the right kind of pilot to come

And she'll say to him (she's sayin')

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby? 
(Ooh-mm, mm)

She can't remember a time when she felt needed
If love was red then she was color-blind 
All her friends, well, they've been trialed for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's sayin', but love is like a barren place
And reachin' out for human faith is
Is like a journey I just don't have a map for
So, baby gonna take a dive and push the shift to overdrive
And send a signal that she's hangin' all her hopes on the stars

What a pleasant dream (just sayin')

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
Hold on (five, four), hold (three, two) on (one)

Mama never loved her much and daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away from human affection
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bag for outer space
And now she's waitin' for the right kind of pilot to come

And she'll say to him (just sayin')

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?

I would fly you to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world where we belong
So would you be my baby?
Ooh-do
