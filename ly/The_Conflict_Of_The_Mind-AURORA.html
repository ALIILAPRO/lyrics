It's a complicated story
That we never talk about
But I see it in the mirrors
In the curtains of our house
I don't want you to be worried
That we're running out of time
It doesn't matter where we're going
We can leave it all behind

Only when I see you cry
I feel conflicted in my mind
It fills my heart up and it breaks me at the very same time
When you open up the gates for me
And leave the world behind
We find proof of love is hidden
In the conflict of the mind

I remember how I'd find you
Fingers tearing through the ground
Were you digging something up
Or did you bury something down?
In your soul, I found a thirst
With only salt inside your cup
In your eyes, I saw a longing
While I longed to lift you up

Only when I see you cry
I feel conflicted in my mind
It fills my heart up and it breaks me at the very same time
When you open up the gates for me
And leave the world behind
We find proof of love is hidden
In the conflict of the mind

Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
Da

Don't let your spirit die
This is just a conflict of the mind (conflict of the mind)
Is your heart alive? (Is your heart alive?)
You'll overcome a conflict of the mind (conflict of the mind)
Don't let your spirit die (love is, let your spirit die)
This is just a conflict of the mind (love is, conflict of the mind)
Is your heart alive? (Love, is your heart alive?)
You'll overcome a conflict of the mind (conflict of the mind)
Don't let your spirit die (love is, let your spirit die)
This is just a conflict of the mind (love is you, conflict of the mind)
Is your heart alive? (Love, is your heart alive?)
You'll overcome a conflict of the mind (love is you)

Love is you
Love is you
Love is, love, love
Love is you
Love
