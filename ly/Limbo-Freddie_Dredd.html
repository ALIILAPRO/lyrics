		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk around the world, it feel like every place the same
I look into your eyes and see that you are in some pain
Freddie gonna help the business, help a rope around your neck
Gonna help you make a choice, let it sit, don't let it rest
You a pest, what the fuck, you left a mess
It's okay, I'll just say that your body's gone today
You in Hell, I don't think you failed, you just made some bail
Come the day, it gets worse and I hope you fuckin' hurt

Now what's the word, captain? I think I caught you lackin'
There are nine more layers that this hell's packin'
No tippy tappin', bitch, I come in rippy rappin'
I feel lucky I'm not you, at the top I do the do
Stuck in the fuckin' darkness and it's cold at heart
Haven't felt sun in some days, bitch, where do I start?
Start from the top, and the next stop the bottom
Rock bottom, baby, I swear I already got 'em

Close your eyes and think of somethin' for me
Think of all the times that you've been feelin' kinda lonely
What could you do with your time instead?
What, you smokin' weed, you fuck your bitch and go to bed?
Notice all the colors that you seein' in your head
Now strip away that shit and feel the darkness, feel it spread
This is what it's like to be known as dead
Now open up your eyes, you see the world, it is red

Now what's the word, captain? I think I caught you lackin'
There are nine more layers that this hell's packin'
No tippy tappin', bitch, I come in rippy rappin'
I feel lucky I'm not you, at the top I do the do
Stuck in the fuckin' darkness and it's cold at heart
Haven't felt sun in some days, bitch, where do I start?
Start from the top, and the next stop the bottom
Rock bottom, baby, I swear I already got 'em
Now what's the word, captain? I think I caught you lackin'
There are nine more layers that this hell's packin'
No tippy tappin', bitch, I come in rippy rappin'
I feel lucky I'm not you, at the top I do the do
Stuck in the fuckin' darkness and it's cold at heart
Haven't felt sun in some days, bitch, where do I start?
Start from the top, and the next stop the bottom
Rock bottom, baby, I swear I already got 'em
