		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw when you arrived looking like a supermodel
Your ass from the side looks just like a coke bottle
I love the way you rock, put that thing on full throttle
So get, get get get up on the saddle

I wanna see you moving like they're moving in Jamaica
Pretend that I am dinner you can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin' to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
Sing it oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah

Sexy little mama, it's really nice to meet you
Can I be in your classroom and be your private teacher
If I bring out my camera will you be in my feature
'Cause we're gonna do some things
Hope your daddy ain't a preacher

I wanna see you move like they're moving in Jamaica
Pretend that I am dinner you can be my salt shaker
You ain't tryin' to hide it girl you're a troublemaker
And I'm a troublemaker maker maker maker maker

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah

I love the way you dance oh, it makes me crazy
I wanna see you move so just let it go, baby
I feel like we can do this if you wanna go with it
Let's take it to the top p-p-push it to the limit
Take it to the top p-p-push it to the limit,
To the limit, to the limit to the limit, limit, limit

I throw my hands up if you believe in me now
I keep my hands up and do it all for the now
And sing out oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah
Oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah oh oh ah ah
