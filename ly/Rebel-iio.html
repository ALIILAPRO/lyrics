		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ride the bike like it's on
clear water
Leave speed behind
Fill it with adrenaline
Medals made of gold not
silver
Challenge the races that
others can't win
Audit me, however you may
want
I own a slang that you'll
never pronounce
Wild-child like you
wouldn't know
Young reckless offspring
That's out of control
Blasting me up
Up... up... I go
Rebel, Am I?
Who... me? Oh no...
That's how a rebel
speaks
While all the others
tweak
That's how a rebel walks
While all the others talk
To be among the bonafide
trail blazers
Gotta jump in, no wetting
your feet
Lead in ferocious
spaces
Cowards can sleep, while
you swallow
Your feast
