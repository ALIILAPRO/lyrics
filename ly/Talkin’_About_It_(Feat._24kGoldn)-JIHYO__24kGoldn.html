		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Up in my face, up in my space
Life got me workin' for a clean slate
Might lose my mind until you come by
So we can be done with all these bright lights
And everyone, everyone, everyone tryna know about our life
'Cause they know ya they know that 
We rare and we ain't gonna happen twice

Talk about
We always gonna be the thing they talk about
It's way too loud
Let 'em talk it out
We always gonna be the thing they talk about
I don't think they know

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Talkin' about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Talkin', talkin' about it
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
I'm still the one who's in control

This kind of thing is way too magical
Could barely stay down on the low
Up on a stage, we make it so theatrical
And when the lights go down we're putting on the real show

(Umm-mm)
Talk about (oh, yeah)
We always gonna be the thing they talk about
It's way too loud
Let 'em talk it out (talk it out)
We always gonna be the thing they talk about
I don't think they know

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Talkin' about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Talkin', talkin' about it
Mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
I'm still the one who's in control
24

I said there's nothing left to talk about (oh, yeah)
'Cause you're here, so who cares what they talkin' about (oh, yeah)
It's unfair that we can't be ourselves together
Runaway, let's leave the pressure
You are all I need forever

Brand new me moving too fast
2023 I'm in a new bag (new bag)
Undercover denims with the good Raf (whoo)
And if they talking, give 'em something to look at dang
Ride around Seoul where my roof at
Ain't nowhere for you and me to sneak past
Cheongdam-dong blowing real cash (hey)
And I got Jihyo with me better not talk back
Whoop, whoop, whoop

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Talkin' about it
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Talkin', talkin' about it
Mm-mm-mm (oh-huh)
Mm-mm-mm (ooh-whoa-ooh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
I'm still the one who's in control
