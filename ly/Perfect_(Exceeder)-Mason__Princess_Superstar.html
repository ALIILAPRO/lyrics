		<p>
		  1234 let me hear you scream if you want some more
Like uhhh
Push it push it
Watch me work it -
I'm perfect

Yeah that's right it's the superstar
Everybody wanna come up when I'm at the bar
All them people wanna try its like gimme some more
Try a little harder honey I'm like gimme my car

Skip the bra
Chill at the spas
Feminine boss
Don't care what it cost

Get lost we gettin rocks
While bitches botox I blow cocks
So hot
We just wreckin the party

Autographin everybody body parts with the sharpie
Can't stop me baby got an army
Be all that you can be baby
Call me

1234 let me hear you scream if you want some more
Like uhhh
Push it push it
Watch me work it -
I'm perfect

I'm comin straight out the nyc
Every little bad boy's wet dream featurin me
Cream get the money dollar dollar bill ya'll kill ya'll got the ill jaw
Exes still call

You know I gotta do whatever it takes
All them other chicks its like that's the breaks
And all them other chicks wanna take my place and all them
Other chicks better get out my face

The look the lips the tits the taste
The hair the eye the skin the waist
You see what I can do on a microphone
So think bout what I'm gonna do to you at home
Get goin with the
Mastercard max it hard
In the backs of cars
Faxin lawyers
Racks and racks at stores
I'm just/ about/ me gettin more

1234 let me hear you scream if you want some more
Like uhhh
Push it push it
Watch me work it /
I'm perfect

Hey I don't mean to brag
But I'm makin ladies mad
When they look at what I have
All the shit in the bag

Runnin things like a track
No practice
Got you starvin for me like a hollywood actress
So attractive wear my dresses backless

Flippin lots of heavy words like a mattress
Make money during napses leg hair waxes? use hundred dollar bills
Got a million pairs of underwear
Millionaire times my strands of hair in bel air

It's all there, bull or bear .....i don't know and I don't care
It ain't fair princess superstar make em stop n stare runnin scared
Kiss my derriere, on my mirrored chair
(why you got a mirrored chair? )

You can see my ass much better there
To kiss it kiss it
