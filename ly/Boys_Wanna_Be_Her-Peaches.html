		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got them all, by the balls 
causin' waterfalls 
Stone walls 
Bar brawls 
Common stalls that cause 'em all

To you they crawl, body sprawl 
Smokin' Pall Malls 
Close call, stand tall 

Doll, you make them feel so small 
And they love it!

The boys wanna be her (The boys) 
The girls wanna be her (The girls) 
The boys wanna be her (The boys) 
The girls wanna be her (The girls) 
The boys wanna be her (The boys) 
The girls wanna be her (The girls) 
The boys wanna be her (The boys) 

I wanna be her 

Yes I do 

The way you rock, don't stop (or lone star) 
Girl, you got the chops 
Flip flop 
She bop 
Self-taught 
You lick so hot 
Are you conceived
Kids receive 
Crawling up the sleeve 
Parents bleed 
Can't conceive 
That indeed we'll never leave 

And we love it!

The boys wanna be her (The boys) 
The girls wanna be her (The girls) 
The boys wanna be her (The boys) 
The girls wanna be her (The girls) 
The boys wanna be her (The boys) 
The girls wanna be her (The girls) 
The boys wanna be her (The boys) 

I wanna be her 

So do you
