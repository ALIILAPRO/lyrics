		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left me broke, 
you said you would come back then just closed the door
Now I spend my days thinking that you’re gone
and telling myself that I can’t move on

Sometimes the flare of your voice just kicks in,
reminding me I don’t have the strength deep in
You fucked me up so bad, look at what you did
Now I just collect the pieces of what is left

Now you run up to her
saying that our love is gone
and embrace her in your arms 
when is cold at night

And I stand right here
smoking up my cigarette
hoping that it will warm up myself inside

You left me broke,
all the times we talked for hours on the phone
listening to K.L, speakers on
promising ourselves the future that we hold

I hope this all comes to you right back
you know you shouldn't do a girl like that
but the world spins around 
and you will take back
everything you’ve done

 you run up to her
saying that our love is gone
and embrace her in your arms 
when is cold at night

And I stand right here
smoking up my cigarette
hoping that it will warm up myself inside

(vocal chops)

You run up to her
saying that our love is gone
and embrace her in your arms 
when is cold at night

And I stand right here
smoking up my cigarette
hoping that it will warm up myself inside
