		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, what we got
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart
Things you want, I'm not looking for
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now

Oh, I love it when we climax (climax)
And I would never burn you
I could never hurt you
If we do it like that
Don't try to take it further
Focus on the friendship
Get a little sidetracked
Catching little feelings
Thought we had arrangements
Thought you weren't like that
Yeah, I thought you weren't like that

Oh, friends no more
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Friends no more
Ooh, friends no more, uh
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Oh

Oh, what we got (oh, yeah)
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart
Things you want (oh, yeah)
I'm not looking for
You're my best friend now (best friend now)
You're my best friend now (best friend now)

Tryna turn the time back
Keep it as a friendship
We already tried that
When you gonna face it?
We're on the other side
Know too much already
Don't wanna fake it (fake it)
If it wasn't for the heat of the moment (Yeah)
And if you weren't like that (like that)
Don't want to send you right back (right back)

Friends no more
Sex as friends no more
I don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Friends no more
Frie-frie-frie-friends no more (no more)
Sex as friends no more
I don't wanna have sex as friends no more
We'll never be friends no more

Oh, what we got (oh, yeah)
Baby, what we got is secure (oh)
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart (toxic love)
Things you want
I'm not looking for (I'm not searching, baby)
You're my best friend now (oh, baby)
You're my best friend now (best friend now)

Oh, I don't want to be responsible 
For your heart if we fall (oh, no)
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so
But we can't get close
You're my best friend now (best friend now)
You're my best friend now (best friend now)
