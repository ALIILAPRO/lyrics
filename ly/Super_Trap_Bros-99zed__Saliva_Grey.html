		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow burning Dutches in the whip I count my earnings up
We get it by the pound so I'm around and bitch I'm serving up
I give Saliva back his bread and now we fucked up turning up
I know that seeing 187 winning really hurting yuh
Front him that
He flip a pack
Get the bread
Send it back
Super trap bros
Matching bags
Tripping sack
In the rags
Snow shoe
Blow down
Whippets in me so Iâ€™m fucking gone
Licking up your shawty like I'm rolling up a dutch
These bitches call me Little Mac the way I'm beating up their guts
And when I'm chopping up a lines the only time that I'm in love
Little bitty bitty bitty bitch I shoot your mans for fun
Biddy biddy bitch
On that trippy trippiness
Drop a tab and then I send
Myself in that dimension 6
Got a 6 and a cig
Fuck her send her out the crib
Send her home with all my kids
Ain't paying for abortion bitch
Call us Ice Climbers
Cocaine burning PK FIRE
I got killers up for hire
50k we burnin tires
He was wearing a wire
So I slid like Micheal Meyers
I had four homies run up
These bullets singing like a choir
I was born in '97 papa raised a fucking savage
Taught me everything and now I flip a fucking package
I got new money fam is grinding every fucking second
Count your blessings count your hundreds coming up like an erection
