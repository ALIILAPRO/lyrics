		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dead language fills the room
I recite the words another body burned
And now the city streets all reek of death

my sacred chalice runneth over
Hatred malice takin over
Let it eat me up until my final breath

I'm fear incarnate to the lower
Resurrection corpse controller
Carnage on me I just made a bloody mess

I want your wings and I won't stand for any less
If he had faith there's nothing left
The reason why the angels wept

I see wrath in my reflection
Offer up blood to make connections
Sacrificial slaughter
My new roster is the holy section

Surgical swiper organ robber
I just found my new obsession
harvesting kidneys like they copper
Human flesh in my digestion

Countless victim gathered lined up placed in my procession
Every night I'm straying further
End all life with no exception
Black cathedral I spread evil always knew that I was destined
I provoke the urge in man
And lead him in the wrong direction

Dead language fills the room
I recite the words another body burned
And now the city streets all reek of death

my sacred chalice runneth over
Hatred malice takin over
Let it eat me up until my final breath

I'm fear incarnate to the lower
Resurrection corpse controller
Carnage on me I just made a bloody mess

I want your wings and I won't stand for any less
If he had faith there's nothing left
The reason why the angels wept
