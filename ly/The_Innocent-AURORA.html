		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have been a dancer but without her feet
I've been a lion but without it's teeth
In the moonlight, I will lie awake
Drinking lava from the lake
You give your all and in return
You get a spark and you watch it burn

The innocent life
The innocent touch
Is never enough
For the one who loves
The ones who love
The ones who love

Danger in the boy that would lose control
When everyone thought he had a heart of gold
I remember how we used to play
He'd let me win if I let him stay
He left without a single trace
I don't know why he said goodbye to love

You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart

The innocent life
The innocent touch
Is never enough
For the one who loves
The ones who love
The ones who love

The innocent life
The innocent touch
Is never enough
For the one who loves
The ones who love
The ones who love

I lay you down in the cold of the water
Watching you drown for the sake of the torture
Now, you are gone
I feel that I'm closer
(You would never let me into your heart)

You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart
You would never let me into your heart

The innocent life
The innocent touch
Is never enough
For the one who loves
The ones who love
The ones who love

The innocent life
The innocent touch
Is never enough
For the one who loves
The ones who love
The ones who love
