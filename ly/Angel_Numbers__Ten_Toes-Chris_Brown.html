		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost my way, somewhere in another galaxy ('xy)
Too much to take, these memories end in tragedy ('gy)
And all of these places, all of these faces
I didn't wanna let you down (down)
And all these mistakes of mine, I can't replace it
I gotta move on somehow

Healing energy on me
Baby, all I really need's one thing
Healing energy on me
Baby, can you make a wish for me?
Healing energy on me
When it's 11:11, I need it
Healing energy on me
Baby, can you make a wish for me?

11:11, oh
11:11
When it's 11:11, I need it

(Ooh, ooh)

Anxiety
Don't let the pressure get to your head
You know we play for keeps
Don't let it go over your head

Heavy stepper, I got too much weight on this
You can see the diamonds, don't complain on this (me)
We was hustlin', you niggas got no say on this (no)
I'm just bein' honest
I'm movin' steady (shoot)
You can't buy success, ain't got no sale on it
You know that God did, he never gon' fail on us
Too much paper, got me thinkin' how I'ma save all this
I know the opps want it, they love this
Two-tone, got the bussdown like whoa (whoa)
The streets crazy, they don't love me no more (ooh)
Not one for pressure, but I'll bang for my bros (bros)
Walkin' in Giuseppe, I be ten on my toes

Welcome all the smoke (smoke, smoke, smoke, ski)
Mama, pray for me so I won't fold (fold)
Walkin' ten toes
I be paranoid, but nobody knows (whoa)
Anxiety
Don't let the pressure get to your head (head)
You know we play for keeps (for keeps)
Don't let it go over your head

Steady, movin' onto greater (ghetto, ghetto)
Never thought that I'd be ready (ready)
She let me, I let her keep her things (keep)
She told me, "Why didn't you just fight for it?"
All these baddies, had too many (many)
I promised that I would have died for it
You just had to fuckin' let me (let me)
Now I'm married to the game, I'm in that
No more chains, I'ma buy me some gold (whoa)
Three babies, tryna make room for some more (ooh)
Life learnin' lessons 'cause you reap what you sow (grow)
Walkin' in Giuseppe, I be ten on my toes

You know I welcome all the smoke (smoke, smoke, smoke, ski)
Mama, pray for me so I won't fold (fold)
Walkin' ten toes (ten toes)
I be stressin' out, but nobody knows (yeah, yeah)
Anxiety (anxiety)
Don't let the pressure get to your head (don't let it get to your head)
You know we play for keeps (we play, we play, we play)
Don't let it go over your head
Know we welcome all the
Welcome all the smoke (welcome all the smoke, ooh)
Mama, pray for me so I won't fold (fold)
Walkin' ten toes (ten toes)
I be paranoid, but nobody knows (yeah)
Anxiety (anxiety, yeah, oh)
Don't let the pressure get to your head (don't let it get to your head, don't let it)
You know we play for keeps (we play, we play, we play, play for keeps)
Don't let it go over your head

Steady (ooh)
Oh-whoa
Just fight for it
