		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "New Orleans is ruled by thugs even more
Ruthless than LA's most violent gangs"
"The Crips & Bloods tried
To establish themselves here
And these guys killed them simple as
That gone! See you later!"
"We look at gangs like this, it's like a
Coward move to us but a gang
It takes fifteen
People to get in two cars and do a
Drive-by and kill one person in New Orleans
I just saw one person kill fifteen people"

You a paper chaser
You got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is
To make nothin' out of something
You handle your biz and don’t
Be cryin' and sufferin' you a paper chaser
You got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is
To make nothin' out of something
You handle your biz and don’t
Be cryin' and sufferin'

Definition of the living dead
Got a dead bitch givin' head
Tulip flowers growin' on my bed
Rust and blood settle on my lead
Broken soul, but I'm breaking bread
Head-dreaded boy from Waggaman
Petey Pablo shirt off, on 'em
Swingin' like a helicopter
Got it covering this chopper
Spittin' out them yoppas
Got the drama with the llama
I can get you to Nirvana
Run them pockets proper
We create our own karma
Balboa out the Magnolia, Northside Soulja
Need the keys to the Rover yung $carecrow-a

You a paper chaser
You got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is
To make nothin' out of something
You handle your biz and don’t
Be cryin' and sufferin'

Ruby da fucking ape
Ruby da fucking orangutan mumblin' nothing
Just the discussion of public destruction
I'm up in flames, the Soulja by the lake
Feelin' like I'm in the Navy, but
I pull up in the tank, ayy
Sippin' the tang out of an AK
Kangaroo the next lane
Lame move, you looking plain
Can't redo the flex, mane
Camo on my body like I just
Got back from the war
I heard a bang in the bank
Ben Frank on the floor back in New Orleans
Now everybody wanna score
I'm trying to finesse the
Lesser into something more
I'm drawin' a blank on who the fuck you is

You a paper chaser
You got your block on fire
Remainin' a G, until the moment you expire
You know what it is
To make nothin' out of something
You handle your biz and don’t
Be cryin' and sufferin'
