		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought it did exist
Till I saw your face 
and felt the something
the little magic (little magic)
Something that I never felt
A dream that seemed so far away
Can you believe it?
Now I got the dream in my arms

Let me hold you in my arms
Baby stay for a life
Be the one 
That'll change my life (be my magic)
Let me hold you in my arms
Baby stay for a life
Be the one 
That'll change my life 

You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life
You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life

I was born the day you said you loved me
Never did I feel so damn alive
You're the love of my life

Baby we are here to stay
Tell me what is life
When the magic is gone
So let it never be gone 

Let me hold you in my arms
Baby stay for a life
Be the one 
That'll change my life (be my magic)
Let me hold you in my arms
Baby stay for a life
Be the one 
That'll change my life 

You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life
You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life

You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life
You make me feel so ecstatic
Babe you give me life
My little bit of magic
That I never had in life

Let me hold you in my arms
Baby stay for a life
Be the one 
That'll change my life (be my magic)
Let me hold you in my arms
Baby stay for a life
Be the one 
That'll change my life 

You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life
You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life

You're my little something
My pretty surprise
The little bit of magic
That I never had in life
You make me feel so ecstatic
Babe you give me life
My little bit of magic
That I never had in life
