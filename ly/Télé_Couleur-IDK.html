		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh, uh

See, my side and yo' side never symmetrical
See, my highs and my lows will keep you levelled though
Our vision ain't level 10, it's more level 4, we need more visuals

Pardon my richness
I raise the bar, better step up yo' fitness
And step up yo' fits, bitch
I'm sick, I need Lipchitz
I make 'em red, they come for my head
Like I'm gettin' kissed by lipstick
My bitch is ign'ant
She put an H in front Hermès
No H in front of I, unless you earn bread, materialistic
But she get it from her daddy
The same one that's payin' for her addy
It is what it is, trick, I come from the district
My mom used to be strict, my daddy was missing
I found him at sixteen, the day that my momma died
I lost him at eighteen, it hurt, but I didn't cry
My tears came in other forms that's actually worse
But they like, "Whatever works for him
It's better to just ignore 'em
It's better to keep him tourin' and tourin'
It's better for him 
The green gon' keep him good
Let's go 'head and build a forest
As long as the cash flowin' in, floor it, the gas on
Let's work 'til it crash, like he got back with no mask on
Like Jay, do the dash without no seatbelt
That's the norm, you don't need help
Natural born to do it, the tears pourin'
But never in the physical
Expressin' it been difficult
They ask me if I'm good, I say, "Bitch, are you good?"
I just flip it like reciprocal

See, my side and yo' side never symmetrical
See, my highs and my lows will keep you levelled though
Our vision ain't level 10, it's more level 4, we need more visuals

The line is habitual
The lines in my songs got me feelin' like a lion when I'm on
I'm a lion with these niggas, with the iron safety off
Just in case they gotta bust, like the race 'bout to start
Or in case they got a bus like they name Rosa Parks
Huh, just because he grew up middle-class
Doesn't mean that he won't heat yo' ass
We watchin' different news
'Cause shit to prove be worser than shit to lose

See, my side and yo' side never symmetrical
See, my highs and my lows will keep you levelled though
Our vision ain't level 10, it's more level 4, we need more visuals
