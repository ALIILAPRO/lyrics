		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How've you been?
I guess you're fine
It's been pretty long since we've last seen

Honestly
Throughout my life
Deep inside
I never felt alive (alive)

The way you used to touch my soul
Was always so sweet and lovely
No matter how far apart we were
You'd always pick up the phone
But now I'm truly all alone in this world
I miss the way you felt so close to my bones

I'm sinking in the deep end
I'll just try to cry myself to sleep
Please stop this pain
If you hadn't changed, then I'd still be by your side
If I gave you one more chance
Can we go back again?

You made me feel
As if we were complete
But now you're filled with nothing but conceit
The times we had (together) were bittersweet (bittersweet)
I miss the days we used to laugh and heal (laugh and heal)

The way you used to touch my soul
Had always kept me whole
You'd always read my text
And ghost me like you wanted me gone
Now I'm truly all alone in this world
I miss the way you felt so close to my bones

I'm sinking in the deep end
I'll just try to cry myself to sleep
Please stop this pain
If you hadn't changed, then I'd still be by your side
If I gave you one last chance
Can we go back again?

Honestly
Without you in my life
Deep inside
I've never felt alive
