		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Animals we are
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
I suppose
It's just the state I'm in
Animals that climb
I'm climbin' over you
Until you say
"Off you go, off you go"

Animal I am
Disposable
Collapsible and raw
I don't know which way
I should turn

Animal that runs
I ran away from you
And now I'm in
"Off you go, off you go"
(And you say)

If you're gonna go, go now
If you're gonna go, go now
I forgot to tell you how
If you gonna go, go now

Animal I am
I'm looking for a future
Just like you
Well I don't know
Which way I turn

Animals that climb
I climb all over you
Until I say
And I missed my chance
By a stone slow

If you're gonna go
Go now
If you're gonna go
Go now
I forgot to tell you how
If you gonna go
Go now
