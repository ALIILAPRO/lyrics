		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't seem to explain a thing
Going on in my head (on in my head)
The memories seem to fade away
With the thoughts in my head (the thoughts in my head)
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head (the thoughts in my head)
Run from different enemies
And the thoughts in my head (the thoughts, in my)

And where did you go as I slipped? (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
I went and I'll count the tears I shed (tears I shed, tears I)
She sat there and watched as I bled

As I bled
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled
As I bled

And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
And where did you go as I slipped (as I slipped)
I can't seem to get out my head (out my head)
