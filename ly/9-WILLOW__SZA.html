		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathing is easier under water
I can see sky from here
Please, remember, all you've taught her
I can see God from here

If only I could stay, if only I could stay for you
I would, try
If only I could wait, if only I could wait for you
I would, fly

If only I could stay, if only I could pray
If only I could wait, if only you could stay
Up, up in your zone, yes, you're all alone
Yes, I'm all alone

Not negative, just different
You wanna have lunch, and I wanna have a picnic
You wanna go up
I wanna just fly all night
'Cause baby, you

Got me tied up in this love thing, it's tough 'cause I
Want to love you but you, keep being so afraid, afraid
If only I could stay, if only you could stay
Up, up in your zone, yes you're all alone, yes, I'm all alone

Getting in the car, we cruisin'
Going down the PCH, I'm gonna to get a smoothie
Never had a problem, but I know that you gon' do this
'Cause you the smoothest

Blue is the emotion, that I'm feeling
Apology's an option, let me hear it
What took you so long to finish your storm, son?
Not negative, just different

You wanna go out, I wanna finish living
You wanna get up (up, up)
When I could just lay all day, with you
I could just stay all day, with you

Hey baby, you're sack of potatoes
We could grow eyes for later, moments to savor
We made
We made, we made art, art
I can't stop, stop
You've blown away, away, away

I don't play wanna no more
I'm not a kid no more
I've did some things, that you can see
That I've been gone away
That I have room to be whom I want to be
And you don't even talk to me

It's three, it's three, it's me
It's Moi, it's Jay, it's all these days
My days are numbered
You can come through
