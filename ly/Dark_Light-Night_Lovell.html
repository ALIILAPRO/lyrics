		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I come back
Niggas tryna flex
Tell me that I'm lost, and located in the back, though
Don't even wanna check
Niggas still wanna call it a day
Approach me, ain't got shit to say
Talkin' to me like you wanted to stay
When it come back around and you still tryna play
Go and break it down for a nigga
Go and break it down just a little, have love for a nigga
But they steady playin' games with a nigga
Steady throwin' names for a nigga
One time for you niggas
And I'm goin' with my stash
Tryna make it last
Thoughts overflow like they did in the past
And with me they still tryna ask
Fuck you wanna know 'bout me?
Fuck a nigga bitch off a 40 OZ
Shit I keep it low-key
Many people sayin' that they know it
Like there's plenty of that shit I ain't see
Catch me overseas in a fuckin' white tee
Bitches say "Lovell man, I really want the D"
Niggas say "Lovell man, I really wanna see"
You don't know 'bout me

Stress keeps building
Blood stops flowin'
Brain got me open
Gone off a potion
Stress keeps building
Gone off a potion

Stress keeps building 
Stress keeps building
Gone off a potion
Gone off a potion
Gone gone off a potion
