		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school.
Teachers here, teachers there,
Books and books, they are everywhere.

Come on boys, we need to dance, we have got a good chance.
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:

Everybody, let's go to the "King",
We can dance there, dance and eat an ice-cream.
Everybody dancing all night long,
Try to do it, sing a happy song.

Music, dancing in the night, we can get so high,
For no reason no long stop, now's the time to go to the top.

It's a sweeter happy song, we'll sing all night long.
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more:
Everybody, let's go to the "King",

It's time to dance, it's time to sing, sing a happy song, a happy song.
Let's go, let's go boys, come with me and sing, sing a happy song.

Come on boys, we need to dance, we all have got a good, good chance.
Lay your problems on the floor, clap your hands and sing once more.
Music sound in the night, we all can get so high,
For no reason no long stop, now's the time to go to the top.

We are down, we are crazy fools everyday at school. 
Come on boys, we need to dance, we have got a good chance.
Everybody, let's go to the "King". 
Let's go, let's go boys, come with me and sing, sing a happy song.
Everybody, let's go to the "King",
Everybody
