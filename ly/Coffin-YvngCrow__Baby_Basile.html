		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cbx frozen city when I ride now
When we show up everybody gonna show out
Tell me that they love me why they love me I don't know how
If you didn't know now you know why I don't go out
Everybody so fake can't fuck with that
Shorty I've been on my way and I ain't going back
Not until I make a billy I ain't stopping
Young vampire when I step out the coffin
Young Bill Gates got ambition I ain't robbing
Fuck them all watch me kill this shit they get to calling
I ain't got time for nobody that be stalling
Balling AK-47 because I'm popping
Watch me hit New York a motherfucker Milly rocking
Never in my city yeah I know that's where them opps is
I could never trust another soul fuck their offerings
Ballin I don't even know why they be talking shit
Cbx frozen city when I ride now
When we show up everybody gonna show out
Tell me that they love me why they love me I don't know how
If you didn't know now you know why I don't go out
Everybody so fake can't fuck with that
Shorty I've been on my way and I ain't going back
Not until I make a billy I ain't stopping
Young vampire when I step out the coffin
I been dead now I'm running out of options
Never really know me but the old me like to talk shit
Last girlfriend man I swear to god she toxic
Running up a check and I might have even lost it
I been dead now I'm running out of options
Never really know me but the old me like to talk shit
She toxic swear I might have lost it
Young vampire in the night like a goblin
I been dead now I'm running out of options
Never really know me but the old me like to talk shit
She toxic swear I might have lost it
Young vampire in the night like a goblin
