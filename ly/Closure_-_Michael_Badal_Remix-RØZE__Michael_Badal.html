		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were two lost souls on our way
No one to listen to what we'd say
Looking back at my greatest mistake
Letting you in, in my way

Oh, I know, I'm better than this
I can make it on my own
And oh so cold you made me feel
When you left me all alone

You're gonna miss me 'cause it's over
And everything is falling down on you
Don't try and tell me you need closure
I'm not the one who's gonna play your fool
You're gonna miss me 'cause it's over

It's hard to find the right words to say
Can't keep ignoring what's in my way
Faking a smile to save face
As much as I run, I stay in one place

Oh, I know, I'm better than this
I can make it on my own
And oh so cold you made me feel
When you left me all alone

You're gonna miss me 'cause it's over
And everything is falling down on you
Don't try and tell me you need closure
I'm not the one who's gonna play your fool

And now you miss me 'cause it's over
And everything has fallen down on you
Don't try and tell me you need closure
I'm not the one who's gonna play your fool
And now you miss me 'cause it's over
