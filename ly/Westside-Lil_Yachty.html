		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh, uh (Buddah blessed this beat)

What the fuck? (Woo)
Swear we up, why mom still stressin'? (What the fuck?)
She don't wanna see her son taken away from his blessing (what the fuck?)
Purple toxic liquid all I been digesting (ew)
Rather lay up with a model then rent a club section (what the fuck?)
Two straps on me, I'm nervous, I need protection (brrt)
Feel like a teenage white girl, I follow one direction (yeah)
And that is up, my bitch perfect, my C-section (yeah)
Can't fuck up what she built up, we both agreed (woo)
I made more guap than all my teachers with they degrees (woo)
Can't have no fun in white neighborhoods, they call police (woo)
I just phoned shawty, no English, she from Belize (yes)
You would not believe how she eat dick, she tell me "Please"

Outside on the west side, west side, west side, west side
Bad bitch wanna take a picture, said, "Hold on, baby it's my good side" (hold on)
Honeycombs in the wrist, would've thought the diamonds came from a beehive (uh)
Lil' bro serve Percs went and gotta pay ten like he Eli (woo)
Lil' bro serve Percs went and gotta pay ten like he Eli (woo)
B's all on Boat, had to take a second, thought that he was E5
Goin' big on a bitch, on her boyfriend, had to get the G5 (yeah)
Twenty thou' on the that G5 (woo)
Thirty thousand on that VLive (woo, woo, wee)
Ask your bitch, bet it, we live
Bet she let me take a deep dive

I got the cinematic (yeah), automatic (yeah)
Ar Pistol if it's real static (brrt)
Let 'em have it, my big homie really problematic (yeah)
I'm tryna beat her back out (woo)
These niggas keep it platonic (yeah)
Got rich now she on dick (go)
What the fuck? Nigga, how ironic (yeah)
Move that bitch to Oklahoma City
Nigga just like Supersonics (okay)
Whip color like a hero comin' (okay)
Beat her throat 'til she wanna vomit (okay)
Gettin' top in the Rolls Royce (skrrt)
Looked up, thought I saw a comet
Cum and bust up all up on her body (yes)
He did it, nigga, he done it (yes)
No Breezy, nigga, we run it
Amen, USA a nigga playpen (go)
Twenty-two, done bought like four Benzes (go)
Mama keepin' up with my expenses (yeah)
Lot of these hoes so pretentious (woo)
Swear they ballin', warmin' up the benches (woo)
Used to be broke, now I got big houses with the gates and fences

Outside on the west side, west side, west side, west side
Bad bitch wanna take a picture, said, "Hold on, baby it's my good side" (hold on)
Honeycombs in the wrist, would've thought the diamonds came from a beehive (uh)
Lil' bro serve Percs went and gotta pay ten like he Eli (woo)
Lil' bro serve Percs went and gotta pay ten like he Eli (woo)
B's all on Boat, had to take a second, thought that he was E5
Goin' big on a bitch, on her boyfriend, had to get the G5 (yeah)
Twenty thou' on the that G5 (woo)
Thirty thousand on that VLive (woo, woo, wee)
Ask your bitch, bet it, we live
Bet she let me take a deep dive
