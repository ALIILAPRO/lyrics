		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another verse another search for something holy
Another chance to make it right 
When it's young and it's fun there's nothing lost nothing won
And no consequence in sight 

You know it only feels like darkness 
When the light doesn't shine on your side
You were the poet I was the poem but were you mine were you your own
Or were we fighting for our lives 
It doesn't matter we survived 
 
But if I could have
One last time with you 
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken 
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine with you 

La-la-la-la-lie-lie-lie, la-lie-lie-lie
La-la-la-la-lie-lie-lie, la-lie-lie
La-la-la-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie lie
Lie-lie-lie-la-lie-lie

I'd ask the past if nothing lasts why don't you show me 
But I'm afraid to scare myself 
'Cause where there's love there is loss 
And they hang on the cross
With another tale to tell
And more wishes for the well 

But If I could have
One last time with you 
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken 
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine with you 

La-la-la-la-lie-lie-lie, la-lie-lie-lie
La-la-la-la-lie-lie-lie, la-lie-lie
La-la-la-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie lie
Lie-lie-lie-la-lie-lie

If I could have
One last time with you 
I imagine all the things we would do
Love is in the words unspoken 
All these moments are golden
Forever is mine with you 

You know it only feels like darkness 
'Til somebody turns on the light
I'd live it all once again 
With an alternate end 
And I'd pay the highest price 
To hold you one last time
