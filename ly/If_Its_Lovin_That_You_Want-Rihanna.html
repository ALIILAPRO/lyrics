		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Then baby, come and share my world, share my world
If it's loving that you want
Come and take a walk with me, a walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby

Now it's obvious you need a friend to come hold you down
Be that one to share your everything when no one's around
Baby, come tell me your secrets, and tell me all your dreams
'Cause I can see you need someone to trust
You can trust in me

Di di di di di da di di di da di dey
So just call me whenever you're lonely
Di di di di di da di di di da di dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homie

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Then baby, come and share my world, share my world (whoa-oh)
If it's loving that you want
Come and take a walk with me, a walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby

It's been so long I've had this feeling
That we could be
Everything you've ever wanted, then you
Your fantasy
I won't push too hard or break your heart
'Cause my love's sincere
I'm not like any other girl you know
So let me erase your fears

Di di di di di da di di di da di dey
So just call me whenever you're lonely
Di di di di di da di di di da di dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homie

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl (ooh)
If it's loving that you need
Then baby, come and share my world, share my world
If it's loving that you want
Come and take a walk with me, a walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl (make me your girl, baby)
If it's loving that you need (baby)
Then baby, come and share my world, share my world (I got what you need, so come share my world)
If it's loving that you want (oh)
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby (whoa-oh)

Di di di di di da di di di da di dey
So just call me whenever you're lonely
Di di di di di da di di di da di dey
I'll be your friend, I can be your homie

If it's loving that you want
Then you should make me your girl, your girl
If it's loving that you need
Baby come and share my world, share my world (oh-oh)
If it's loving that you want
Come and take a walk with me, walk with me (come and take a walk with me)
'Cause everything that you need, I got it right here baby, baby

I want to let you know
That you don't have to go
Don't wonder no more
What I think about you
What I think about you, boy
I got what you need so come share my world, oh, no
