		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey single ladies, I know you like to party
Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa
Hey single ladies, I know you like to party
Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa

I got money in the bank so we order couple of drinks
Matter of fact, just bring the bottle throw it up, throw it up
Rock the boat until we sink, lot of fishes in the tank
Face around like we be down, but I tell them tear it up
Baby I huff, I puff, I'll blow your house in
In the building like constructions, we don't need no introductions
Single ladies need no drama, they already baby mamas
So the focus for tonight is just put it on the floor

Hey single ladies, I know you like to party
Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa
Hey single ladies, I know you like to party
Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa

She was glancing by the bar, she unknown but she a star
Come to et's after party, yeah I space shipped at my car
Got my system all equipped we get louder than the club
Face around like we be down, but I tell them tear it up
Easy coming easy go, I'm ready to hit the road
All you, pimping biznes cause it's all around the globe
Pretty girls they don't get down, yeah I heard it all before
When they turn around and flip it, right down put it on the floor

Hey single ladies, I know you like to party
Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa
Hey single ladies, I know you like to party
Girl come and kick it with me
Calling all single ladies here tonight

Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa
Let's get it started, whoa, let's get it started, whoa
