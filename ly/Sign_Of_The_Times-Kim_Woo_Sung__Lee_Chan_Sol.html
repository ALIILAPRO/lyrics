		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes

You can't bribe the door on the way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here

Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets

We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets?
The bullets oh-oh

We don't talk enough
We should open up
Before it's all too much
Oh-oh-oh

Will we ever learn?
We've been here before
It's just what we know

We got to get away
We got to get away
We got to get away oh

We got to, we got to get away
We got to, we got to get away
We got to, we got to get away 
Oh-oh

Just stop your crying
It's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
