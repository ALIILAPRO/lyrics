		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got, she got
She got that rich girl, LA vibe (LA)
She got, she got, she got
She got that rich girl

Love, take it off
She love that dirty talk
Pushing her up against the wall
Ah, white wine and bubblegum

She got that rich girl LA vibe (LA)
She whip it good in her daddy's 95
Rough sex on the bedroom floor
Hop in the shower, she begging for more
Do not disturb on the hotel door
Waking the neighbors

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tanned skin and light eyes
Oh my, she's so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time

She got, she got, she got
She got that rich girl
She got, she got, she got
She got that

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tan skin and light eyes
Oh my, she's so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time

She love to light it up (to light it up)
She smoke that lemon drop
Under the sun
Fill my cup
Ah, rose and bubblegum

She got that rich girl, LA vibe (LA)
She ride it good like she work it nine to five
Band tee and some ripped jeans
She a bad bitch, she be looking like Kylie
Blue eyes and green tea (she be looking like Kylie)

All she want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tan skin and light eyes
Oh my, she's so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the
All she want is

She got, she got, she got
She got that rich girl
She got, she got, she got
She got that

All I want is champagne and sunshine
Looking for a good time
Sipping on the stars while we laying under sunlight
Tan skin and light eyes
Oh my, she's so damn fine
Kissing on her neck
We be running from the night time

She got
