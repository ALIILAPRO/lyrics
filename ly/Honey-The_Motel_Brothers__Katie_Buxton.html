		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving down the high way,
Take me to the west side 
maybe even past it
wanna ride with you all night 

cause i got it bad, babe
want you to take up all of my time
when you look at me like that, babe
I know what giving in feels like

cause your love is sweet like honey
and warm so sunny
and you make it so hard to not just loose my mind
when you put your hands right on me
you know it really ain't funny
cause you may just send my soul straight to the sky

driving down the highway
there's something in that ride
cause you feel like a Friday
cause the weekend's in your eyes 
(cause the weekend's in your eyes)

and i don't always fall right into it 
but right now i want all of this 
i don't know how you do it
got me so messed up, its stupid

and there's something in your touch just takes me home
replaying in my head when i'm all alone
oh you know you're my favourite song

cause your love is sweet like honey
and warm so sunny
and you make it so hard to not just loose my mind
when you put your hands right on me
you know it really ain't funny
cause you may just send my soul straight to the sky

oooh oohhh 
i got it bad
ooooh oh oooh

oohhh 
i got it bad
