		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took you so many years
You're slowly dying to know if
But who?
Who knows if it will?
It will
It will
Will take you there
Wait
Is this it, is this it?
Won't you take it? Take it
Wait
Is this it, is it?
Won't you take it?
Take it
Content to feed the waves
That take you nowhere
Now getting desperate
To know if it will
It will
It will
Will take you there
Wait
Is this it, is this it?
Won't you take it? Take it
Wait
Is this it, is it?
Won't you take it?
Take it
Wait, wait
Is this it, is this it?
Won't you take it? Take it
Wait
Is this it, is it?
Won't you take it?
