		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot bear to see you leave me
I'm begging you, don't go (Begging you don't go)
I cannot bear to see you leave me
I'm begging you, don't go (Begging you don't go)

And though you tell me that you love me
Sometimes I just don't know (I just don't know)
I cannot bear to see you leave me
I'm begging you, don't go (Begging you don't go)

I cannot bear to see you leave me
I'm begging you, don't go (Begging you don't go)
I cannot bear to see you leave me
I'm begging you, don't go (Begging you don't go)

And though you tell me that you love me
Sometimes I just don't know (I just don't know)
I cannot bear to see you leave me
I'm begging you, don't go (Begging you don't go)

And though you tell me that you love
And though you tell me that you love
And though you tell me that you love
And though you tell me that you love
And though you tell me that you love

And though you tell me that you love
And though you tell me that you love 
And though you tell me that you love
(That you love, that you love, that you love)

Don't Go
