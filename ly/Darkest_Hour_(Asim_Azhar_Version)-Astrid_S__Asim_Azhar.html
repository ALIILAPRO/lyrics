		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the second that you call me
Saying you need to be alone tonight
I know you're deep down and you're crawling
Not going anywhere, so why're you trying?

You push me away, you stupid to think that I would leave ya
(You know I can never leave ya)
If I could get in your head, I would make you see the way I see ya
(Make you see the way I see ya)

Hand on my heart, I'd die for you
Nobody can love you in the way I do
And when you're hurt I'm hurting too
In your darkest hour, I'll be there for you

Ooh, I'd die for you
Ooh (I, I'll never leave ya)
Ooh, I'm hurting too
In your darkest hour, I'll be there for you

Know everybody got their demons
Knock on your door, I'll never call you first
But I knew you and all your reasons
Did you forget we said "For better or worse"?

You're stupid to think something bad could never come between us
(You know I can never leave ya)
If I could get in your head, I would make you see the way I see ya
You know I can never leave ya

Hand on my heart, I'd die for you
Nobody can love you in the way I do
And when you're hurt I'm hurting too
In your darkest hour, I'll be there for you

Ooh, I'd die for you
Ooh (I, I'll never leave ya)
Ooh, I'm hurting too
In your darkest hour, I'll be there for you
(And I'll be there for you)
