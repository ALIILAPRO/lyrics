		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm no longer found
Bugs got all my yummy
Passed out in the yard
Spiders on my tummy

I'm no longer found
Sex got all my pride
I'm no longer found
Passed out in the art of angels
Disable
I saw someone change the labels
I've seen it
I saw someone change the meaning

Once you were lost
Like we almost
Like we almost, wouldn't love
Can't you help it, thinking of me, think you love me
It's like you must, like you almost
Like you almost haven't lost
For making something of me, something of me

Beating so profound
These shoes got all my boogie
Crawling in the yard
Acid went right for me

I'm no longer found
Love got all my dime
I'm no longer found
Flying in the sky like Cupid
Hypocrite
I saw someone change the habits
I've seen it
A sudden change of spirit

Once you were lost
Like we almost
Like we almost, wouldn't love
Can't you help it, thinking of me, think you love me
It's like you must, like you almost
Like you almost haven't lost
For making something of me, something of me

Lost
Like we almost 
Like we almost wouldn't love
Well it made something
Something of me, something of me
