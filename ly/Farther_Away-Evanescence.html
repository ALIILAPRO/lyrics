		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took their smiles and I made them mine.
I, I sold my soul just to hide the light.
And now I see what I really am,
A thief a whore, and a liar.
I run to you,
Call out your name,
I see you there, father away.

I'm numb to you numb and deaf and blind.
You give me all but the reason why.
I reach but I feel only air at night.
Not you, not love, just nothing.
I run to you,
Call out your name,
I see you there, father away.

Try to forget you,
But without you I feel nothing.
Don't leave me here, by myself.
I can't breathe.
I run to you,
Call out your name,
I see you there, father away.

I run to you,
Call out your name,
I see you there, father away,
Farther away,
Father away,
Father away,
Father away,
Father away.
