		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look, I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it
You ever need me for any reason, let me know
I got your back, I would die and kill for you
Don't question that, you know it's true, don't pretend you don't
Beautiful is what are you are, I know you doubt it daily
Words would never be enough to describe the way we
Both connected when you had our baby
I'm proud of you, I can't believe it, it still fascinates me
Watching us grow seems like yesterday we met
Life is flying by, makes me
Emotional, just talking 'bout it got a lot of memories
Things I could never forget you gave me
Life when I was on empty and I was going crazy
Stood by my side, it's only right that I return the favor
You changed my life and gave me love when I had none to offer
Gave me hope when I was hopeless, ain't no second thoughts
If it came down to me or you, I swear to God, that I would take a-

I would take a bullet, give my life in a second, if it came down to it
Sacrifice anything to see the light in your eyes, I swear I'd do it
When you're down and you feel low
When your world starts to crumble
When you think that there's no hope
I got you

Yeah, both got trauma sometimes I see it work against us
Other times I see it bring us close and connect us
That scar on your stomach, that's not a flaw, that's perfection
Your whole body a work of art, don't you let that
Mess with your mental
I know your birth plan didn't pan out like you wanted
But look what we got from it
Scared to death, I can't imagine how you feel
Tryin' to handle all of this pressure you're under
Watching you suffer
Sick to your stomach
Unprepared, I ain't the best husband at times
My lack of encouragement hovers over us both
Still you love me, it's mind blowing
The selflessness you show me on a day to day basis is humbling
You picked me up when I was weak and felt like I had nothing left
Believed in me and still had faith when no else did
I wouldn't have a second thought if it came down to it
I swear to God I would take a
Yeah, I would take a-

I would take a bullet, give my life in a second, if it came down to it
Sacrifice anything to see the light in your eyes, I swear I'd do it
When you're down and you feel low
When your world starts to crumble
When you think that there's no hope
I got you

When the days feel long and the nights get lonely
When your sky goes dark and the rain starts pouring, yeah
When the walls cave in and you need somebody
I got you

I would take a bullet, give my life in a second, if it came down to it
Sacrifice anything to see the light in your eyes, I swear I'd do it
When you're down and you feel low, and you feel low
When your world starts to crumble, starts to crumble
When you think that there's no hope, that there's no hope
I got you (oh-oh-oh-oh)
I got you (oh-oh-oh-oh) 
I got you
