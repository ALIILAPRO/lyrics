		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am just a new boy
Stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock and roll refugee
Ooh, baby set me free

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

Hello?
Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mister Floyd
Will you accept the charges from United States?

Oh, he hung up, that's your residence, right? I wonder why he hung up?
Is there supposed to be someone else there besides your wife there to answer?

Hello?
This is United States calling, are we reaching
See he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering
