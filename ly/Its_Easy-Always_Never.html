		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say less, say less

It's easy
Make a little move on the road
Seven lines
For a dime
At least you've got a place you could go
Tempted
Opens any door she can find
Got a lay
Took the same
Everybody lost out their mind

Running on a Monday passing out
It's the little changes adding up
Can everybody take it easy?
Maybe I just need some time please
And, girl, goddamn
I say it all the time 
You're wasting all the time and
Until then
You're changing on the run
You'd never even stop and

It's easy
Make a little move on the road
Seven lines
For a dime
At least you've got a place you could go
Tempted
Opens any door she can find
Got a lay
Took the same
Everybody lost out their mind

I can never tell when I've had enough
It's getting out of hand 
Yeah, it's bad enough
When did it get so silent
Check your vest, no pilot
And, girl, goddamn
You say it all the time 
I'm wasting all my time and
Until then
I'm changing on the run
I'm never gonna stop and

It's easy
Make a little move on the road
Seven lines
For a dime
At least you've got a place you could go
Tempted
Opens any door she can find
Got a lay
Took the same
Everybody lost out their mind

Baby, what you sayin? Don't lash out
Have a little more, don't pass out
Oh-oh, oh, yeah
