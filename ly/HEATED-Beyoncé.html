		  (Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Hermès on me)

Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Ivy on me
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool down, heated (fan me off like hot, hot, hot)
(Like Coco Chanel, put me up in jail)
I gotta cool it down, heated (cool it down, hot, hot, hot)
Yeah, yeah (like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)

It's been a lot of years
Really think you're gettin' one past me?
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool it down, heated
You got me, heated
Heated, oh

Never met a girl with a mind like this, no no
To give you space at a time like this, my love
Never met a girl so fine like this, no no no no
With a waist that whine like this, my love
Only a real one could tame me
Only the radio could play me
Oh, now you wish I was complacent
Boy, you musta mixed up our faces (Uncle, Uncle Jonny)
Oh, now you wanna have conversation (Uncle Jonny)
See how you're testing my patience (Uncle Jonny made this)
Yeah, yeah

I've got a lot of bands, got a lot of Chanel on me
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool down, heated (fan me off like hot, hot, hot)
(Like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)
I gotta cool it down, heated (tip, tip, tip, tippin' on)

Got a lot of style, got a lot of Tiffany on me
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool it down, heated (I'm hot, hot, hot)
You got me, heated (fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot)
Heated (like stolen Chanel, put me up in jail)

Whole lotta reservations
Whole lottta
Whole lotta texting with no conversations
Whole lotta playing victim and the villain at the same time
Whole lotta, huh, money, not a lot of patience
Whole lotta niggas been waitin'
They want some time on it, now I wanna flaunt it
Panty and a bra, we can get involved, boy (wake up pretty)
You keep playin' with my heart, boy
I'm just as petty as you are (petty, petty, petty, petty, petty)
Only a real man can tame me
Only the radio could play me
Only my baby

Got a lot of bands, got a lot of Chanel on me
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta fan myself off
I gotta cool down, heated (fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot)
(Like Coco Chanel, put me up in jail)
I gotta cool it down, heated
Heated

Never met a girl with a mind like this, no no
To give you the space at a time like this, my love
Never met a girl so fine like this, no no no no (fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot)
With a waist that wine like this (like Coco Chanel, put me up in jail)

Tip, tip, tip on hardwood floors
Ten, ten, ten across the board (with a waist that wine like this)
Give me face, face, face, face, yah
Your face card never declines, my Gawd
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Mhmm yummy, yummy, yummy, make that bummy eat it
Make a pretty girl talk that shitty
Whiskey 'til I'm tipsy, glitter on my kitty
Cool it down, down, down my pretty
Bad-bad bitch, make a bad bitch glitchy
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
Liberated, livin' like we ain't got time
Yada yada ya, yada yada ya ya
Yada yada yada, boom boom kaka
Blastin' on that ass, blast on that ass
Fan me quick, girl, I need my glass
Fan me off, my wrist goes click
Dimples on my hips, stretch marks on my tits
Drinkin' my water, mindin' my biz
Monday I'm overrated, Tuesday on my dick
Flip-flop, flippy flip-floppin' ass bitch
Fan me off, watch my wrist goes click
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Cuff me please 'cause this ain't fair
Dripped in my pearls like Coco Chanel
Uncle Jonny made my dress
That cheap Spandex, she looks a mess
Fan me off, I'm hot, hot, hot
Like stolen Chanel, lock me up in jail
Finger tips go tap, tap, tap
On my MPC makin' disco trap
Uncle Jhnny made my dress
That cheap Spandex, she looks a mess
