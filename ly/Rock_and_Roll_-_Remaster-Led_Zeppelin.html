		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time since I rock and rolled
It's been a long time since I did the stroll
Ooh let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Yes, it has
It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from, whoa-oh-oh

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Oh seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right, oh yeah
Open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let love come running in, yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yeah-hey, yeah-hey, yeah-hey, yeah-hey

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
