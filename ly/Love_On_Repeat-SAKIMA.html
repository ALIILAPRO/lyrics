		  Chorus:

I need love on repeat
Be the u' in us
I need love on repeat
Be the u' in ugh 
Cause I need

Verse 1:

Feel like I'm falling for the first time
And if it's wrong then it's my first crime
I'll bend the rules just to be with you
If you let me

Pre:

Crashing right into my bed
Like how it was in my mind
We could do this all night

Chorus:

I need love on repeat
Be the u' in us
I need love on repeat
Be the u' in ugh 
Cause I need love

Verse 2:

Love me love me not
Cross my heart hope I die like
Love me love me not
Roses are red but you got me dead like woah
Every time every time like the first time
You're keeping me stuck on you
You're keeping me stuck on you

Pre:

Crashing right into my bed
Like how it was in my mind
We could do this all night

Chorus:

I need love on repeat
Be the u' in us
I need love on repeat
Be the u' in ugh 
Cause I need love
