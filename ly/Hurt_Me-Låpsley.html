		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't look at you the same way, anticipatin' heartbreak
And I know, and I know, and I know
I'm puttin' on a brave face to meet you in the same place
And I know, and I know, and I know
Gotta let my mind find another space
Cause I heard these scars never go away
And now I'm runnin' out of ways to numb the pain

So if you're gonna hurt me
Why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
Just dig a little deeper
Push a little harder than before
And I'm counting down the seconds that we have
I can see the end in sight, at last
So if you're gonna hurt me
Why don't you hurt me a little bit more?

Like breathing underwater, what's the law and order?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
You're sitting in a corner, hiding 'til it's over
And it shows, and it shows, and it shows
Buildin' up my walls just to tear them down
Tell me that it's love, force me to drown
Buildin' up my walls just to tear them down
Tell me that it's love
(And I thought you said you still loved me)

So if you're gonna hurt me
Why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
Just dig a little deeper
Push a little harder than before
And I'm counting down the seconds that we have
I can see the end in sight, at last
So if you're gonna hurt me
Why don't you hurt me a little bit more?

Never thought I would lose my grip
I always thought it was an adverse trip
Never thought it would hurt so much
Lost your way to another touch
(And I thought you said you loved me)

So if you're gonna hurt me
Why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
Just dig a little deeper
Push a little harder than before
And I'm counting down the seconds that we have
I can see the end in sight, at last
So if you're gonna hurt me
Why don't you hurt me a little bit more?
