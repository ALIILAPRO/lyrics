		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been calling you too many times
But now your gone
I've been wondering if i could stay
One more night
Night

But i don't know why
I'll be by your side
You hooked up with somebody new
Your breaking my heart
And wasting my time
This will be last goodbye

I think im better when
You're gone
Better when you're gone
Better when you're gone
I think im better when
You're gone
Better when you're gone
Better when you're gone

I've been calling you too many times
But now your gone
I've been wondering if i could stay
One more night
Night

But i don't know why
I'll be by your side
You hooked up with somebody new
Your breaking my heart
And wasting my time
This will be last goodbye

I think im better when
You're gone
Better when you're gone
Better when you're gone
I think im better when
You're gone
Better when you're gone
Better when you're gone
