		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You like to hurt me you know that you do
You like to think in some way that its me and not you
You like to have me jump and be good, but I don't want to do it
You don't know why I wont act the way you think I should
You thought they'd make me, behave and submit

What were you thinking, cause I don't forget

You don't know why
I wont give in
To hell with the pressure
I'm not caving in
You know that I got under your skin
You sold your soul but I wont let you win
You talk to much
You say I do
Difference is know one cares about you

You've got all the answers
You know everything
Well nobody asked you
Its a mystery to me

I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)
You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe
I'm sorry for you
Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)

You don't know who you can trust now
But you should believe
You should believe
You close your eyes
All well and good
I'll kick your ass like I said that I would
You tell them story's they'd rather believe
Use and confuse them their numb and naive
Truth is the truth hurts don't you agree
Its harder to live with the truth about you
Than to live with the lies about me

Know body owes you
Not one god damn thing
You know where to put your
Just shut up and say

I'm sorry for you

Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)

You don't know who in the hell to or not to believe

I'm sorry for you

Not sorry for me (not sorry for me)

You chose to hurt those that love you and wont set them free
