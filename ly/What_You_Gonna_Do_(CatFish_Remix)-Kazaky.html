		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you want all your wish
I know you are you child or a beast?
I'll show you how deep in your soul
Just let me go down, go down to your.

What gonna do? You have to know.
I want to know, we want to know.
Is it my choice? You ask me once,
You ask me twice, I said three times.

What gonna do? You have to know.
I want to know, we want to know.
Let me go down and deep and down,
And deep and down to the bottom of soul.

What gonna do? you have to know.
I want to know, we want to know.
Is it my choice? You ask me once,
You ask me twice, I said three times.

What gonna do? You have to know.
I want to know, we want to know.
Let me go down and deep and down,
And deep and down to the bottom of soul.

I know you. I know what you want!
I know you. I know what you want!
I know you. I know what you want!

What you gonna do? You have to know.
What you gonna do? You have to know. 

What gonna do? you have to know.
I want to know, we want to know.
Is it my choice? You ask me once,
You ask me twice, I said three times.

What gonna do? You have to know.
I want to know, we want to know.
Let me go down and deep and down,
And deep and down to the bottom of soul.

What you gonna do? It's your choice,
Let me go deep to the bottom of soul.
What you gonna do? It's your choice,
Let me go deep to the bottom of soul.

I know you. I know what you want!
I know you. I know what you want!
I know you. I know what you want!

You're so horny.
I have to go.
