		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen a lot of things
I've been a lot of places
I love my diamond rings
I wear my pearls when naked
I think I'm better off
When I do what I fucking want

So don't let me down
Don't take my golden arrow
Don't smear my black mascara

One day I'll have some money
After my funeral, honey
They'll say I was a legend
Gone way too soon for heaven
I'll leave them in suspense
All waiting up just for one kiss

So don't let me down
Don't take my golden arrow
Don't take my head out the crown
I ain't your Cinderella
Don't smear my black mascara

You lost me out by the creek
When you could hardly speak
Say that you'd die for me
So why not give it all away
That's not attention that I crave

I've got too much left to prove
My flowers still want to bloom
No one really has an excuse
No, I can't give it all away
That's not the future that I crave

I've seen a lot of things
I've been a lot of places
I love my diamond rings
I wear my pearls when naked
I think I'm better off
When I do what I fucking want
