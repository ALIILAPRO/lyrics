		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came in the door, checked in my coat
And who I'm looking for is staring in my face, oh
They played our song, we hit the floor, he held me strong
And we danced the night away, oh

I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying, oh-oh-oh-oh

And if he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh
Make you go left, right, up, down
Make you spinning 'round and 'round
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh

And if he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh
Make you go left, right, up, down
Make you spinning 'round and 'round
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh

(You go left, right, up, down)
(Left, right, up, down)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
Sing, ohh, ohh
(You go left, right, up, down)
(Left, right, up, down)
(Like a million dollar bill, sing)
(Oh, babe)

It's been a long, long time
Since I felt that love has found my way, oh
I've been looking (looking)
I've been searching (searching)
For the man to touch this place, oh

I can see the way that he's making me feel
This way about his love
I've been looking for something like this
I'm saying, oh oh oh oh

And if he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh
Make you go left, right, up, down
Make you spinning 'round and 'round
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh

And if he makes you feel like a million dollar bill
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh
Make you go left, right, up, down
Make you spinning 'round and 'round
Sing, ohh, ohh
Sing, ohh, ohh

(You go left, right, up, down)
(Left, right, up, down)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
(You go left, right, up, down)
(Left, right, up, down)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
(You go left, right, up, down)
(Left, right, up, down)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
(You go left, right, up, down)
(Left, right, up, down)
(Like a million dollar bill)
(Sing, ohh, ohh)
