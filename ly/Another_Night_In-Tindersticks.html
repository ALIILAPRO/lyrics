		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Greed's all gone now, there's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ear

Regain your balance
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight

For the love of that girl
Greed's all gone now, panic subsides
When I could run, pulling arms to love her
Try to put myself on the inside
Of the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl

Promise is never over, never questions that needed reply
But she could breathe deep into my neck
Let me know I'm just on the outside

Of the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl
Greed's all gone now, there's no question
And I can see you push your hair behind your ears

Regain your balance
Doesn't matter where she is tonight
Or with whoever she spends her time
If these arms were meant to hold her
They were never meant to hold her so tight

For the love of that girl
Tears swell, you don't know why
For the love of that girl
They never fall, they can never run dry
For the love of that girl
