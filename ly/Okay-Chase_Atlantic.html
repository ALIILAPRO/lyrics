		<p>
		  Yeah, positively thinking got me reaching now
Positive I'm blinking, but I don't know how
Positive an oxy just went in my mouth
Positive I've died tonight, no fucking doubt

Okay, okay, dirty habits well you
Don't say, you don't say I got dirty in my own veins, Cobain
Tryna' stop me, I'm like no way, no way, yeah

Baby, pass the bottle quit with all the stalling
Not sure if I'm breathing I've been Addy rollin'
Catatonic, speeding like this shit was stolen
You wouldn't believe this even if you saw it
Billie Jean, I'm dancing on my own shit
Narcolepsy, you know how it goes shit
Ask me how I'm doing, yeah, I'm coping
I said, "I'm coping"

(All I know is) okay, okay, dirty habits well you
Don't say, you don't say I got dirty in my own veins, Cobain
Tryna' stop me, I'm like no way, no way

All I know is okay, okay
Tryna' fuck me I'm like okay, okay
Pop another I'm like okay, okay
Psychopathic but it's okay, okay

I can feel it in my brain
Hit the tongue, watch it dissolve, just take a taste, yeah
She gonna make decisions either way
I swear ever since I hit it I ain't ever been the same, yeah

Okay, okay, dirty habits well you
Don't say, you don't say I got dirty in my own veins, Cobain
Tryna' stop me, I'm like no way, no way

All I know is okay, okay
Tryna' fuck me I'm like okay, okay
Pop another I'm like okay, okay
Psychopathic but it's okay, okay
