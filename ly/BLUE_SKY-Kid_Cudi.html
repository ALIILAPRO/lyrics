		  Hmm, hmm-hmm, whoa, whoa
Hahaha, yeah (hmm, hmm-hmm)

No pressure on me, pressure on me, walkin', ain't no stressin', you see? (Hmm, hmm-hmm)
They sayin' what they sayin', I'm just sayin', give no fucks what you think (hmm, hmm-hmm)
His own master, people talkin', uh-huh (hmm, hmm-hmm)
Out my way, this blunt won't smoke itself, uh-huh (hmm, hmm-hmm)

Listen close, I hear myself, the intuition, that's what I got (hmm, hmm-hmm)
Many people wonderin' what's up with him, but do they know Scott? (Hmm, hmm-hmm)
A nigga with some new dreams and a sexy mama, uh-huh (hmm, hmm-hmm), I see, let's play

The sky is blue, oh finally, been dreamin' of this for a while (yeah)
The sun is shining, blinding, swimmin' in this place of mine (let's go)
Help me out, pass that blunt, my guy
We're all on a quest to climb, and we're on our way (hmm, hmm-hmm)

Couple days, I'm playin', and I'm layin' on the beach coolin' out (hmm, hmm-hmm)
Askin' myself, "Are you happy?", And I might think this is the route (hmm, hmm-hmm)
The things I thought I needed, please (hmm, hmm-hmm)
Found my peace, oh wait, no turnin' back, whoa (hmm, hmm-hmm)
The days, the weeks, the time, it rushes, it goes (hmm, hmm-hmm)
It's okay, I would say good lacks in the moment you know (hmm, hmm-hmm)
Believin' what a dream, we livin' in a dream, hum, hu-hum, let's play (gi'me, gi'me, yeah)

The sky is blue, oh finally, been dreamin' of this for a while (yeah)
The sun is shining, blinding, swimmin' in this place of mine (yeah)
Help me out, pass that blunt, my guy
We're all on a quest to climb, and we're on our way (ooh-ooh)
The sky is blue, oh finally, been dreamin' of this for a while
The sun is shining, blinding, swimmin' in this place of mine
Help me out, pass that blunt, my guy
We're all on a quest to climb, and we're on our way (yeah)

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah

No pressure on me, pressure on me, walkin', ain't no stressin', you see?
They sayin' what they sayin', I'm just sayin', give no fucks what you think
His own master, people talkin', uh-huh
Out my way, this blunt won't smoke itself, uh-huh
