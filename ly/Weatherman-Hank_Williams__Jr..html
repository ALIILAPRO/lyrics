		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mr weatherman what is your forecast
I need a major change
I can't stand no more rain

Everything's been goin' wrong
Please, tell me it's something in the ozone
Or is the atmospheric pressure
Just too strong?
I can't ride out one more storm


'Cause I've had too many highs
And too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good forecast tonight

'Cause I've had too many highs
And too many lows
Too many storms and tornadoes
I need some blue skies and sunshine
I need a good outlook tonight

Hope your weekend forecast is bright
Hope you got me on your weather eye
