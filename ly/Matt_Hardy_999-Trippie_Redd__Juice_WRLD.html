		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Outtatown, but we never out of money)
Ayy
You know what I'm sayin'? Big 14
(Star Boy, you're my hero)

I just got a million bands today
'Bout to go and spend a bag, blow them bands today, yeah
'Bout to spend a hundred grand today
Lot of blue face hundreds, it's a blue band parade, yeah
Huh, grah, shootin' out the Hummer today
I'm in a bad mood, so I feel like dumping today, yeah
One bad move, I'ma dump at his face
Keep the toolie by my side, feel like Ratchet & Clank, yeah

Shoot out the Wraith, stick up
I need everything in your safe, nigga
Huh, I'm with them grave diggers, we gon' dig your grave, nigga
Pop molly at the rave, nigga, chains on me, no slave, nigga
We've been in the cave, nigga, we done fucking made niggas
Take your chain, nigga, what the fuck you claim, nigga?
1400, 800, bitch, I'm talkin' gang, nigga
We not the same, nigga, Big 14, Great Dane, nigga

Fuck what you claim, nigga
Feel like the KKK, we kill you then we hang niggas
Do that the same day
Pull up in the all gray
Black Mustang
In the streets, I was hustlin'
Run up on me, gun bussin'
Uh, that's your best friend? That's my main thing
Uh, she give me tit-Titi Boi, 2 Chainz
Uh, get to the nitty gritty, boy, new stains
Uh, pouring Prince up in my cup, no Purple Rain
I'm throwing bands, I'm throwing hands and I ain't throwing shade

Jumping out the Batcave
Just like Bruce Wayne
Kicking shit like Liu Kang
My plug Palupe
Big racks on us do thangs
Big blues, no clues, yay
Your bitch like to choose, ayy
But that's your boo, ain't it?
Take a flick, uh
Licky on my dick, uh
On my blick, uh
While I take a shit, uh
And a piss, uh
Sing to that bitch like KISS, uh

Oh, that's your bitch, huh?
R Kelly, I may just piss on her (skrrt)
I'm in a 'Rari
You make me mad-mad, I may shoot up your party
That lil' bitch she bad, but she fake, she a Barbie
But she still know to ride me like a fucking Harley
Ask me if I love her, I respond to her, "Hardly"

Jumping off the top rope in that bitch like Matt Hardy
Why the fuck your pussy ass in here, this a gangster party
What? What? What? Like I'm Playboi Carti
Got my robe on in this bitch, it's a Playboy party
That bitch hella plastic, that bitch just like a Barbie
Playing games with all these hoes, bitch, just like Atari
Kicked up with my feet up, sippin' Hennessey at a safari
With a bunch of white bitches and they all like, "Trippie Redd, you gnarly"
Viral iCarly

She on the webcam like Carly
That's your girl, I'm sorry
She was off the molly
Uh, I'm in the trap, I'm whipping, I got your aunty on my dope
She told me she ain't have enough money for them rocks
My dick up in her throat
I'm going hard, LOL to the bank, no joke
You run up on me, you leaping froggy, you get croaked
Uh, huh, you know?
