		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The light is fading now
My soul is running on a puff that I cannot reach
My brain is turnin'
And my head is hurtin'
Every day a little bit more

The light is fading now
My forces is being sucked by a bloody leach?
My fear is smilin'
And my threat is singin'
Every night a little bit more

I cannot see anything
I am blindfolded

I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's about to cry

I'm a zombie
I don't know what to do
I should be done in the place
But I gotta stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

I'm so lonely
I don't know if I get through
I wanna be floating in space
But I gotta stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's about to cry

I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's about to cry

I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
It's about to cry

I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
I can hear the birds
I can see them fly
I can see the sky
