		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh
(Got the beat by Powers and we just made a banger)
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah

Pull up with the grr, pow, onomatopoeia
Hopping out the 'Burban, big body like Madea
Put some holes in him, now he spotted like a cheetah
How the fuck you living? Good, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I'm with your bitch and her back arched like Tina
Look to the back at you boys, you can't keep up
Bulletproof vest, looking like I'm Vegeta
Quickdraw from my hip, make him dance like Shakira, uh

Spot him outside, hold up, skrrt, hit the breaks, uh
Call him Might Guy, send his ass to the gates, uh
Y'all so pussy to the bone, need a spay, uh
Beat him up, boots to the face, uh
Kxll, why you trippin' like that? I don't like you
Love when my foes get to bolting like a Raichu
Said he wanna get close to God, I could guide you
Money stacked up like the letters on a haiku
D-Dirty lil' bastard, yeah, bitch, I'm rancid
I keep a Glock by my dick where my pants sit
He acting odd, like Cosmo he vanish
Run up, see this shit? Ain't here just to brandish
Lay him down, on top his casket, I'm prancing
Stretching these bands like my money elastic
Sex, money, violence, revenge what I practice
He disrespect, that's a suicide tactic

Uh, I just send a text, she get wet, okay, cool, uh
Say that boy feel vexed, Smith & Wess' correct moods, uh
Insert when erect, pierce cervix, she get skewed, uh
Bullets on Rize, eat your flesh, Tokyo Ghoul (yeah)

Pull up with the grr, pow, onomatopoeia
Hopping out the 'Burban, big body like Madea
Put some holes in him, now he spotted like a cheetah
How the fuck you living? Good, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I'm with your bitch and her back arched like Tina
Look to the back at you boys, you can't keep up
Bulletproof vest, looking like I'm Vegeta
Quickdraw from my hip, make him dance like Shakira, uh, yeah
