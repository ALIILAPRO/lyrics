		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't close my eyes
I never had much choice
I took out my pistol and ran from everyone
The air that's in my lungs
Just like a noose that's strung
Cuts off my blood and brain until I'm like everyone
But I wouldn't hurt you, I'm a STRANGER TONIGHT

I never had much luck
I never had a plan
I'll come right up behind you like death does to everyone
Your neck is warm to touch if I squeeze a little too much
Cuts off your blood and brain until you're like everyone
I wouldn't hurt you, I'm a STRANGER TONIGHT

Now we shan't overcome
Fucked over everyone
As long as I'm alright Jack you don't care about anyone
Our brains are empty shells
But theres no room in hell
We'll wrought the earth with blood and pain to fall on everyone
But I wouldn't hurt you, I'm a STRANGER TONIGHT
