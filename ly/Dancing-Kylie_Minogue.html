		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one wants to stay at home
Nobody wants to be alone
When you come knocking, I'll be at your door

I don't ever wanna stop
I'm gonna give it all I've got
And when they ask me, "who could ask for more?"

Can't stand still
I won't slow down

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out, dancing

This is where I wanna be with you
Your arms wrapped around me
And fireworks reflecting in your eyes
This is how I wanna feel
The wild kiss, the music reeling
Getting down, riding all the highs

Can't stand still
I won't slow down

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out, dancing

Everybody's got a story
Let it be your blaze of glory
Burning bright, never fade away
And when the final curtain falls, we could say we did it all
The never ending of a perfect day

Can't stand still (Can't stand still)
I won't slow down (Won't slow down)

When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah
I wanna go out dancing

I wanna go out
I wanna go out
(I wanna go out dancing)
I wanna go out
I wanna go out
(I wanna go out dancing)
