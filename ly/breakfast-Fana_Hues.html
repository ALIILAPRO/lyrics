		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Must've left my heart where my head is
You said
Gone gone tumbling in and off the deep edge
You let me
Woke up in the wrong day forgot breakfast (mmhm)
Nothing even means anything

Lost track of time
But you stay
Pretty little mind
Daydreaming lullabies (bye bye, bye bye)
Frame, pretty little mind
Lost, lost track of time
But you stay in the frame of my pretty little mind
Glistening, oh, glistening
But I can't stay tethered to a past time of lullabies

Lost lullabies
On my mind, mind

Lost (lost) track of time (lost track of time), mm
But you stay (frame)
In my pretty little mind (mind) 
You stay, you stay, you stay
Daydreaming (day, day dreaming lullabies) lullabies (bye bye, bye bye)
But you stay
In my pretty little mind (mind)

I never dreamed I leave in the summertime (summertime)
Drown with sorrows in our bed
I know this won't make sense
But baby, I hate that we're too lost to find us

Lost track of time (ooh, lost track of time)
Frame (and you stay)
Pretty (pretty little mind) mind (ooh)
Daydreaming lullabies (goodbye, oh stories, goodbye)
Frame, pretty little mind (stories, goodbye)(bye bye, baby) (stories)

Bye bye
Bye bye
