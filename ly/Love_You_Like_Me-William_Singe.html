		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She never calls this late at night, no
But I can tell she's been drinking all night long
She sounds upset, I'm asking baby where you at
I called you earlier but you aint hit me back
She's breaking down, I'm bout to lose it
Im screaming who the fuck were you with
I grab my keys you better tell me where you at
She said she fucked up but theres no taking it back

I gave everything to you
And this is what you turn around and do
Did he have all, all that you wanted
For you to go and break your promise

I wanna know
Every secret you've been hiding
I wanna know 
Just how long have you been lying
I  wanna know
Does he fuck you like I did
I wanna know
And will he love you like I did 

He won't do you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't touch you like me
He won't love you like me, baby 
He won't fuck you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't love you like, he won't love you like me
I wanna know

Girl this aint how its supposed to be
Dancing between someones elses sheets
I can't believe that this is really happening
Your guilty conscious is going to be the death of me
You got so caught up in the moment 
But hell only love you when he's lonely
This aint no game you better tell me where you at
No girl, you fucked up and theres no taking it back

I gave everything to you
And this is what you turn around and do
Did he have all, all that you wanted
For you to go and break your promise

I wanna know
Every secret you've been hiding
I wanna know 
Just how long have you been lying
I  wanna know
Does he fuck you like I did
I wanna know
And will he love you like I did 

He won't do you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't touch you like me,
He won't love you like me, baby 
He won't fuck you like me
He won't love you like me, baby
He won't love you like, he won't love you like me
I wanna know

I gave everything to you
I gave everything to you
And this is what you turn around and do
Did he have all, all that you wanted
For you to go and break your promise
