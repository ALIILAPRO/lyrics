		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving through the desert looks alright
Driving through the desert looks alright
Going to the place where all the lights shine on

Going fast, that's the way we go
Going fast, that's the way we go
Going to the place where all the lights shine on

Try to follow us and you will get lost
Try to follow us and you will get lost
Going to the place where all the lights shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on

The cops are on our tail but that's alright
The cops are on our tail but that's alright
We won't pull over and that's it

Fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
