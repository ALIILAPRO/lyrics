		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a sun, there's a ground under my feet
There is almost nothing in between
Now I'm left like a flag atop a moon
Precious one, you have abandoned me

Oh, so let me in
Because I'm out
I know that I am someone
No one said I was, no one said I was

Should I call you
Should I reach out?
It feels like chasing shadows in the night
Yeah let me in
Because I'm out
I know that I am someone
No one said I was, no one said I was, no one said I was

Thrown away, have I been thrown away?
Thrown away, have I been thrown away?

There's a sun, there's a ground under my feet
There is almost nothing in between
Now I'm left like a flag atop a moon
Precious one, you have abandoned me

Oh, so let me in
Because I'm out
I know that I am someone
No one said I was, no one said I was, no one said I was

Thrown away, have I been thrown away?
Thrown away, have I been thrown away?
