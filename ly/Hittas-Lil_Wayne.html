		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it true you performed with Willie Nelson at the Country Music Awards?
I don't know, but I know I did perform at this bad ass bitch birthday party recently 
She was crazy, stupid thick

Mack in here, Scoob here in here with me

Tell them hoes get they mind right, tell them niggas back up
Man, I heard the truth is hard to swallow, do you have cups?
Used the rope to hang myself to tie a money bag up
Tell 'em get they iron right before Iron-Man come
Tell 'em bring my car around
Tell 'em bitches lap up
I'ma cut this music down
Tell 'em put they AP's up
Tell 'em throw they pride out
Roll them windows back up

Money in the air, who say white men can't jump?
Catch that nigga late night on the phone at a gas pump
Let me get the phone and the car once it's gassed up
Ak-47 make a sittin' duck stand up
I could let it blast, but I much rather have one
Tell 'em bring my car around
Tell 'em bitches lap up
Then them hoes get passed down
Then them hoes get passed up
Sittin' on this money to me feel like a cactus
I'm stickin' to this shit
You would've been have hopped yo' ass up

Tell 'em, I got hittas whoadie (hittas whoadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty whoadie (plenty whoadie)
I got hittas whoadie (hittas whoadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty whoadie

I got hittas whoadie
Yeah I got plenty whoadie
And they just wait for the word
This shit like Wheel of Fortune
Goddamn, these snitches nosy
Goddamn, these snitches nosy
Nigga, I'm a ass with that semi
Call me semicolon
Yeah I got hittas whoadie
Yeah I got plenty whoadie
They kick the door and kill yo' ass 
And leave the children snoring
I'm sippin' lean out a glass
Make me feel important
I made some green in the past 
And now it's good as golden
Yeah

Clearly, Lil' Wayne answers to no one

Tell 'em, I got hittas whoadie (hittas whoadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty whoadie (plenty whoadie)
I got hittas whoadie (hittas whoadie)
I got, yeah I got plenty whoadie

I'm so lifted, I'm so lifted 
I wrote my will in hieroglyphics
Weezy, where you been? The people miss you
Crickets
I got hittas and they not kidders
That's my niggas
You got niggas but they not hittas
They got jitters, they get hit up
I'm placin' figures on your niggas
Takin' bidders, yo' bae yo' niggas

Don't make a difference
I got shooters, on pharmaceut'
They armed and brutal
Armed intruders, 'cause we don't doodle
We draw conclusions
I got sprayers, all type of sprayers
We gon' need Google
I got paper, on top of paper
We gon' need rulers
I'm effective, been doin' numbers since Roman numerals
Strong as sumo, we armed as usual
My hittas hungry
Charleston Chew you, bazookas chew you
Just like Bazookas, don't confuse 'em
We only hittas, y'all only humans
Don't get hit up, whoadie
'Cause I got hittas, whoadie

He's a very small child
And I just said he was a genius, you know what I'm sayin'?
Which I used to pray, and ask the Lord to send me one
You know, he did
He say he's so smart, I can't teach him nothin'
He's, he's done been here before
