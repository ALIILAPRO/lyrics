		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here kitty, kitty
There's too much demon blood
In these self appointed angels
Acting like you're comatose
Speaking like a country rose
Or a preacher's pet in drag

Banging on a kettledrum
Won't make you notice me
Though you're bored beyond belief
Suckin' on an old mans thumb
Man it makes me feel so numb
Gonna teach you how to how to make it feel good

I'll be your nightmare mirror
Do what you do to me
I'll be your nightmare mirror
Colder than a steel blade

Get them while they're younger
Yeah, someone told me that
But man I never saw it commin'
Gonna let myself go soon
Man, I'm gonna tear it down
And maybe take my kitty with me

Girl you need some discipline
Girl you need some medicine
Even though my heart is breaking
Never gonna straight you up
Oh my god, what's wrong with me
Can't seem to teach you how to make it feel good

I'll be your nightmare mirror
Do what you do to me
I'll be your nightmare mirror
Colder than a steel blade

I'll be your nightmare mirror
Do what you do to me
I'll be your nightmare mirror
Colder than a steel blade
