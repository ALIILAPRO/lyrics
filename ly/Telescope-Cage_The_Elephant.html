		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a far and distant galaxy
Inside my telescope, I see
Pair of eyes peer back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
Sits around inside his house
From room to room, he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things
And wonders how it all turns out

Do-do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breakin'
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
Or time I've wasted
Don't waste it

Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
Too terrified to find a thing
He battens all the hatches down
And wonders why he hears no sounds
Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

Do-do-do-do, do
Do-do-do-do, do
It's safe to say that

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
The walls keep breakin'
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
Or time I've wasted

Here in my mind, losin' my friends
Fall on my face, do it again
You say, "How do you do?"
Man, how 'bout you? Man, how 'bout you?
To be free, to be sold
To be killed, to be safe
In my head, I'm alone
I'm not dead, I'm ashamed
Just like you, I've been trying to escape
In my bones, I feel cold
I give thanks to the Lord
Industry, in the street
Let me go, let me be
I don't need to be here
I'm alone, can't you see? Can't you see?

I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
These walls keep breakin'
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
Or time I've wasted
Don't waste it
