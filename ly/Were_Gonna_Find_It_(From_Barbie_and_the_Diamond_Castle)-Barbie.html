		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we are, far from home
A little bit hungry and a little alone
But it's alright
Yes, it's alright

'Cause in this room, there might be friends
Can't see how the story ends
But it's alright
Yeah, it's alright

We can start a new

Can't go back so we gotta go on
We'll stick together, staying strong
There's a diamond castle in my mind
And someday soon
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it

Somehow things are looking up
Feeling like we've changed our luck
I can see life, in a new light

Can't stay long (can't stay long)
Passing through (passing through)
Don't know where we're going to
But it's alright
'Cause we just might
Find a way that's true (find a way that's true)

Can't go back, so we gotta go on (gotta go on)
We'll stick together, staying strong (staying strong)
There's a diamond castle in my mind
And someday soon
We're gonna find it 
We're gonna find it 

We're gonna find the perfect place for us to be
And hear our melody set free
Climb the highest mountain just to see

To see

Can't go back; so we gotta go on (gotta go on)
We'll stick together, staying strong (staying strong)
There's a diamond castle in my mind (in my mind)
And someday soon
We're gonna find it

Can't go back, so we gotta go on (gotta go on)
We'll stick together, staying strong
There's a diamond castle in my mind (in my mind)
And someday soon
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it
We're gonna find it

Someday soon
