		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, yeah yeah 

I've been waiting all day here for ya bae
So won't you come sit and talk to me
You tell me how we're gonna be together always
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to a pillow tight
And think about how you promised me forever

I never thought that anyone (mm) could make me feel this way (uh)
Now that you're here boy all I want is just a chance to say

Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone
'Cause I know about her (who?)
And I wonder (why?) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)

Tell me why you looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy you must've gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone

So now after all is said and done
Maybe I'm the one to blame but
To think that you could be the one
Well, it didn't work out that way

Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (move)
And I wonder (why?) how I bought all the lies (all the lies)
You said that you would treat me right ('cause you)
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)

I wanted you right here with me
But I have no choice you've got to leave
Because my heart is breaking 
With every word I'm saying, I gave up everything I had (oh)
On something that just wouldn't last (oh)
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these eyes (oh, oh)

Get out
Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me (you and me)
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (move)
And I wonder (why?) how I bought all the lies (how did I buy all these lies?)
You said that you would treat me right 
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)(oh)

Get out (leave) right now
It's the end of you and me (hey yeah)
It's too late (now) and I can't wait for you to be gone (you to be gone)
'Cause I know about her (move)
And I wonder (why?) how I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right (treat me right)
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time) (oh yeah)

Get out (leave) (you and me)
It's too late (too late) (now)
About her (move) (why?)
You said that you would treat me right (no)
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time) (oh, ooh, oh)
