		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stick stick stick
Pretty bitch on a big dick
Tryna ride that shit
Hit a lick I don't miss shit
I don’t like the cake so I call that shit bisquick
Nose so runny shawty so sound sick sick
Let it hit let it rip let her drip
I don’t wanna talk about a bitch
No lip with some change and gorilla grip
Pop that shit like ayyy
Motherfucker ion lover
Ace of spades with triple double
Imma take your sisters mother
Beat cho bitch ass with a shovel
Yo mama don’t like me I’m some trouble
With some Jordan threes I’m like mike
Like mike
But the tires they creased on my bike
My bike
My chopper best friend say sike
Danger in this place
Tell the other motherfuckers get back
Get back
Miss my kids
But they all up on her face and her back
He tryna rap just just like this
But a motherfucker ain’t got no gift
He thinks that we are same
But the diamonds don’t dance on his wrist uh uh
I eat it up like a kid on Halloween
I eat Oreo chips like cookies
I don’t really give a fuck
I got pistols in the trunk
I might go and get real drunk
I like the fuckery watch me while I strut
Stick stick stick
Pretty bitch on a big dick
Tryna ride that shit
Hit a lick I don’t miss shit
I don’t like the cake so I call that shit bisquik
Nose so runny shawty so sound sick sick
Let it hit let it rip let her drip
I don’t wanna talk about a bitch
No lip with some change and gorilla grip
Pop that shit like ayyy
