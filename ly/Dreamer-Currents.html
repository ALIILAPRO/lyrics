		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sit here counting the days

It starts to weigh so heavily
And these thoughts keep running around my head as I keep spinning and spinning
You have to chose; does this path from the past mean the world to you? On time, too late or too soon, will you be ready for your vision when it comes true?

Voracious, and you're out of your mind, always grabbing onto things that'll eat you alive. It's not the first proposition, it's the best. Everything is a test. Everything is a test. You don't know who you're talking to, I'll destroy your life and blame it on you. And as you think it stands, you're dead without me, so I can. You don't understand

I'm stepping back from what I know is the truth, I just don't feel the way I used to
I'd turn my back if you would follow me. We could just run away, we could just run away

I feel like I'm obsessed, when I'm torn apart is when I'm at my best
I'm not good at faking where I wanna be
It's my heart or my sanity
Stuck in your head. Going over the things that you should've said
On time, too late or too soon; will you be ready for your vision when it comes true? Cause when it does, it'll swallow you
I fear the burden of truth

Voracious, and you're out of your mind, always grabbing onto things that'll eat you alive. It's not the first proposition, it's the best. Everything is a test. Everything is a test. You don't know who you're talking to, I'll destroy your life and blame it on you. And as you think it stands, you're dead without me, so I can. You don't understand

I'm stepping back from what I know is the truth, I just don't feel the way I used to
I'd turn my back if you would follow me. We could just run away, we could just run away

Let them promise you the world, but don't you take it. Cause when you give them what they ask, they'll turn their backs
It's a sham
A sham. A sham, it's all a fucking sham. Turn away and run from this as fast as you can. Don't let them force you to become their hand
Don't let this slip through your hands.
