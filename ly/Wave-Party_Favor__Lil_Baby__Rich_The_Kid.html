Hol 'up

I done caught a wave
She bout to get slayed
She know I don't play
I look like I get cake
Bitch I'm the key to my section
I'm trying to keep it refreshing
I got a pill, it's an X (X)
Soon as she take it, she necking
Running to the sack like a linebacker
I be on your bitch, I'm a mindtracker
I don't want your bitch, nigga, mine better
Brand new Maserati, yeah, mine faster
Everything up to date
All my jury water link
Told you I don't go on dates
We ain't fucking, you can skate
Dj pulled off midnight
Hoe deep throat by mid flight
Put your glass to the sky, it's a good life
If a shark in the water, I'm a great white
You don't sip right, I'ma sit right
I don't like that cat, it don't look right
Put your seat belt on, it's a rough ride
I don't miss no bitch, I miss flights

Hundred bottles in the section, everybody lit
Audemars and new Pateks, everybody rich (Rich)
Boy, that chick looking at me, come and get your bitch
If she leave out of here with me, on the game she getting dick

I'm in all white like a preacher
I'm in the coupe with an eater (skrrt)
I'm in the trap, got a beaper
I got a bitch, don't need her
I count up a milli, a long day
I pull up the Masi', the long way
I fucked the bitch, she did the wrong way
I put the Rollie on Ice Age
Drink out the bottle, it's lit (lit)
Fucking the model, it's lit (lit)
Need some more bottles, it's lit (lit)
She wanna swallow, it's lit (lit) (woo, woo)
Drink out the bottle, it's lit, ay (lit)
Fucking the model, it's lit, ay (lit)
Need some more bottles, it's lit (lit, lit, lit, lit)

Hundred bottles in the section, everybody lit
Audemars and new Pateks, everybody rich (everybody rich)
Boy, that chick looking at me, come and get your bitch
If she leave out of here with me (if she leave out here with me)
On the game she getting dick (she getting dick)

Hol' up, brand new 'Rari, sitting outside, me and my dawgs (ay)
Thirty five hundred, brand new wall, me and my dawgs (skrrt)
Brand new 'Rari, sitting outside, me and my dawgs (ay)
Thirty five hundred, brand new wall, me and my dawgs (me and my dawgs, yup)
