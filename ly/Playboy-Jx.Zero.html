		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is America, my president is Black
And my Lambo is blue, nigga
Now get the fuck out my hotel room
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, uh, uh

She treat me pretty like a playboy, don't play, boy, you twenty-one
I was fifteen, shoppin' for them chains, boy
Early as a jit in diapers, some shit had to change, boy
Not like these other niggas, I get cake, no, I don't play, boy

You heard how I'm havin'
I can't hang 'round here, face savage
Want these streets so bad, they cappin'
I can't say I'm from the hood
Just know I'm armed and ready, packin'
Pops said, "they can't catch you lackin'
Long as you move how your rappin'"
In the shadows like I'm Batman
And that shit brought me traction
We're really 'bout that action
It's more than Gucci fashion
My back was damn near in the wall and I ain't never back in
My neck was damn near in the rope and I ain't never tap in
Oh, he think he God, come show me somethin'
Seen red and blue, don't know 'bout nothin'
Come get your bitch, I see her crushin'
What you rollin'? Woods, Russian
Is she bad? No, I'm crushin'
You gon' stop with all that fussin'
Came up grindin', ain't had nothin', uh

She treat me pretty like a playboy, don't play, boy, you twenty-one
I was fifteen, shoppin' for them chains, boy
Early as a jit in diapers, some shit had to change, boy
Not like these other niggas, I get cake, no, I don't play, boy

Uh, uh, uh, uh
I done been back to back
But I'm still gonna break her back
And I'm still gonna get these racks
Been broke and I put this on my bro, you won't see me back
I held my hand out for niggas, all that did was hold me back
Shit, Jx, why you spitting all these facts?
Just the truth of me, otherwise I'm fuckin' holding back
Sorry, I can't be your man
I'm sorry, she a fuckin' fan
Uh, I get bread, all these fuckin' bands
I was seven years old, on God, I knew I was the man
Shit, dropped outta school, I ain't never had no fuckin' plan
Got my boy, he 5'2", but he shoot like NBA Jam
Oh, you need help, tough
I was down bad, I don't recall you ever giving a fuck
Even when I'm on my ass, I still ain't had enough
And she can't fly on private jets 'cause she not bad enough

Uh, uh
I get the uh, uh, uh, uh
I get the uh, uh, uh, uh
I get the uh, uh, uh, uh
Aw, damn
I get the uh, uh, uh, uh
I get the uh, uh, uh, uh
I get the uh, uh, uh, uh
