		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see me stuntin', I know that it hurt you (I know that it hurt you)
I keep gettin' money, I know that it hurt you (I know that it hurt you)
See me go up and I know that it hurt you (I know that it hurt you)
I'ma keep stuntin' I know that it hurt you
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

I told them to spray you but I could've murked you
I did a commercial but didn't go commercial
My circle so small you can't fit in my circle (it's Gucci)
I'm riddin' in a Maybach commissioned by Virgil
I threw bait at the bitch and she bit it like a turtle (bit)
I can't fuck her raw 'cause her pussy too fertile (nah)
Penthouse on the beach and I ain't talkin' murder (nah)
If you interview Gucci don't ask him 'bout murders (grraow)
Mask on protect he got shot in the girdle (well, damn)
Say he got beef with me I never heard of
Rockin' some kicks that don't come out 'til April
This bitch droppin' songs who got kicked out the label (wow)
How you gon' bite who put food on the table? (Huh)
Fam against family shit, Caine versus Abel (damn)
Why you keep beggin'? Don't watch me watch cable
Say Guwop fell off, man, that boy told a fable (well, damn)

You see me stuntin', I know that it hurt you
I keep gettin' money, I know that it hurt you (it's Gucci)
See me go up and I know that it hurt you 
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you
Money gettin' longer and it's only gettin' worse
Game elevated I'm a whole 'nother person
I'ma keep stuntin' I know that it hurt you 
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you (it's Gucci)

Got so much cash I can build me safe house
I'm buildin' a new house it's bigger than Drake house (wow)
A nigga play with me I'm bringin' the Drac' out
Rock so much water, turn the clothes to a lake house (burr)
I ain't gotta worry about the police doin' steak out
Got a private chef won't even eat take out (nah)
I remember I was eatin' lobster first day out 
Whole lotta crabs in the bucket didn't make out (crabs)
I know some killers got life on a break out
I had to sack up the bud, take the shake out 
We ain't had no goal in the hood, brought the crate out
Floor full of money, make the ho bring the rake out (well, damn)
Rob with no gun, he got beat, knock his lights out
Took a juice off for the morn' now we iced out (bling)
He fucked his bitch, now he mad, wanna fight now
Thought he was the man but he told, he a mice now (mice)
You ain't piped up like that, you need to pipe down
Lyrics all cap need to go put the mic down (cap)
Bullets fly by this shit windy like Chi-Town
Don't sleep on the A-Town, this shit ain't no playground
Like I said niggas better get down and lay down
When shots fire niggas better get down and stay down
Always knew I would come up 'cause I stay down
It ain't my birthday but I still bring the cake 'round (it's Gucci)

You see me stuntin', I know that it hurt you
I keep gettin' money, I know that it hurt you
See me go up and I know that it hurt you 
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you
Money gettin' longer and it's only gettin' worse
Game elevated I'm a whole 'nother person
I'ma keep stuntin' I know that it hurt you 
I know that it hurt you, I know that it hurt you

My dawg just gave me some great advice 
He told me go harder
It's Gucci
Burr
