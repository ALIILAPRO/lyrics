		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)

They might say, "Hi" and I might say, "Hey"
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Nothin' on you baby (yeah)

No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe
No-nothin' on you (yeah)
I know you feel where I'm comin' from (from)
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done (done)
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun (fun)
On the carousel, so around I spun (spun)
With no directions just tryna get some (some)
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun (sun)
And so I lost more than I had ever won (won)
And honestly I ended up with none (huh)

There's so much nonsense
It's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering
If there was something that you wanna know (something that you wanna know)
But never mind that we should let it go (we should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts just let them go (go, go, go)

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
Nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
They might say, "Hi" (hi) and I might say, "Hey" (hey)
But you shouldn't worry about what they say (why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
Nothin' on you baby
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you) (yeah) 

Hands down there will never be another one (nope)
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style I ain't really got nothin' on (nothin')
And you out and you ain't got nothin' on?
Baby, you the whole package plus you pay your taxes (huh)
And you keep it real while them other stay plastic (facts)
You're my Wonder Woman call me Mr. Fantastic (ha)
Stop, now think about it

I've been to London (yeah), I've been to Paris (yeah)
Even went out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (yeah) to New Orleans (yeah)
But you always steal the show (steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well, now you know (know, know, know)

Beautiful girls all over the world (all over)
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted (haha)
They got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
Nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
They might say, "Hi" (hi) and I might say, "Hey" (hey)
But you shouldn't worry about what they say (why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
Nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)(yeah)

Everywhere I go I'm always hearing your name (name, name)
And no matter where I'm at, girl, you make me wanna sing (sing)
Whether a bus or a plane (plane) or a car or a train (train)
No other girls on my brain and you the one to blame (blame)(yeah)

Beautiful girls all over the world (all over)
I could be chasing but my time would be wasted (why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
Nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
They might say, "Hi" (hi) and I might say, "Hey" (hello)
But you shouldn't worry about what they say (why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you)
Nothin' on you, baby (ooh, ooh, ooh)
(No-no-no-nothin' on you, babe)
(No-nothin' on you) (yeah)

Yeah and that's just how we do it, ha ha
And I'ma let this ride
B-O-B and Bruno Mars
