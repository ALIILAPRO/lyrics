		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
It's another one (yeah)
Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

Why you so fine with it?
I'ma take my time with it
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours
Watch me slip and slide with it
Might just change your life with it
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours

Girl, you gotta know that I want you
You could see it how I'm pressin' on you
Never sweatin' them but you a sauna
Never give me drama
Bringin' that good energy 'cause you top shelf, number one designer (ayy)
Why you put these bitches on skates? (Yeah)
Nobu, baby, ain't no cheap dates (nah)
Take you home and put you on a plate
It's my birthday, come and put the cake on my face, yeah

(Slide) anytime you want it A.M., P.M., ayy
(Slide) hocus pocus, turn you to my BM, ayy
(Ride) curvin' all them niggas in your DM
Like we could be somethin', oh

If I call you one day in the mornin'
Not only when I'm horny
Not only when I'm lonely
If I let you drive, then drive the foreign
Just know that you important
Just know that you go

Why you so fine with it?
I'ma take my time with it
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours
Watch me slip and slide with it
Might just change your life with it
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours

What hoes? I've been single for a reason (ayy)
Say the word, we'll be cuffin' every season (it's Eazy)
You my twin flame, never leavin' you
Just believe in me like I believe in you, ooh-woah, ooh-woah

(Slide) anytime you want it A.M., P.M., ayy
(Slide) hocus pocus, turn you to my BM, ayy
(Ride) curvin' all them niggas in your DM
Like we could be somethin', oh, ooh-woah

If I call you one day in the mornin'
Not only when I'm horny
Not only when I'm lonely (that's an Eazy call)
If I let you drive, then drive the foreign
Just know that you important
Just know that you go

Why you so fine with it?
I'ma take my time with it
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours (all yours)
Watch me slip and slide with it
Might just change your life with it (come and change my life)
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes (hoes)
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours (yours)
Why you so fine with it? (Fine)
I'ma take my time with it (time)
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes (hoes) (yeah)
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours (that's right)
Watch me slip and slide with it (with it)
Might just change your life with it (life)
If I go and drop, drop, drop these hoes
You gon' have to drop, drop, drop all yours
