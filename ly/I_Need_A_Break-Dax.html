		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  LexNour love is a drug that I can't quit
It's destroying me

I sit and cry in my room
 my heart's been broken
Suffocating, feels like I'm chokin'
I don't know what to do
I'm just prayin' that this pain goes away
Drinkin', taking shots to the face
How you love me, if you always playin' games?
Wanna leave but I feel trapped inside a cage
I just think I need a break, haa

How'd you do this?
We were supposed to live in perfect harmony
I got half of you, you got all of me
Miscommunicating, girl, just talk to me
Ah, how you let you get to this?
How you let my friend hit?
If there's no loyalty, girl
There is no relationship
Yeah, so I think I'm gonna
Have to take a break
So I think I'm gonna have to

I sit and cry in my room
My heart's been broken (Been broken)
Suffocating, feels like I'm chokin'
(I can't breath) i don't know what to do
I'm just prayin' that this pain goes away
(Goes away)
Drinkin', taking shots to the face
How you love me, if you always playin' games?
(Playin' games)
Wanna leave but I feel trapped inside a cage
(Inside a cage)
I just think I need a break, haa

This is stupid, don't stop crying now
I feel you lose it
Had my heart and then you abused it
All my scary dreams, I think I'm losin' (Uhm)
My heart is scattered in many pieces
Broken I think it's bleedin'
Now I have no feelings

I sit and cry in my room
My heart's been broken (Been broken)
Suffocating, feels like I'm chokin'
(I can't breath) i don't know what to do
I'm just prayin' that this pain goes away
(Goes away)
Drinkin', taking shots to the face
How you love me, if you always playin' games?
(Playin' games)
Wanna leave but I feel trapped inside a cage
(Inside a cage)
I just think I need a break, haa
I just think I need a break, haa
I just think I need a break, haa
I just think I need a break, haa
I just think I need a break, haa

I sit and cry in my room
My heart's been broken
Suffocating, feels like I'm chokin'
I don't know what to do
I'm just prayin' that this pain goes away
Yeah, it's Dax
