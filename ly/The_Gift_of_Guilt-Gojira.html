		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We leave the shores to see the mountains rising
A distant impression grwoing
This judgement creates the pain in we hold
Destructive intentions that serve no purpose

But the end of us all
These vultures from the past, coming
In all the hells and worlds, the time has come
Delivered from their eyes

Embrace, suffer, destroy, gift of guilt
The shame and sorrow, self-condemnation
Fill all the gaps and the spaces, unyielding
Bestowed upon us, devastating power

We're building connective tissue to a maze of lies
We're left as starving orphans
The vital core is gone
Our sins are all over and over again we swallow

We're sick and tired when this wind blows
The reflex is insane
We must forgive and stop blaming ourselves for this love
These vultures from the past, coming

In all the hells and worlds, the time has come
Delivered from their eyes
I'm leaving this behind, the gift of guilt
