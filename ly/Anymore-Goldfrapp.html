		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're what I want
You're what I need
Give me your love
Make me a freak

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Your scent, like storms
Is wild divine
I want your love
All of the time

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Connect me
To the other side
Connect me
To the other side

Your strange music
Like lucid dreams
The power of you
Transforming me

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait anymore

Connect me
To the other side
Connect me
To the other side

Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now
Don't stop now, don't stop now

I can't wait, I can't wait anymore (Don't stop now)
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore (Don't stop now)
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore (Don't stop now)
I can't wait, I can't wait anymore (Don't stop now, don't stop now)
