		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't do this for the riches
I'm infected, my condition is I'm always in my head
These words are my religion
I'm obsessed, it's by decision
I'ma do this till I'm dead

Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire, whoa, whoa
I'm still alive
I'm still a, I'm still alive, whoa
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Higher, faster, everlasting
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Higher, faster, never-crashing
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

I do this with conviction
I write truths and never fiction
My disease is what you fed
I can't stop with my ambition
Like a missile on a mission
I'm a force that you will dread

Set me on fire
Set me on, set me on fire, whoa, whoa
I'm still alive
I'm still a, I'm still alive, whoa
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead
Bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm not dead, I'm not dead

Stronger, stronger, everlasting
Higher, faster, never-crashing
Stronger, stronger, everlasting
Higher, faster, never-crashing

Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Stronger (bet you thought that I was dead)
(But I'm not dead, I'm not dead)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
Stronger (bet you thought that I was dead)
(But I'm not dead, I'm not dead)
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Whoa oh, whoa oh
Bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life
