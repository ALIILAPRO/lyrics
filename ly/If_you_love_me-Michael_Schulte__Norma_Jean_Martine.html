		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I never said the things that I said?
What if you heard it in the way that I meant?
Would we still be here in the ruins of a perfect life?
Why don't we go back to the moment when it all felt right?

Can you hold me just a little bit closer?
I'm not ready to admit that we're over
We're just breakin', we're not broke
If you love me, don't let me go
Just keep hangin' on a little bit longer
'Cause the pain is only gonna get stronger
I can't take this on my own
If you love me, if you love me, don't let me go, hmm

We could be in Heaven if we make it through Hell
And here right now will be a story we tell
'Bout how we made it out when we couldn't see a clear way through
It's better than regrettin' that we gave up on it all too soon

Can you hold me just a little bit closer?
I'm not ready to admit that we're over
We're just breakin', we're not broke
If you love me, don't let me go
Just keep hangin' on a little bit longer
'Cause the pain is only gonna get stronger
I can't take this on my own
If you love me, if you love me, don't let me go
If you love me, if you love me, don't let me go

I can't take it anymore now
I keep holdin' on, holdin' on, ohh

Can you hold me just a little bit closer?
I'm not ready to admit that we're over
We're just breakin', we're not broke
If you love me, don't let me go
Just keep hangin' on a little bit longer
'Cause the pain is only gonna get stronger
I can't take this on my own
If you love me, if you love me, don't let me go (don't let me go)
If you love me, if you love me, don't let me go

If you love me, don't let me go
If you love me, don't let me go
