		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn me Father, for I must sin

Four centuries of this damned immortality 
Yet, I did not ask to be made
Why? 
I will never again feel your sun upon my face 
Or the comfort of a grave 
I am not alive and I am not dead 
This is Hell on earth 

How can I possibly explain this eternal youth?
When I can do nothing, but sit by 
As my loves grow old and wither 
And with each of them, take a fragment of my heart 
and prolong this endless winter 
It is October's perpetual agony 
It is the shadow realm 

Father, please forgive him 
For he knows not what to do 

With every victim I pray for my own death 
And as much as I love the night 
I curse the moons eerie glow 
This blood lust that drags me forever 
The toxic rays of dawn that condemn me to limbo 
I am forced to dwell in gray Autumnal twilight 
I am suspended in dusk 

Father, please forgive him 
For he knows not what to do 
Father, please forgive him 
For he knows not what to do
