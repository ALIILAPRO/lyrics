		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ignorance breeds fear, breeds hate, breeds violence
Everything falls down and breaks in silence
We could forgive and then forget and start over
We could finally try it stone cold sober
No more dark clouds over the horizon

We killed it in cold blood
Did it for so long
God rest her soul
Until there was no love
Until it was all gone
Nothing could grow
We killed it in cold blood

Loneliness is the curse of the broken hearted
I came undone and you just fell apart
Maybe some distance can heal us both now
We had it one but we lost it somehow
Maybe the dark clouds are finally behind us

We killed it in cold blood
Did it for so long
God rest her soul
Until there was no love
Until it was all gone
Nothing could grow
We killed it in cold blood
Blood

Ignorance breeds, hate breeds violence
Everything breaks down in silence
Your ignorance breeds hate, breeds violence
Everything breaks down in silence

We killed it in cold blood
Did it for so long
God rest her soul
Until there was no love
Until it was all gone
Nothing could grow

We killed it in cold blood
Did it for so long
God rest her soul
Until there was no love
Until it was all gone
Nothing could grow

We killed it in cold blood
We killed it in cold blood
