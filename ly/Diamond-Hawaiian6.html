		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, my dear sadness
Because you are always
by my side
I can feel the happiness
Even from the sunlight
I soak up in the dawn
Thank you my dear happiness
Because you are always
right by my side
I can shed a tear from my heart
Even to the birds
flying across the sunset
All your tears
And all your worries
Will turn into a smile someday
So Keep your head up high
A tiny litlle stone that
you keep safely in your heart
Will turn into a shiny gem
some day
Everything will be fine
All the chagrin All the sadness
The crucifix you carry behind
May be it's in your way now
But that's what makes you smile
All the thank
All the last goodbyes
All the tears you kept behind
Maybe it's just sadness now
But it all makes us strong
If you live the way you are
You will shine on someday
Even it's still warped
You'll shine like a diamond

If there is no sadness
in this world
All the smiles in the world
will be gone
If there is no happiness
in this world
All of us will be gone
The world goes around
'coz of every thing
We can smile 'coz of you
All the chagrin All the sadness
The crucifix you carry behind
May be it's in your way now
But that's what makes you smile
All the thank
All the last goodbyes
All the tears you kept behind
Maybe it's just sadness now
But it all makes us strong
When we turn in to a star
Every tiny little things
Will be our guiding star
of tomorrow
That is the light that
shine our future
Brighter than a Diamond
Every little thing is a
Diamond for us
