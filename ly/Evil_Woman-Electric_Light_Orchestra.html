		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made a fool of me
But them broken dreams have got to end

Hey, woman, you got the blues
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame

Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman

Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hard to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do?
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feelin' pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train (train)

Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman 

(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman 

Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny, how you broke me up
You made the wine, now you drink a cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go

Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman 

Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)
Evil woman (such an evil woman)
