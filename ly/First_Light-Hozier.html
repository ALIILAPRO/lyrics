		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One bright morning changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathing
You wake
Your eyes open at first a thousand miles away
But turning shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believing in
Could this be how every day begins?

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light

One bright morning goes so easy
Darkness always
Finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to calling out your name
But after this I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again

The sky set to burst
The gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup
The sun coming up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
