		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And then I found how to be what you want
I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep 
And now it’s too late
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground
Breaking the same old ground

So you think that I asked for this
Let me show you
What I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this
Come on
Use your fist

And then I found how to be what you want
When I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep 
And now it’s too late
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground
Breaking the same old ground
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground

So you think that I asked for this
Well, let me show you
What I think of your lips
And you think that I asked for this
Come on
Use your fist

When I found how to be what you want
I was out looking for something new
Digging too deep 
Now it’s too late
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground
We just keep on
Breaking the same old ground

Shh
Shh
I am owned by death
And
I’m in love with oblivion
I am owned by death
And
I’m in love with oblivion
