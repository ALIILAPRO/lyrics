		  OG Parker
And my nigga G. Ry
I say 

Fuck all my bitches old friends (yeah, yeah)
Y'all let that girl fuck anybody (no, oh, yeah, yeah)
She out here catchin' every body (body)
Told her not to lean on anybody
Told her not to be seen with anybody
It's gon' be so hard to claim back that body when I want it, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I was to take her out the game
Who's to fuckin' blame? What's my fuckin' name?
Yeah (PARTY) y'all was her model roles (ooh) only let her do wrongs (ooh)
On my name

I hate when a cute girl see a bad bitch
And try to get the bad bitch to do average shit, yeah
And on my name
Hate when a bad bitch can act real dumb
Every time she throw a little tantrum
She wanna fuck another nigga in vain, oh
On my name
I can speak about it, real out loud
'Cause I done fucked these bitches wearing these other rappers niggas chains, I don't tell you
I'm the H-N-I-C
I'm not from Spellman, I ain't got to tell you what that mean
And I can sit right here, all out like the Source Awards
And then these niggas come and show me love (show me love)
But bitches wet like Fiji when Big P step in the club (club)
Bitches when they see me, all they greet me, show me love
I'm with bitches wearin' VVs, flawless, they don't fuck with scrubs, yeah
But I just need my shawty back, yeah, yeah
Richer than I ever was
And when I call, pick up, don't let your friends answer, those bitches broke

Fuck all my bitches old friends (fuck her old friends, yeah, yeah)
Y'all let that girl fuck anybody (yeah, yeah)
She out here catchin' every body (yeah)
Told her not to lean on anybody
Told her not to be seen with anybody
It's gon' be so hard to claim back that body when I want it, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I wants to take her out the game (I'm supposed to take her)
Who's to fuckin' blame? (Take her) What's my fuckin' name?
Yeah (it's PARTY) y'all was her model role (ooh) only let her do wrong (ooh)

On my name, fuck the fame
You knew what I was all about, Manny
I tell you that I loved that girl
I was in, I was out, speakin' candid (speakin' candid)
And your common sense seem to vanish, oh
I always knew I had a bad bitch and everybody's tryna bag it (oh-whoa, ooh-whoa, oh)
But you gave it away, girl, and you made a mistake
And I'm living with it now (now)
Gotta explain it to the kids like my business
No it ain't the time or the place to start trippin'
Yeah, but fuck your friends and all (fuck your, fuck your friends)

Fuck all my bitches old friends (yeah, yeah)
Y'all let that girl fuck anybody (y'all let that girl fuck, yeah, yeah)
She out here catchin' every body
Told her not to lean on anybody
Told her not to be seen with anybody
It's gon' be so hard to claim back that body when I want it (when I want it) 
whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I want to take her out the game (I'm supposed to take her out the hood)
Who's to fuckin' blame? (Whatcha) What's my fuckin' name? (Party)
(It's your fault because)
Y'all was her model role, only let her do wrong (y'all let her do wrong on my name)

Yeah
Oh-oh, yeah
