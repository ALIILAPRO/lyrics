		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I summoned you, please come to me
Don't bury thoughts that you really want
I fill you up, drink from my cup
Within me lies what you really want

Come, lay me down
'Cause you know this
'Cause you know this sound

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long

'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh oh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh
In the middle of the night

These burning flames, these crashing waves
Wash over me like a hurricane
I'm captivated, you're hypnotized
Feel powerful, but it's me again

Come, lay me down
'Cause I know this
'Cause I know this sound

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long

'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh no, ooh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh, ooh

Just call on me, oh
Just call my name (just call my name)
Like you mean it

In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
Just call my name, I'm yours to tame
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night
I'm wide awake
I crave your taste all night long

'Til morning comes
I'm getting what is mine
You gon' get yours, oh
In the middle of the night
In the middle of the night, oh, ooh
