		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soft kiss, my baby wanted it
I could sense it from a mile away
He wants a bit of this sweet melancholy and
He can get it any time of day

'Cause nothing else can satisfy him
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something comes over me
Baby, whenever you are around

Light dims as he walks my way
I've been running for a reason I could never retain
Sweet lips like pink lemonade
When he's feeling generous he's gonna give me a taste

'Cause nothing else can satisfy me
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something comes over me
Baby, whenever you are around
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something comes over me
Baby, whenever you are around
Oh, oh, I can't help myself
Something grabs hold of me
Baby, whenever you are around
