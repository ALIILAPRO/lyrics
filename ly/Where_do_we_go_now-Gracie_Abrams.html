		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  24th Street
Where you held me, grabbed my arm
What a mental fire alarm
'Cause a lot of that felt wrong
Like I miss you
But when I kissed you back, I lied
You don't know how hard I tried
Had to fake the longest time

Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

You look hopeful
Like we're supposed to work somehow
Can't you tell our light burned out?
Got a lot to cry about
There's nothin' left here
All our best years are behind
What a brutal way to die
But you choose it every time

So where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?

We could meet down the line
After all of the time
And give an actual try
I can't promise you'll like it
I know I changed overnight
So I can't blame you for fightin'
And I'd be losin' my mind
If you lived in your writin'
'Cause now I'm half of myself here without you
You're the best in my life and I lost you
And we had no control when it fell through
It was one-sided, hate how I hurt you
If I could, I'd have changed every feelin'
Reservations were up to the ceilin'
Guess the space was the thing that I needed
But I miss you

Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go now?
