		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm am the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil

Look, I'm standing right here before you
I can only offer what I've been taught
And you look on with eyes from another
How can I compete with an ingrained thought
And tell your followers that I'm crazy
If it stops them questioning anymore
Oh, keep them tidy, keep them beside you
And keep them coming back for more

All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil

Look, I'm standing right here before you
I can only offer what I've been taught
And you look on with eyes from another
How can I compete with an ingrained thought
And tell your followers that I'm crazy
If it stops them questioning anymore
Oh, keep them tidy, keep them beside you
And keep them coming back for more

All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil

All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil himself
All these folk, they think that I'm evil
Like I, I'm the living devil
