		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh

9 mm, strapped with that heat (what?)
Vampire slayer, stake's on me (ooh)
Bow and arrow, call me chief Cherokee (ooh, ooh)
I'll go animal to keep you next to me (ahh)

When you lay me down in (hey)
In some supernatural way
And you take my body (hey)
To the Himalayan sea
Purify me (woo)
Resurrect me from the grave
Baby darling (hey)
I'll do anything you say

I'll, I'll kill, I'll kill for
A little drop of your good love
I'll rob and steal stars
To keep it lit up in your world
The alphabet need only U and S
'Cause all we'll ever need is us
I'll kill, I'll kill for
A little drop of your good love

Baby, open the door for me
Tell me just what I did to make you go so quiet
Who's he? Who is he? Must be someone else tonight
Believe me, I won't be going nowhere without a fight
Ohh (hey, hey)

When you lay me down in (yeah)
In some supernatural way
And you take my body (yeah, yeah)
To the Himalayan sea
Sugar honey (woo)
I'll do anything you say

I'll, I'll kill, I'll kill for
A little drop of your good love
I'll rob and steal stars
To keep it lit up in your world
The alphabet need only U and S
'Cause all we'll ever need is us
I'll kill, I'll kill for
A little drop of your good love

(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum) kill for your love
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum) kill for your love
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-ooh) kill for your love
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum)
(Dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum-dum) kill for your love
