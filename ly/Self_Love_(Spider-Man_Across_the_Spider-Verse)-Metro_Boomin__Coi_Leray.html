Yeah
Mmm

Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Long way, really long way from suburbia

Small towns love, fall down love, not medicated
Drink too much, think too much, thoughts drownin' me
I'm too high, please don't cry, stop doubtin' me
You don't know love, you just show love, stop doubtin' me

Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me

Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Long way, really long way from suburbia

Big dreams, yeah (yo), big screams, yeah (oh, yo)
She's impressionable
Hate to see, yeah (woah), money scheme, yeah (woah)
Live and questionable
My friends drive (yo) new beamers (yo)
Drop top convertibles
Love hangin' out, say you hate it now
Feelin' introvertical

Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me

Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Long way, really long way from suburbia

Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me

Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
Long way, really long way from suburbia

In every other universe Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man
And in every other universe it doesn't end well
(Well, it's a first time for everything, right?)
