		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I shouldn't try to be perfect
I confess, I'm obsessed with the surface
In the end, if I fall or if I get it all
I just hope that it's worth it

Last year I fell flat on my face
And last month I knew somethin' should change
Last week I started over again
Ask me and I'll tell you how I've been
Mhm, don't get me started

You've got me nervous to speak
So I just won't say anything at all
I've got an urge to release
And you keep tellin' me to hold on
You've got me nervous to move
So I just won't give anything to you
You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Should I be quiet?
Uh, come on, be silent
Uh, you know I'm tryin'
So don't say nothin'
Uh, tell me you trust me and
Kiss me and hug me, yeah
Well, I would do anything for ya
You just gotta love me and
I got an itch in my throat
I don't know which way to go
I keep on switchin', I know
I need a different approach
It's all because I wanna
Show you that I'm so capable

You've got me nervous to speak
So I just won't say anything at all
I've got an urge to release
And you keep tellin' me to hold on
You've got me nervous to move
So I just won't give anything to you
You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Hush, baby, don't you say another word
Hush, baby, don't you say another word, be quiet
Hush, baby, don't you say another word
Hush, baby, when you do, I just get hurt

Come on, baby, don't you hurt me anymore
I'm not the same way that I was before
I got goosebumps all over me
When you're around, hard for me to breathe
Come on, baby, don't you do that anymore
It's not like the days have never felt so short
My nerves, they give me a sign
Tell me I'm not fine, mhm

You've got me nervous to speak
So I just won't say anything at all
I've got an urge to release
And you keep tellin' me to hold on
You've got me nervous to move
So I just won't give anything to you
You got me turnin' all around to be who you need me to

Hush, baby, don't you say another word
Hush, baby, don't you say another word, be quiet
Hush, baby, don't you say another word
Hush, baby, when you do, I just get hurt

Hush, baby
Hush, baby
Hush, baby
Hush, baby
