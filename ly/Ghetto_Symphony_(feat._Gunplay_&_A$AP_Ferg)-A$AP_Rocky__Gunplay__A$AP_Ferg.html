		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do just what I tell you
Don't come in any closer
And no one will get hurt
'Cause I dunno how long I can hold my heart in two

A rebel I be one day, on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
Beef is on my entrée, gin and juice that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday, fitness on a Monday
My new crib came with Feng Shui
And my closet is like a runway
Come be fiancée, she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge
Just a sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K, shopping date for two K
Bougie ass bitch made wait to fuck for two days
Finally got the two day, swear to God my mood change
Top off like toupes, drop off, touché
Yeah my mouth is full of gold and I'm a city boy
And my outfit was in Vogue, I'm a pretty boy
Bounce, boy, Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga G
Riding on my enemies, this my Ghetto Symphony

Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer

Whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my Swishas
Once she blow my whistle
She know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official
Now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive
Forget it, war ready, already tested
Tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiacs arrested and my 40 oz is empty
Show me watcha owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires, only I
Rolling down a lonely mile phony smile, warrants
Police on me now, still touring
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain, in it's purest form
Don't complain I came to reign
From here forward, still 'noid
So the crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is clear ports

Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer

Since Rocky spit like Andre, I'm gon' kill em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
For talking how fast, you could grip a 9
Damn, look at how that hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas have the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pourin' liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul get cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many time your eyes and a nigga died?
Never!
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better nigga
