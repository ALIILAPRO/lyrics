		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried my best to be just like
The other boys in school
I tried my best to get it right
And died at every June
This mountainside is suicide
This dream will never work
Still the sign upon my headstone, write
"A champion of the world"

I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best to taking flak
But my rocket ship reversed
No referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
But I'll stand before conquistadors
'Til I'm champion of the world

(When I sail) and when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Though I might fail) knowing I might fail
But still I am hoping for the best
(In my dreams) and in my dreams
Onto my chest
She'll bring the colors and say
"I wandered the whole wide world
But baby, you're the best"

La, la, la, la, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ay
La, la, la, la

So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth
I am jumping with no parachute
Out into the universe
I am E.T. on my bicycle
With this kid and I want more
I am riding on my rocket ship
And I'm champion of the world
