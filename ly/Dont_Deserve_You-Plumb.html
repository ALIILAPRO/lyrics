		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the first face that I see
And the last thing I think about
You're the reason that I'm alive
You're what I can't live without
You're what I can't live without

You never give up
When I'm falling apart
Your arms are always open wide
And You're quick to forgive
When I make a mistake
You love me in the blink of an eye

I don't deserve Your love
But You give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running and come right after me
It's what You do
And I don't deserve You

You're the light inside my eyes
You give me a reason to keep trying
You give me more than I could dream
And You bring me to my knees
You bring me to my knees

Your heart is gold and how am I the one
That You've chosen to love
I still can't believe that You're right next to me
After all that I've done

I don't deserve Your love
But You give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running and come right after me
It's what You do
And I don't deserve You

I don't deserve a chance like this
I don't deserve a love that gives me everything
You're everything I want

I don't deserve Your love
But You give it to me anyway
Can't get enough
You're everything I need
And when I walk away
You take off running and come right after me
It's what You do
And I don't deserve You
And I don't deserve You
