		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's too late keep your head on straight
Just don't make it up (don't make it up)
People change they don't ever stay the same
But I keep it up (But I keep it up)

Can it be
Those days have gone
Ooh what a night to remember

Every time I need a fix
I can get it
It's easy to believe it
Every time I need my fix
I can get it
It's easy to believe it
Just something that I surrender to

Talk to me baby
Nothing else I think I would rather do right
This time

Can it be
Those days have gone 
Ooh what a night to remember

Every time I need my fix
I can get it
It's easy to believe it
Every time I need my fix
I can get it
It's easy to believe it
Every time I need my fix
I can get it
It's easy to believe it
Every time I need my fix
I can get it
It's easy to believe it
Every time I need my fix
It's easy to believe it
Every time I need my fix
It's easy to believe it
