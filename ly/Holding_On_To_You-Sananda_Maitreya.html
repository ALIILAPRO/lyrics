		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left the east side for a west coast beauty
A girl who burned my thoughts like kisses
She was down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat painted lips on a live wire beauty
A tangerine girl with tambourine eyes
Her face was my favourite magazine
Her body was my favourite book to read
They say that all poets must have an unrequited love
As all lovers must have thought-provoking fears
But holding on to you means letting go of pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you, oh

I left the rough side for a seaside baby
A chamomile smile that pouts on cue, ha
For every moment I breathe her sigh
Her bosom contains my sweet alibi, yeah
In an emotional mist she breathes in fog
And breathes it out as garden flowers
Why me of all the tough-talking boys?
I guess she heard my heartbeat through the noise
They say that all poets must have an unrequited love, yes they do, ha
As all lovers must have thought-provoking fears
But holding on to you means letting go of pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Holding on to you, ha
Means letting sorrows heal
Means letting go of what's not real, yeah
Holding on to you, yeah, woo-hoo!

Wah, heard some people say that all poets must have an unrequited love, ha
As all lovers I'm sure must have thought-provoking fears, yeah
But holding on to you means letting sorrows heal
Means letting go of what's not real
Holding on to you
I left the east coast for a west coast beauty
A woman who wet my thoughts like kisses
She was down, down by street decree
She swore she'd pull my best years out of me
Fat wet lips on a sea salt canvas
Goodbye Picasso, hello Dolly
The soil is fertile where her footsteps trod
She's my new religion, she's all I got
They say that all poets must have an unrequited love, yes they do, ha
As all lovers, I'm sure must have thought-provoking fears, yeah
But holding on to you means letting go of pain
Means letting go of tears
Means letting go of rain
Holding on to you, ha
Means letting sorrows heal
It means letting go
It means letting go of pain
It means letting go of pain, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoo
It means letting go of tears, it means letting go of rain
It means turning the page
And letting go of pain
Woo-hoo, yes it does, yes it does, yes it does
