		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The last time I held you
You held the cards and I was
Asking for anything you had
You saw it coming but you
Didn't tell me and next
Thing everything turned bad

You got the car and I got the break
I've had as much as I can take
And my heart can't handle anymore
And all the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put me back together again
So I laid in broken pieces on the floor
So don't come back for more

The last time I saw you
You didn't see me from
The sidewalk the south side of town
I called your name in a whisper so
You wouldn't hear me and turn around

The last time I thought of you
Was in this song and I
Can't get you out of my head
But I'm not stupid I can
Just walk away and
I'll break my own heart instead
