		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't be fucked with
Ayy, 4 Pockets, huh
(Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)

'Fore I go broke like Joc
Fuck with that dog like Vick (roof)
Not that rock, that pit'
Palm Angels down to my sock
Can't hold my Glock, reason I don't really like that shit (nigga, I don't)
Young turnt nigga, can't wife no bitch (at all)
Excuse my French, don't like no bitch (nope)
Limo tinted, all five of my cars, yeah, I had it hard
Seen my bitch broke bad, I ain't had a heart
Skrrt, yeah, that's us
Two-tone AP, yeah, I'm bust
Got the head from her, I ain't even wanna fuck (fuck her)
Why? Slut, bye (fuck on)
Nothin' on me from Saks, everything Revive
Old nigga tellin' on bro, should've died
No, he ain't kill 'em, dawg, he ain't even try
Still'll bet my last shootin' dice in the hood
Take who chain? Nah bitch, not Dugg's
Probably in somethin' fast with a Glock in the hood
Courtside tickets, spillin' Wock' on the wood

First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lambs'
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept takin' L's, finally got me a M
Still makin' double, I don't count what I spend
S550 2018
Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz
Young turnt nigga from the D to the A
I'm rockin' with the Lions
Yeah, I'm rockin' with the Braves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid

I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week off of weed
Bro beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lambs'
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
