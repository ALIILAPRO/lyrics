		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were never the same, are you outta your mind?
I don't like strings, no, no ties
I don't wanna keep you dreamin', you waste your time
I don't need strings, no, no lies

You needed somethin' to believe in
Two hundred miles in the evening
Super speeding, are you leaving right now?
When I pretend that I'm your boyfriend
I'll pour the drinks, so don't annoy me
Are you lonely?
'Cause I'll be gone 'til the next when the sun's up
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me
Feelin' your touch and I'm feelin' so sweet (ayy)
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me
Never turn back when I'm goin' full speed (woo)

Ooh, live fast, ride fast like two hundred on the dashboard
Ooh, it's my way, my way, even if it is a crash course
Ooh, live fast, ride fast like two hundred on the dashboard
Ooh, no, I can't slow down, I just wanna go fast, baby

Work, work, work, work, work
Switchin' lanes, doin' work (switchin' lanes, doin' work)
All I hear is heavy metal (all I hear is heavy metal)
Drippin' tears on my shirt (drippin' tears on my shirt, drippin' tears on my shirt)
Seven, seven, seven (seven, seven, seven, seven), oh
It's a little piece of Heaven (it's a little piece of Heaven), ayy
We don't know how to act now, yeah (we don't know)
I don't wanna come back 'round, no
I don't wanna let you down (let you down)
Told you that I'm leaving now (leaving now)
Please don't stay out, please don't stay out

You needed somethin' to believe in
Two hundred miles in the evening
Super speeding, are you leaving right now?
When I pretend that I'm your boyfriend
I'll pour the drinks, so don't annoy me
Are you lonely?
'Cause I'll be gone 'til the next when the sun's up
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me (blame it on me)
Feelin' your touch and I'm feelin' so sweet (oh yeah)
Blame it on me, you can blame it on me (ooh)
Never turn back when I'm goin' full speed

Ooh, live fast, drive fast like two hundred on the dashboard
Ooh, it's my way, my way, even if it is a crash course
Ooh, live fast, drive fast like two hundred on the dashboard
Ooh, no, I can't slow down, I just wanna go fast, baby
