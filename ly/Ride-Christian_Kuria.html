		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me
I wanna go
Think that I forgot it
Tell me
I wanna know
Everything I'm not

Wasted time
I lied
But still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Wasted time
All night
But still you ride

Make me
I wouldn't fold
Leave me where it started
(Yeah)
Hate me
Heart made of stone
Ain't no qualms about it

Wasted time
I lied
But still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Wasted time
All night
But still you ride
(You ride)

Running through your thoughts
Take another loss
No one knows
Running through your thoughts
Changing all the locks
Feel like home

Wasted time
I lied
But still you ride
(You ride, you ride)
Wasted time
All night
But still you ride

(Running through your thoughts)
(Take another loss)
(Still you ride)
(You ride, you ride)
(Running through your thoughts)
(Take another loss)
(Still you ride)
(You ride, you ride)
