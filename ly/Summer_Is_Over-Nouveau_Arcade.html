		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it you or is it just me?
That feels alone and you can’t sleep

I wanna remember
Wanna forget
The beautiful memories
And the things unsaid

We used to joke around
About your favorite shirt
And now it smells of sex and mint ice cream

I’m sorry, I’m sorry
For what it’s worth
We were both just lost
In the fantasy of a summer’s eve
Now I said...

Summer is over
Seasons change
Summer is over
It’s time to begin
Time to begin again

Is it you or is it just me?
That feels alone and you can’t sleep
I wanna remember
Wanna forget
The beautiful memories
And the things unsaid

Summer is over
Seasons change
Summer is over
It’s time to begin

Time to begin again
Summer is over
Seasons change
Summer is over
It’s time to begin
Time to begin again

Now that summer is over
