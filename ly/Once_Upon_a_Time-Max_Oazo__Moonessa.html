		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a couple years since Ive seen your face 
Wondering what your up to now
Yea my head is still up in space 
I guess it never came down

I can tell you that I've changed a bit tho
Not too much since then
We were always rebellious kids 
Do you remember when

We were ridin through the night 
The moon was on our side 
Once upon a time 
Once upon a time
As high as the stars in the sky 
Crossing all the lines 
Once upon a time 
Once upon a time 

Do you recall all the promises 
We used to make back then
Can you tell me are they still on 
Or is that silly of me to think

The years I find separate us 
I think of you now and then 
Won't let memories fade to dust 
Baby remember when

We were ridin through the night 
The moon was on our side 
Once upon a time 
Once upon a time
As high as the stars in the sky 
Crossing all the lines 
Once upon a time 
Once upon a time
