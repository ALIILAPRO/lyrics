		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words in you message trouble me tonight
Saw my reflection written down in every line
It wasn't easy to believe that I did that to you
You were needing something deeper, I think I always knew

And I, I can see everything now
Awakened your heart but buried mine deep underground
What you showed me is
Better to love honest than stumble in the dark
And I, I can see everything now

It was over nothing
I think about you every time
I'm caught in the open
Looking for a place to hide
It wasn't easy to believe that I did that to you
You were needing something deeper, I think I always knew

And I, I can see everything now
Awakened your heart but buried mine deep underground
What you showed me is
Better to love honest than stumble in the dark
And I, I can see everything now

Can you feel it?
Now we can breathe again
Found the meaning
Now we can breathe again

Can you feel it?
Now we can breathe again
Found the meaning
Now we can breathe again

And I, I can see everything now
Awakened your heart but buried mine deep underground
What you showed me is
Better to love honest than stumble in the dark
And I, I can see everything now
