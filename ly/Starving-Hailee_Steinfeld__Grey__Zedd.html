		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know just what to say
Shit, that scares me, I should just walk away
But I can't move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, oh

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

(I didn't know that I-I didn't know that I-till I tasted you)
(I didn't know that I-I didn't know that I-till I tasted you)
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head-on, got me weak in my knees
Yeah, something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday, ye-eah
So much younger yesterday, oh, yeah

I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you
Don't need no butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

(I didn't know that I-I didn't know that I-till I tasted you)
(I didn't know that I-I didn't know that I-till I tasted you)
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you

You, yeah, till I tasted you
(I didn't know that I-I didn't know that I-till I tasted you)
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn't know that I was starving till I tasted you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me's changed
I was so much younger yesterday
