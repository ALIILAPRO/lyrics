		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear your winter
And I hear your rain
But I've failed your summer ways
And I feel no pain 

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way

I hear you fade away
And I hear you crawl
And I gave my life away
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel no pain
And I feel your pain

And she was my lover so sweet
And she was my angel
What I've recovered of me
I put into a box underneath my bed

When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
When you lie in your bed
And you lie to yourself
Lie
Lie

Bang bang your dead hole in your head
Bang bang your dead hole in your head
Bang bang your dead hole in your head
Bang bang your dead hole in your head

I hear what you want
And I feel that way
I hear what you want
And I feel that way

(This take, don't give a fuck)
