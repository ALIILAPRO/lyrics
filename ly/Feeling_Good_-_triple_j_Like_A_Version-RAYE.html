		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Birds flyin' high, you know how I feel
Sun in the sky, you know how I feel
Breeze driftin' on by, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
A new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River running free, you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree, you know how I feel

It's a new dawn
A new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

Yeah, I'm feeling

Dragonfly out in the sun
You know what I mean, don't you know?
Butterflies all havin' fun
You know what I mean
Sleep in peace when day is done
That's what I mean
And this old world is a new world
And a bold world for me, yes
And I'm feeling good
And I'm feeling good

Stars when you shine, you know how I feel
Scent of the pine, you know how I feel
Oh, freedom is mine, and I know how I feel

It's a new dawn
It's a new day
It's a new life for me
And I'm feeling good

And I'm feeling, oh so good
