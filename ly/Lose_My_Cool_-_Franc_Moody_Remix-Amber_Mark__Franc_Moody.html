		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was so full of pain just stuck in my head
There was no one that could get me out of it
Yes, I think the drinking was a bit excessive
Just to be frank, the drinking ain't what caused me to be aggressive

My heart has been taken over
Everyday I get colder to 'em
I realize need to let go expression from the get go to 'em
Yeah

Feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain 
Yes I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain (yeah)
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
Let loose

I was so full of pain, just stuck in my head
There was no way for me to get over it
So I kept it bottled up all inside of me
'Til I felt the pressure I could no longer breath
Yeah you know 

I'm feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain
Yes I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain (yeah)
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
(Got to lose my cool)

I'm feeling it like
I just need to speak my brain
Yes I know it might seem like
I'm going to cause you pain (yeah)
Boy you got to realize
I've got to get all this crazy
I've got to lose my cool
(Got to lose my cool, yeah)

I've got to lose my cool now baby
I've got to lose my cool now darling
I may act a fool now baby yeah
