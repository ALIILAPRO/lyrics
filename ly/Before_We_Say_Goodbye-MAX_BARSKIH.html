		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wish I could keep this moment forever,
In the dark with my arms around you,
This lifetime brought us together
So gentle, so new

I don’t even have to say a word
You can read me,
You opened up a window to my soul,
It’s not easy
We don’t have a place where we belong,
But you near me,
And it feels like home

Night after night,
I hold you closer, baby
Cause this might be the one last time
I see your body naked,
Tomorrow’s unknown it can split us apart
But wherever I go you would be in my heart,
Night after night
Tell me you love me, baby
Before we say goodbye

I don’t wanna see you cry

Wish I knew what the future’s gonna bring us,
I would walk through the shadow with you,
I don’t care about the distance in between us,
My feelings stay true

Baby don’t you ever lose your hope,
I’ll remind you,
Even if you ever be lost,
I will find you,
Wish I could stay a little more,
Right beside you,
But it’s time to go

Night after night,
I hold you closer, baby
Cause this might be the one last time
I see your body naked,
Tomorrow’s unknown it can split us apart
But wherever I go you would be in my heart,
Night after night
Tell me you love me, baby
Before we say goodbye

I don’t wanna see you cry
