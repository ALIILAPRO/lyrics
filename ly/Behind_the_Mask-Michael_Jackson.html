		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stab me
All along I knew you were a phony girl (hee, hee)
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth but that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
'Cause when he's in your arms
Your throwing rocks at me

Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me? (Hee-hee-hee)
With you? I don't know
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want you (hee-hee-hee)
If you can't answer
You know me, woo

(There is nothing in your eyes)
There is nothing in your eyes
(But that's the way you cry)
But that's the way you cry, girl (cry, girl)
(All is grand, all is bright)
All is grand, all is bright
(You're just steady in my mind) ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah

I walk around, I'm sufferin' in my doom
When I come to you, you're sittin' in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (hee, hee, hee)
So take off the mask so I can see your face

Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me? (Hee-hee-hee)
With you? I don't know
Who do you love, babe? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want you (hee-hee-hee)
If you can't answer
I know you, woo

(Heaven must be weary)
Heaven must be weary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me scared, girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
That be you, just as good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl

(Heaven must be weary)
Heaven must be weary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
That be you, na-na-na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?) Hey, hey, hey

(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)
(Hee-hee-hee)

I walk around, I'm sufferin' in my doom
When I come to you, you're sittin' in your room
You sit around in the strangest place (hee, hee, hee)
So take off the mask so I can see your face

Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me? (Hee-hee-hee)
With you? I don't know
Who do you love, babe? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want you (hee-hee-hee)
If you can't answer
I know you

Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
Is it me? (Hee-hee-hee)
With you? I don't know
Who do you love? (Hee-hee-hee)
I don't want you (hee-hee-hee)
I, da-nah
I don't know

I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) (hee-hee-hee)
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it) (hee-hee-hee)
I don't wanna talk about it (let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk (hee-hee-hee) 
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) hee-hee-hee
I don't, don't know (hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee) 
(I don't, don't, don't, ohh, don't) 
I don't, don't know (hee-hee-hee, hee-hee-hee) (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
