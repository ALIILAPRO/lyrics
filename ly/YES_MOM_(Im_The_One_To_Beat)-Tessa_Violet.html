		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bet you've been a fan of me
See me in your fantasies
Everything I got, I got working for me so
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah (yeah)
I'm the one to beat, yeah, mmm
I'm the one to beat, yeah

When I take my picture
Wanna kiss her, I'm like damn (damn)
I see my reflection got affection 'cause I can
I can't help that I feel myself
Yes, I guess I'm a fan
When everything you're looking for is right here where I stand, yeah

Bet you've been a fan of me
See me in your fantasies
Everything I got, I got working for me so
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah
What you see is what you get
Everything I'm owning it
Did it independent 'cause I got what I need so
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah
I'm the one to beat, yeah, mmm
I'm the one to beat, yeah

2020 vision with ambition's how I'm made
I can't keep from winning when it's in my DNA
Push me down and I bounce right back
Trampoline and it's in my past (past)
Rising like a phoenix making fire from the ash, yeah

Bet you've been a fan of me
See me in your fantasies
Everything I got, I got working for me so
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah
What you see is what you get (yes mom)
Everything I'm owning it (yes mom)
Did it independent 'cause I got what I need so
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah

God, it's such a treat just getting to be me
Spending all my time on what I want
Looking in the mirror
I'm so glad I'm here
I'm the one to beat, yeah
I'm the one to beat, yeah
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah

I love, I love, I love, I love, I love me
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love me
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love me
I love, I love, I love
Eat that, peep that, I'm the one to beat, yeah
