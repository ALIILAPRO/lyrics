		<p>
		  Talk to me more
You're a little bit bored, I'm a little bit tired
We don't fight though
You've been acting so cold, I don't know what you wanted

Every time we touch it's like the last time
Holding onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feelin'

Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holdin' on to thin lines 'til we just walk between 'em
Gettin' so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it

Do we let go?
Are we too far gone? I don't know what we started
I guess I don't know
Where we took a wrong turn, everything got harder

Every time we touch it's like the last time
Holdin' onto something when it's not right
Tell me to my face that you are all mine
You don't know what I'm feelin'

Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
Holdin' on to thin lines 'til we just walk between 'em
Gettin' so loud, I can't pretend that I don't hear 'em
Maybe that thing you said under your breath, you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
I know you mean it
