		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?

Am I in love with just a theme?
Or is Ayesha just a dream?
A mystery
Oh, who is she?

Oh, who is she?
A misty memory
A haunting face
Is she a lost embrace?

I call her name
Across an endless plain
She'll answer me
Wherever she may be

Oh, who is she? (Oh, who is she?)
A misty memory (a misty memory)
A haunting face (a haunting face)
Is she a lost embrace?

Somewhere across the sea of time
A love immortal such as mine
Will come to me
Eternally

Immortal she
Return to me
