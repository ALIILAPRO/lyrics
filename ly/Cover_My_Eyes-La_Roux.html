		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say it's coming
But I can't see it at all
You know me well, but I don't know you at all
No, I don't know you at all
It's always just on the horizon
So my hopes rise and fall
You know me well, but I don't know you at all
No, I don't know you at all

Early '90s decor
It was the day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless color
Once in fashion, soon to be scene
Once in fashion, soon to be scene

Been dreaming of blue skies
New horizon and sides from my eyes
The discovery of the unknown
Is something to tell the folks back home
I want to get away
To feel the sun on my skin
To feel it really
Sinking in

Early '90s decor
It was the day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless color
Once in fashion, soon to be scene
Once in fashion, soon to be scene

Early '90s decor
It was the day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless color
Once in fashion, soon to be scene

Early '90s decor
It was the day for
We wanted to play
But we had nothing left to play for
Colourless color
Once in fashion, soon to be rediscovered
