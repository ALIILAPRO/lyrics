		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control

Now, tell me what you saw
Tell me what you saw
There was a crowd of seeds
Inside, outside
I must have done a dozen each

It was the height I threw, the weight
The shell was crushing you
I've been around a few

Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh

Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Gold lion's gonna tell me where the light is
Take our hands out of control
Take our hands out of control

Outside, inside
This is a moon without a tide
We'll build a fire in your eyes
We'll build a fire when the cover's getting brighter
Cold desire, makes a moon without a tide

Tell me what you saw
I'll tell you what to
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh
