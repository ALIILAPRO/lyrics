		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you leave
And don't come back
'Cause I'm cold
Baby, I'm cold
Baby, I'm

Still cold
Cold like I'm seeing my breath
After the season you left
Baby, I'm stuck in my ways
They say the coldest hearts are hardest to break
That's probably how I ended up in this place
With no emotion left to process the pain
It's better this way

Too numb to feel the burn
Too numb to let it hurt
I stare at my reflection
I don't recognize myself

Too numb to feel the pain
Too numb to feel a thing
You watched me bleed
I hope you leave
And don't come back

'Cause I'm cold
Baby, I'm cold

I hope you leave
And don't come back
'Cause I'm

Call me on the phone but I'm outta range
When I'm all up in the mountain ranges
And I know you won't put this on your playlist
Show your friends all mad I'm keeping you nameless
I was down bad for you from the jump
Thought you were the one
Now I gotta regain my trust
Matter fact I don't trust no one
Left me in the dust
Got me outta touch with emotions, yeah

Too numb to feel the pain (too numb to feel the pain)
Too numb to feel a thing
You watched me bleed
I hope you leave
And don't come back

'Cause I'm cold
I hope you leave
And don't come back
'Cause I'm cold
You watched me freeze
And turned your back on me

So don't hit my line
Don't waste your time
I'm too far gone
Yeah, yeah, I swear that I'm cold
I hope you leave
And don't come back
'Cause I'm cold

I hope you leave
And don't come back
'Cause I'm cold

I hope you leave
And don't come back
'Cause I'm
