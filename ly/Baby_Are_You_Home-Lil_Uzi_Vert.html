		  Baby, are you home?
Baby, are you home? 
Baby, are you home? Yeah
Baby, are you home?
Baby, are you home?
Baby, are you home? (if young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

Yeah, she call my phone (what?)
Ask me what I'm on (yeah, yeah)
Baby, is you home?
I'm in the area
Like, tell me what he on
He ain't scaring none
You know why you text my phone
Tell me if you home
Like, Baby, are you home? (ayy)
Baby, are you home? (yeah)
Baby, are you home? Yeah
Baby, are you home? (huh?)
Baby, are you home? (what?)
Baby, are you home? (yeah)
Baby, are you home? Yeah
Baby, are you home? (yeah)

Like, counting all my dough (yeah)
With my eyes closed (huh?)
I don't trust a hoe
But, I trust my hoe
Like, money in my pants (ayy)
Sticking out my thigh, bro (yeah)
Yes, Lil Uzi, like hit that eye roll (that eye roll)
I don't got no money, that's a lie hoe (that's a lie hoe)
Kinda got messy, got rid of my side hoe (yeah)
I don't wanna fuck you if you a dry hoe (what?)
Up in Mexico with the plug, eating Pico de Gallo (yeah)
You a rockstar, now pills try those (ayy)
Traded in my chakra, now I got a bright hoe (uh)
Man, I got my head right (yeah, yeah)
Man, I got my bread right (yeah, yeah)
Livin' my life just so right (yeah)
You can see my diamonds at night
Girl you know I'm higher than a satellite (satellite)
Can I come over, or are you the playin' type? (what?)

Yeah, she call my phone (what?)
Ask me what I'm on (yeah, yeah)
Baby, is you home?
I'm in the area
Like, tell me what he on
He ain't scaring none
You know why you text my phone
Tell me if you home
Like, Baby, are you home? (ayy)
Baby, are you home? (yeah)
Baby, are you home?, yeah
Baby, are you home? (huh?)
Baby, are you home? (what?)
Baby, are you home? (yeah)
Baby, are you home?, yeah
Baby, are you home? (yeah)

I swear boy, you do not know me (yeah, yeah)
Boy, you ain't my homie
Ballin' like I'm Kobe
Now, I'm ballin' like Ginobili
Like, boy your style so old (what?)
Balding like Ginobili (what?)
Pull up in that Porsche
Brittany in the Lotus (skrrt, skrrt)
I get money, yeah (yeah, yeah)
And I put that on my oldest (oldest)
I ain't got no kids, so I put that on my Rollie (Rollie)
They say that he real, so that nigga got to show me
And that nigga homies, really ain't his homies (ayy)
I got red homies
I got blue homies (yeah)
Yeah, I got the gun, and it shoot homies
Yeah, I got them crash dummies, they my new homies
Girl, I made you famous
Ain't no need to thank me
Like yeah I put you first you're my lady (yeah, yeah
Um, skrrt in the water with my baby (skrrt)

Yeah, she call my phone
Ask me what I'm on
Baby, is you home?
I'm in the area
Tell me what he on
He ain't scaring none
You know why you text my phone
Tell me if you home
Like, Baby, are you home?
Baby, are you home? (ayy)
Baby, are you home? Yeah (yeah)
Baby, are you home? (huh?)
Baby, are you home? (what?)
