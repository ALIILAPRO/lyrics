		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Freedom new life awakened empty eyes

Voyaging across the sea, the way unknown
Known now the purity of renewed hope
Hope is the music of the song
The wind sings to me

Summoning me far out to sea
Voices of the wind reaching within
Calling, "Leave all behind seek
And you’ll find the
Dark edge of the map gathering light"
Finally waking from long sorrowful dreams
Set free from deadened sleep
Reclaiming lost viridity of youth and spring
Voices of the wind guiding me
Into the fountain of nеw life
That I have found

Vita nova vita nova vita nova vita nova

Voices forgottеn with time whispering again
Whispering again this time
The way less traveled by now is mine

Life is redeemed, finally free
A new song awakes, piercing the grey
No more longing for dreams far out of reach
Singing with the wind, let life begin

Summoning me far out to sea
Voices of the wind reaching within
Calling, "Leave all behind seek
And you’ll find the
Dark edge of the map gathering light"
Finally waking from long sorrowful dreams
Set free from deadened sleep
Reclaiming lost viridity of youth and spring
Voices of the wind guiding me
Into the fountain of new life
That I have found

Vita nova vita nova vita nova vita nova

Vita nova awakened my empty eyes

Vita nova vita nova vita nova vita nova
