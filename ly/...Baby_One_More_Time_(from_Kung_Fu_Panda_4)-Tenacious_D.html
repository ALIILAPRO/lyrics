		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Yeah, tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Girl, you've got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Yeah, tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

(Baby, baby, ba-ba-baby)
(Ba-ba-baby, hit me one more time)
Hit me, oh, yeah
Hit me, oh, girl
Hit me, baby, but not too hard
Hit me one more time
Hit me, baby, but not too hard
One more time again

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go

And I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

My loneliness is killing me (and I)
I must confess I still believe (still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time
