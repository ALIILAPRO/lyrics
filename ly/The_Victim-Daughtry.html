		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You showed me your colors
Showed me your face
Painted with pretty lies
You broke every promise
Feeling no shame
Leaving me dead inside
And I won't
No I won't take the blame
So I run
From your cold wicked way
You ain't diggin, diggin, diggin
My grave, no

Not gonna be the victim
Don't wanna be a slave
Not gonna be addicted
To a system
I did not create
Stop making me the monster
Stop messing with my brain
Not gonna be the victim
Any longer
So get off my wave

I rest you in pieces
Ashes and dust
Spiritual suicide
Shedding my skin
Shake off the rust
Bringing me back to life
So I run
From your cold wicked way
You ain't diggin, diggin, diggin
My grave, no

Not gonna be the victim
Don't wanna be a slave
Not gonna be addicted
To a system
I did not create
Stop making me the monster
Stop messing with my brain
Not gonna be the victim
Any longer
So get off my wave

No I won't (No I won't)
No I won't take the blame
So I run (So I run)
From your cold wicked ways
No I won't (No I won't)
No I won't take the blame
So I run (So I run)
From your cold wicked ways

Not gonna be the victim
Don't wanna be a slave
Not gonna be addicted
To a system
I did not create
Stop making me the monster
Stop messing with my brain
Not gonna be the victim
Any longer
So get off my wave

Oh not gonna be the victim
Yeah not gonna be the victim
Yeah not gonna be the victim
So get off my wave
