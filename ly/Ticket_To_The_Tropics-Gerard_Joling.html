		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I'm sitting and it's getting cold
The morning rain's against my window pane
While the world it looks so cold and gray
In my mind I drift away
Then I'm on my way to tropic island
You had always said I was a dreamer
You were right

Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can live without your love

Here I'm sitting in the middle place
Sun is shining on my face again
Think about the way it had to end
Now I'm sitting here alone
And it's not the way we were together
I want you to know I'm gonna miss you
Miss you bad

Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can live without your love

Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
Forget our love and leave this place behind me
Gotta buy me a ticket to the tropics
And prove myself that I can
