		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (West, Mr. West) uh, yeah
Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah

And I heard 'em say, nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
From the Chi, like Tim it's a harder way
So this is in the name of love like Robert say
Before you ask me to go get a job today
Can I at least get a raise of the minimum wage?
And I know the government administer AIDS
So I guess we just pray like the minister say
Allahu Akbar and throw in some hot cars
The things we seen on the screen that's not ours
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it

Uh, and I heard 'em say (ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

They say people in your life are seasons
And anything that happen is for a reason
And niggas gun clappin' and keep to squeezin'
And gran' keep prayin' and keep believin'
In Jesus, and one day that you see him
'Til then walk in his footsteps and try to be him
The Devil is alive, I feel him breathin'
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin'
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down
So now my lil' cousin smokin' them cigarettes now
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now?
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of it now, uh, uh

And I heard 'em say (ooh)
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
But we'll find a way
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way

With every worthless word we got more far away
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today
And nothing lasts forever but be honest, babe
It hurts but it may be the only way
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
