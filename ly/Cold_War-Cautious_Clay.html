		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yellow tinted lenses and a Pink Gelato
Fallin' out the window, hit me back tomorrow
We'll always be the one tough act to follow
'Cause we aimin' for the stars with a point and hollow
Feelin' these songs mocking jokes and carols
Started this job sellin' rocks and arrows
'Cause you only swipe right if you fuck for follows
Welcome to the days of the broke and shallow

But if we just spoke, like we meant it
Would you reference
This open part of me?
The minute I know the time we spent in
Came corrected, in my anatomy

Matter over mind if we bein' honest
But you wander through ya thoughts like a broken promise
In it for the monetary growth and power
But we divided at the bottom of this whiskey sour
So leave it on the table if you hot and bothered
Tell me if you mean it, baby, who's the father?
The stories of a land you divide and conquer
You really showin' me the meanin' of a losing offer

But if we just spoke, like we meant it
Would you reference
This open part of me
The minute I know the time we spent in
Came corrected, in my anatomy
