		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

Shallow skin, I can paint with pain
I mark the trails on my arms with your disdain
Everyday it's the same I love, you hate
But I guess I don't care any more
Fix my problems with the blade
While my eyes turn from blue to gray
God, the worst thing happened to me today
But I guess I don't care anymore

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

My flaws are the only thing left that's pure
Can't really live, can't really endure
Everything I see reminds me of her
God I wish I didn't care anymore
The more I touch, the less I feel
I'm lying to myself that it's not real
Why is everybody making such a big fucking deal?
Is never gonna cure anymore

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

What the hell am I doing?
Is there anyone left in my life?
What the fuck was I thinking?
Anybody want to tell me I'm fine?
Where the hell am I going?
Do I even need a reason to hide?
I am only betrayed
I am only conditioned to die

You are wrong, fucked, and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie, motherfucker
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything

You are wrong and overrated
I think I'm gonna be sick and it's your fault
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
I haven't slept since I woke up
And found my whole life was a lie
This is the end of everything
You are the end of everything
You are the end of everything
