		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you lie, don't you lie
Don't you, don't you lie, yeah

Pittsburgh Steelers with the black and yellow diamonds (go)
Maybach coupe, in the seats I recline in (hey)
Fresh out of jail, I ain't know what I was signin' (jail)
I was havin' drip 'fore I knew about designer (woo)
Lookin' for the right one, then fucked around and found her (found her)
Haters in the circle, had to get the fuck around 'em (hey)
If we got a problem, make the young nigga down him (baow)
Fuckin' with a gangster, I bend you on a counter (hey)
Runnin' through these bands, you can never trust these hoes
I ain't fuckin' with a fan, nigga, knowin' that's a no (no)
Stand up like a man when the world get cold (man)
Spray him with a tan, why he thought I was a hoe? (Why?)
Jet goin' Thailand, when I got a show (Thailand)
Learn how to finance when I got a load (woo)
Took her out a Scion, put her in a Rolls (Rolls)
Shit is not science, get a bankroll (go)

Porsche panoramic, she know I do damage (go)
My watch white ceramic, give gifts like I'm Santa (Santa) 
Northside Atlanta, red like a panda (north)
Servin' that raw, Dirty Diana (raw)
Shawty too raw, fucked her on camera (hey)
Four-hundred-thou' when I bought the Phantom (woo) 
Open your door, hoe, and show me your manners (hoe)
Where would I be if I didn't have Atlanta? (Yeah)
Smoke what you want, then I blow out his candles (yeah)
If that's what he want, fuck it, that's what he get (fuck it)
I bought a Lambo' and snatched up a kit (skrrt)
She pull her phone out, it's makin' me glitch (hey)
'Fore I had hits, I was hittin' a lick (hits)
'Fore I got rich, I had gang in this bitch (gang)
Codeine dreamin', there was pain in them sips (drank)
Gave her my hoodie, then called her a Lyft (woo)
She know I'm not lame, I got racks in the bank, I got thirty-four chains (thirty)
All of this pain, I'ma fuck around and blink (pain)
I got no one to talk to, no one to exchange (nobody)
None of my words, callin' up Murk, had to check in on Jerz
My son is Wave, I know how to surf (Wave)
Life is a maze, better learn how it work (maze)
We move in silence, we boardin' the bird

Pittsburgh Steelers with the black and yellow diamonds (go)
Maybach coupe, in the seats I recline in (hey)
Fresh out of jail, I ain't know what I was signin' (jail)
I was havin' drip 'fore I knew about designer (woo)
Lookin' for the right one, then fucked around and found her (found her)
Haters in the circle, had to get the fuck around 'em (hey)
If we got a problem, make the young nigga down him (baow)
Fuckin' with a gangster, I bend you on a counter (hey)
Runnin' through these bands, you can never trust these hoes
I ain't fuckin' with a fan, nigga, knowin' that's a no (no)
Stand up like a man when the world get cold (man)
Spray him with a tan, why he thought I was a hoe? (Why?)
Jet goin' Thailand, when I got a show (Thailand)
Learn how to finance when I got a load (woo)
Took her out a Scion, put her in a Rolls (Rolls)
Shit is not science, get a bankroll (go)

Don't you, don't you lie, yeah
Don't you lie, don't you lie
Don't you, don't you lie, yeah
Don't you, don't you lie, yeah
