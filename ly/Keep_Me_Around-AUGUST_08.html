		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You play victim, that ain't no surprise
You say you miss me but actin' Mickey
Hate to say it but we too alike
Callin' at the wrong time on some weird shit

You hear me out
Poppin' up at 3 AM, in your feelings
Knowin' that I like it
I let you in 'cause I love a bad decision

When you're mad I get turned on
Ignore the pain, you're all I want

So I keep you around, around, around, around, around
So you keep me around, around, around, around, around
Hella crazy in love but it don't feel the same without you
So I keep you around, around, around, around, around
Yeah

Head spinnin', that ain't no surprise
Hella toxic like drinkin' dirty Sprite
Disappear every Valentine
Actin' like your phone died 'til the mornin'

Why the hell I like it?
Poppin' up at 3 AM, in your feelings
Knowin' that I like it
Pushin' buttons in your face, I don't listen

'Cause when you're mad I get turned on
Ignore the pain, you're all I want

So I keep you around, around, around, around, around
So you keep me around, around, around, around, around
Hella crazy in love but it don't feel the same without you
So I keep you around, around, around, around, around
Yeah
