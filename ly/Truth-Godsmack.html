		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can tell me that you try
But you told me as you said goodbye
And all those things you couldn't say
You just watched me walk away, again
But I was there for you to the end
As your lover and your best friend

So why'd you cross that line and destroy my life?
Please just tell the truth
'Cause it's a lot to defend and I can't understand
How I'm still loving you

Why can't you be by yourself?
Always needing to be with someone else
So uncomfortable in your own skin
I didn't realize that time alone meant time with him

So why'd you cross that line and destroy my life?
Please just tell the truth
'Cause it's a lot to defend and I can't understand
How I'm still loving you

We only have one life to get right
We had our second chance
And yet we fucked it up again

So why'd you cross that line and destroy our lives?
Please just tell the truth
It's a lot to defend, I can't understand
How I'm still loving you
How am I still loving you?
