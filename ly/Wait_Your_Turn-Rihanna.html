		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over

I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team you can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here, but babe the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win, the wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble that's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways
Ain't no timeout in my game, they already underway
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here, you can play but hold up

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

It's getting crowded over here, but babe the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win, the wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble that's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else
You're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
Babe you're up
The time is now and now the wait is over

The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over (just wait your turn)
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over (just wait your turn)

It's getting crowded over here, but babe the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win, the wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble that's a flag on the play
Babe if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together we gon' be taking over

It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn

(Just wait your turn)
The wait is over, the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
