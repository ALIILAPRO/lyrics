		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Intimidation, I stand before you now
Hold my crown; you won't strike me down
A validation of all the blood I spill
Survival of my will

There's nothing left to say
Yourself you have betrayed
We must try to seize the day

All the world will hear you
Our voices can't be bound
All the world will hear you
Redemption in the power of the sound

Interpretation of all the thoughts I share
Tie you there creating all your fear
A brand new nation for those who persevere
The future is so clear

There's nothing left to say
Yourself you have betrayed
We must try to seize the day

All the world will hear you
Our voices can't be bound
All the world will hear you
Redemption in the power of the sound

What of validation?
What of all the filth wide spread?
What of validation?
Why our blind fear?

All the world will hear you
Our voices can't be bound
All the world will hear you
Redemption in the power of the sound
