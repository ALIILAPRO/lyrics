		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many of you people out there been hurt in some kind of love affair?
And how many times do you swear that you'd never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights?
How many lies, how many fights?
Well, why would you want to put yourself through all of that again?

"Love is pain," I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain (yeah)
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day, hmm

Why don't we turn the clock to zero, honey?
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day (brand new day)
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way (brand new day)

We'll turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
I'm starting up a brand new day (brand new day)
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across it
We're started up a brand new day

It could happen to you, just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity, there's no guarantee
I say love is such a force if you find yourself in it, babe
Need sometime for reflection you say
Baby, wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Well, wait a minute, wait a minute

Why don't we turn the clock to zero, honey?
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day, ooh (brand new day) (it's a brand new day)
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I'm begging her to take me back
I'm, I'm thinking in a brand new way (brand new day)
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across it
Starting up a brand new day (brand new day)(it's a brand new day)
Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don't wanna be no fuddy-duddy
We're starting up a brand new day (brand new day)

I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm a bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm a wave (it's a brand new day)
I'm the plow and you're the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm a flagpole to your nation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Stand up

Stand up
I'm the present to your future
You're the wound and I'm the suture (it's a brand new day)
You're the magnet to my pole
I'm the devil in your soul (brand new day) (stand up)
You're the pupil, I'm the teacher
You're the church and I'm the preacher (it's a brand new day)
You're the flower, I'm the rain
You're the tunnel, I'm the train (brand new day)

Stand up all you lovers in the world, yeah 
(It's a brand new day)
Stand up and be counted, every boy and every girl (brand new day)
Stand up all you lovers in the world, yeah, yeah
(It's a brand new day)
Starting up a brand new day (brand new day)

Stand up
