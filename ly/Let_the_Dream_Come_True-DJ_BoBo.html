		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you
Let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you
Let the dream come true
Let the dream come true
Let the dream come true

Kick it, tip it, flip it, sip it
Shake your booty 'round and get wicked
Use the door get on the floor
I still got more for you to store
Get on your feet it's treated unique
Just feel the heat and get back to the beat
Rubadap, rubadap, rubadap, rubadap
Jump and shake your booty, wine it up
Everybody shake your body, DJ Bobo starts the party
Up and down, here we go
Don't look back, just let it flow
Up and down, don't lose your crown
What goes up must come once down
Now hold tight, everything's alright
There's no need to fight tonight

Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you
Let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you
Let the dream come true
Let the dream come true

It's a break, I don't mean a fake
Open your ears, it's not a mistake
The music is strong and I made these rhymes
Party time 'cause the time is mine
So let's go down, down on the floor
I wanna give you what you are waitin' for
You know what you want and you want it now
You know what you want when you hear the sound
Swing your body and have some fun, now you' re on the run
This track has just begun, it's done for fun and hits you like a gun
Jump up and down, toss and turn
Right to the ground before you burn
Pump the bass right in your face
Just in case we start the race

Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you
Let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you
Let the dream come true

First I waited, then created
Didn't debate it, just made it
The feeling is strong, so keep coming on
With the bass and the drums there's nothing wrong
Now get on up, take your shoes
Swing your body, get wild and loose
One, two, three, four, tipping' and tapping'
Slipping' and slipping', there's no stoppin'

Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you, let the dream come true
What I'm gonna do without you
Let the dream come true
Not a broken heart, now we're gonna start
It's for me and you
Let the dream come true

Let the dream come true
Let the dream come true
