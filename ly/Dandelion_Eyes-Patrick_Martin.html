		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dandelion eyes 
Gets me every time 
Seasons gonna change
But you're summer in my mind 

Stay up 
All night 
Just to find what we're made of 
Alright 
Yeah I gotta feel the rhythm 
Of you
And the way you move 

It's pure ecstasy
I want you next to me 
Tell me your secrets that 
Nobody knows 
We could be anything 
You might be everything 
Sing me the Melody 
Deep in your soul 

Dandelion eyes goin wild in the sun 
I don't need a wish when I got what I want 

Supernova smile 
wear the sun like your makeup 
Picture paradise
Aint nobody but you and me what could be 



So we should stay up
all night 
Just to find what we're made of 
Alright 
Yeah I gotta feel the rhythm 
Of you
And the way you move 

It's pure ecstasy
I want you next to me 
Tell me your secrets that 
Nobody knows 
We could be anything 
You might be everything 
Sing me the Melody 
Deep in your soul 

Dandelion eyes goin wild in the sun 
I don't need a wish when I got what I want 

We're far from heaven
but we're on the edge of paradise 
we'll fall into a fantasy 
I'm paralyzed, my dandelion

It's pure ecstasy
I want you next to me 
Tell me your secrets that 
Nobody knows 
We could be anything 
You might be everything 
Sing me the Melody 
Deep in your soul

Dandelion eyes goin wild in the sun 
I don't need a wish when I got what I want
