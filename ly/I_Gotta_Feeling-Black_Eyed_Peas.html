		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night (a feel-)

Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up (a feel-)
Go out and smash it, like, oh my God
Jump off that sofa, let's kick it off

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out, spaced out, and losing all control (a feel-)

Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off (a feel-)
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it, and do it, let's live it up
And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I got a feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Tonight's the night (hey)
Let's live it up (let's live it up)
I got my money (my pay)
Let's spend it up (let's spend it up)
Go out and smash it (smash it)
Like, oh my God (like, oh my God)
Jump off that sofa (come on)
Let's kick it off
Fill up my cup (drink)
Mazel tov (l'chaim)
Look at her dancing (move it, move it)
Just take it off
Let's paint the town (paint the town)
We'll shut it down (shut it down)
Let's burn the roof (woo)
And then we'll do it again
Let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, let's do it (let's do it)
And do it (do it), and do it
Let's live it up
And do it (do it), and do it (and do it)
And do it (and), do it (and), do it (and do it)
Let's do it (and do it), let's do it (and do it)
Let's do it (hey), do it, (hey), do it, (hey), do it

Here we come, here we go
We gotta rock (rock, rock, rock, rock)
Easy come, easy go
Now we on top (top, top, top, top)
Fill the shot, body rock
Rock it, don't stop (stop, stop, stop, stop)
'Round and 'round, up and down
Around the clock (clock, clock, clock, clock)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (do it)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday (do it)
Get, get, get, get, get with us
You know what we say, say
Party every day, p-p-p-party every day

And I'm feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
A feeling (woo-hoo)
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Woo-hoo
