		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I close my eyes
Close the door
I won't worry anymore
I've been waiting for you
Everyday and every night

Cut the light
Let it fade
I don't want to be afraid
I've been waiting for you

Tonight it is right 
Stars shine bright
I just really want to be with you
I celebrate pray for that day
When all my wishes will be coming true

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feets step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feets step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

I think of you 
Everyday
I've been waitig for a call
Just the sound of your voice
Anytime and anyway

Dream of you 
Since that day
When I saw you 
The first time
At the Hard Rock Cafe

Tonight it is right 
Stars shine bright
I just really want to be with you
I celebrate pray for that day
When all my wishes will be coming true

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feets step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feets step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

I close my eyes
Close the door
I won't worry anymore
I've been waiting for you

And my feet steps the beat, baby
My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feets step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam

My heart beats like a drum, like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
And my feets step the beats like a drum
Dam dam dam dam dam dam
