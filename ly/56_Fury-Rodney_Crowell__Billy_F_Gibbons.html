		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spit curl down his forehead
Talking bout yes it's understood
It's not just some lame six-bang grease stain
Sitting underneath the hood
Tamping down a camel on a zippo with a grin maybe wider than a country mile
Corsicana cool hand taking us to school man
Burnin' up the road style
 
56 Fury built for comfort built for speed
56 Fury long about every last thing you need
56 Fury
 
Hair stacked up and twisted like some beehive made in France
Seven double shots of spray net
Down for nothing left to chance.    
Yeah so here's what's real cries sweet Lucille
They're ain't no other boy I know
Who can even dare to hold a candle to that hot rod Romeo
 
56 Fury high performance built for fun
56 Fury lord have mercy watch her look at her run
56 Fury
 
Two door hard top coupe so sleek and sexy grown men moan
Jet white streak of lightning destination long since gone
Back off V8 Ford back off Chevrolet
Pontiac and Cadillac ain't even fit for hauling hay
 
56 Fury Bound for glory seconds flat
56 Fury Somebody tell me maybe what was that
56 Fury Finest car on the road
