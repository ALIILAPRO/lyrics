		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I might
But would you like to take on me
Make an exception
When there's less to remain of me
So make an exception

Well it's the same thing
I cannot consider a maybe
I'm chasing the night so I can find
Rough bones and bitter diamonds

Let it find you
I wanted the right so you gave me
A fever in the measure of a kind
Rough stones and bitter diamonds

Shouldn't want you to need 
Shouldn't want you to need 
Shouldn't want you to need 
Shouldn't want you to need

So I might
But would you like to take on me
Make an exception
When there's less to remain of me
So make an exception

You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down

Well it's the same thing
I cannot consider a maybe
I'm chasing the night so I can find
Rough storms and bitter diamonds

Shouldn't want you to need 
Shouldn't want you to need 
Shouldn't want you to need
Shouldn't want you to need 

You let me down
You let me down
You let me down
You let me down

So I might
But would you like to take on me
Make an exception
When there's less to remain of me
So make an exception
