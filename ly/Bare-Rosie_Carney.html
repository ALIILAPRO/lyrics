		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bare

Left  me  broken  
Smashed  like  a  glass  that  was  dropped  on  the  floor.  
Words  you've  spoken  
Leave  marks  on  my  skin  like  a  name  on  the  wall.  

How  do  you  
Sleep  right  through  
Bold  and  bare  
I'd  rather  be  there.  

You  keep  asking  
Why  have  your  angels  left  you  on  your  own.  Time  keeps  passing  
Stronger  the  beat  of  your  heart  grows  alone  
As  you  build  up  your  home  
You  can  breathe  on  your  own.  

Oh  do  we  
Forget  dreams  
Drunk  on  air  
Please  take  me  there.  
Please  take  me  there.  
Please  take  me  there.  
Please  take  me  there.  
Please  take  me  there.
