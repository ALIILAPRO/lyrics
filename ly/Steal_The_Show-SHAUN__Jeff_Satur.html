		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got those eyes on you 
I've been watching you all night
All those things you do 
When I'm taking you by my arms
All these lights, it's so obvious that's what you like
Attentions right calling out on you
For the fames you're chasing through

Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm caught in the middle
Flashing lights, fancy life 
That's what you think you are made of
Thrilling times and your lies 
Your adrenaline's toxic as venoms
Oh, but that's not what I'm about

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Take the stage and do your show
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause I want to see it blows
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause you're the star that never glows
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I want you to steal the show
I want you to steal the show

Caught those lies of you
They don't even worth a fight
All those things you do (do)
They are far from what I'm about
I'll be fine (fine) 
But the time is winding down, that's right
Let's face it now, curtain's closing on you, yeah
There's no place to take your role

Baby, I, baby, I, baby, I'm caught in the middle
Flashing lights, fancy life 
That's what you think you are made of
Thrilling times and your lies 
Your adrenaline's toxic as venoms
Oh, but that's not what I'm about

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Take the stage and do your show
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause I want to see it blows
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause you're the star that never glows
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I want you to steal the show
I want you to steal the show
I want you to steal the show
