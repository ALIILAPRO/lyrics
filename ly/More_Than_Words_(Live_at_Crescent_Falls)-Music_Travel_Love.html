		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew

How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words, is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say, that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do, if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say, if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying, I love you
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da

Now that I've tried to, talk to you and make you understand
All that you have to do is, close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words, is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say, that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

What would you do, if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say, if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying, I love you
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da
More than words
La di da, da di da, di dai dai da
More than words
