		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my dancing machine, hold on to me, alright
You're my wildest of dreams, make love to me in the night
You're my dancing machine, eyes like a free Gemini
You're a Hollywood dream, loud and obscene in the night
But you don't wanna be loved
And everybody wants a piece of you
I'm in the corner watching over you
Look at you go

And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
(Everybody just wants to dance with you
Everybody just wants to dance with you)

You're my dancing machine, fly without fear, alright
And you like to be seen, invincible queen in the night
But you don't wanna be loved
And everybody wants a piece of you
I'm in the corner watching over you
Look at you go

And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
(Everybody just wants to dance with you)

What about the nights that belong to us?
Could there be love without a fuss?
What about the nights that belong to us?
I wish you wouldn't be so rough
I wish you wouldn't be so rough
I wish you wouldn't be so rough

And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
And everybody just wants to dance with you
(Everybody just wants to dance with you)
