		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will, but what a thrill
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

I laughed at love 'cause I thought it was funny
But you came along and you moved me, honey
I've changed my mind, this love is fine
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

Kiss me, baby
Ooh, that feels good, baby
Hold me, baby
I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, and so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs
I get nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you drivin' me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

Kiss me, baby
Ooh, that feels good
Hold me, baby
I wanna love you like a lover should
You're fine, and so kind
I'ma tell this world that you're mine, mine, mine, mine

I chew my nails and then I twiddle my thumbs
I get nervous, but it sure is fun
Come on, baby, you drivin' me crazy
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire
