		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me if you got a problem 
Tell me if it's in your way 
Tell me if there's something bothering you 
Tell me what should I say 

You know I'd do almost anything 
You know I'd change the world 
You know I'd do almost anything 
For my little girl 

Tell me if you got a problem 
Tell me now what's inside 
Show me if your broke your heartstrings
You know you never need to hide 

You know I'd do almost anything 
You know I'd paint the sky 
You know I'd do almost anything 
For Your my guiding light

You are my star, shining on me now 
A love from world's apart
I need for you
You are my shining star 
My star 
Love grow us apart 
For me, for you 
You are my shining star 

Once upon a time a memory 
Once upon a time a girl 
Once upon a time a perfect life 
Once upon a perfect world 

You know I did most anything 
You're my guardian light 
You know I do most everything 
To keep you in my life 

You're my star, shining on me now 
Love grow us apart 
For me, for you 
You are my shining star 
My star 
Love grow us apart 
For me, for you 
You are my shining star 

Just a memory 
Every dream you see you and me 
If I wish upon the stars 
Well I hope that's where you are 

When heaven turns you know you'll shine 
You're in my heart for all time 
When heaven turns you know you'll shine 
In worlds of heart 

You're my star, shining on me now 
Love grow us apart 
For me, for you 
You are my shining star 
My star 
Love grow us apart 
For me, for you 
You are my shining star 
You are my shining star 
Shining on me now 
Love grow us apart 
For me for you
