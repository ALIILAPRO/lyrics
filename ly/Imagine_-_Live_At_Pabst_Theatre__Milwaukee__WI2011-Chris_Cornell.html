		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a good Easter song, this next one 

Imagine there's no Heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace

But you may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Maybe one day you'll join us
And the world will live as one
Ah yeah yeah

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

You may say that I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
Maybe someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one

Maybe someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
