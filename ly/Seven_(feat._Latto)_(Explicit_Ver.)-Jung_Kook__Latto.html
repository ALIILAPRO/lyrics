		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weight of the world on your shoulders
I kiss your waist and ease your mind
I must be favored to know ya
I take my hands and trace your lines

It's the way that you can ride
It's the way that you can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know, night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, seven days a week

You love when I jump right in
All of me I'm offering
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is
Wind it back I'll take it slow
Leave you with that afterglow
Show you what devotion is
Deeper than the ocean is

It's the way that you can ride
It's the way that you can ride (oh-oh, oh-oh)
Think I met you in another life
So break me off another time (oh-oh, oh-oh)
You wrap around me and you give me life
And that's why night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, oh

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know, night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, seven days a week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know, night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, seven days a week (Big Latto)

Type to take control, type to take his soul
Take your phone and put it in the camera roll (ah)
Leave them clothes at the door
What you waitin' for? Better come and hit ya goals
Uh, he jump in it, both feet
Going to the sun-up, we ain't getting no sleep
Seven days a week, seven different sheets
Seven different angles, I can be your fantasy
Open up say, "Ah"
Come here, baby, let me swallow your pride
What you on? I can match your vibe
Hit me up and I'ma Cha Cha Slide
You make Mondays feel like weekends
I make him never think 'bout cheatin' (uh)
Got you skipping work and meetings 
Fuck it, let's sleep in, yeah (seven days a week, ooh) 

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second (oh, oh, oh)
You know, night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, seven days a week
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (a week)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Seven days a week
Every hour, every minute, every second
You know, night after night
I'll be fuckin' you right, seven days a week
