		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I'm into you, but you already knew
By the way you touched my hair
Like your hand's always been there
So I dropped my guard, and it hit real hard
Couldn't even make a sound
Felt the whole world slowing down

But when you kiss me, it's so cozy
And I don't know what it is, it's like you know me
And there's a thousand reasons why
We should stop and say, "Goodnight"
But I don't care 'cause you're so damn cozy

Ba-da-da, ba-da-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-da-ba-ba

There's a universe where we both get hurt
But, in this reality
We'll just have to wait and see

I don't ever wanna see you cry (ah-ah)
I don't wanna have to say goodbye (ah-ah)
I don't ever wanna have to choose (ah-ah)
Between having us and losing you

Kiss me, it's so cozy
And I don't know what it is, it's like you know me
And there's a thousand reasons why
We should stop and say, "Goodnight"
But I don't care 'cause you're so damn cozy

When you hold me, you're so cozy
When you hold me, you're so cozy
When you hold me, you're so cozy
When you hold me, you're so cozy

When you kiss me, it's so cozy
And I don't know what it is, it's like you know me
And there's a thousand reasons why
We should stop and say, "Goodnight"
But I don't care 'cause you're so damn cozy
