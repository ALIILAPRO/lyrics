		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, he'll buy me a thorn before he'll buy me a rose
Be covered in dirt before I'm covered in gold
He's trying it on, yeah, he's ticking me off
Say what you want but I won't ever be told
'Cause I'm in love with a monster

Friends say I'm stupid and I'm out of my mind
But without you, boy, I'd be bored all the time
No, I don't really care for the same conversation
Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love, with a monster

I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love with a monster

Wrap me in leather before you wrap me in lace
We breaking rules like we changing the game
He's trying it on, and he's ticking me off
Say what you want but I won't ever be told
I'm in love with a monster

My daddy told me, I should have better taste
But I'd rather pay to see the look on his face
No, I don't really care for the lame conversation
Got everything I need, and I'd rather be chasing
Chasing love, with a monster

I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love (I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
I'm in love with a monster (hey)

Sweeter you try, they don't, not getting love from it
Ain't worth a dime 'cause I just don't get enough from it
(Leave it to me, don't you see, I don't run from it
Bitter the better, hey, hey, hey, hey)

You make me crazy, but I love it (I love it baby)
You make me crazy baby, but I love it (pretty baby)
You make me crazy, but I love it
You make me crazy baby, but I love it
I'm in love with a monster

Everybody now
Did you know (did you know)
Did you know (did you know)
Everybody loves a monster (mmm yeah)
Did you know (did you know)
Did you know (did you know)
Everybody loves a monster (yeah)
I'm in love (we're in love) with a monster

(I'm in love)
I'm in love with a monster
Are you in love with a monster?(I'm in love)
I'll never find another monster
I wanna know, I wanna know
I'm in love with a monster

Hit me, hit me, hit me
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Thank you, goodnight
