		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not sick, I'm not the fool
I'm not scarred and we're not far apart
Well, I admit, I'm at fault
We all got our problems

To live a life without the vows
There'll always be risks
No matter how you try
You'll be sorry

So, where are the answers
I don't wanna save regret
Holding back my dark intent
And all the false redemption
Gonna slip away from what follows

Don't give a fuck

I've got a voice to break the rules
What's all the fuss? And we're not far apart
Well, I admit, I'm at fault
We all got our problems

To live a life without the vows
There'll always be risks
No matter how you try
You'll be sorry

So, where are the answers
I don't wanna save regret
Holding back my dark intent
And all the false redemption
Gonna slip away from what follows

Where are the answers? Where are the answers? Where are the answers?

Ladies and gentlemen
You feel your dark side?
You gonna run and hide or let it go?

There's an evil within us
It can defeat us and kill us
But should we keep the beast hidden
Or just concede to the illness?

I'm not sick, I'm not the fool
I'm not scarred and we're not far apart
Well, I admit, I'm at fault
We all got our problems

So, where are the answers
I don't wanna save regret
Holding back my dark intent
And all the false redemption
Gonna slip away from here
Gonna slip away from here
Gonna slip away from what follows

Don't give a fuck
