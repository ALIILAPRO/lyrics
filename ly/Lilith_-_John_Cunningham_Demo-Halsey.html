		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm perfection when it comes to first impressions
Well, I romanticize and then I get to stressing
A big brain like I'm teaching it a lesson
Baby, it's a blessing, yeah

You got me thinking that I was too mean
Well, everything that I say I believe
Tuck a knife with my heart up my sleeve and
Change like a season
Reason for nothing
I am disruptive
I've been corrupted
And by now I don't need a fucking introduction
I've been gone
'Cause I been on this road too long

You know I get too caught up in a moment
I can't call it love if I show it
I just fuck things up, if you noticed
Have you noticed?
Tell me, have you noticed?

I get too caught up in a moment
I can't fall in love if I show it
I just fuck things up, if you noticed
Have you noticed?
Tell me, have you noticed?

Now I'm wondering if I ever wanted to hold you
It never mattered if I owned you
'Cause you'd let anybody with a body control you
And you know it too

You got me feeling like I've been too mean
And everything that I say I believe
Tuck a knife with my heart up my sleeve
And fuck like a demon
Do it like nothin'
I am disgusting
I've been corrupted
And by now I don't need no help to be destructive
I've been gone
Yeah, I've been on this road too long

You know I get too caught up in a moment
I can't call it love if I show it
I just fuck things up, if you noticed
Have you noticed?
Tell me, have you noticed?

I get too caught up in a moment
I can't fall in love 'cause I'm focused
I just fuck things up, if you noticed
Have you noticed?
Tell me, have you noticed?

The more that you give away
The more that you have
More that you give away
More that you have
The more that you give away
The more that you have
The more that they take
