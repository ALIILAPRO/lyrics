		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah, I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest

Nah, I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah, I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest

And I don't know what the fuck's so wrong
Wasn't ready for the downfall on my own
Should've never talked about it in my songs
You're solo when you're so low, so everything slows down
I'm here and there no I never stay
In the stud, I should've been today
Why the fuck got the cam in my hand?
I do your job 'cause you cannot do shit
And it's like
"Woah" everywhere I go
"Don't make them videos
You waste your force, use it for your flow
Your music and your shows"
But listen bro, I cannot trust yo
Yo lazy motherfuck, I needed help
No pesos, you made it clear my problems ain't yours

Nah I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest

Lost and found then
Many traps on my way
I've been escaping the desert
Of my faith

No, I don't care bro
'Bout all the money, fame and clothes
It's not the point, of what I live for
Where's the joy, was it my choice?
Will I do what I'm I supposed to?
It ain't just words
Pendulum still runs for my soul

Man, I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah, I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest

Nah, I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah, I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
