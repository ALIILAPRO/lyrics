		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped in the darkness
Nothing goes right, please tell me why
My heart is now frozen
But I won't give in, I won't give in

Goddess of despair
May come and knock me down
Trying to escape from the pain, the pain inside
I'm drowning, but I won't give up
To see the light at the end of the road

Just move on and on
Like a warrior
Through miles and miles of rough and rocky road
My destiny lies in my hands
So I trust my own fate and believe that I can change this world

Lost in this cold maze
Nothing seems right but I'm ready to fight

Goddess of despair
May come and knock me down
Tortured by fear
I feel my body shaking
But hoping, just wanting
To see the light at the end of the road

Just move on and on
Like a warrior
Through miles and miles of rough and rocky road
Your destiny is in your hands
So I trust my own fate and open the gate now

To change this world
Be brave and fight back
Feel my soul awakening
I breathe in and out, embrace the moment and say to myself
There must be reasons for all things on earth

So I believe
In light of hope
Shining there deep down inside my heart

Just move on and on
Like a warrior
Through miles and miles of rough and rocky road
My destiny lies in my hands
So I trust my own fate and believe that I can change this world
