		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something in the wind
I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly
On the wings of a bomb
There's something in the wind
I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in hotly
And it's coming in strong

Lately I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try but

Change is a powerful thing
People are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing
I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time this song is done
I'll be able
To be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall when I don't feel beautiful
Or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

Everytime that we run
We don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down
We feel close to it
There's a change gonna come
I don't know where or when
But whenever it does
We'll be here for it

There's something in the wind
I can feel it blowing in
It's coming in softly
On the wings of a song
There's something in the water
I can taste it turning sour
It's bitter, I'm coughing
But now it's in my blood

Lately I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinking it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try but

Change is a powerful thing
People are powerful beings
Trying to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing
I feel it coming in me
Maybe by the time this song is done
I'll be able
To be honest, capable
Of holding you in my arms without letting you fall when I don't feel beautiful
Or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are because

Everytime that we run
We don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down
We feel close to it
There's a change gonna come
I don't know where or when
But whenever it does
We'll be here for it

Hmmm
Yeah, whenever it does
We'll be here for it
Hmmm
Whenever it does
We'll be here for it
