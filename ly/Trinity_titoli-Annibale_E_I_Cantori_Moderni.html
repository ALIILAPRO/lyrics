		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's the guy who's the talk of the town
With the restless gun
Don't you bother to fool him around
Keeps the varmints on the run, boy
Keeps the varmints on the run

You may think he's a sleepy-type guy
Always takes his time
Soon I know you'll be changing your mind
When you've seen him use a gun, boy
When you've seen him use a gun

He's the top of the west
Always cool, he's the best
He keeps alive with his Colt 45

You won't bother to fool him around
When you've seen him use a gun, boy
When you've seen him use a gun

He's the top of the west
Always cool, he's the best
He keeps alive with his Colt 45

Who's the guy who's riding to town
In the prairie sun
You won't bother to fool him around
When you've seen him use a gun, boy
When you've seen him use his gun
