		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I'm disappointed that you didn't
Merry Christmas your way back into my life
And I get that there's still New Years'
But by New Years' I'll be a very different person
So you've really only got like a five day gap
Before I definitely can't tolerate your bullshit anymore
Because I swore that I'd be a non-bullshit tolerating kind of girl, who

Looks after her head, leaves people on read
No getting attached to men you can't have
No crying on tubes, no weird little moves
No telling the truth and definitely no you, Andrew

Last year, I had to focus on survival
My ex was a bitter man, middle child
Oh dear, oh wow, now I'm in my holy revival
And I have two friends
I listen to them like the Bible
My ex gets a little wave, little smile
Good luck, god speed
Now I'm in my holy revival
Mhm, now I'm in my holy revival

I bet you're all wondering who Andrew is
And that is really not important
Stay with me here, it's what he represents
Which is me getting obsessed
By someone fundamentally wrong for me
I'm not doing it again
It's just, just me and myself
So good for my health, you're just kinda dumb
I'm just kinda done
No crying on tubes, no weird little moves
No telling the truth and definitely no you, Andrew

Last year, I had to focus on survival
My ex was a bitter man, middle child
Oh dear (oh dear), oh wow, now I'm in my holy revival
And I have two friends
I listen to them like the Bible
My ex gets a little wave, little smile
Good luck, god speed
Now I'm in my holy revival
I'm in my holy revival

Last year, I had to focus on survival
My ex was a bitter man, middle child
Oh dear, oh wow, now I'm in my holy revival
Had to focus on survival
Bitter man, middle child
