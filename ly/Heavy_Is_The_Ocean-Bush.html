		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come alive
I see all the answers right there in your eyes
Come inside
I'm waiting for you like my suicide

They don't know a damn thing, babe
This fuckery could be the death of us
This fuckery could be the death of us

Heavy is the ocean
Steady all the ways
Heavy is the ocean
Cracked but we don't break
Heavy is the ocean
Heavy is the ocean
Heavy

In the sky
The endless stars are lead to fantasize
In the night
Silhouettes dance rings around your life

They don't know a damn thing, babe
This bravery will save the world a bit
This bravery will save this world a bit

Heavy is the ocean
Steady all the ways
Heavy is the ocean
Cracked but we don't break

Heavy is the ocean (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy is the ocean (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy is the ocean (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy is the ocean (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy

You burn with love
You'll miss the one that you love the most
You give it up
It's the worst that you'll ever get

All the time
You're in me like the waves crash, all in white
In light
A silver blue that shines across tonight

I give it all
I give it all

Heavy is the ocean
Steady all the ways
Heavy is the ocean
Cracked but we don't break

Heavy is the ocean (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy is the ocean (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy is (heavy is the ocean)
Heavy is
Heavy is the ocean
