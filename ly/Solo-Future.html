		  Talk to me

I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down

You see how we livin', yeah
I'm tryna keep it simple as possible
You know what I do, haha

Get you Gucci on site, yeah, Rollies on ice, yeah
Get first class flights, yeah, when you ride it like a bike, yeah
Get a brand new Wag, ayy, be quiet, don't brag, ayy
You ain't never pump gas, hey, need to keep it on task, yeah
Peelin' off, flex, hey, keep it on track, hey
Fussin' and fightin', yeah, fuckin' all night, ayy
Gotta make it count, yeah, love it when it bounce, yeah
Girl, that's tight, yeah, get whatever you like, ayy
Gucci on sight, yeah, Rollie on ice, yeah
Take my advice, ayy, live a better life

You got maids right now, you got it made right now
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
It's like 4 right now, it's like 4 right now
It's like 4 right now, it's like 4 AM right now
We can't be too discrete, niggas gon' know right now
Got my name too big, everybody know right now
I enjoyed our time, we been on the low for a while
I been solo now, I've been goin' solo now

Twenty ounce steaks, hey, can't fit it on the plate
Jumbo shrimp, hey, straight out the lake, hey
Sleepin' on the boat, ayy, wake up, take dope, ayy
You don't want no smoke, nigga, don't want no starch, ayy
We gon' put it on the hood, ayy, before we put it on God, hey

Ayy

You got maids right now, you got it made right now
I won't let you down, I won't let you down
It's like 4 right now, it's like 4 right now
It's like 4 right now, it's like 4 AM right now
We can't be too discrete, niggas gon' know right now
Got my name too big, everybody know right now
I enjoyed our time, we been on the low for a while
I been solo now, I've been goin' solo now

Solo now
E-Everybody know right now
I've been goin' solo now

Bands on your tags, woo, know you got bags, woo
I won't let you down, bet I won't let you down
Bands on your tags, woo, know you got bags, woo
I won't let you down, bet I won't let you down

I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down, no way
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down
I don't wanna let you down, I don't wanna let you down

Niggas gon' know right now
Everybody know right now

I've been goin' solo now
