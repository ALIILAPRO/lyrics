		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna go
But baby, we both know
This is not our time
It's time to say goodbye
Until we meet again
'Cause this is not the end, oh
It will come a day
When we will find our way, way

Violins playin' and the angels cryin'
When the stars align, then I'll be there

No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you, oh
You're stuck on me like a tattoo, oh
No, I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you, oh
You're stuck on me like a tattoo, oh

I'm letting my hair down
I'm taking it cool
You got my heart in your hand
Don't lose it, my friend
It's all that I got

Violins playin' and the angels cryin'
When the stars align, then I'll be there

No, I don't care about them all
'Cause all I want is to be loved
And all I care about is you, oh
You're stuck on me like a tattoo, oh
No, I don't care about the pain
I'll walk through fire and through rain
Just to get closer to you, oh
You're stuck on me like a tattoo, oh

You're stuck on me like a 
Like a tattoo, oh
You're stuck on me 
Like a tattoo, oh
You're stuck on me like a tattoo

You're stuck on me like a
