		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you say you're lonely
You cry the whole night through

Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river, I cried a river over you

And now you say you're sorry
For bein' so untrue

Well you can cry me a river
Cry me a river, 'cause I cried a river over you

You drove me nearly out of my head
While you never shed a tear babe

Remember, I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
You told me you were through with me

And now you say you love me
Well just to prove that you do

Why don't you cry me a river
Cry me a river, 'cause I cried a river over you, over you

You say you loved me, but you lied

Now you say you love me
Well just to prove that you do

Come on and cry me a river
Oh cry me a river
I cried a river over you

I cried a river over you, I cried a river
Now you can too, cry me a river

Cry me a river
