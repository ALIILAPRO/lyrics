		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once more we sing along
To this never ending song 
Once more we carry on the pain
What have we done?

Once more we sing along
To this never ending song
Once more we'll dance the hurt away
What do you say?

Once more we sing along
To this never ending song
Once more we carry on the pain
What have we done?

Could I've done more?
What if we're done?
Once more we carry on the pain
What have we done?

For too long, been dying inside
For too long
For too long, I've been dying inside
For too long, oh

Once more we sing along
To this never ending song 
Once more we'll dance the hurt away
What do you say?

For too long, I've been dying inside
For too long
Just maybe I've been giving in, shivering
For too long

For too long, I've been awake at night
For too long

For too long, I've been dying inside, oh my god
For too long
Just maybe, I've been giving in and shivering
For too long
Could have been wrong, rather been right
