		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tough girl in the fast lane
No time for love, no time for hate
No drama, no time for games
Tough girl whose soul aches

I come home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony (oh)

I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking

Tough girl, I'm in pain
It's lonely at the top, blackouts and airplanes
And I still pour you a glass of champagne
Tough girl whose soul aches

I come home, on my own
Check my phone, nothing, though
Act busy, order in
Pay TV, it's agony (oh)

I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking

I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up, I wake up, I wake up
Alone

I may cry ruinin' my makeup
Wash away all the things you've taken
And I don't care if I don't look pretty
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their hearts are breaking
Big girls cry when their heart is breaking
