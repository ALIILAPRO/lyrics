		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let go of me, I'm better on my own
This isn't me, this isn't me anymore
Let me be free 'cause this isn't me
Doesn't feel like me

I didn't want it, I never meant to
So accidentally to fall in love with you
I didn't want it, I never meant to
I never meant to

I'm looking for resulting, searching for a hope
'Cause when you kicked me out you closed that door
I am looking for a heart to love me more
Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you

Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, 'cause you love me wrong
Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, just like I loved you

My heart was on fire, yeah; your heart was a stone
I loved you so right, but you loved me so wrong
Just like I loved you 
Just like I loved you, just like I loved you

You didn't see, you didn't feel my pain
You left me here all by myself again
Did you ever love me? Oh, I was just a game to you
Was just a game to you

I didn't want it, I never meant to
I lost myself in this, I sold my soul to you
I didn't want it, I never meant to
I never meant to

I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, 'cause you love me wrong
Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, just like I loved you

Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, 'cause you love me wrong
Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, just like I loved you

Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, 'cause you love me wrong
Just like I loved you
Just like I loved you, just like I loved you
