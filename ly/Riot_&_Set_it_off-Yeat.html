		  Yeah, riot
Yeah, riot-riot
Riot-riot, yeah, riot-riot
Riot-riot, yeah, riot-riot
Riot-riot, yeah, riot-riot

You could fly in this shit, you should lie down
I got whole lotta money, I could fly now
I could take you, pull up to my planet, right now
Ride (ride) 'til you ('til you) die (die)
All of it, all of it, all of it, all of it
Ride (ride) 'til you ('til you) die (die)
All of it, all of it, all of it, all of it

No, no, we don't make room
No, we don't pay for you
No, we don't play the role
No, we gon' lay low
No, I don't make room
No, I don't fuck with you
No, I don't fuck with you
No, I don't fuck with you
No, we gon' lay low
No, we don't play the role
Yeah, we gon' let it go
Yeah, we gon' let it off

I'm gon' set it off
I'm gon' set it off
We gon' let it fly, we just crossed the sky
We gon' let it off
We gon' let it off
We gon' send ya off, far across the sky
I put G in golf, I put G in wagon
I put money up, shit you couldn't imagine

Put it all up, pour it all up
Put it all up, pour it all up
Put it all up, pour it all up
Put it all up, pour it all up
