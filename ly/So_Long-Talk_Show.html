		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Settle down you know you got a ways to go
Moving slowly gets you by
Settle down now - You'll be around now
After all your flowers die

Trees grow from the silence of the earth and never speak
Thoughts that come from underneath are pure and never weak

And you have lived for so long
You have lived for so long

Have regrets you will, it's only natural
Have them till the day you die
Having doubts now,
You'll come about now
Birds always fall before they fly
