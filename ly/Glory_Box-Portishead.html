		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so tired
Of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just

Give me a reason
To love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman

I just want to be a woman
From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over, and give us some room, yeah

Give me a reason
To love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman

I just want to be a woman

So don't you stop
Being a man
Just take a little look 
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

Give me a reason 
To love you
Give me a reason to be
A woman
I just want to be a woman

It's all I want to be 
Is all woman
For this is the beginning 
Of forever 
And ever

It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

I'm so tired
Of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just

Give me a reason, to love you
