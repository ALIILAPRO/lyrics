		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you mean, "I don't believe in God"?
I talk to him everyday
What do you mean, "I don't support your system"?
I go to court when I have to
What do you mean, "I can't get to work on time"?
Got nothing better to do
And, what do you mean, "I don't pay my bills"?
Why do you think I'm broke? Huh?

If there's a new way
Oh, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

What do you mean, "I hurt your feelings"?
I didn't know you had any feelings
What do you mean, "I ain't kind"?
Just not your kind

What do you mean, "I couldn't be the President
Of the United States of America"?
Tell me something, it's still "We the people" right?

If there's a new way
Oh, I'll be the first in line
But it better work this time

Can you put a price on peace?

Peace
Peace sells
Peace
Peace sells
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
Peace sells, but who's buying?
(No, no no no no)
(Peace sells)

(Peace sells, aah)
