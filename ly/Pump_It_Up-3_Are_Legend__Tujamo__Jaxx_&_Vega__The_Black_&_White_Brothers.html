		  Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you

Just put your hands up

You got to pump it up
Don’t you

You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you know, pump it up
You got to pump it up

Don’t you

Just put your hands up

You got to pump it up
Don’t you

You got to pump it up
Don’t you

You got to pump it up
