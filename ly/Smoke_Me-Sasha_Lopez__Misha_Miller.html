		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never could
Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never had enough
Mhm mhm mhm
Woah!

Woah!
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Woah!
Barambam, boom barambam
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam

If you hear me singing
If you hear my soul
You'll never want to let me go
Close your eyes and I will
Catch your flow inside
Your body is dancing, wildest one

Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never could
Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never had enough
Woah!

Woah!
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Woah!
Barambam, boom barambam
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Woah!

Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never could
Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never had enough
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Woah!

Woah!
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
Woah!
Barambam, boom barambam
Boom bam barambam, boom barambam
