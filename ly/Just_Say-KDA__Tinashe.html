		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to
Hear you talking anymore
'Cause I know it's hard
I can see you all alone
So come into my home
Baby I don't need to
Believe every word you say
With all the games you play
Doesn't matter that you're late, you're always late

Just say that you love me
'Cause I want you to
Just say that you love me
And help me get to you
Just say that you need me
Baby like I need you
While the world is spinning 'round
I'm on solid ground
If you say that you love me

I can feel you
I can feel you when you move
And it feels so good
Look so pretty when you're down
But you don't make a sound
Oh, when I'm holding you
Holding at just air
When I'm touching you
You seem so far away from me
And I never seem to be who I wanna be
When you talk to me

Just say that you love me
'Cause I want you to
Just say that you love me
And help me get to you
Just say that you need me
Baby like I need you
While the world is spinning 'round
I'm on solid ground
If you say that you love me
'Cause I want you to
If you say that you love me
And help me get to you
If you say that you need me
Baby like I need you
While the world is spinning 'round
I'm on solid ground
If you say that you love me

Like I need you
Like I need you (you, you, you)
Like I need you
Like I need you You, you, you
Like I need you
Like I need you You, you, you
Like I need you
Like I need you

Don't you tell me
Don't you tell me that we're through
After all I've done for you
It's just another silly game
That's causing me this pain
Oh, burning paradise right down to the ground
Taking everything, all that god laid down
And now you're still testing me somehow
And I need you now
But you won't no, you won't say you love me

Just say (hey, hey, hey, hey)

So just say that you love me
'Cause I want you to
Just say that you love me
And help me get to you
Just say that you need me
Baby like I need you
While the world is spinning 'round
I'm on solid ground
If you say that you love me
'Cause I want you to
If you say that you love me
And help me get to you
If you say that you need me
Baby like I need you
While the world is spinning 'round
I'm on solid ground
If you say that you love me
