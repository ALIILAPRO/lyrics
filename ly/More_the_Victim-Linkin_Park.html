		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've listened endlessly to your injury
You wanna talk about your sores?
You wanna talk about suffering?
Maybe sympathy is all you're really hungry for
'Cause you just criticize and you fingerpoint
And you say that they beat you down
You may be victimized, but you're still the one
Who won't just get up off the ground

I used to be as innocent as you
My excuses ran out
Ran out of things to complain about
Fear will always find a way to show right through

You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
You want to say you're more the victim

You wanna talk constantly about misery
And how you've been done so wrong
You wanna bend your honesty and exaggerate
With the stress that you've undergone
There's never a compromise, no one can say
That they've ever been hurt before
They may be victimized, but you'll always say
That you're a victim so much more

I used to be as innocent as you
My excuses ran out
Ran out of things to complain about
Fear will always find a way to show right through

You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
You want to say you're more the victim

You wanna be just another someone
Somebody angry, somebody broken
You wanna be that? Then be it all alone

You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
You want to say you're more the victim
You want to be more hurt than me
You want to say you're more the victim
You wanna complain and pass the blame
Pass the blame, pass the blame
