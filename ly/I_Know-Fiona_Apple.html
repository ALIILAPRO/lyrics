		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So be it, I'm your crowbar
If that's what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess

And I will pretend
That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know

And you can use my skin
To bury secrets in
And I will settle you down

And at my own suggestion
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know

Baby
I can't help you out
While she is still around

So for the time being, I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense all the time
Give it time

And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtain
I'll wait by the backstage door

While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It's okay, don't need to say it
