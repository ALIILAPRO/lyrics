		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe it
The totem figure speaks the truth, I see it
I bow to whispers
The legs and arms are numb and now I feel it

The wall's falling, the mind is opening, and now I see it
The red face paint, so much is happening and now I see it

I believe that I'll die, but in the same dream I'm flying
I believe that I saw something none of us shouldn't

Carvings, left from old dreamers
Left in the
Carvings, left from old dreamers
I'm lost in the dream

I can see it 
The floating colors speak the truth, I feel it	
Allow the whispers
To let you swim in oceans deep and freely
The tone's changing, the void's opening and I can see it
The red face paint, the shaman's smile deceives me now, I see it

I believe that I'm done, but in the same dream I'm choking
I believe that I saw something none of us shouldn't

Carvings, left from old dreamers
Left in the
Carvings, left from old dreamers
Left in the
Carvings, left from old dreamers
Left in the
Carvings, left from old dreamers
I'm lost in the dream

Taking travelers through jungles of their own
Sunset is all far gone, but moonlight 

Shows them

Taking some of them, dancing with ghosts to drums
Drink up and let your soul out, open

Open now

They say the dead are coming home

I saw horrors roaming free in jungle
Stuck in terror, shamans locker
I saw creatures carve my name on totems
Stuck in dreams outside of myself

Carvings, left from old dreamers 
Left in the
Carvings, left from old dreamers
I'm lost in the dream
