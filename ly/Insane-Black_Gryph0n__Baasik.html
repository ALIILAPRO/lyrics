		  Dearly beloved, for your entertainment
It's my pleasure to introduce to you hell's latest arrival
The equal-opportunity killer, Alastor

Hello, it's nice to meet you (hello)
Oh, can you tell me where I am?
I don't know how I got here
But I, I think I'm starting to understand
I don't belong among the angels
And baby, that's just fine with me
The things I did up there were high school
But now I'm going for my degree

Hey, sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire

Wait a minute, do I know you?
Weren't you an old pal of mine?
Departed from us far too early
But now we're meeting a second time
We used to have such fun together
And maybe you have what I need
But first I have one tiny question
Tell me, do you demons bleed?

Hey, sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire
(Yeah, alright)

Hey, sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire

Sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
