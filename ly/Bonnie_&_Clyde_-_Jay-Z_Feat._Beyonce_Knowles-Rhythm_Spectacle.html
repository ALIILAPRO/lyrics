		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I've had this secret
And I feel it's time that you should know
When I'm in your arms, it turns me on
But I've got a conscience, too
And it says my heart's never in tune
With anything I do

So, this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you,
"I'm your biggest fan."
I'm your biggest fan

I've had this secret
And now it's time that you should know
I was wrong to string you along
Circulating the streets in the pulsating heat
I scoured your town, completely aroused
Making love to your memory

So, this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you,
"I'm your biggest fan."
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you,
"I'm your biggest fan."

Sad minion of mine
Don't be so unkind
I know I stole your coat
You can have the song I wrote
I've just crossed the line
From fashion to crime
But it's such a perfect fit
When I am wearing it
Sad minion of mine
Don't be so unkind
I know I stole your coat
You can have the song I wrote
I've just crossed the line
From fashion to crime

So, this is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you,
"I'm your biggest fan."
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you,
"I'm your biggest fan."
This is the last time that I'll hold your hand
I want to kiss you on the mouth and tell you,
"I'm your biggest fan."
I'm your biggest fan
