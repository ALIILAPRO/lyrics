		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long and still nobody quite like you
Can't fill the void inside my head since you

I can't find my way through this storm
In too deep far from shore
Too weak to fight
Can't hold on anymore

Just let me love you
Let me be the one you want
Just let me love you
We can be more than enough

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you

Maybe we can find a way for us
We're far from home
But all we really need is one touch

We can find our way through this storm
In too deep to give up on us
I'm willing to fight
And hold on a little anymore

Just let me love you
Let me be the one you want
Just let me love you
We can be more than enough
Just let me love you
Just let me love you

Just let me love you
Just let me love you
Just let me love you

Just let me love you
