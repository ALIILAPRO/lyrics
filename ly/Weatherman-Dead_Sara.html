		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His skin was soft as leather 
I'm the weatherman 
No one else more dedicated 
I'm the weatherman 
Well, hey kid 
You got the right 
But the choice to kill 
No, son of sam 
Will let you in to turn against 
Addicted to the love of ourselves 
I'm the weatherman 
I tell no one else 
I'm the weatherman 

So go for the kill 
'Cause no one else cares 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 

His skin was soft as leather 
I'm the weatherman 
There's no on else worth the dedication 
I'm the weatherman 
'Cause hey kid 
You got the heart without the ache 
Pretentious thieves 
Have you believe it's theirs to take 
Addicted to the love of ourselves 
I'm the weatherman 
And tell no one else 
I'm the weatherman 

So go for the kill 
'Cause no one else cares 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 

For here's the history we make 
For luck, of our fathers 
(If I could be anywhere I wouldn't be here) 
No future or good night 
(If I could be anywhere I wouldn't be here) 
No future fans 
(If I could be anywhere I wouldn't be here) 

I sing for the melody and I sing for a reason 
And I'll sing as the neglect for all that un-american 

So go for the kill 
'Cause no one else cares 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill, go for the kill 
Go for the kill
