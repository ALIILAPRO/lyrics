		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh ooh ooh, ooh ah

Now this might be a mistake
That I'm calling you this late
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough

Started bringing up the past
How the things you love don't last
Even though this isn't fair for both of us

Ooh
Maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are

Ooh, these minefields that I walk through
Ooh, what I risk to be close to you
Ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
(Whoa) Ooh, what I risk to be close to you

Close to you

I didn't notice what I lost
Until all the lights were off
And not knowing what you're up to tortured me

Now this might be a mistake
We're broken in so many ways
But I piece us back together slowly

Ooh
Maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are

Ooh, these minefields that I walk through
Ooh, what I risk to be close to you
Ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
Whoa, what I risk to be close to you

Close to you (oh ooh)
(Oh, to be close to you)
Close to you (ooh oh)
Ooh (to you, to you)

Now this might be a mistake
That I'm calling you this late
But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough
