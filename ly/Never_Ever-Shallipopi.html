		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wey, they call me Shalipopi
My life is like a moving train (Moving moving)
I just wanna live my life on a Friday night I be cruising
Many nor Dey feel my pain, cause many never knew me
I know I'm a born winner, and I know all this bitches tryna use me

By the time you go know my worth, say I promise you I be long gone
Call me Mr President, girly hope say you know where I come from
I be fucking all my enemies, I go raw with no condom
And I be Pluto boy and my people know say I stubborn

They never seen a guy like me, I say they never ever
Never seen a bad man like me, they never ever

They never seen a guy like me, they never ever
Seen a bad man like me, they never ever

I spent two milly, two milly on my baby, and I'ma spend two more milly milly (yoko)
And when I stack up funds, I'ma stack them up to the ceiling ceiling
Why you wanna come around me? Only when imma winning winning
Girl I be your Asap Rocky
And you be my bad girl Riri

By the time you go know my worth, say I promise you I be long gone
Call me Mr President, girly hope say you know where I come from
I be fucking all my enemies, I go raw with no condom
And I be Pluto boy and my people know say I stubborn

They never ever seen a guy like me, I say they never ever
Never seen a bad man like me, they never ever

They never ever seen a guy like me, I say they never ever
Seen a bad man like me, they never ever
