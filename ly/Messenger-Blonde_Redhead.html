		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay still do be still 
No wonder you are always lost 
If a messenger you must be known 
Then with messages you must return 
To be seen by demanding hands 
And touches of jealous men 
Invisible and forgivable 
To all their secret hands 

Be it so be quick 
Don't run just walk and walk and walk 
Don't loose yourself to decorate 
Somewhere on your wall 
Cause somewhere in your mind 
You know you are doing fine 
Holding secret hair locks 
You'll pluck before you hide 

So how can I keep anything to myself 
So how can I keep any of these to myself 
So how can I keep anything to myself 
Behind those clouds 
I'm almost home
