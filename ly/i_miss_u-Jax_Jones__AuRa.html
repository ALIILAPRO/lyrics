		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only miss you when it rains
And when I listen to the radio
Go past your station on the train
And then I'll think of you
Can't help but think of you

Seasons change and I remember
How you loved me like September
Time goes by and I pretend that
That I don't think of you

I only miss you when I open my eyes
And I breathe and I try to forget
That I let you go
I only miss you when I'm closing my eyes
Try to sleep and I cry
To forget that I let you go

I only miss you when I open my eyes
And I breathe and I try to forget
That I let you go
I only miss you when I'm closing my eyes
Try to sleep and I cry
To forget that I let you go

I only miss you when
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da
I only miss you when
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da

I never talk about you now
I hear you're happy and that's hard to know
I sometimes wander past your house
Because I think of you
I always think of you

Seasons change and I remember
How you loved me like September
Time goes by and I pretend that
That I don't think of you

(I miss you) that I don't think of you
(I miss you) that I don't think of you
(I miss you) that I don't think of you
(I miss you) that I don't think of you
(I miss you) that I don't think of you
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da)
(I miss you) that I don't think of you
(Da-da-da-da, da-da-da)
(I miss you) that I don't think of you

I only miss you when I open my eyes
And I breathe and I try to forget
That I let you go
I only miss you when I'm closing my eyes
Try to sleep and I cry
To forget that I let you go

I only miss you when I open my eyes
And I breathe and I try to forget
That I let you go
I only miss you when I'm closing my eyes
Try to sleep and I cry
To forget that I let you go

I only miss you when
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da
I only miss you when
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da
