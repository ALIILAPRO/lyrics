		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmmm, oohhhh, yeah yeah yaah
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket to the blues

Choo choo train
Tuckin' down the track
Gotta travel on it
Never comin' back
Ooh
Ooh got a one way ticket to the blues

Bye bye love
My babe is leavin' me
Now lonely tear drops are all that I can see

Ooh
Ooh
Got a one way ticket to the blues
Gonna take a trip to lonesome town
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel

A fool such as I, a fool such as I
There never was
I cry my tears away

One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket to the blues

Choo choo train
Tuckin' down the track
Gotta travel on it
Never comin' back
Ooh
Ooh got a one way ticket to the blues

Gotta go on
Gotta truck on
Got a one way ticket to the blues

I gotta take a trip to lonesome town
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel
Ooh
A fool such as I, a fool such as I
There never was I cry my tears away

One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket
One way ticket to the blues

Choo choo train
Tuckin' down the track
Gotta travel on it
Never comin' back
Ooh yeah yeah yeah
Ooh got a one way ticket to the blues

Got my ticket
There is no way you can deny it
I see that you're oh so sad
