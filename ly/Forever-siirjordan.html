		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told you bout how I'm taking off
I told you bout how I'm taking off
I told yo ass I would take it all
Love over hate but they fake it all
Even when I'm down and low nigga I'm still a boss
No Nigga your not with the mob
Fuck talking get to the plot
Fuck Niggas yeah they talk a lot
Do not give a fuck cuz I'm, laid back
Oh yeah, Ain't no time travel ain't no way back
If it's fuck me then say that
I ain't here to lie I'm here to state facts
Lie after lie they gone cover it up
You'll know when you know that's that feel in your gut
Closest one to you got to watch out for them
Don't make it easy to obtain your trust
Shit getting old might turn to rust
Gotta stay cautious nigga that's a must
Hell of a difference between love and lust
Hoes hella quick to get it fucked up
Yeah I'm just taking a stand
Yeah the man with the plan
Yeah watch me count it up
Yeah I won't be needing a hand
I want them racks in demand
I could never fall down again
Even when I struggle I'm still the man
Yeah it's been forever but I'll stick too the plan
Yeah, I'll stick to the plan, yeah
Yeah its been forever
I'll stick to the plan, yeah
I'll stick to the plan, yeah
Yeah its been forever
I'm running it up no matter how long it takes
That nigga said he was gone stick by but somehow he still turned out fake
You've been prey watch out for the snakes
Steady watching you and yo every move watch how they presence fade
Asking myself how can I get up
Don't gotta be picked up
I'm soon to be richer
Do you get the picture
The lord sent me on a mission
This life he gave us my ambition
I earned my stripes nigga through intuition
Forever with motion need a intermission
Yeah its been forever
Yeah its been forever
