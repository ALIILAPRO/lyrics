		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passing in the shadows
Upping the risk of being found
When we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lying trust

I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

I was a faking alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights

Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lying trust

I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you

That you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me (dangerous)
Tell me that you love me
Tell me that you love me (your love is always dangerous)
Tell me that you love me

I don't know why
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (do with, do with, do with)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you (I don't know)
To do with you (I don't know why)
I don't know why, but I guess it's got something to do with you
To do with you
