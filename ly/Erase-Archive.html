		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you know how to die
Deleting yourself alive

Erase your face from time
Erase the all of you from mind

And you know how to fall
Did you ever really care at all

Erase your face from all the sides
Erase yourself from love
Erase yourself from love
Erase it all away
Erase yourself from memory

You know how to kill, you're murdering love
'Cause hurting just ain't enough
You know how to kill, you're murdering love
'Cause dying just ain't enough
You know how to kill, destroying love
'Cause dying just ain't enough

Erase yourself from all the love
Erase yourself from love
Erase your face from all the all the sides

You know how to fall
Erase yourself from love
You know how to die
Dying just ain't enough
