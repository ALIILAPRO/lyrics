		  [Part I Odysseus' Theme / Overture]

[instrumental]



[Part II - Journey to Ithaca]

To the one that I love, my journey has begun
When our eyes meet once more there will be peace
The taste of your lips the warmth of your touch
Again, forever, two souls as one

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home, I'm dreaming of home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
To return would make my dream
Come true

Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years
I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca
I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears
But the tide is changing, and with it all my fears

Yeaaaah
I will return

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home, I'm dreaming of home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
To return would make my dream
Come true

Behold the sea and winds of Jove
We set sail guided by the stars above
The ports of Troy escape our view
A cold and stormy fate awaits our rendezvous

Onward we ride into the raging fury
Setting our course by the moon and sun
We forge ahead
Seeking glory
Yet the journey has just begun

Ohh

Onward we ride
Nine days we brave her might
We are (we are we are we are we are we are ) coming home...



[Part III - The Eye]

Awakened at dawn
Land dead ahead with the winds of the morning we change course
No remorse, a place forbidden to all

Search all the grounds
Find food and water
Yet journey not into the Caves of Woe
Long ago
A legend spoke of a beast

A thousand riches
Hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares
Mortal's blood forever flows

Mountainous black
Engulfed in a shadow
A bone chilling growl and an Eye of Hate
A ghastly fate, held prisoner by the Eye

Yet he must sleep
As the daylight fades
We focus our senses and sharpen the blade
We take aim
In silence we strike

A thousand riches
Hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares
Blood runs forever
From the Eye...



[Part IV - Circe (Daughter of the Sun)]

We sit adrift on the open sea
The gift of wind, by Zeus, concealed
So carelessly
We break the waves on a course untrue
Across the endless plain of blue
A new coast in view

Yeaaah

We, carouse with the maiden beneath her eyes the madness lies...
In mystery
I (I), drink deep from the chalice of gold and jad, my senses fade...
I'm mesmerized
Ohhh

Stay like those before I condemn you all, from walk to crawl...
Metamorphasized
No (no), my will it defies her speak the verse, lift the curse...
She's mesmerized
Ohhh ohhh

Am I asleep?
Tell me
Daughter of the Sun
There's vengeance in the air
And all things all things must be undone



[Part V - Sirens]

Dire warnings
Told by the sorceress in white
"False bringers of love" - Sirens
Echoing songs from above
Wings flowing
Floating on Sea of Lies, I defy
Their vision
Elysium swallows my cries

Embracing
Maidens of lust stimulate and manipulate
My senses
I welcome a watery grave
Tied steadfast
To the mast tragedy awaits me
I'm falling
Victim betrayed by the sea



[Part VI - Scylla and Charybdis]

[a) Gulf of Doom]
[b) Drifting Home]

[instrumental]



[Part VII - The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithaca]

So this is home...
In the guise of a beggar
Minerva guides my way
I find the kingdom in jeopardy

Vengeance it swells within me as I spy
So many who eye my Queen
I'll make them pay for this blasphemy...
All will see

Triumphant Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Ohhhh
Triumphant Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
My journey has come to and end
Woahhh ohhh

A contest of valor
"To pierce all the rings in a single arrow's flight"
Yet, not a one can string the bow

My veil of silence lifted all is revealed
Revenge burns in my heart
Thrashing and slashing down all my foes...
To claim the throne

Triumphant Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Woahhh ohhh
Triumphant Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin this is the end of my Odyssey

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home, I'm finally home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
I have returned to make my dream come true
