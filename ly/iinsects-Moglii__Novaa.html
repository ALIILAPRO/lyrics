		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was a dragon
I think I would fly
Through the heavens
Escaping your eyes
If I was a garden
I think I could grow
If I was no use to you
Would you let me live here, too?

When I find big things in small places
It seems like the big things, they can't take it

Embrace it (embrace it)
Embrace it (embrace it)
Embrace it (embrace it)
Embrace it, embrace it

If I was an insect
Would I be irrelevant?
Do you still see me
When you cannot scale my size?
If I was a scarab
Living of your dust and dirt
If I was no use to you
Would you let me live here, too?

When I find big things in small places
It seems like the big things, they can't take it

Embrace it (embrace it)
Embrace it (embrace it)
Embrace it (embrace it)
Embrace it, embrace it

Come in, crawl down
My skin, new town
New friends, same love
Please save my home

Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it
Embrace it, embrace it

Insects are so fucking annoying, but insects are very cute
And, um, I like insects, I like spiders, they're very cute
Sometimes, they live in my house, and I give them names
And then I have a friendship with them, and they show up once in a while
And I like them, they're cute
