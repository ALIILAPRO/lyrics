		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this is more than I'm missing 
I'm feeling ridiculous 
This is more than a dissing 
So shut up and listen 
Oh I've got more than you're dreaming 
So stay with your prisoners 
I've got something to teach ya, baby 
But let me tell you something, baby 
I just wanna hold you close enough 
And I wanna live just you and I

Baby, I just want you close tonight
Baby, I just want you close tonight
And I wanna live just you and I 
Baby, I just want you close tonight
Baby, I just want you close tonight
But let me tell you something baby, baby, whoa

You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours, baby 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours, baby 

Oh, this is more than a kiss for me 
You left me with no breath 
And I'm feeling so bad for ya 
I'm feeling so bad 
You were lying in front of me 
Naked in the bed 
No I've got something to teach ya, baby 
But let me tell you something baby 
I just wanna hold you close enough 
And I wanna live just you and I 
Baby, I just want you close tonight
Baby, I just want you close tonight
And I wanna live just you and I 
Baby, I just want you close tonight
Baby, I just want you close tonight
But let me tell you something baby, baby, whoa

You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours, baby 

You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours, baby 

You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 

You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours, baby 

You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
You've got me trapped in your mind 
But tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours 
Tonight I won't be yours, baby
