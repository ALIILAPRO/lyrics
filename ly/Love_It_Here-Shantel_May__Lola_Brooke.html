		  Hey, Major
SK

Love it here
Love it here
He love it when you here
Love it, he love it when 
Do you love it, love it?
You love it when you're here

So now, so now
Love it here
You love it, love it
Love it when you here
Love it, love it when you

He gon' come when I call
Bet he be right back home
Can't stay mad for too long
'Cause I got what he want
He gon' text my phone when he ready
He might talk that shit and go crazy
Toxic tendencies, it's complicated
Don't get it twisted, that's my baby

Don't think for once, I don't cross his mind
That's that bad bitch magic
Hard to breathe without it
It'd be a cold night to see him break this habit
Our love story's short but it's tragic
But he fell in love with the madness

He ain't goin' nowhere
Promise he loves it here
My baby ain't goin' nowhere, I swear (goin' nowhere, goin' nowhere)
Promise he loves it here (loves it here)
Still here (love it here)

He could say nothin'
He gon' say he gon' leave, he ain't budgin'
Might try but he out of his mind
To him not a dime of a dozen, it's no discussion
It may be like that
Got that good, make his ass want to spin back
Yeah, his energy, I match that
You hate it's hard to let me go

Don't think for once, I don't cross his mind
That's that bad bitch magic
Hard to breathe without it
It'd be a cold night to see him break this habit
Our love story's short but it's tragic
But he fell in love with the madness

He ain't goin' nowhere
Promise he loves it here
My baby ain't goin' nowhere, I swear (goin' nowhere, goin' nowhere)
Promise he loves it here (loves it here) (love it)
Still here (love it here, love it here) (you know you love it here)

It shouldn't be that hard to keep 'em out our business (nah)
And since you love it here so much, you should lick what's in it (hey, baby)
Tastes like strawberries, sugar mixing in wit' lemons (uh-huh)
Come to the studio, spit in it for thirty minutes
Caught a knockout wit' this TKO
Said my neck so reckless that it need to be froze (ah)
Keepin' it private, like the minor things, I'm keeping your soul
No drivin' dirty on this uss, a nigga need to be told (uh-huh)
Don't be mad at me I just keep it gangsta (gangsta)
Strategize my moves, it make me feel safer (safer)
I gotta reroute it, when you crashin' out for gator (crashin' out for gang)
Smack anybody, you gon' always do me that favor (uh)

He ain't goin' nowhere
Promise he loves it here
My baby ain't goin' nowhere, I swear (goin' nowhere, goin' nowhere)
Promise he loves it here (loves it here)
Still here (love it here)
Love it here

He love it, love it
Love it, he love it when he near
He love it when
Said he love it, love it, love it when you
So now you know, so now you know
You know, he love it when he here
