		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel like time is slipping away
And all those games people play don't mean anything
When you look down at the light on your phone
In your room, all alone, would you answer it?

Are you all loved out? What if I stepped in?
Would it turn your doubt to faith again
Did the city lights start to lose their glow?
I know a place where we could go
If you wanna drive, I can take you out
If you wanna get high, I can hang around
Or could it be that you're just like me
When the sun goes down?

Are you all loved out?
Are you all loved out?

When I look out at the stars coming out
And I reach for someone, it's just empty space
Do you ever get so sick of yourself
Take it from someone else, honey, it's okay

If you're all loved out, what if I stepped in?
Would it turn your doubt to faith again
Did the city lights start to lose their glow?
I know a place where we could go
If you wanna drive, I can take you out
If you wanna get high, I can hang around
Or could it be that you're just like me
When the sun goes down?

Are you all loved out?
Are you all loved out?

Are you in over your head
Walking on thin air
Out in the unknown
If you show me where
I can meet you there
Out on that tight rope

Are you all loved out, what if I stepped in?
Would it turn your doubt to faith again
Did the city lights start to lose their glow?
I know a place where we can go
If you wanna drive, I can take you out
If you wanna get high, I can hang around
Or could it be that you're just like me
When the sun goes down?

Are you all loved out?
Are you all loved out?
