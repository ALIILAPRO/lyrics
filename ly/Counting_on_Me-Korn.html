		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why can't you ever back down?
Why can't you just shut your face?
Oh God, the feelings I feel
Would get me thrown in a cage

You're the one who's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your life so care free
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away
I can't see
Lead the way
Make them pay

Counting on me
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
In turn, you're never there for me

You suck the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
But always stay when I should leave

You see the pain in my face
While you keep putting me down
Inside the rage starts to build
You push me, I won't go down

You're the one who's always screaming at me
I'm the one that keeps your life so care free
What the fuck more do you want me to be?
Why must you do this to me?

Run away
I can't see
Lead the way
Make them pay

Counting on me
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
In turn, you're never there for me

You suck the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
But always stay when I should leave

Could this really be the day, today?
Could this really make the problems go away?
I'm gonna have to doubt this time

Right now
I've taken all I can now
Right now
You've torn us all apart
Right now
There is nothing you can do to stop me

Right (now)
Right (now)
Right (now)
Right (now)
Right (now)
Right (now)
Right (now)
Right (now)
Right

Counting on me
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
In turn, you're never there for me

You suck the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
But always stay when I should leave

Counting on me
Always hoping I'll be
There for all of your problems
In turn, you're never there for me

You suck the life out of me
You hate everything you see
I can't take this anymore
But always stay when I should leave
