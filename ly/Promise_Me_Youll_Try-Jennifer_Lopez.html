		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I'll take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try

Though I'm sure of what I feel
Never though a love so true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby time will tell the tale

Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try

Don't promise me forever
Don't you promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try
Just hold me now
And promise me you'll try
