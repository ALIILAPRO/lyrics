		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Words can't describe the way
That I feel for you
Words can't describe the dreams
That you've made come true
The wonderful things
That we planned together have all come true
Because we planned together
Through all kinds of weather
I know that this love of ours
Will forever be
For words can't describe the way
That you're thrilling me
I promise you that I will be
Forever yours etеrnally
For words can't describe how much
You mean to mе the wonderful things
That we planned together have all come true
Because we planned together
Through all kinds of weather
I know that this love of ours
Will forever be
For words can't describe the way
That you're thrilling me
I promise you that I will be
Forever yours eternally
For words can't describe how much
You mean to me
Words can't describe how much
You mean to me
