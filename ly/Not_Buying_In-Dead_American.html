		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are so many things I would love to say, but they're all bad words
I'm always a little too late, a little too much for my own sake, but I have no cares left to say
There's nothing worth paying attention to, it's all clickbait
Go grab your play and get the fuck out of my lane, 
I'm not buying in when all you have to give seems more like take in the end
I'm not buying in when all you have to give just seems fake in the end
I won't follow your leader
I won't follow him, I'm no follower 
I'm not buying in
I'm not buying your shit
I'm sick of it, I'm just so sick of it
I'm so sick of this, I'm sick of your shit
Feels like I'm falling through loop holes, twisting my tongue and there's no real need to navigate
Nothing here remains the same in any type of way
Are you listening?
I'm not buying in when all you have to give seems more like take in the end
I'm not buying in when all you have to give  just seems fake in the end
I won't follow your leader
I won't follow him, I'm no follower
I'm not buying in
I'm not buying your shit
I'm sick of it, I'm just so sick of it
I'm so sick of this, I'm sick of your shit
