		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Fade away like frozen photographs
Remember, forget
The stakes, the ways you take
The ways you make the moment pass
For every regret,
I tell a beautiful lie
And I would die if you find out.
I tell a beautiful lie every time that I did not open up my mouth
All the same, it?s a game
It's a play, it?s a war
It's a shame that we're always fighting for
I don?t mean to cost no blame,
I don?t intend to prentend that I could never loved you more

But in the blink of an eye,
Everything you ever knew can change
And it's a beautiful lie if you think
Everything will always stay the same

Babe. My babe.
You got a secret
It's starting to show.

My babe.
Sweet babe.
How long can you keep it?
How far would you go?
You tell a beautiful lie.

You tell a beautiful lie.
And it's going to, it's going to drive you crazy.

How far would you go go go
You tell a beautiful
Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Fade away like frozen photographs.
Remember, forget
Forever

Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Fade away like frozen photographs.
Remember, forget

You tell a beautiful lie
