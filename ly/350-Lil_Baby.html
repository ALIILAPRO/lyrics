		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That shit a act, if I went flat today, I wouldn't even see your face
Brodie told me he'll take thirty-five, he just want a date
That'll piss me off, we takin' that shit every which way
Used to look up to my cousin, how you strung out and you raised?
One of the smartest people I know, I can't believe nigga went crazy
I'ma keep this shit a buck for me, nobody gotta praise me
Why you ask to borrow petty money without no intention to pay me?
I been really on some whole other shit as of lately
I know one day it's gon' hit me, bro ain't never comin' back
Ain't never say nothin' 'bout it, nigga, you know you a rat
If I was fucked up, I would've been a pimp, I'm rich, so I be payin' 'em
Two bad bitches at the same time
I can't trust none of these hoes, they tell us all the same lies
Try to let you park, somebody came and took the last spot
Bulletproof the Supercharger, I still can't stop at red lights
I done got too deep off in this shit, now I can't back out
Need the whole hundred, you can't never give me half off
She done went back and got some hips, plus, her ass soft
She be tryna play it like she innocent, I drag her
Hard to sleep with twenty-five million in the stash spot
Bro, I'm out here tryna have somethin' and hold it down for the have-nots
I'm standin' out here, schemin', goin' against the grain
Makin' it harder, shit be easy
If I ain't see it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it
Lost a couple day ones, ain't found the time to grieve yet
Lost what I thought I couldn't live without, but I'm still breathin'

Bubba Watson on my wrist, three-fifty
Bad bitch, she know I'm that, she can't diss me, never
Bubba Watson on my wrist, hit it down some
Brodie on a trial for his life, I hold it down for him, yeah
'Nother watch on my wrist, three-fifty
Heard that these niggas can't diss me, never

'69 Challenger, I turn it to a demon
This shit ever go South, just tell 'em that you ain't seen me
I make sure you get a bond, Eastside ask lawyers like genies
Made a million every day out the streets, I really seen it
When I go to sleep, nightmares, barely have a good dream
I was hurt when it was crunch time, glad I had a good team
I had ran me up a hundred thousand, that was '16
I made six figures sittin' in prison, fuck you mean?
That shit fucked up and you free
Every bitch I ever had was fucked up over me
Realest nigga ever, I hope one day she can see it
Never cry about this shit, it is what it is
Lost a dozen handful of the people, I gotta live, yeah
Used to wanna run up a dime, that's in the crib now
All the shit I put on, you ain't pick up, well, that's your fault
My advice to you, get out my way, I'm 'bout to go off
Men 'posed to be with me, we slip and knocked lil' bro off
Coup de Main seen eye to eye, that shit really hurt my heart
Slapped the phone, I'm talkin' to nobody on the yacht
Most of my niggas got life without, I'm playin' it smart (I'm playin' it super smart)
I done got the ball, they handin' hard, I gotta dodge them all
I done made my money and got out, this shit for y'all
I could never think of sellin' out, nigga, I'm all, nigga
Even in the sun, I can't unthaw, I'm just that raw, nigga
Fuckin' done with y'all niggas

Bubba Watson on my wrist, three-fifty
Bad bitch, she know I'm that, she can't diss me, never
Bubba Watson on my wrist, hit it down some
Brodie on a trial for his life, I hold it down for him, yeah
'Nother watch on my wrist, three-fifty
Heard that these niggas can't diss me, never
'Nother watch on my wrist, three-fifty
This time, I unlocked a whole new level
