		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You should say it right now)

Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
(You should say it right now, should say it right now)
Anybody wanna buy a heart?

'Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Woah! Westside shorty, with an Eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, Double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist, and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it
She tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said she was in love, and I still didn't budge
'Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)

I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing 
That you would come slide in me and confide in me

He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo

'Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us?

But when you're away I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time

(But you waited)

Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy trust
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?

(You should say it right now)
It's a heart for sale who's buying?
I don't care who's crying
There's trust for sale who's buying?
I don't care who's lying
