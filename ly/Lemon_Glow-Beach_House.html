		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Read my fortune too
Tell me what you see
Cross it like a T
It's all the same to me
This game I play, I do it every day
I promise I'll be fine
Bear it every time

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

See this state I'm in
Is crawling in my skin
Fevers took me back
And turned me inside out

When you turn the lights down low
Lemon color, honey glow

It's what you do
This pulls me through
To the other end
Where it begins
You see through me
Still, it's coming back
I come alive
You stay all night

Feel it coming right through you
The color of your mind

The color of your mind

The color of your mind
You feel it coming right through you
You feel it coming right through you
It's on the other side
It doesn't have to be this way
It doesn't have to be this way
The color of your mind

It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night
It's what you do
This pulls me through
I come alive
You stay all night

Candy-colored mystery
The color of your mind
