		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dangling above a vat of putrid muck
A rancid stench of foul decay never encountered before
Screaming in horror for I now remember my fate
I will be submerged in boiling flesh 
This cauldron will soon take my life

Upside down my mind is warping
Cannot break free
From the shackles
Bloodied chains cut circulation
Losing reason
Gag and vomit

Blisters are forming all over my body now
Oozing with pus as they start to explode, fervent finality
The fumes and the vapors have perforated my lungs
Writhing and twitching from maddening pain
Why must I die like this?

Insanity not far away
Mental breakdown
Scathing havoc
Pray for death to come and get me
Inner anguish
Begins

Fear
Received
Relentless
Malignancy

Near the end is what I'm sensing 
Must accept it 
Can't accept it
Last attempts to stop this nightmare
Cannot be done
I will be dead

Gone 
Berserk
While waiting
My life will boil

To struggle is useless

Plunge
Fatal
Paradise
Of the obscene

Enter the tank 
It doesn't take long
Epidermis dissolved
All that's left are my bones 
It's a matter of seconds when defleshed in flesh 
My body now part of sick mire
This chamber of liquefied humans that I have amassed is completed because I was last in line
