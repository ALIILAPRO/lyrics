		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you taste the fear in the back of my throat? So terrified
And I'm shaking like a tremor face down on a bed of nails
I swallowed a pill (pill, pill)

Welcome to your new reality
Is it everything that you thought it would be?
Slow fade eternally
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
Welcome to your new reality (new reality)

Sweat on my palms, starin' at the wall
Screamin for help, can you hear me at all?
Can't shake the feeling I've had too much
Checking my pulse, ice-cold to the touch

Watch out, watch out
There's no going back now

Welcome to your new reality
Is it everything that you thought it would be?
Slow fade eternally
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
Welcome to your new reality
New reality (three, two, one)
Go, yeah

Are we running out of time? I'm here to let you know
The world is eating itself, it's time to let it go
Let it go

Welcome to your new reality
Is it everything that you thought it would be?
Slow fade eternally
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Welcome to your new reality
Is it everything that you thought it would be?
Slow fade eternally
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
