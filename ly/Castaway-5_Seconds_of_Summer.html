		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Young love, close the chapter
There's no ever after
Fell fast, ended faster, yeah
Late night conversations
Led to complications
Now my heart is in my hands

'Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
And I just keep on asking myself

How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway, ay
Heartbreak that I can't escape
A sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway, ay

All your screaming whispers
Slip right through my fingers
But these memories linger on
Eyes closed, all I see is
Good times disappearing
And I'm trying to hold on

'Cause you walked out and left me stranded
Nothing left but picture frames
I just keep on asking myself

How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway, ay
Heartbreak that I can't escape
A sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway, ay

Oh oh oh-woah
Oh oh oh-woah
Oh oh oh-woah
Castaway

Oh oh oh-woah
Oh oh oh-woah
Oh oh oh-woah
Castaway

How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway

How'd we drift so far away
From where we left off yesterday?
I'm lonely like a castaway, ay
Heartbreak that I can't escape
A sinking ship I'll never save
I'm lonely like a castaway, ay

Oh oh oh-woah
Oh oh oh-woah
Castaway (oh oh oh-woah)
Castaway

Oh oh oh-woah
Oh oh oh-woah
Castaway (oh oh oh-woah)
Castaway
