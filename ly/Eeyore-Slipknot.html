		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet the man that made me
Greet the can that I came from
Oh the fucking sacred heart of Jesus
Blew it in the back room
Feelin' like a real goon
Slam the fuck aside, man
I'm on, you're not

I am the great big mouth
Good riddance, though I'm sad to say
I didn't get to kill you
Rhetoric, better look both ways
I gotta get an arm through
Stain
What the fuck is up? get the fuck away
Run if you want to
Innocent? You're a guilty conscience
Laugh last, break through
Stain

Prepare you fucker
I don't give a shit, bitch
I don't give a fuck, bitch
I don't understand this
You don't matter
I don't give a shit, man
I don't give a fuck, man
I don't really care, man
I'm the super sized man
