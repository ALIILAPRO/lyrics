		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where'd all the time go?
It's starting to fly
See how the hands go
Waving goodbye
And you know I get so forgetful
When I look in your eyes

Now she's walking backwards (now she's walking backwards)
Through a parade (parade)
And I'm stuck in the shadow (I'm stuck in the shadow)
Blocking the shade (shade)
And there ain't no way to sweep up
The mess that we've made

She gets dressed up like a pillow 
So she's always in bed
Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the fog rises
Somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore

There's nothing to keep you (nothing to keep you)
From falling in love
It starts at the bottom (it starts at the bottom)
And comes from above
Like pieces of a puzzle
Like a hand in a glove

She gets dressed up like a pillow 
So she's always in bed
Flowers for the sick and dead
She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow
She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes
And when the tide rises
Somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye

Somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye
