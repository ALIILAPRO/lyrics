		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, haha
Yeah, we bringin' the streets back
Yeah, you know this shit hot right now, man
Snitchin' at an all-time high
Yeah

Dope boy, street nigga
Cut your plug off, come eat with us
Dope boy, street nigga
Cut your plug off, come eat with us
Jugg with the gang, come eat with the gang
You'll get your head bust for a watch and a chain
Everybody equal, we don't give out stain
Kept it real with my niggas, never switch lanes

Come get some free bands, cut off your boss
I'm rich as fuck, nigga, I could take a loss
I hear it in your raps, but I invented the triple cross
Put five strains together and call it criss-cross
Come eat with the gang, come eat with the gang
Half these rappers walkin' 'round with fake chains
I rock Eliantte diamonds, we are not the same
Don't leave the house without a stick, the streets is not a game

Dope boy, street nigga
Cut your plug off, come eat with us
Dope boy, street nigga
Cut your plug off, come eat with us
Jugg with the gang, come eat with the gang
You'll get your head bust for a watch and a chain
Everybody equal, we don't give out stain
Kept it real with my niggas, never switch lanes

Yeah, they say Geeski brought the streets back, he Jeezy '03 (Jeezy)
But his dope don't go one to three, he ain't nothin' like me (nothin' like Jeezy)
It wasn't my lane, but I still bought it 'cause the price was cheap ('cause the price)
Breakin' off shards, my ice is sweet, junkie up for a week (go)
I'm qualified, I bust my yeek and don't talk with police
I'm on TV, showin' my jewelry off, droppin' a V
They on computers, I'm a shooter in real life, not on beats (gang, gang)
You ever served your daddy, uncle, or cousin a P?
You ever stood over a nigga and did it for free? (Brr)
Without no mask 'cause it was personal, want him to see (see this shit)
We laid in front his house so long, I start fallin' asleep
Fuck my bitch raw 'cause I could not with no mask, hit the sink

Dope boy, street nigga
Cut your plug off, come eat with us
Dope boy, street nigga
Cut your plug off, come eat with us
Jugg with the gang, come eat with the gang
You'll get your head bust for a watch and a chain
Everybody equal, we don't give out stain
Kept it real with my niggas, never switch lanes
