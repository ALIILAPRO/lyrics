ODUMODUBLVCK
Native
(Jimoh sounds killed it)
All I know
All I know
All I know

All I know is that when I dey cock, I hit and go
All I know is that when I been shoot, I hit their own
All I know is that when I dey cock, I hit and go
All they know is that when I been shoot, I hit their own

So, why they wanna cause more?
Put him in a Crosstour
Kolobi their own blood
Did it on their own turf
So, why they wanna bring blood?
Down to my front door
I don't wanna drink more
Blood on the dance floor

Supposing I fall in with my kala like this and that
I'm dressed in black
Opportunity no be wetin I go dey look them pass
So, I light my bass
Light that man with my pompi
Tear garanut on the monkey
Shake her nyash for my money
Odumodu fala-follow, decipher konji

I go fill my glass cup
Higher catch fun
While I dey function
My ops on a lost cause

All I know is that when I dey cock, I hit and go
I dey shoot and go
All I know is that when I been shoot, I hit their own
When dem point and kill
All I know is that when I dey cock, I hit and go
(Who dey check my own?)
All they know is that when I been shoot, I hit their own
(I dey run my race)

So, why they wanna cause more?
Put him in a Crosstour
Kolobi their own blood
Did it on their own turf
So, why they wanna bring blood?
Down to my front door
I don't wanna drink more
Blood on the dance floor

I dey always expect these things
Normally, normally, normally
You dey try us, you dey try me
Normally, normally
We came here to party nana
But you came here to find me
You came here to find me
The thing wey dey my mind

I go fill my glass cup
Higher catch fall
While I dey function
My ops on a lost cause

Run for your life, they gon' come for your life
And my one true advice, bring a gun to fight
Let it go, Let it go
Kiss the kids and the wife
Over here, shit get real
Like for real, could be bad when they roll
I ain't bout to go out like a motherfucker hoe
You bring it to my door, I'ma send you to the goat
The thing about war, you will never know closure
The windows close, they be in the back door
And I don't trust nothing but this God giving flow
Dobale to Folarin when you pass Ondo
They crash out for me cause I ride for my folks
Take a chance if you want, we gon' dance if you go

All I know is that when I dey cock, I hit and go
All I know is that when I been shoot, I hit their own
All I know is that when I dey cock, I hit and go
All they know is that when I been shoot, I hit their own

So, why they wanna cause more?
Put him in a Crosstour
Kolobi their own blood
Did it on their own turf
So, why they wanna bring blood?
Down to my front door
I don't wanna drink more
Blood on the dance floor

Supposing I fall in with my kala like this and that
I'm dressed in black
Opportunity no be wetin I go dey look them pass
So I light my bass
Light that man with my pompi
Tear garanut on the monkey
Check her nyansh
Nyash
Blood on the dance oh
Blood on the dance floor
Blood on the dance
