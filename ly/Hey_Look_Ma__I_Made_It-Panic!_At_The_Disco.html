		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life, been hustling
And tonight is my appraisal
'Cause I'm a hooker sellin' songs
And my pimp's a record label
This world is full off demons
Stocks and bonds and bible traders
So I do the deed, get up and leave
A climber and a sadist, yeah

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look ma, I made it

Friends are happy for me
Or they're honey-suckle phonies
Then they celebrate my medals
Or they wanna take my trophies
Some are loyal soldiers
While these other thorns are rosy
And if you never know who you can trust
Then trust me you'll be lonely, oh

Are you ready for the sequel?
Ain't you ready for the latest?
In the garden of evil
I'm gonna be the greatest
In a golden cathedral
I'll be praying for the faithless
And if you lose, boo-hoo

Hey look ma, I made it
Hey look ma, I made it
Everything's comin' up aces, aces
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me
I said hey look ma, I made it, I made it

I said hey look ma, I made it, I made it
I see it, I want it, I take it, take it
If it's a dream, don't wake me, don't wake me

I said hey look ma, I made it
(Mama best believe it, Mama best believe it) (Hey look ma, I made it)
(Think I must be dreamin', wide awake and dreamin') (Hey look ma, I made it)
(Mama best believe it, Mama best believe it) (Hey look ma, I made it)
(Think I must be dreamin')
Hey look ma, I made it
