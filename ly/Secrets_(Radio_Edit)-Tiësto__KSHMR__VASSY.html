		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
Show me darkness, baby, show me deepness
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
Show me darkness, baby, show me deepness

Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret

Stay a while, stay a while
And I will make it worth your while, worth your while
Stay awhile, stay awhile
And I'ma go the extra mile, extra mile
Boy, if you wait until the lights go down
I got some tricks that help you scream it out
So stay a while, stay a while
And I'ma make it worth your while, worth your while
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)

Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'll take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
