		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hand, skin
The memory lies
Safe at the helm of reunion
Play the part, similar blood
Where are you going, you rainstorm?

Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?

Seems your heart is criminal-like
Sitting on the fences of real life
Haunted by your love affair
Staring down the eyes of our nature

Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?
Are you used to it
Pouring out your life?

Are you used to it?
Are you used to it?
Are you used to it?
Are you used to it?
