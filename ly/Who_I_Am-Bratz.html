		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell you about a City Girl 
She's surprising 
You never get the better 
So totally amazing 

Don't worry about nothing 
She just gotta be free, yeah 
So don't you, won't you 
Try to mess with me 

They can't tame us 
So they blame us 
For everything 

I say hey 
People don't know who I am 
All they can say 
She's a bad girl 

But they just don't understand 
No they don't know who I am 

Burst my bubble 
Just try, why don't you 
It doesn't matter anyway 
I'm putting on a great show 

Moving on up 
And it feels so right 
Speeding in the fast lane 
That is my vibe 

They can't tame us 
So they blame us 
For everything 

I say hey 
People don't know who I am 
All they can say 
She's a bad girl 
But they just don't understand 
No they don't know who I am 

I hear 'em knocking at my door 
I turn the stereo up some more 
What can you do 
When they blame it all on you?

I say hey 
People don't know who I am 
All they can say 
She's a bad girl 
But they just don't understand 
No they don't know who I am
