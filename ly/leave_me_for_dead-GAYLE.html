		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the look that's in your eyes
I wanna scream, I wanna die
Your bad intentions held my attention
You didn't care enough to try
But you still cared enough to lie
Our days were numbered
Burned through a summer

And if you're not gonna love me
Oh, the least that you could do is kill me

Take a knife and put it through my chest
Won't feel a thing, there's nothing left
Go live your life, fuck your goodbyes
If you're gonna leave, leave me for dead
I'm gonna haunt you in your head
The things we did, the last words I said
Go live your life, fuck your goodbyes
If you're gonna leave, leave me for dead

Just cut me off, throw me away
I'll let you get on with your day
Just keep on walking, I'll be here running, baby
Call me a bitch, say that I'm dumb
Tell me that you were never in love
Tell me I suck, you wish I did
How you ever gettin' over this?
You put on a good show, call it a new low
Now that I know everything I needed to know

You're not gonna love me
I don't want nobody else to love me
So the least that you could do is kill me

Take a knife and put it through my chest
Won't feel a thing, there's nothing left
Go live your life, fuck your goodbyes
If you're gonna leave, leave me for dead
I'm gonna haunt you in your head
The things we did, the last words I said
Go live your life, fuck your goodbyes
If you're gonna leave, leave me for dead

(La-la-la) Well, I don't think it's gonna be worth it
(La-la-la) You're gonna have to live with a life sentence
You got no dear friends, so it's the best you ever had

Take a knife and put it through my chest
Won't feel a thing, there's nothing left
Go live your life, fuck your goodbyes
If you're gonna leave, leave me for dead
