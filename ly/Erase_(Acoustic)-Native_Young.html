		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been taking it easy
I've been running from the past
Hoping the pain won't last
I've been forging my way ahead
But its this symmetry
The volumes of you and me
Or your legacy
It's killing me
A lion in the dark
Slowly begins
To stuck
The science of fear
Let's go to the stars

Erase
Erase
Love is a tree with autumn leaf's
She needs to bleed
Before she breathes
Heart is cold
So must more (oh, oh)
That's the way it has to be
The lions copying symmetry
This is my allergy

Udlala ngami sthandwa sami, Yeah
Udlala ngami sthandwa sami, yoh
Udlala ngami sthandwa sami, yeah
Udlala ngami sthandwa sami,yoh

A lion in the dark
Slowly begins
To stuck
The science of fear
Let's go back to the stars

Erase
Erase
Let's go back to the stars
Unchain my heart
Come on and set me free
I'm so tired of falling to your feet
Hold me back in your arms
Forget about all the scars
I'm done with the past
Take me back to yesterday

Erase
Erase
Erase
