		  Move it

He like that, move it, move it
Watch how I move it, move it
Love when I move it, move it
Real bad gyal never lose it, move it

Pretty face, slim waist with a attitude (damn)
Nuh-uh, my belly fat, bitch
Pull up in a big Benz, Atlas
Niggas can't match this
And I'm on smoke like a match stick (move it)
Pink pretty pussy in the sea like Patrick
Big belly Shelly pon telly, she want gastric
Pop, make you do the macarena, send the 'Matic
Pop, pop, now you on the floor with your mattress
Pop, pop, pop, popcorn, that's a hat trick
Birdman flyin', brrat, hit him with the ad-lib
Baby plain, catch a Barbie plane, I'm a bad bitch
Piff bud, dummer wrist whippin' up the magic

Ass fat, yeah, you like when I move it
So I put it in his lap, make him lose it
Got a bitch in the way, but I move it
I'ma move it, I'ma move it

He like that, move it, move it
Watch how I move it, move it
Love when I move it, move it
Real bad gyal never lose it, move it
I like to move it, move it (uh, uh)
I like to move it, move it (yeah, yeah)
I like to move it, move it (uh-huh, uh-huh)
You like to move it

I be workin' on my abs, baby
Lookin' like a million, bitch, I bring the heat
Phenomenon, five minus four, one, yes, I'm the Don
Brilliant take, nobody checking me, look (move it)
I pulled up in that Bentley Jeep
Alien, lookin' like a different entity
Man, shook cah they know they can't flex on me
Orange interior with the leather seats, I got it
These hoes demonic, deep throat, you want it
He wanna play with the kitty cat like Atomic
Come at it, must hit it, my titties is so exotic
Miss Piggy pretty, no biggie, she be bouncin' on it (move it)
Classy, ratchet, bad, rude
Fuck with me, you can't lose
She a top killer, got the block with her
I make you twist up your neck when I leave you nuh, come on

Ass fat, yeah, you like when I move it
So I put it in his lap, make him lose it
Got a bitch in the way, but I move it
I'ma move it, I'ma move it

He like that, move it, move it
Watch how I move it, move it
Love when I move it, move it
Real bad gyal never lose it, move it
I like to move it, move it (uh, uh)
I like to move it, move it (yeah, yeah)
I like to move it, move it (uh-huh, uh-huh)
You like to move it
I like to move it, move it (move)
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it (real bad gyal never lose it, move it)
