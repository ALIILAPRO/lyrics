		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This means nothing to me
'Cause you are nothing to me
And it means nothing to me
That you blew this away

'Cause you could've been number one
If you only found the time
And you could've ruled the whole world
If you had the chance

You could've been number one
And you could've ruled the whole world
And we could've had so much fun
But you blew it away

You're still nothing to me
And this is nothing to me
And you don't know what you've done
But I'll give you a clue

You could've been number one
If you only had the chance
And you could've ruled the whole world
If you had the time

You could've been number one
And you could've ruled the whole world
And we could've had so much fun
But you blew it away

You could've been number one
And you could've ruled the whole world
And we could've had so much fun
But you blew it away
