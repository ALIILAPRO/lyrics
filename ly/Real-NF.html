		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, real music
(Yeah)
Yo, ya just get in that, you get in that head space, ya know

Somebody get the body bags, working with beats and
Put the MC's in 'em, season 'em, put 'em on a beat with me, then I'm eating 'em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain't hungry enough, you rappers ain't hungry like ah
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leaving, why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'mma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind blowin', ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't never been on my level, I gotta part 'em out the way
To keep 'em talking and acting like everybody 
Gonna get up in a sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
I look around and my fanbase and they ready
That last album was heavy, that last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best
You're better off playing Russian roulette
Then comin' in a booth with me cause I get
A little bit intense, I'm like, "Who's next?"
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It's my time, this ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn't ready
Them rappers, they coming up on me, I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, "bye-bye"
What? Were you lookin' for a high-five? Nice try
Do not believe everything that you read on the Internet
I do not know who your dentist is, but he should clean out your mouth
Don't call me a sellout, that's something I've never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know where heaven is
Father forgive me, for I am a sinner
But you gave me music as medicine
And nobody want a problem when they get in my zone better leave me be
I'm a mean MC, better feed me rappers or feed me beats, ah, feed me both of 'em
They like "Nate, what's it like to be famous?"
Um, I'll let you know if I make it
I wonder what life will be like if I didn't stick out my neck
200 dollars inside of my bank account, woo, I was living on that
I need some money to pay for my rent, I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complaining, I'm just being honest, I promise that I will not beg for respect, no
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I created
Time is wasting and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job
Me, I don't have no patients
I keep pacing back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 
'Cause you acting like you read my pages
I wreck these stages, real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it, but you don't know anything about me
You know I'll leave 'em changing
'Cause you know I'm real with it, don't care if you feeling it
I'm feeling it, you don't like it then deal with it, and if God ain't real, real isn't
You still wonder why I existed, I exist in the world that's real different
And what you gon' be when you grow up Nate? I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off limits I'm off in a
World that you don't get cause you ain't ever been in it
In 10 minutes, I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protecting 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life then don't get so sensitive
When I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is? I stand out cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest and every time I look into the mirror
Don't forget about where I started

Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing?
Tell me what am I, what am I doing?
Mmm
Tell me what am I doing?
I say what am I doing?
Tell me what am I doing here?
If I'm not being real, mmm
