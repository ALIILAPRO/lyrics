		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monday morning, putting on a tux
Gray clouds, baby life, it sucks
Mama says I'm talking too much
Don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck

'Cause me and you baby, we've been through so much
Me and you baby, we've been through so much
Look at our bruises, look at our cuts
I don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck anymore

Anymore, anymore, anymore

People telling me I'm not enough
People saying my music sucks
It used to hurt me so much
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck

People telling me I'm not enough
People saying my music sucks
It used to hurt me so much
I don't give a fuck, don't give a fuck anymore

Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
Anymore, anymore, any-
