		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in your arms tonight
I fell hard in your arms tonight, it was nice
I died in your arms tonight
I slipped through into the afterlife, it was nice
White light in your arms tonight
I lost sight in your arms tonight, it was nice

And hey, you, don't you think it's kinda cute
That I (I) died (died) right inside your arms tonight?
That I'm fine even after I have died?
Because it was in your arms I died

I cry in the afterlife
I cry hard because I have died, and you're alive
I try to escape afterlife
I try hard to get back inside your arms alive

And hey (hey), you (you), don't you think it's kinda cute
That I (I) try (try) to escape the afterlife?
That I (I) try (try) to get back in your arms alive?
That I died in your arms

That I fell hard in your arms
I went and died in your arms that night

I fell in your arms tonight
Suicide in your arms

And hey, you, don't you think it's kinda cute
That I (I) died (died) right inside your arms tonight?
That I'm fine even after I have died?
That I (I) try (try) to escape the afterlife?
That I (I) try (try) to get back in your arms alive?
That I died in your arms that night

I fell in your arms tonight
I died in your arms tonight
I lie in your arms tonight
I fell in your arms tonight
