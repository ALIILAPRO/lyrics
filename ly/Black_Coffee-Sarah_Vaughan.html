		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling mighty lonesome
Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee

Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday
In this weekday room

I'm talking to the shadows
One o'clock to four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee

Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hanging out on Monday
My Sunday dream's too dry

Now, a man is born to go a-loving
A woman's born to weep and fret
And stay at home and tend her oven
And drown her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moody all the morning
Mourning all the night
And in between, it's nicotine
And not much hard to fight
Coffee

Feeling low as the ground
It's driving me crazy
This waiting for my baby
To maybe come around

Mmh, mmh, mmh
