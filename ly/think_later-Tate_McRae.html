		  Live now, think later, I do it so well
Live now, think later, I do it so well
Fall hard, heart breaker, I want him, oh well
Live now, think later, I do it so well

Met you at a night out in Boston
Put your hand on my thigh in the Commons
Been drinking something blue, turn my phone off
'Cause if it's not you, I don't wanna talk
Don't know if it's been a minute or an hour
Kinda cute when you're bribing the bouncer
My friends got scared, and they called the cops
But I'm just at the Ritz with the door locked

Live now, think later, I do it so well
Live now, think later, I do it so well
Fall hard, heart breaker, I want him, oh well
Live now, think later, I do it so well

Dance with your hand in my back pocket
I picture your face in my neck locket
Just give me your beating heart, I'll stop it, boy
Don't lie, I know you want it, yeah
Gotta make a quick stop at the ATM
I know you won't make me pay, but I'll just pretend
Laughing in the backseat of the black car
It's not a good night if you don't take it too far

Live now, think later, I do it so well
Live now, think later, I do it so well
Fall hard, heart breaker, I want him, oh well
Live now, think later, I do it so well

Live now, think later, I do it so well
Live now, think later, I do it so well
Fall hard, heart breaker, I want him, oh well
Live now, think later, I do it so well

Don't worry 'bout, don't think about
I ain't stressing 'bout not a fucking thing
Don't worry 'bout, don't think about
I ain't stressing 'bout not a fucking thing

Live now, think later, I do it so well
Live now, think later, I do it so well
Fall hard, heart breaker, I want him, oh well
Live now, think later, I do it so well
