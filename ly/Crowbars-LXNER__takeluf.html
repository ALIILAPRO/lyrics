		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay so far so good yeah

Missed calls wtf you wanna talk about
You know I am alone I'm gonna put my gun (In your throat)
Crowbars baby we gon pull up to your house
Stop crying baby, can you fucking shut your mouth?
Missed calls wtf you wanna talk about
You know I am alone I'm gonna put my gun (In your throat)
Crowbars baby we gon pull up to your house
Stop crying baby, can you fucking shut your mouth?
Missed calls wtf you wanna talk about
You know I am alone I'm gonna put my gun (In your throat)
Crowbars baby we gon pull up to your house
Stop crying baby, can you fucking shut your mouth?
Missed calls wtf you wanna talk about
You know I am alone I'm gonna put my gun (In your throat)
Crowbars baby we gon pull up to your house
Stop crying baby, can you fucking shut your mouth?

I know exactly its over
Was looking nights for the closure
Tears through the night
And it's over, its over, it's over

Give me rifle, tell me what you die for
Bad like Michael pray for me I'm idol
Imma tough guy this is my title
Demons in my head thoughts are suicidal

Shut up and take my gun to your mouth
I just wanna see your body on me cause you a fuckin thot
Uno dos tres quatro if you mothefucker talk
I don't trust you if you wanna use me little fuckin dumb

I see you hope I like it, don't cry like a bitch
Just stop it, I don't respond to your crushes
You wanna fuck with me for fuckin clout shit
I see you hope I like it
Don't cry like a bitch. Just not bad
I don't respond to your crushes
You wanna fuck with me for fuckin clout shit

Missed calls wtf you wanna talk about
You know I am alone I'm gonna put my gun
Crowbars baby we gon pull up to your house
Stop crying baby, can you fucking shut your mouth?
Missed calls wtf you wanna talk about
You know I am alone I'm gonna put my gun
Crowbars baby we gon pull up to your house
Stop crying baby, can you fucking shut your mouth?
