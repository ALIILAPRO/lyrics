		<p>
		  I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk about it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it

You may talk slick
Tryna hit, but I'm not dumb

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

I bet you want the goodies
Bet you thought about it
Got you all hot and bothered
Mad 'cause I talk around it

If you're looking for the goodies
Keep on looking, 'cause they stay in the jar
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
