		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh, uh, uh
Uh-huh, uh, ayy

Twenty-four-seven, I'm a real one
I ain't got no money problems, I ain't got no children
Dodgin' baby mama drama, oop, that's a close one
Ass like a horse, but a face like she wholesome
Uh (uh), Wholefoods shoppin'
And she work out every day, you know them nudes poppin'
Stomach on apple cider vinegar, she do somethin' to me
Good sex, got you thinkin' me and you somethin', thought it was
Ayy, thought it was, thought it was
Four-fives, two tens, that's a dub, that's a dub
Say she just graduated, I'm in love, I'm in love
Say she like to do the lounge, she don't fuck with the clubs
My type, my type, yeah, yeah, my type
Like Biggie, if the head right, I'm there all night
Like Yeezy, when I see it, I'ma hit it on sight
Like Kendrick Lamar, we gon' be al'

When I used to shoot my shot, you were Matrix
Now you reappear, but I hate tricks, look
Nobody likes a fake ho
Bitch, love who I am, not my bankroll
But I'm up, so that is not realistic
Shoot my shot, then I check the ballistics
Shoot my shot, then I'm on to the next one
Shoot my shot, no stress when I'm sextin', uh

Shoot my shot, Steph Curry, it's a swish (swish)
Gucci or Dior, you come explore the way I live (explore)
Bentayga for baddies, put the Chrome Heart on your drip (Chrome)
Add up, mathematics, it's like magic, way it flip (magic)
Make her the tone (who's grown?), brown skin
Just like the Patek on my arm (brown)
Bounce it, you get allowance, icy charm (bounce)
Fountain, I make it rain, a thunderstorm (splash)
Private flash and private nights, nobody knowin' (shh)
Told her she was fuckin' with the one, they was snorin' (snorin')
Sleepin' on me, woke 'em up, alarm (wake up)
Niggas hatin', I don't even know like, "how you doin'?" (hi)
'Fore I got this rich, I wasn't shit, my life was ruined (hey)
Drivin' in my coupe today, my window tinted, eat the plate (woo, woo)
Eat the plate like Anna Mae, do it and she take the bait
Million dollar nigga, put one million in a coded safe
I dress in the coldest way, bando, I just stole your bae

When I used to shoot my shot, you were Matrix
Now you reappear, but I hate tricks, look
Nobody likes a fake ho
Bitch, love who I am, not my bankroll
But I'm up, so that is not realistic
Shoot my shot, then I check the ballistics
Shoot my shot, then I'm on to the next one
Shoot my shot, no stress when I'm sextin', uh

These hoes don't respect my grind (ayy, ayy)
She callin' rain checks, don't respect my time (ayy, ayy)
Callin' rain checks 'cause she know she a dime (ayy, ayy)
I make that bitch bounce, I'm Bank of America (ayy)
I got Sydney and Erica, I got Stacey and Marilyn
I got plenty of hoes, don't make me make no comparison
I should've marriaged these hoes but I'ma calm back down
Got the Maybach, ask her how she gon' act now

When I used to shoot my shot, you were Matrix
Now you reappear, but I hate tricks, look
Nobody likes a fake ho
Bitch, love who I am, not my bankroll
But I'm up, so that is not realistic
Shoot my shot, then I check the ballistics
Shoot my shot, then I'm on to the next one
Shoot my shot, no stress when I'm sextin'
