		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more time 
Just one more time 

So crazy, beat the strain 
Too lazy, shake the gray 
So, and she willed the rain 
So let me be defamed 
Your redundancy stains 
Tired of infantile claims 
Like puppets on a string 
Untangle you from me 

Time to call the doggies off 
Tired of the shadowin' 
Slide me to the side again 
Slapped in the face again 

No more time 
Just one more time 

Your redundancy stains 
Tired of infantile claims 
Like puppets on a string 
Untangle you from me 
So crazy, beat the strain 
Too lazy, shake the gray 
So, and she willed the rain 
So let me be defamed 

Time to call the doggies off 
Tired of the shadowin' 
Slide me to the side again 
Slapped in the face again 

One day my plane leaves 
Some way my head creeps 
Some day my head leads 
Some way my head creeps 

No more time 
Just one more time 

Empty room sets the scene
Pick at me slow, pain fiend
Suck me through barbed screen
Anger becomes our queen
Tongue whipping forked black
How long until you crack
Surprised and set back
Lackeys' loose talk for fact

Time to call the doggies off 
Tired of the shadowin' 
Slide me to the side again 
Slapped in the face again 
Time to call the doggies off 
Tired of the shadowin' 
Slide me to the side again 
Slapped in the face again 

One day my plane leaves 
Some way my head creeps 
Some day my head leads 
Some way my head creeps 
Creeps 

No more time 
Just one more time 

So crazy feel the hate 
Yeah, I've got years to wait 
I know it's not too late 
Lending clean hands of fate 
Rise from the dirt I'm in 
Hide in another's skin 
Stick black dress doll with pin 
Your mouth takes on my grin 

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

So crazy
So crazy
So crazy

Ah
Ah
Ah
