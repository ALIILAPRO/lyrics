		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The moon is full for you and I
The moon is full for you and I
Birds are flying high
Birds are flying high

This is the beginning of an endless love
And we know it now
This is the beginning of a brand new life
With an open heart
I will tell it to the moon
And sing it to the sky
I know that the best thing is you and I

The moon is full for you and I
The moon is full for you and I
Birds are flying high
Birds are flying high
Roses of May
The sky of June
When April sings for the summer afternoon
You took me there with songs and lullabies
You saved my soul from drowning in the night
