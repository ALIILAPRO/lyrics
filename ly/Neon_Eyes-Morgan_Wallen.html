		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They started out blue like an East Tennessee, June sky
Full of small town innocence 
Guarded by a picket fence perfect till I drove by
You were looking for a way out and I was on my way girl
Once you love a cowboy you'll never be the same
I know right now you think this is it
But I'm gonna leave you with

Neon eyes, dollar in a jukebox heartache
Drinking off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave ya with neon eyes
Dancing with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really gettin' what you came for
Lonely lips sipping on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see ya with neon eyes

Right now they're glowing like the cigarette we just sparked
Aw, but I've seen this scene before 
Like the lights on a liquor store
Pretty soon they'll go dark
I know you're tired of all the same shit
That's why you think you want this
I can show you first-hand, girl
What you wish you'd a missed
But if you won't take it from me
I guess you're gonna have to see through

Neon eyes, dollar in a jukebox heartache
Drinking off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave ya with neon eyes
Dancing with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really getting what you came for
Lonely lips sipping on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see ya with neon eyes
Neon eyes

I don't wanna be the one to say I told you so
Just let me push you away before you get too close
I can't go and make up your mind
And I don't wanna be the reason behind those

Neon eyes, dollar in a jukebox heartache
Drinking off a dive bar highway
Thick smoke soaked up in tequila
Told you I'd leave ya with neon eyes
Dancing with a ghost on the dance floor
Never really getting what you came for
Lonely lips sipping on a margarita
Girl, I'd hate to see ya with neon eyes
Neon eyes
Neon eyes
