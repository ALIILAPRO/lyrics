		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My whole life I been curled up, worried 'bout fitting in
Don't know what I am, I just know that I'm different
Spazzed out, fidgeting
Playing with the monsters
Only open up around the creatures that I conjure
Flashlights dangling underneath the stairs
If I ever went missin', they would always meet me there
They would be the ones to love me on the nights I needed care
Never brought 'em out in public 'cause I hate when people stare
I'll be fine
Just losing track of time
Just dancing in the city with these voices in my mind
They the only ones who listen when I tell 'em what I feel
No one ever understood, and they probably never will

So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Away
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
(Ghost, ghost)
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
(Ghost, ghost)

Riding through the city, I'm just buzzin' alone
Close my eyes while I drive 'cause I love the unknown
Heart beating so hard, feel it thud in my bones
Can't say I Iove her, but I wrote her dozens of poems
And I almost read 'em out loud hundreds of times
Closed mouth, what a waste of a wonderful mind
She gets scared when the rain and the thunder combine
And I'm from a gloomy place where the sun doesn't shine
It wouldn't work, so, I admire from afar
Lying on the rooftop, lining up the stars
Hiding all my scars is oh-so exhausting
I just wanna get lost now

So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Away
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
(Ghost, ghost)
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
(Ghost, ghost)

(Ghost, ghost)
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
(Ghost, ghost)

So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Away
So, I'm going now
Away, away
So, I'm going now
Watch me disappear just like a ghost
