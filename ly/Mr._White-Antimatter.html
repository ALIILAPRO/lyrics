		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm supposed to talk to you
Don't even know where to start
Don't want to stand with the setting sun
Tell me does it really show
I'll promise you anything
Place your hand over your heart
Don't want to fool myself anymore
Think nobody else will ever know

[Chorus]
Mr. White, up all night
Hiding in my room
Mr. White, so uptight
Even knows my name

Could never show you just how I feel
It's only that inside I'm so tired
So tired of being all alone
Now the hours are breathing
Gone like tears in yesterday's rain
I remember voices telling me
Secrets of mind-changing reality
