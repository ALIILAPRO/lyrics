		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frozen and stowed away
Here we'll stay
Heading to get somewhere 
we've never been
Reaching again
out into nothingness 

It feels like
I've lost my mind
There's nothing left 
It's all a mess
Lost in this paradigm
With no way out
My screams won't make a sound

Lost in the haze of my mind
Left it behind
Searching for something new that
we feel we can find
It's all been designed
If we could just get there 

Frozen, darkness my only friend
Nothingness surrounds me without an end
And I feel like I can make this home
It slowly becomes my paradise 
Paradise 

It feels like
I've lost my mind
There's nothing left 
It's all a mess
Lost in this paradigm
With no way out
Until I kill this doubt
