		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly little bird to Hiroshima
In the way a load
Speak the magic word to Hiroshima
Let the sky explode
Hiroshima, Hiroshima

There's a shadow of a man at Hiroshima
Where he passed the moon
In the wonderland at Hiroshima
Where he died too soon
And the world remembers his face
Remembers the place was here

Fly little bird to Hiroshima
In the way a load
Speak a magic word to Hiroshima
Let the sky explode
And the world remembers his name
Remembers the flame was Hiroshima
Hiroshima, Hiroshima

There's a shadow of a man at Hiroshima
Where he passed the moon
In a wonderland at Hiroshima
Where he died to soon
And the world remembers his name
Remembers the place was here
Hiroshima

And the world remembers his name
Remembers the flame was
Hiroshima, Hiroshima, Hiroshima...
