		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope I cross your mind
When you're too high and wide awake
I hope you wonder if I'm happy
If I'm still the same
And when you turn over, see her there
Hope you think of me and how you wish it
Would've ended differently

Oh, there's no hard feelings left
But it's hard not to think about
How you walked away so easily

I don't miss you
I just wish that it would've been harder
For you to get through
'Cause you meant a lot more to me
Than I did to you
And I wish you knew, I went through hell
While you found someone new
But I don't miss you

We never fell in love
But we were well on our way
And it could've been in my head
But I thought you would feel the same
When we'd stop hanging out all night
I thought you'd be a mess like me
But I don't think you cared
It didn't work out

Oh, there's no hard feelings left
But it's hard not to think about
How you walked away so easily

I don't miss you
I just wish that it would've been harder
For you to get through
'Cause you meant a lot more to me
Than I did to you
And I wish you knew, I went through hell
While you found someone new
But I don't miss you

I don't miss how you broke me
How you moved on so fast
I hope that sometimes you miss me
But I think you don't i don't miss you, oh
I don't miss you, oh, oh

I don't miss you
I just wish that it would've been harder
For you to get through
'Cause you meant a lot more to me
Than I did to you
And I wish you knew, I went through hell
While you found someone new
But I don't miss you
