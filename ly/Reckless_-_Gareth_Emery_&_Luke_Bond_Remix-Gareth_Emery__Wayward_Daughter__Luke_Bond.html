		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pulling away pulling away
Pulling the truth out of me watch it unravel
Coming apart at the seams
You've seen darkness and rain
Heartache and pain nothing but memories left
You're the only mistake that I
Know I will never forget

I held on to your heart
And I played my part
Knowing you couldn't let go
I crushed it to sand in the palm of my hand
If only you'd just get them, oh

Why did you trust me, oh
With something so precious?
Oh, why did you love me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm reckless

Why did you? Why did you?

All these things that I've done
The battles I've won
They've taken the fight out of me
A twist of the knife
Now, I'm just watching you bleed
You knew from the start this
Could tear you apart
If only you'd just let me be
You say we could be better
But I know what's better for me

Oh, why did you trust me, oh
With something so precious?
Oh, why did you love me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm reckless

Why did you?

Oh, why did you trust me, oh
With something so precious?
Oh, why did you love me?
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm reckless

Why did you?
