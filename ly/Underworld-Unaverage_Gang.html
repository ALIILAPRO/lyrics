		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Straight from the underworld, coming for the underground
Mothafuckaz better watch out for dem hell houndz
UNAVERAGE be the mothafuckin gang that you all doubt
Risen out the purgatory all you bitches done now

Straight from the underworld, coming for the underground
Mothafuckaz better watch out for dem hell houndz
UNAVERAGE be the mothafuckin gang that you all doubt
Risen out the purgatory all you bitches done now

Death is your minimal punishment
Boy you better recognize who you fuckn round with
Only fought a couple times
I never busted any crimes but that don't mean, I won't put you in the coffin
Walk-in round with a noose, or a fuckin 22, when I see your ass in person get to poppin
I can't stand a fuckin artist who can't get it on their own
Taking handouts like a bum who is jobless

Clickity clock with the Glock did you get popped?
When it's crunch time bet you all run off!
Fifty fifty chance that you rats all gon get chopped
Playing all these bitches like an avatar
Yea it's 50k for a verse or a punchline
Cause without you we doing this shit just fine
See we learned a lot of things from this shitty generation
Everything is bout an image for some fuckin recognition

Ouuu, wait
I think That I'm saying shit hitting they soft spot
Ou, aye
The reason they can't stand the truth, cuz they're all dropped
Aye
Fuck what they think cause I promise, I won't stop
Aye
The wolf that is climbing the hill is already on top

Straight from the underworld, coming for the underground
Mothafuckaz better watch out for dem hell houndz
UNAVERAGE be the mothafuckin gang that you all doubt
Risen out the purgatory all you bitches done now

Straight from the underworld, coming for the underground
Mothafuckaz better watch out for dem hell houndz
UNAVERAGE be the mothafuckin gang that you all doubt
Risen out the purgatory all you bitches done now

Everybody dissin and missin my fucken punch line
Hatin on my elements, never willing top mine
Bunch a little bitches in the back, but we front line
Put me to the test and fuck yo challenge, make it all mine

Can't believe this shit so crazy
Might as well just drive miss daisy
Why do y'all just plain start hatin?
Y'all just mad cause we in your bitch playlist

Shots went off did you hear that sound?
One went missin, the other one found
One chopped up, put the other in the ground
If you fucken with the gang, means you fucken with the hounds
Have you heard?
Shootin at my vessel won't work
I think you really fucken missheard
Death doesn't really occur
Disturbed in your conscience as you watch the fucken underworld turn

"Hey guys you sound like $B
You should really hit'em up do a feature for free"

Nah bitch this be that UAV
Fucken sick of you bitches thinkin they runnin the scene

"But guys i'm really thinkin that you should
If you ever got chance do you think you would?"

Honestly, you really must of misunderstood
We only fucken with the sound from the hounds in the woods
