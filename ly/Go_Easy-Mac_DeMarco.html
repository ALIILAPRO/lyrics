		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pack it up and leave it, leave it all behind you
Starting fresh in someone else's town
And though we may be leaving, I'll be right beside you
To pick you up until you come around

So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy

Honey, it can be tough, without your friends beside you
You built it up, just to knock it down
So when you're feeling rough, I'll be right behind you
To pick you up until you come around

So please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy

Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
Please, go easy with my baby
Please, go easy
