		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the time is made of golden seeds
Just because I understand doesn't mean that I believe
It gets lonelier than this
Standing in the corner of the decent things we missed

Oh, and the fire wasn't my idea
You were the one who changed the lock
Oh, and the fire wasn't my idea
They tell you you're forgiven, but you're not
Oh, I'll take you down to the sea

You can tell me your philosophy
Just because I understand doesn't mean that I believe
It gets lonelier than this
Standing in your mercy

Oh, and the fire wasn't my idea
You were the one who changed the locks
Oh, and the fire wasn't my idea
They tell you you're forgiven, but you're not
Oh, I'll take you down to the sea
Oh, I'll take you down to the sea

Oh (the fire wasn't-)
I'll take you down to the sea (down to the sea)
Oh, I'll take you down to the sea (down to the sea)
Oh, I'll take you down to the sea
