		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been waiting for someone to tell me that I’m wrong
To make me realise that this is just a song
Don’t wanna be a slave to all the things you said
So from now on, you’ll just be out of my head

Every time you say you think that I’m the one
Feels so nice, but surprise
I know that it s a lie
Every time you try to just come back to me
You will see, you will see
That now I can be free

I know that it’s a lie

But now I can be free

You know that words can hurt you even if you’re strong
Can’t seal the bond we’ve had, you know it’s been too long
You’ll never let me down again cauze now you re gone
You won’t be back and now my life goes on

Every time you say you think that I’m the one
Feels so nice, but surprise
I know that it s a lie
Every time you try to just come back to me
You will see, you will see
That now I can be free

I know that it’s a lie

But now I can be free

Every time you say you think that I’m the one
Feels so nice, but surprise
I know that it s a lie
Every time you try to just come back to me
You will see, you will see
That now I can be free
