		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said hi when I saw ya
Walked by when I said it
So I sat back down and my friends told me to forget it

Now your hairs on my pillow
Cheeks red with your lipstick
But I still walk by and you don't say hi, reminiscent 


You do that hair toss, arms crossed, never reply
You do that turn round, walk out too good for goodbye
And I’m wishin that you’d just stay, but you’re pullin out the driveway
I Keep walking towards you,
You keep walking away


My dad thinks it's stupid 
But I kinda like it
Cause I won't get bored and it's actually satisfying 

Tell me Is it normal
I’m surprised when you answer
You could hang up one hundred times 
But I give you a million chances


You do that hair toss, arms crossed look in your eyes
You do that turn round, walk out too good for goodbye
And I’m wishin that you’d just stay, but you’re pullin out the driveway
Keep on walking towards you,
You keep walking away


So I hope that you keep making me chase you now

Cause the way that you leave makes me love it when you come around 

You do that hair toss arms crossed
you do that turn round walk out
