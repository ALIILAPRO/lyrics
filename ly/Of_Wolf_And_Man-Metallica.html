		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Off through the new day's mist I run
Off from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lamb

Off through the new day's mist I run
Off from the new day's mist I have come
We shift pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleep

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift, back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of life

Bright is the moon, high in starlight
Chill is the air, cold as steel tonight
We shift, call of the wild
Fear in your eyes, it's later than you realized

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of life

I feel I change
Back to a better day
(Shape shift) hair stands on the back of my neck
(Shape shift) in wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf and not the man

Shape shift, nose to the wind
Shape shift, feeling I've been
Move swift, all senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning (back to the meaning) of wolf and man, yeah
