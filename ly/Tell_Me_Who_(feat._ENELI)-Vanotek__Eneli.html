		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world gets lonely find me something to believe in
Maybe I'm blind
The world's gone mad now find me something to believe in
Maybe I'm blind
See I've been waiting for so long
Waiting for so long
See I've been waiting for so long
Why does it always seem so wrong
Oh it seems so wrong
See I've been waiting for so long

Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do is gonna come back to you
Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do, what you do

This ain't the truth I wanna find or am I dreaming
Maybe I'm blind
This ain't the place I said, I always wanna live in
Maybe I'm blind

See I've been waiting for so long
Waiting for so long
See I've been waiting for so long
Why does it always seem so wrong
Oh it seems so wrong
See I've been waiting for so long

Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do is gonna come back to you
Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do, what you do

I think I might lose it
I'm so tired of using
Just different words to say the same story
But I guess I'm just lonely
What can you do for me
Will you just let me be
Have I done anything wrong

Tell me who
Just tell me who
Tell me who
Just tell me who
Just tell me who
