		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The songs you never sung
Are the ones you know
The longing never watered 
Is the one that grows

The fog you see ahead 
Is where you want to move
Before a sudden wind
Takes everything from you

The lips you haven't met 
They kiss you in your dreams 
The longing never bared
Aches to be revealed

Hear me
Follow this calling
I know you see me
Try to believe me
Hid away your longing will only grow
And you'll only grow colder

Ooh
Ooh

You lived for love alone
At first it didn't show 
That it was love itself 
You were letting go

The light that shone for once 
It colors all you see 
The longing never lost
Is the one you keep

Hear me
Follow this calling
I know you see me, fear me
But try to believe me
Hid away, your longing will only grow
And you'll only grow older

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
