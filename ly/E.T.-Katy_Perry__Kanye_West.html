		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a dirty mind,
I got filthy ways,
I'm trying to bathe my ape in your milky way
I'm a legend, I'm irreverent
I'll be reverend
I'ma be so far up
We don't give a fu
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You and I invited to the other side of sanity
They calling me an alien
A big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because your boy
Yeezy gets ass a lot

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil, could you be an angel
Your touch magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leave my body glowing

They say be afraid
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA, they dont understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial

You're so super sonic
Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial

I know a bar out in Mars,
Where they driving space ships instead of cars,
Cop a Prada space suit about the stars,
Getting stupid high, straight out the jars
Pockets on shrek, rockets on deck
Tell me what's next,
Alien sex?
I'ma disrobe you,
Then I'ma probe you
See, I abducted you,
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do
What to do
What to do

Kiss me, kiss me
Infect me with your love, and fill me with your poison
Take me, take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial
Extraterrestrial

Boy, you're an alien, your touch so foreign
It's supernatural, extraterrestrial
