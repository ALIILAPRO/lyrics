		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's another one of them ol' funky Cypress Hill things
You know what I'm sayin?
And it goes like this

Hey don't miss out on what you're passin'
You're missin' the hoota of the funky Buddha
Eluder or the fucked up styles to get wicked
So come on as Cypress starts to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaw stridin' while suckers are hidin'
Jump behind the bush when they see me (us) driving
By, hangin' out the window
With my Magnum, takin' out some puto's
Actin' kinda loco, I'm just another local
Kid from the street gettin' paid for my vocals

Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 

I'm ignoring all the dumb shit
Yo, because nothin' is comin' from it
I'm not gonna waste no time
Fuckin' around, my gat straight hummin'
Hummin', comin' at cha
And you know I had to gat ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shinin' a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that will gat ya right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, "Yo, it's on
Take cover son, or you're ass-out
How you like my chrome?", then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast out, but I did anyway
That young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is something you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To light my spliff, ignite ya with insights
And if you ain't down, bullshit
Say some punk try to get you for your auto
Would you call the one-time, play the role model?
No, I think you play like a thug
Next, hear the shot of a Magnum slug
Hummin', comin' at cha
Yeah ya know I'm gonna gat ya
How do you know where I'm at when you haven't been where I've been
Understand where I'm comin' from
When you're up on the hill, in your big home
I'm out here, riskin' my dome
Just for a bucket, or a fast Ducat
Just to stay alive, aiyyo I gotta say, "Fuck it"

Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand 
(How I could just kill a man)
Here is somethin' you can't understand

(All I wanted was a Pepsi)
