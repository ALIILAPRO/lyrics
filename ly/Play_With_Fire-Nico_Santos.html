		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooh
Ooh-ooh

It's only been about a couple of days
You must've gone and put a spell on me
I can't get you out from under my veins
Singin', "Oh my lord, she'll be the death of me"
I'm not the one to normally play the fool
So tell me brother, what's a man to do?
Half mad, half mad
Going crazy over you
Singin', "Oh my god, if you're the fire, I'm the fuel"

Well, my mama, yeah, she'd always say it's stupid to get in between a woman who knows what she wants
Well, I guess I made that mistake
I'm young and foolish or brave and she's made her way into my heart

I gotta get out
This is what you get when you fall in love
No one ever said how good it hurts
I tried once but it's once too much
You end up getting burned
I'm like the gasoline, you light the match
Ain't no one else who can burn me like that
So I cross my heart, kill my desire
This is what you get when you play with fire

Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
This is what you get when you play with fire
Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
This is what you get when you play with fire

I'm a pyromaniac, it ain't safe
'Cause you've got trouble written over your face
You say, "Lover, gotta have a little faith"
Thinking I'd have mercy but I know you ain't a saint
And daddy used to warn me 'bout your kind
I read the book maybe a thousand times
Somewhere, somehow
Missed the warning signs 'cause I'm calling up to see if you're around tonight

Well, my mama, yeah, she'd always say it's stupid to get in between a woman who knows what she wants
Well, I guess I made that mistake
I'm young and foolish or brave and she's made her way into my heart

I gotta get out
This is what you get when you fall in love
No one ever said how good it hurts
I tried once but it's once too much
You end up getting burned
I'm like the gasoline, you light the match
Ain't no one else who can burn me like that
So I cross my heart, kill my desire
This is what you get when you play with fire

Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
This is what you get when you play with fire
Oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh-uh-oh
This is what you get when you play with fire

Fire, fire, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Play with fire, fire oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I gotta get out
This is what you get when you fall in love
No one ever said how good it hurts
I tried once but it's once too much
You end up getting burned
I'm like the gasoline, you light the match
Ain't no one else who can burn me like that
So I cross my heart, kill my desire
This is what you get when you play with fire

Fire, fire, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is what you get when you play with fire
Play with fire, fire, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
This is what you get when you play with fire

Fire, fire, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Play with fire, fire, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
