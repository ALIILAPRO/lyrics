		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, okay, I see what's happening here
You're face to face with greatness, and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel
It's adorable
Well, it's nice to see that humans never change

Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes, it's really me, it's Maui
Breathe it in
I know it's a lot
The hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demi-god

What can I say except, "You're welcome"
For the tides, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy

Hey
What has two thumbs and pulled up the sky
When you were waddling yea high?
This guy
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?
You're lookin' at him, yo
Oh, also I lassoed the sun
You're welcome
To stretch your days and bring you fun
Also I harnessed the breeze
You're welcome
To fill your sails and shake your trees

So what can I say except you're welcome
For the islands I pulled from the sea
There's no need to pray, it's okay
You're welcome
Ha, I guess it's just my way of being me
You're welcome
You're welcome

Well, come to think of it
Kid, honestly I could go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was Maui just messing around
I killed an eel
I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now you got coconuts
What's the lesson?
What is the take-away?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a break-away
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been
I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini-Maui just tickety-tappin'
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha, hey)

Well, anyway let me say, "You're welcome" (you're welcome)
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome (you're welcome)
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go (hey)

Hey, it's your day to say, "You're welcome" (you're welcome)
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome (you're welcome)
'Cause Maui can do anything but float

(You're welcome)
You're welcome
(You're welcome)
You're welcome
And thank you
