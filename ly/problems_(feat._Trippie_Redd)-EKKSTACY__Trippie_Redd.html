		  Problems
Always causing problems
You don't know what I've done
There isn't much to say
I want
You don't know what I want
That just makes this harder
Whatever, anyways

I'd rather not let go
It's better to not know
The things that you so deeply wanna hear
I gave you all my soul
Won't ever let you go
My days without you are the only thing I fear

Problems
Always causing problems
You don't know what I've done
There isn't much to say
I want
You don't know what I want
That just makes this harder
Whatever, anyways

I'd rather not let go
It's better to not know
Now I'm on my own
I gave you all my soul
Won't ever let you go
Be all alone
