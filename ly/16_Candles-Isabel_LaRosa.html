		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate you for making me cry on my birthday
I only thought of you during my party
I hate you for letting me get my hopes up
If the summer was a dream
Then now I've woken up

You should know
Sixteen candles have all gone out
(Have all gone out)
No more wishes now (No more wishes now)
Now I know
Not to let my hopes run around (Run around)
They're all gone now (They're all gone now)

I guess I'm too much
I don't fit under your thumb
And you're looking for someone
Who plays your games and thinks you're tough
They're enough i guess I'm too much
And you're scared to have a crush
On a girl who's just a tough as you
Don't act like you're above it's a bluff
I guess I'm too much

I hate you for making me
Cry in the front seat
Of my brother's car halfway
Home from your party
I felt your eyes on me through the smoke haze
But you never even wished me happy birthday

You should know
Sixteen candles have all gone out
(All gone out)
No more wishes now (No more wishes now)

I guess I'm too much
I don't fit under your thumb
And you're looking for someone
Who plays your games and thinks you're tough
They're enough i guess I'm too much
And you're scared to have a crush
On a girl who's just a tough as you
Don't act like you're above it's a bluff

I guess I'm too much (too much, too much)
I guess I'm too much (too much, too much)
I guess I'm too much, too much, too much
(Ah)
