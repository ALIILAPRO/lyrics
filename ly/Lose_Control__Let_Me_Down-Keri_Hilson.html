		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I've been telling you not now
But baby come and give it to me
'Cause I can tell by the way that you move
That you're the one who could give it to me, yeah
So come on lets move through the crowd
So we can find ourselves some privacy
And when I get you all to myself
I promise it's gonna be hard to breathe
When you watch me

Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control
Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control
Put your hands on my body, I
Love the way you make my body say iyiyi
Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control
Shake, wind and roll
Shake, wind and roll

Looking like you've seen a beautiful ghost
She must have been a sight to see
As you got your mouth wide open
And you're sweating like a hundred degrees
But it's not a ghost
You're body can't handle you watching me
And one more move
I'mma make you drop to your knees when I

Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control
Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control (show me how you want it)
Put your hands on my body, I
Love the way you make my body say iyiyi
Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control

Baby, I'm loving how it feels
Looking in your eyes
Ooh it sends me chills
All down my spine
But now the song is done
You can have another one
But first you've got to pay to see me

I gotta pay?
How much?
Hundred thousand dollar, two hundred thousand
You name it
Beemer, Benz, or Bentley
Bugatti body, you claim it
And all of it depends
On the way you shaking your anus
Had to valet park it to red carpet
I'll make you famous
And if you fancy huh?
Lil mama have reindeer bambi huh
I stain my brain, Mia Lansky
I'm sixty nine, right now
Nasty ma, na-na-nasty ma
Now you can play wit it, play wit it
And you gon' get it
Have you legs split it
You say get it and I'ma get it girl
Let me see you shake it, wind it, control it
Bring it around
Take your cellphone
We say it now and it's going down

Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control
Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control (show me how you want it)
Put your hands on my body, I
Love the way you make my body say iyiyi
Shake, wind, and roll
Let's lose control

Shake, wind,
Shake, wind, and roll
Shake, wind,
Shake, wind, and roll
Shake, wind,
Shake, wind, and roll
Shake, wind,
Shake, wind, and roll

Maybe you didn't really need my loving
Not the way I needed yours
I was only tryin' to keep it open
How you gonna slam the door
Led me to believe we were together
You were on a different plan
Just when things were changing for the better
You became a different man

If I was you
I would have never left you in the cold
In the first place, oh baby

And if I was you
I'd be really trying to make it
You turned down a one way

Oh babe, said you let me down
Said you let me, let me, let me, let me, let me down
Yeah, you let me, let me down
Yeah you let me, let me, let me, let me, let me down
Said you let me, let me down
Let me down

A real man wouldn't have done it like that
No boys allowed
