		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's Havok, baby)
(I swear that's Ekayy)
(Heatmaky got the hit, though)
They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans
They run when they hear that the ting goes bang (Elevate this mix sounds mad)
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang (ay, Tweeko mixed this, you know?)
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump-jump out cars or jump out- (it sounds cold)

They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans
They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans

In the club, nuk po nalet
She fucks with the opps, nuk falet
Leni hallet, I du paret
Boot down doors edhe midis Tiranet
They want me on the wing like Mahrez
But I'm still in the field like Suárez
In the four by four mes natës
'Cah we get money regardless
Splash man up like I've lost my taste
Keep splashing, can't tell it's his face
Bossman knows my life's a movie
Who's dookie? He's moving bookie
I spin the whoopty like, "Brudda, who's he?"
Back the Uzi, they call me Rooney
Just shake that booty, she think she's boujie
She looks like Snoochie, but she moving shy
She'll be gone by the end of the night
Bust that left then bust that right
Two, four, seven in a three, six, five
Like Z said, I'm trying to take what's mine
And if there's no money then decline
You're not worth my time
Bro told me it's your time to shine
Sorry baby, I couldn't treat you right
I'm on the back road, so mind your chat, bro
Cah you can get hit like that
I'm on the main road, dressed in plain clothes
I bet you didn't notice that
Two got chinged and hit with a combo
One got shot, they ain't learn from that
Ride on us, and we ride straight back
Slide on us, and we counter-attack

They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans
They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans

Dodge them lights then dodge that chase
Can't find him, can't find where he stays
Can't feed him, I'll feed these blades
Please someone, tell me where he lays (where is he?)
Don't mind me, you gotta mind this blade
Phineas and Ferb, in the field we play
Side by side, I got bros same way
Don't switch side, my side gets paid
She wanna get fucked by a London yute, yes (yeah)
Right by the London view
Marijuana, so I'm taking two
What happened that night? Ain't left that room
She caught feelings, she thinks I did too
Sorry baby, it's not true
You can't live one day in my shoes
A million views, still step with excuse (boaw)

They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans
They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans

They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Do it on my ones or do it with gang
Jump out cars or jump out vans
They run when they hear that the ting goes bang
Sku-du-du, du-du-du, bang
Jump-jump out cars or jump out vans
