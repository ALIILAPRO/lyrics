		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know where to go
I don't think this world is made for me
Behind the clouds there is a castle in the sky
And I just want you to take me there

And then I'm free
then I'm free with you
Then I'm free 
Then I'm free with you

I don't know where to go
I don't think this world is made for me
Behind the clouds there is a castle in the sky
And I just want you to take me there

And then I'm free
then I'm free with you
Then I'm free 
Then I'm free with you

I don't think this world is made for me
Behind the clouds there is a castle in the sky
And I just want you to take me there

And then I'm free
then I'm free with you
Then I'm free 
Then I'm free with you
