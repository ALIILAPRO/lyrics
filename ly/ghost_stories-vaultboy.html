		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two in the mornin'
And I'm way too stoned, I can't drive home
It's pourin' oh God, it's pourin'
And while we're talkin'
And our bodies move in closer
Can't ignore it i can't ignore it

I see the way she's fallin'
She's fallin'
She's fallin' right into my arms (Mm hmm)
And I can tell I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
I'm fallin' right into her charm (Mm hmm)

She said, "Tell me ghost stories
Turn down the lights"
Light up a candle, she's holdin' me tight
God knows where we'll be by
The end of the night
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
While we're tellin' ghost stories
While we're tellin' ghost stories (Mm hmm)

Sit in the silence where the only sound is
Breathin' in the quiet
And I don't know where my mind is
You're the only thing I want
And I won't fight it oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh

And I can tell I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
I'm fallin' right into her charm (Mm hmm)

She said, "Tell me ghost stories
Turn down the lights"
Light up a candle, she's holdin' me tight
God knows where we'll be by
The end of the night
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
While we're tellin' ghost stories
While we're tellin' ghost stories (Mm hmm)
While we're tellin' ghost stories
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh

She said, "Tell me ghost stories
Turn down the lights"
Light up a candle, she's holdin' me tight
God knows where we'll be by
The end of the night
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
We're tellin' ghost stories
We're tellin' ghost stories
(Oh, oh oh, oh oh)
We're tellin' ghost stories
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh, oh oh
