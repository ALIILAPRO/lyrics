		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart and soul were never mine to own
What you care to die for?
What you care to die for?
We die alone, we'll all die young
What you care to die for?
What you care to die from?

Snow, snow glistens on the ledge, whiskey on the ledge
Shake it out and light a cigarette
Miss me when you, you wish you weren't right
Shake me all out if I'm wrong, for you, for you
Shake it all out when I'm gone, I, for you

Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep, while the earth turns
And his kids learned to say, "fuck you", they don't love you
Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams, while the earth burns?
She cries 'cause she's nothing like you, is she like you?

What you want from a devil like me, devil like me?
You see, the devil don't mean to be evil
He just regrettably forgets to exceed expectation

Holes riddled in your head, little bit of lead
Shake it out and line silhouette
Miss me when you, you wish weren't kind of glad
Shake me all out when you're done, for you, for you
Shake it all out when I'm gone, I, for you

Is the devil so bad if he cries in his sleep, while the earth turns
And his kids learned to say, "fuck you", they don't love you
Does the devil get scared if she dies in her dreams, while the earth burns?
She cries cause she's nothing like you, is she like you?
What do you want from a devil like me, am I like you?
