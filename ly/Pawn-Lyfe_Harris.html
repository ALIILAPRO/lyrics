		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The camera’s still flashing , camera still flashing
Im flicking these ashes, running from madness
The camera’s stop rolling , nigga’s still acting
But I cant lose focus or get distracted
Cause I got turned into a monster by one of the baddest
She was sexy and at the same time shawty’s a savage
I paid attention to all of the details you thought I wouldn’t catch it
Because I knew right away (Right away)
I just don’t wanna live with any regrets
So I just had to get things off of my chest
The way they tried to play me
You’d swear that it was chess
And they treated me like a pawn
But still I cant forget it , I swear I wont forgive em
I hope they know its war
I was way off in the shadows, I barely saw the sun
They wanted me in the dark
And i’m barely finding balance , I still don’t have closure , its touchy and still sore
But I get it, I see what’s popping
I know you had plenty options I know you had to explore em
So depending on where you laying Im sliding to where you staying
Im pulling up to your door
Use me , use me
Play me like a pawn
Memories don’t fade
Cant be undone
Use me , use me
Treat me like a pawn
Use me how you need to
Girl I’m numb
Now I gotta keep em out the way cause I got nigga’s still praying on my downfall
I put a foreign on the interstate these nigga’s prayed to god that I was crash dawg
Funny how the city full of hate and all I ever tried to do was help em blast off
And its funny how shawty is a stripper but she still ain’t ever learned to take the mask off
Not like them
Not like them
But I’m not like him
Dont try me...
