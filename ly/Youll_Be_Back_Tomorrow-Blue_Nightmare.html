Oo... kayy
Say it ain't so
I ain't like everyone else
Ahem
Yea
Gimme just a couple seconds like...
I gotta ease up a lil bit
Aight, here it goes

She don't answer when she with me
She can't come to the phone right now
That's cause her throat busy
You should leave her alone right now

And I can't feel sorry for you, cause you settled for fake roses babe
Your worth's showing babe
I don't think you understand
I'm okay with never seeing you again
But you'll be back tomorrow

One day after the next
There's no reason to stress
Cause tomorrow
You'll send another text
Ain't gon be nothing left for tomorrow
(Morrow!)
Not tonight, not tonight, not tonight, but to...
Morrow
Cause tomorrow ain't promised babe

Girl sometimes you scare me
It's like you can just read my mind
Playing games unfairly
That's until I get right behind
That nigga wishing on a star, he need a fucking genie
That nigga begging to see you, but you begging to see me
And you always act like this is where the story ends
I'm okay with never seeing you again
You'll be back tomorrow

One day after the next
There's no reason to stress
Cause tomorrow
You'll send another text
Ain't gon be nothing left for tomorrow
(Morrow!)
Not tonight, not tonight, not tonight, but to...
Morrow
Cause tomorrow ain't promised babe

I guess this finally counts for sumn
You could look around the world for love
Compared to mine, it won't be enough
Go head and dare to try your luck
I guess this finally counts for sumn (finally counts for sumn)
You could look around the world for love (round the world for love)
Compared to mine, it won't be enough
Go head and dare to try your luck

You'll be back tomorrow
One day after the next
There's no reason to stress
Cause tomorrow
You'll send another text
Ain't gon be nothing left for tomorrow
(Morrow!)
Not tonight, not tonight, not tonight, but to...
Morrow
Cause tomorrow ain't promised babe

Do you know me that well?
I think you know me that well
But should you know me that well?
Do you know me that well?
I think you know me that well
But should you know me that well?...

Maybe
