		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I could be a lot
Hundred girls all wrapped in one
I'm the emotional type
Takes everything way too far
Be the girl to key your car
With you, I wanna cross the line

Yeah, I don't know why
But when you look at me with those eyes
I go a little crazy, outta my mind, yeah I

I wanna fuck, marry, kiss you all in one day
Wanna hold you, cut your head off straight
Maybe I'm a masochist
I don't feel in love at all, oh
I wanna love, kiss, curse you out in one breath
Wanna say you're mine and start an argument
Maybe I'm a psychopath
Taking shit from one to ten, I
I wanna fuck, marry, kill you sometimes

Yeah, uh, hate to love me, love to hate me
Call me stupid, call me crazy
My moods are swinging and swaying
You got me stressed on the daily
Wanna love you, wanna like you
Wanna kill you, wanna wife you
I don't pick up out of spite
Then call you back just to fight
I be caring too much, people turn and they run
Think I'm falling in love, but I got ice in my blood
My friends told me I'm dumb but I don't give a fuck
Marry, kill you all in one

I wanna fuck, marry, kiss you all in one day
Wanna hold you, cut your head off straight
Maybe I'm a masochist
I don't feel in love at all, oh
I wanna love, kiss, curse you out in one breath
Wanna say you're mine and start an argument
Maybe I'm a psychopath
Taking shit from one to ten, I
I wanna fuck, marry, kill you sometimes
I wanna fuck, marry, kill you sometimes

I wanna, I wanna
Fuck, marry, kill you sometimes (fuck, marry, kill you), yeah
I wanna fuck, marry, kill you (I wanna, I wanna)
Fuck, marry, kiss you sometimes, yeah
(Fuck, marry, kill)

I wanna fuck, marry, kill you all in one day
Wanna hold you, cut your head off straight
Maybe I'm a masochist
I don't feel in love at all, oh
I wanna love, kiss, curse you out in one breath
Wanna say you're mine and start an argument
Maybe I'm a psychopath
Taking shit from one to ten, I
I wanna fuck, marry, kill you sometimes
