		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

No doubt I'll regret this
Tour bus went and broke down out in Texas
There's barely any sound or reception
Promise you won't fuck the whole town when you get this, yeah
Low power on an iPhone, yeah
White powder in my nose, yeah
Ring ring, hearing dial tones, yeah
I just hope you get the message

If you get a minute, call me back
I'm so lonely and you're the only one that knows me, yeah, yeah
And if you're busy, then I understand it
It's bad timing and I'm probably gonna end up crying, ah
Fall back, yeah
I hope you're not mad
See, I've been taking medicine so I can relax, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, so if you get a minute, call me back, babe, yeah, yeah
Here's hoping twenty minutes I'ma hear that phone ring

We're sorry, the number you have dialed is not in service at this time

Yeah, two days out in Chelsea
The way you keep on coming up on me (oh, yeah)
I'd ask 'cause I don't mind but
Is there any chance he'll be here in the morning? Yeah
And I'm guessing that you're lonely
Wholesome girls get a little boring
If you don't want it to end
Well, then that really depends on you (yeah, yeah)

If you let somebody down
I can feel your karma coming 'round ('round, 'round)
And I wonder if he's hurting now, yeah (now, now)
Send me your reply when you're up 'cause I'm waiting
Fuck it, I've been waiting enough so I'm sayin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you get a minute, call me back
I'm so lonely and you're the only one that knows me, yeah, yeah
And if you're busy then I understand it
It's bad timing and I'm probably gonna end up crying, ah
Fall back, yeah
I hope you're not mad
See, I've been taking medicine so I can relax, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, so if you get a minute, call me back, babe, yeah, yeah
Here's hoping twenty minutes and I'll hear that phone ring

Yeah
Twenty minutes 'til the phone ring
I'ma pull up on you outside of your house, twenty minutes, you can jump in
We could take a long way drive up the hills 'cause I know you love riding
I can see it in your eyes, baby, just for one time I was hoping
Yeah, one time I was hoping

If you get a minute, call me back (if you get a minute, call me back, please)
I'm so lonely and you're the only one that knows me, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
And if you're busy then I understand it (I understand it)
It's bad timing and I'm probably gonna end up crying, ah
Fall back, uh
I hope you're not mad (hope you're not mad)
See, I've been taking medicine so I can relax, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, so if you get a minute call me back, babe, yeah yeah
Here's hoping twenty minutes and I'll hear that phone ring 

Hear that phone ring from you, babe
I'm stupid
This love hurt
My phone don't ring no more
So if you get a minute call me back, back, oh
