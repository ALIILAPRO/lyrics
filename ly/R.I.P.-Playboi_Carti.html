		<p>
		  Yeah, I'ma go fuck that bitch
I'ma go thrash that bitch
Shawty gon' suck this dick
Shawty gon' suck this dick
That's a pull-up bitch
Don't make me pull up, bitch
I'd smash that thot, then pull out bitch
Might push the Flacko shit
Watch me pull up, take your chain, lil' bitch
I'm on Deebo lit
I'm on Migo lit
I'm on kilo lit
I go psycho bitch
Watch me suck your bitch
Watch me thrash that bitch
Then I pass that bitch

Cop the Prada bitch, get one for the silt
Got that Prada bag, got one for my bitch
Lil' boy hit like blitz
Lil' boy this my bitch
Got me mad as shit, so I slapped that bitch
I ain't even hop in the coupe
the bitch gon' start with the clique
And I ain't even fucking this thot
But your bitch got the star on the clique
All of my diamonds they flawless
All of my diamonds legit
All of these diamonds they popping
Hold up, hold up, Slatt, move like a boss
Slatt, move like a boss
I get the dope, kilo
Yeah, come fuck with the boss
Smokin' that gas, diesel
Yeah, smell like a boss
She throwin' the bag like a freezer
Yeah, hit like a boss

I'ma go fuck that bitch
I'ma go thrash that bitch
Shawty gon' suck this dick
Shawty gon' suck this dick
That's a pull-up bitch
Don't make me pull up, bitch
I'd smash that thot, then pull out bitch
Might push the Flacko shit
Watch me pull up, take your chain, lil' bitch
I'm on Deebo lit
I'm on Migo lit
I'm on kilo lit
I go psycho bitch
Watch me suck your bitch
Watch me thrash that bitch
Then I pass that bitch

All my dogs, fight with my dog, yeah, shootin' with my dogs
Yeah, I want your thot, don't want your bride, yeah
She all on my lot
Countin' the nights, all in my ghosts, yeah
Head to the loft
I got a strap all on my dick, ain't hittin' it raw
I just let, ooh, Prada bag, ooh, holding the nine
I got a bitch, Rihanna bad, ooh
That bitch gotta box
Fuck that mumblin' shit
Fuck that mumblin' shit
Bought a crib for my mama off that mumblin' shit
Made a mil' off that, uh
Off that mumblin' shit
Made a mil' off that, uh
Off that mumblin' shit
Bought a crib for my mama
Off that mumblin' shit
Fuck that hoe, that one, big ass booty bih

I'ma go fuck that bitch
I'ma go thrash that bitch
Shawty gon' suck this dick
Shawty gon' suck this dick
That's a pull-up bitch
Don't make me pull up, bitch
I'd smash that thot, then pull out bitch
Might push the Flacko shit
Watch me pull up, take your chain, lil' bitch
I'm on Deebo lit
I'm on Migo lit
I'm on kilo lit
I go psycho bitch
Watch me suck your bitch
Watch me thrash that bitch
Then I pass that bitch
