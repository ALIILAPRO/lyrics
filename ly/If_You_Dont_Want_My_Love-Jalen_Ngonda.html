		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this night, a starry sky
My baby told me with a sigh
Saying words that came across as a doubt
I reassured that every day my love is strong in every place
In your heart, I sho'nuff can't live without
Every mountain, every sea
Can never stray or burden me
No matter the state of space and time
Keeps us close and keep us dear
Not just a day, but every year
You were made to be a focus in my mind

But if you don't want my love
And if you want somethin' more
Said if you never wanted my love
Let me know, oh

You're not bound by a vow
Could be tomorrow or even now
If you want another scope to look inside
I'll be the person of your dreams, or your lover in-between
Every corner in the canyons of your mind

But if you don't want my love
And if you want somethin' more, baby, baby
Said if you never wanted my love
Let me know, let me know

Let, let me know
Come on, baby
Let me know
Ooh, let me know
