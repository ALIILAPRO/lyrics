		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He’d leave me out when it was pouring
but you’d never find me boring 
if I kinda look like shit 
you’d say I’m pretty in the morning

after three years think he’d know my coffee order
only talking for a week and now you’re my favourite author
I got guys as friends and you wouldn’t mind that
Go out all night and he never liked that
He never liked that

I’m not looking for another rebound
I’m not dating anyone with skinny jeans now
But me on the bench I’m referee now
Out their league now

I hit save on you & me
I can delete my history

No no no no
Ctrl alt delete I won’t repeat my history

Was treated like one of the fellas
But to you I’m cinderella
He could never please me
You know all the ways to pleasure
I won’t ever fuck my ex 
Never ever ever again
Cause I got somebody better
Who gon love me as I am
I got guys as friends

And you wouldn’t mind that
Go out all night but he never liked that
He never liked that
But you wouldn’t mind that
I can dress how I like but you wouldn’t mind that
Go to sunrise and you hit me right back
Na na na
He wouldn’t like that
But you wouldn’t mind that

I’m not looking for another rebound
I’m not dating anyone with skinny jeans now
But me on the bench I’m referee now
Out their league now

I hit save on you & me
I can delete my history
No no no no no no

Ctrl alt delete I won’t repeat my history
I hit save on you & me
I can delete my history

I’m not looking for another rebound
I’m not dating anyone with skinny jeans now
But me on the bench I’m referee now
Out their league now

I hit save on you & me
I can delete my history
No no no no no no

Ctrl alt delete I won’t repeat my history
I hit save on you & me
I can delete my history

delete my history
delete my history
hit save on you & me
I can delete my history
