		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The nights spent kicking cars
won’t you help me find the stars
The things I dream are tearing up the structure’s seams

And analyse with ice could eyes
Something in me makes you realise
The things I dream are tearing up the structure’s seams

And why can’t we be analogue
Running ‘round, in your consumer fog
And your another stupid pet, hey did you forget the cigarettes

We look to the kicked in stars
Family day trips, the moon and mars
The things I dream are tearing up the structure’s seams

And analyse with Irish eyes
Something in me makes you wanna die
The things I dream are tearing up the structure’s seams

And why can’t we be analogue
Running ‘round, in your consumer fog
Your another stupid pet, hey did you forget the cigarettes

And why can’t we be analogue
Running ‘round, in your consumer fog
Your another stupid pet, hey did you forget the cigarettes...............Heeeeay!
