		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rag weed tall better hope that his ladder don't crack
Or he'll hit the ground low, hard and out of  his back
At the battle at the bottom of the ocean, well the dead
Do rise
You need proof I got proof at the surface you can watch
'Em float by
Way in back of the room, there sits a cage

Inside it's a clock that you can win if you can guess its age
Which you never can do 'cause the time it constantly changes
For luck or lack

I guess that is the saying
On the first page of the book of blue it read
"If you read this page, than that'll be your death"
By then it was too late

And you wound up on an island of shells and bones that
Bodies had left 
And the one thing you taught me 
'bout human beings was this
They ain't made of nothin' but water and shit
