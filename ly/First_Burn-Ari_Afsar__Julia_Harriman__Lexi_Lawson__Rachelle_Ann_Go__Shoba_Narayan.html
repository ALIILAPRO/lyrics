		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I saw you
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine

Do you know what Angelica said
When I told her what you'd done?
She said

"You have married an Icarus
He has flown too close to the sun"

Don't take another step in my direction
I can't be trusted around you
Don't think you can talk your way
Into my arms, into my arms

I'm burning the letters you wrote me
You can stand over there if you want
I don't know who you are
I have so much to learn
I'm re-reading your letters
And watching them burn (burn)

I'm watching them burn (burn)

You published the letters she wrote to you
You told the whole world
How you brought this girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives

Heaven forbid someone whisper

"He's part of some scheme"

Your enemy whispers

So you have to scream

I know about whispers

I see how you look at my sister

Don't

I'm not naive

I have seen women around you
Don't

Think I don't see

How they fall for your charms
All your charms

I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder how Eliza reacted
When you broke her heart
You have thrown it all away
Stand back, watch it burn
Just watch it all burn

And when the time comes

Explain to the children

The pain and embarrassment

You put their mother through

When will you learn

That they are your legacy?
We are your legacy

If you thought you were mine (mine, mine)
Don't
