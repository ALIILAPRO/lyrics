		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you all good?
Are you alright?
I'm in your neighborhood
For your darkest times

Are you all good?
Are you alright?
I'm in your neighborhood
For your darkest times

Are you all good?
Are you alright?
I'm in your neighborhood
For your darkest times

Are you all good?
Are you alright?
I'm in your neighborhood
For your darkest times

Are you all good?
Tell me how you're feeling
Are you alright?
Now we're all alone
I'm in your neighborhood
I wanna whisper you something
For your darkest times
That you already know

Are you all good?
Tell me how you're feeling
Are you alright?
Now we're all alone
I'm in your neighborhood
I wanna whisper you something
For your darkest times
That you already know

When all you want
Is to disappear
Searching for wisdom
But nothing's clear
What will become of me
If you're not here?
I know life is a mental place
Where there's always fear

Are you all good?
Tell me how you're feeling
Now we're all alone
I wanna whisper you something
That you already know

Are you all good?
Tell me how you're feeling
Now we're all alone
I wanna whisper you something
That you already know

Are you all good?
Tell me how you're feeling
Are you alright?
Now we're all alone
I'm in your neighborhood
I wanna whisper you something
For your darkest times
That you already know

Are you all good?
Tell me how you're feeling
Are you alright?
Now we're all alone
I'm in your neighborhood
I wanna whisper you something
For your darkest times
That you already know

Are you all good?
Are you all good?
