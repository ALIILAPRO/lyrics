		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on
Because the force
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like, ah
It make me feel like, ooh

Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperatures risin' now
Power (oh power) is the force, the vow
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why (ooh)
So get closer (closer now)
To my body now
Just love me
'Til you don't know how (ooh)

Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothin' like a love desire (ooh)
I'm melting (I'm melting)
Like hot candle wax
Sensation (oh sensation)
Lovely where we're at (ooh)
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complainin' (ooh)
'Cause this is love power (ooh)

Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Heartbreak enemy despise
Eternal (oh, eternal)
Love shines in my eyes
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complainin'
'Cause your love is alright, alright

Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Keep on, with the force, don't stop (don't stop, babe)
Don't stop 'til you get enough 
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (oh, my baby)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Lovely is the feeling now 
I won't be complaining
The force is love power

Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (don't stop, darlin')
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (go crazy, baby)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (keep on, now)
Don't stop 'til you get enough

Keep on, with the force, don't stop (keep on, darlin')
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (love power, yeah)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (keep on, darlin')
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (don't, no, no)
Don't stop 'til you get enough (keep up the power, yeah, ooh)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough ('til you get enough, now)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (ooh)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (yeah)
Don't stop 'til you get enough (oh, no)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (yeah)
Don't stop 'til you get enough (keep on, baby)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough (oh, 'til you get enough)
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (keep on, darlin')
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop (oh, no)
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on, with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
