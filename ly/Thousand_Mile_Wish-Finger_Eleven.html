		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgive me if now I wear the face of worry
This time alone could never cause any doubt
But I've been cold too long
Such a strange time to find myself coming down as the rain
With all the holes my love,
To fill up from the middle
This storm could stay all night

So can you stay until we close our eyes
'Til your dreams hold mine
Just stay until we know we tried one more time

'Cause laughing lovers can overcome their closest demons
And they'll go on and they won't let go
They saw something that they know
Has never come so close
Can it stay here for us, for now?

Can it stay until we know ourselves?
I'm torn as I tell
You're the story that I know and fell from
I'm so far into your story I don't know why
We think we're in control
When we lie between the lines

We'll find a line to follow
It's got to show real soon
Or we'll never each this high

We climb a little further
'Cause there's nothing we can't get around together
Further gets colder until nothing was all that I saw around

So we stay until the ground
That we can't come down from splits us away
Maybe stars know why we fall
I just wish they were thinking out loud
Oh, I could wish all night
