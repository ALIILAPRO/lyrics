		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got so many questions
You seek information
No need to be desperate
We're just getting started, yeah

Diamond plated tension
Two minds, one direction
Craving the connection
Patience, babe

We're pulling at each other like magnets
The rules are telling us to ignore them
Your moves they're asking me for attention
Oh, I'm losing it, hey

No turning back once we're connected
No turning back once we're connected
No turning back once we're connected

All that I want is you
Even if I'm a fool
Why do I fall for you?
No turning back once we're connected

All that I want is you
Even if I'm a fool
I know that you want me too
No turning back once we're connected

Locked in sight, we're in trouble
A lock and a key making rumbles
I know you want me, don't crumble
Leave it to time, no need to hustle

Meant for each other, no one can stop us
You know that we'll be lasting forever
Feel the fire, it's burning up the danger
You know it shouldn't be, but

We're pulling at each other like magnets
The rules are telling us to ignore them
Your moves they're asking me for attention
Oh, I'm losing it, hey

No turning back once we're connected
No turning back once we're connected
No turning back once we're connected

All that I want is you
Even if I'm a fool
Why do I fall for you?
No turning back once we're connected

All that I want is you
Even if I'm a fool
I know that you want me too

No turning back once we're connected
