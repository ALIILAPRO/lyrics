		  Fuck it (Come on, man, come on)
What the fuck (Hey)
What?! (Hey)
What?! What the fuck do you want?!

Hello motherfucker
Heard you was craving for more
I know you hear me barkin at your door (hoo)

So run it, just fucking gun it
I dare you try me
Put me on it, don't try to stop it
I been craving for more than conscious
I want all the nonsense

Just let me fight a motherfucker hoo

I been craving for more than conscious
I want all the nonsense
I been craving for more than conscious
I want all the nonsense

I been craving for more than conscious
I want all the nonsense
I been craving for more than conscious
I want all the nonsense
