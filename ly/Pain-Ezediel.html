		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These motherfuckers they don't know, they don't know me
These motherfuckers they don't know, they don't know me
These motherfuckers they don't know, they don't know me
These motherfuckers they don't know...
And I'm a product of Pain
And you know, I don't feel the same
Let me burn, let me burn
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
And I'm a product of Pain
And you know, I don't feel the same
Let me burn, let me burn
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
It's the only way!
These motherfuckers they don't know me Yah
When you feel this strain, and feel so lonely Yah-Yah
And I'm about to get all of it Yah
Even if you won't face all your shit
Heal like there's no way out, you think about, now pay the deal
Bless me and kill me, it's a fire pit, Immortality
Army of Angels, the light of God beside me
And you think you're free Free
But there's chains on your chin
Fire inside of my veins My veins
Get the fuck out on my way My way
Stain blood, your staring face
I'm stainless steel
You will embrace Yo
Stain blood, your staring face
I'm stainless steel
You will embrace
There's no dark without the light
We fall apart now shot this pace
You don't know me, How far can you
If you save me, who would save you too
And I'm a product of Pain
And you know, I don't feel the same
Let me burn, let me burn
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
And I'm a product of Pain
And you know, I don't feel the same
Let me burn, let me burn
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
It's the only way
It's the only wa-way
It's the only way!
