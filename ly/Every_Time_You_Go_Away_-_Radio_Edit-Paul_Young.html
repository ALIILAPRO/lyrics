		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't leave me all alone
I'm picking up the pieces (I'm picking up the pieces)
Don't leave me all alone
I'm picking up the pieces (I'm picking up the pieces)
Don't leave me all alone
I'm picking up the pieces (I'm picking up the pieces)
Don't leave me all alone

Hey
If we can solve any problem
Then why do we lose so many tears?
Oh, so you go again
When the leading man appears

Always the same thing
Can't you see
We've got everything
Going on and on and on

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you, ooh

Go on and go free, yeah
Maybe you're too close to see
I can feel your body move
Doesn't mean that much to me

I can't go on
Saying the same thing
'Cause can't you see?
We got everything
Baby, even though you know

Every time you go away, yeah
You take a piece of me with you, oh
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you, ooh

Oh

I can't go on
Saying the same thing
'Cause, baby, can't you see?
We got everything
Going on and on and on

Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you
Every time you go away
You take a piece of me with you

Picking up the pieces
Every time you go away (ooh)
You take a piece of me with you (be careful)
Every time you go away (every time you go)
You take a piece of me with you
You take a piece of me
Every time you go away (oh)
You take a piece of me with you (every time you go)
