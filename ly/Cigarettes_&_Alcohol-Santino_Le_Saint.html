		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cigarette stain on your velvet dress
Red wine spilled on my ice white shirt, ooh
Two-inch rip in your favorite skirt, baby
I tried to fix it all, tried to make it work

Cursed you out when we were driving home
I'm playing victim to this alcohol
And you're sensitive, I know, I know
When we're drunk we're always in love or out of control, yeah

Cigarettes and alcohol
They gonna get the best of us both
But no matter what you do
I'll still love you
Red label and some white Marlboro
Some things we just can't let go
But no matter what I say
I'll still love you
I'll still love you

Dior sittin' on the waist of my jeans
Baby, you're drunk, just remember it, please
What's that mark on your neck I see?
I thought you said you'd never do that to me
So, why don't I believe you?
And why don't you believe me, too, baby?
Love is blind and it's crazy, ooh

You cursed me out when we were driving home
A product of the alcohol
And you don't care, I know, I know
But when we're drunk we're always in love, oh-oh

Cigarettes and alcohol
They gonna get the best of us both
But no matter what you do
I'll still love you
Red label and some white Marlboro
Some things we just can't let go
But no matter what I say
I'll still love you 
I'll still love you

I'll still love you
I'll still love you
I'll still love you
I'll still love you
