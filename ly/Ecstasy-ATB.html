		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever noticed
That I'm not acting as I used to do before?
Have you ever wondered
Why I always keep on coming back for more?

What have you done to me
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure

I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure 
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure 

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

Have you ever noticed
That I'm not acting as I used to do before?
Have you ever wondered
Why I always keep on coming back for more?

What have you done to me
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure

I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure 
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure 

Have you ever noticed
That I'm not acting as I used to do before?
Have you ever wondered
Why I always keep on coming back for more?

What have you done to me
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure

I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure 
I'll never be the same I'll tell you for sure 

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

You really are my ecstasy
My real life fantasy, oh yeah

(There can be no other
While we still have each other)
(There can be no other
While we still have each other)
(There can be no other
While we still have each other)
(There can be no other
While we still have each other)
