		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be blue
and dive into the water
Feel the freedom
and feel hope

I wanna be the light
and run into the open
Living in the freedom
and living in hope

Swim is all I want
I need to leave it all behind
and swim

Swim is all I want
I need to leave it all behind
and swim

I wanna take the dark
Dark filling your whole heart
Giving you the freedom
and giving you hope

I wanna take the dark
Dark filling your whole heart
Giving you the freedom
and giving you hope

Swim is all I want
I need to leave it all behind
and swim

Swim is all I want
I need to leave it all behind
and swim

I wanna be light as a light
I wanna be light as a light
I wanna be light as a light

I wanna be light as a light
I wanna be light as a light
I wanna be light as a light

Swim is all I want
I need to leave it all behind
and swim

Swim is all I want
I need to leave it all behind
and swim
