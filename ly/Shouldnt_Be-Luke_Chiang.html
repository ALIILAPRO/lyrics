		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stop feelin' like none of this matters at

Fool around, tell me words that you don't mean
I'm already numb to it
I'm already numb to it
Feed me lies, tear me up, break me down
I don't wanna be playin' these games

I'm already used to it
I'm already used to you bein' this cold

But keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you missed me
You've played with my pride
Makin' me feel like we had somethin' real

I know we've been over this, it's nothin' new
You're still gonna be leavin' me here
It's easier hatin' you than missin' you
But I don't wanna be feelin' this way

I'm already through with it
I'm already tired of thinkin' at all

'Cause keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you missed me
You've played with my pride
Makin' me feel like we had somethin' real
And makin' you stay shouldn't feel wrong
This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
I've played all my cards
Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?

No matter what I say to you
You're gone (I've been tryin' in vain to hold on)
No matter what I say

Keepin' you close shouldn't be hard
If you were honest when you said you've missed me
You've played with my pride
Makin' me feel like we had somethin' real
And makin' you stay shouldn't feel wrong
This is the last time I'll ask you to listen
I've played all my cards
Would you feel a thing if you saw me right now?
