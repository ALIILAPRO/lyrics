		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my heart
It used to be so supple and sweet
And now it's withered on the vine

There's before and then there's after
You were mine

Take my faith so strong and full of fire
Now it's bruised, broken down and blind

There's before and then there's after
You were mine you were mine

Sun comes up, sun goes down
World keeps rollin' around and around
The hands on the clock going
Tick-tock-tick-tock
Ain't the way I measure time

There's just before and then there's after
You were mine you were mine

Take my hands, they used to hold you so tight
Now they reach
But they never touch you in the night

There's before and then there's after
You were mine you were mine, mine, mine

Sun comes up, sun goes down
World keeps rollin' around and around
The hands on the clock going
Tick-tock-tick-tock
That ain't the way that I measure time

There's just before and then there's after
There's before and then there's after
There's before
There's before and then there's after
You were mine

You were mine, you were mine, you were mine
Oh, yeah yeah, oh, yeah yeah oh-ho-ho
You were mine, you were mine, you were mine
Yeah
