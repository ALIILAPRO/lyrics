		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone
Got themselves a letter
In the mail the other day
It's already worn and tattered
And I guess
It gives away

All the things we keep inside
All the things that really matter
The face puts on it's best disguise
And all is well
Until the heart
Betrays

She knows
As she reads her letter
That things were bound to stray
Winds blow
She pulls her coat tighter
And the letter flies away

With all the things she keeps inside
All the things that really matter
The face puts on it's best disguise
And all is well
Until the heart betrays

Lord bring on the night
Wrap it all around me
Let it hold me tight
Soak up all that I bleed

Lord bring on the night
Wrap it all around me
Let it hold me tight
Soak up all that I bleed

And I'll fly away
Yeah I'll fly away
Yeah I'll fly away
Watch me

Lord bring on the night
Wrap it all around me
Let it hold me tight
Soak up all that I bleed, yeah yeah

I bleed
