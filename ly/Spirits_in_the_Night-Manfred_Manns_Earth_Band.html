		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crazy Janey and her mission man
Were back in the alley tradin hands
Long came Wild Billy with his friend 
G-Man all duded up for Saturday night

Well, Billy slammed on his coaster brakes
And said, "anybody want to go on up to Greasy Lake?"
It's about a mile down on the dark side of Route 88
I got a bottle of Rose, so let's try it

We'll pick up Hazy Davy and Killer Joe
And I'll take you all out to where the Gypsy angels go
They're built like light and they dance like spirits in the night
(All night) in the night (all night)

Oh you don't know what they can do to you
Spirits in the night (all night)
In the night (all night)
Stand right up now and let them shoot through you

Well now, Wild Billy was a crazy cat
And he shook some dust out of his coonskin cap
He said, "trust some of this, it'll show you where it's at
Or at least it'll really help you feel it"

By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake
I had my head out the window 
And Janey's fingers were in the cake
I think I really dug her cause I was too loose to fake

I said, "I'm hurt."  She said, "Honey, let me heal it."
And we danced all night to a soul fairy band
And she kissed me just right like only a lonely angel can
She felt so nice, just as soft as a spirit in the night

(All night) in the night (all night)
Janey don't know what she do to you
Spirit in the night (all night) in the night (all night)
Stand right up and let her shoot through me

Now the night was bright and the stars
Threw light on Billy and Davy dancin in the moonlight
They were down near the water in a stone mud fight
Killer Joe gone passed out on the lawn

Well now, Hazy Davy got really hurt, 
He ran into the lake in just his socks and a shirt
Me and crazy Janey was makin love in the dirt
Singin our birthday song

Janey said it ws time to go so we closed our eyes
And said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row, 
Felt so right together we moved like spirits in the night (all night)
