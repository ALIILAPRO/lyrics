		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Build yourself a boat, babe
Make yourself a sail
Float into the ocean
To nowhere
Yeah, I see you looking
Looking for a sign
Praying for a beacon
So here's the light

My arms will be wide open
For the moment you arrive, arrive

When you set sail on your journey
And happiness is far away
Love will guide you 'til the morning
Lead your heart down to the bay
Don't resist the rain and storm
I'll never leave you lost at sea
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home

Yeah, I see you're lonely
Going in alone
Fire up the engine
Stoke the coal
Floating on a feeling
Fighting with the tide
Hoping you'll be home for Christmas time

My arms will be wide open
For the moment you arrive, arrive

When you set sail on your journey
And happiness is far away
Love will guide you 'til the morning
Lead your heart down to the bay
Don't resist the rain and storm
I'll never leave you lost at sea
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
I will be your lighthouse keeper
Bring you safely home to me
