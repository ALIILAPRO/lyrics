		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been done with all my vices
Moralizing and tellin' my new therapist about you
I've been walkin' in the forest, avoiding crowded rooms
I've been out here takin' shrooms, I've been microdosing
I ain't drinkin' no more booze, it's a bad influence
Baby got that BBL, thought that ass would cure it
She told me to go to Hell, I ain't feel no fury

I tried to keep my heart pure
But I'm damned if I don't, damned if I do
It's not easy livin' with clarity
I just need a little more therapy
(Ooh-ooh)
I just need a little more clarity
(Ooh-ooh)
I just need a little more therapy
(Ooh-ooh)
I'm out here searchin' for truth
(Ooh-ooh)

Said I'm done with hesitation, congratulations
Back to the basics, life's what you make it
I know that I'm impatient, manipulative
Hardheaded, ain't shit
These diamonds flawless, but my flaws need some work still
Might take a picture, but we ain't picture-perfect
I got distracted by the bag, wasn't worth it
Ain't take a look at what's inside

I tried to keep my heart pure
But I'm damned if I don't, damned if I do
It's not easy livin' with clarity
I just need a little more therapy
(Ooh-ooh)
I just need a little more clarity
(Ooh-ooh)
I just need a little more therapy
(Ooh-ooh)
I'm out here searchin' for truth
(Ooh-ooh)

(Ooh-ooh)
(I just need a little more clarity)
