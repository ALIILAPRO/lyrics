		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh love love keep lover
Gimme your time your body, boy
I don't need money (money), I got my own
Gimme your sex appeal, so I can take you home
Ohh I'ma make you a believer
(Paradise) Ima show you what paradise look like
(Damn right) I can make you go all night, fuck all night
(All night) Ohh I'ma make you a believer
(You wanna ride my roller-coaster)
Don't you wanna ride it? ride it? (my boat)
Don't you wanna ride it? ride it? (when you go up & down)
Don't you wanna ride it?
I got toys with the boys
Take a tour look around
My playground
I'll make you a believer
I'll make you a believer
So tell me whatchu want (aohh)
I'll make you a believer
Don't you want fun (fun), call my name
I'll be your guard, your body, boy
If you won't come (come), let me know
Are you gonna wait in line, but I'ma start the show
Oh I'ma make you a believer

Don't you wanna ride it? ride it?
My boat
Don't you wanna ride it? ride it?
When you go up & down
Don't you wanna ride it?
I got toys with the boys
Take a tour look around
My playground
I'll make you a believer

I'll make you a believer so tell me whatchu want (aohh)
I'll make you a believer so tell me whatchu want (aohh)
I'll make you a believer so tell me whatchu want (aohh)
I'll make you a believer so tell me whatchu want (aohh)
