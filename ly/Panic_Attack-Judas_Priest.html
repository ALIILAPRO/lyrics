		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The clamor and the clatter of incensed keys
Can bring a nation to its knees
On the wings of a lethal icon, bird of prey
It's a sign of the times when bedlam rules
When the masses condone pompous fools
And the scales of justice tip in disarray

Panic attack, panic attack
Panic attack, panic attack

Matters of fact fall on deaf ears
While the bitter mobs ramp up their fears
Go creeping 'round those corridors of power
As the dead heads gladly suffer sins
While the euthanizing then begins
The clock is ticking down to doomsday hour

Panic attack, panic attack
Panic attack, panic attack

Alien nations gleam
Cybertronic schemes
Fibre optic, mass hypnotic
Wild neurotic memes

Cynicism, greed is what you're fed
Disconnecting from the world wide web

It don't matter about your choice
'Cause all you've got is an empty voice
And there's no way left to tell what's right from wrong
There's still time left to do what's right
Eliminate those parasites
And force your mind amidst the angry throng

Panic attack, panic attack
Disconnect the system
Panic attack, panic attack
Euthanize the brain
Panic attack, panic attack
Blind synthetic wisdom
Panic attack, panic attack
Digitally, criminally insane

Panic attack, panic attack
Panic attack, panic attack
Panic attack, panic attack
