		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me

Lord forgive me, I be puttin' in work
Lord forgive me, I was doin' that dirt
Lord forgive me, I put a hole in his shirt
Lord forgive me, he was on the wrong turf
Lord forgive me, had the pistol at the church
Lord forgive me, been cursed since birth
Lord forgive me, tryna figure my worth
Tryna do better, can't get no worse

What I done wrong, I done right
It's my darkness in your sunshine
What I done wrong, I done right
It's my darkness in your sunshine

Look, before I spit a hallelujah, I'ma need a hearse
'Cause I ain't finna let nobody ho me out here
My pockets on Buddha (fat), church
But demons still gotta pay the toll around here
Big Glock, keep heavy metal like Kid Rock
Never let it sick, hide, shoot 'til my wrist lock
If the opposition make a pit stop
By the drip drop, get popped while some Kidz Bops playin'
Yeah, all my daughters know that this ain't only talk
My only thought is how to make a chopper make a opper
Skate from 'round this, ho, like Tony Hawk, yeah
Tell Skateboard P this a buffet
I'm from where they handle more keys than valet
Whole squad grippin', but it's in the ballet
So if you hear the boom-boom, all I can say is

Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me

Lord forgive me, I be puttin' in work
Lord forgive me, I was doin' that dirt
Lord forgive me, I put a hole in his shirt
Lord forgive me, he was on the wrong turf
Lord forgive me, had the pistol at the church
Lord forgive me, been cursed since birth
Lord forgive me, tryna figure my worth
Tryna do better, can't get no worse

What I done wrong, I done right
It's my darkness in your sunshine
What I done wrong, I done right
It's my darkness in your sunshine

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Whole hood screamin', "Big Fat, don't hurt 'em"
Tob like, "Hell nah, get 'em"
Big steppin' on the head of the serpent
But I keep a blade 'case I gotta kill 'em
Everything but headache when I get it
I done slid on everything, but I ain't quittin', no to debit
I'm invested, that's why I can go from prints to bein' breaded
And my baby daddy got a bank account in seven digits plus some (plus some)
Can't fight good, but I bust guns
It's on sight with me, never duck none (duck none)
I'm givin' my hood baby trust funds
We ain't never goin' broke, ayy, look (look)
I don't play about my two lil' daughters or my son
Or my lil' baby that's about to come
I leave a demon holier than nuns and then pray

Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me
Lord forgive me, Lord forgive me

Lord forgive me, I be puttin' in work
Lord forgive me, I was doin' that dirt
Lord forgive me, I put a hole in his shirt
Lord forgive me, he was on the wrong turf
Lord forgive me, had the pistol at the church
Lord forgive me, been cursed since birth
Lord forgive me, tryna figure my worth
Tryna do better, can't get no worse

What I done wrong, I done right
It's my darkness in your sunshine
What I done wrong, I done right
It's my darkness in your sunshine
