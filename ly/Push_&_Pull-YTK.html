		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been in and outta element and tryna make a move
I ain't like these niggas ima tell you something true
I can't never fake the funk, cause that ain't something I can do
Sir Charles one call she gone give the boy the blues

Nigga pockets getting greedy
Baby call me cruddy but she call me when she need me
Love the lovey-dovey til' she turn the shit anemic
We should Usher Raymond let it burn into a phoenix

Better off alone only way the should we leave it
She say seeing is believing
Like I never been the type to try practice what I'm preaching
Girl you motherfucking geekin'
But you halfway right
Blowing my phone last Saturday night
Paragraph texting but you know I hate to type
So you might as well call if you tryna get right
Feel like you always wanna fight but I know that ain't true
And I ain't even tryna be wit that bitch if it ain't you
Cause I tell you real shit the type of shit that's painful
I say you be on some shit but I be on the same bull

Feel like we pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
Pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
Pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
Pull then we push, then we push, then we pull

Feel like we push, and pull
It could be so simple we got Kush, to roll
When we in that element it's wonderful
And I don't wanna leave
I just wanna ball wit you in a different league
You ain't never gone change shit staying where you be
And I put that on my momma, on my brother on me
Want the two-door Rolls flood my molars wit the Vs
Nigga life is what you make it you control what ya see
Make the work match the play, and the play match the work
If I gotta grab the ball bitch I ain't asking first
Double scoop alley-oop read the play back to Kurt
Hand the strap back to Cam I don't really give a damn bout
Nothing, niggas, talking, bout
Nigga run you up some money 'stead of runnin' yo mouth
Nigga worry bout ya streams stead of worried bout me
Whether pounds or plays man we got bare P's
It's my niggas from the way I see,  Imma push down court, pull me a 3

Feel like we pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
Pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
Pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
Pull then we push, then we push, then we pull
