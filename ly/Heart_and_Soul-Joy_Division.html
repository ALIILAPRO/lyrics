		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Instincts that can still betray us
A journey that leads to the sun
Soulless and bent on destruction
A struggle between right and wrong

You take my place in the showdown
I'll observe with a pitiful eye
And humbly ask for forgiveness
A request well beyond you and I

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

An abyss that laughs at creation
A circus complete with all fools
Foundations that lasted the ages
Then ripped apart at their roots

Beyond all this good is the terror
The grip of a mercenary hand
When savagery turns all good reason
There's no turning back, no last stand

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn

Existence well what does it matter?
I exist on the best terms I can
The past is now part of my future
The present is well out of hand
The present is well out of hand

Heart and soul, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn
One will burn, one will burn
Heart and soul, one will burn
