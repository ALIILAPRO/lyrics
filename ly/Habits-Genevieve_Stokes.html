		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Habits I'm trying to kick, can't get over it
Lovers I hate to admit are the ghost of it
I don't know why I try anymore
Wasting the days to forget that I'm losing it
Stuck in my ways and I hate that I'm used to it
I don't know why I try anymore

You go and I stay
It's always right person and wrong way
I hate to be right, please, tell me I'm wrong
Please, tell me I'm wrong

'Cause it's on again, off again
Love you like oxygen
I don't know what to say or do
On again, off again
Love you like oxygen
You don't know what I'd do for you

I'm stubborn and brittle
Act like I know a lot, but know very little
I'm growing up, but I'm not growing old
And I hate to do anything that I've been told

And you go and I stay
It's always right person and wrong way
I hate to be right, please, tell me I'm wrong
Please, tell me I'm wrong

'Cause it's on again, off again
Love you like oxygen
I don't know what to say or do
On again, off again
Love you like oxygen
You don't know what I'd do for you
