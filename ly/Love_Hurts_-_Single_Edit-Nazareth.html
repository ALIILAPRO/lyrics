		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love hurts
Love scars
Love wounds and marks
Any heart not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts

I'm young
I know
But even so
I know a thing or two, I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame, it burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts

Some fools think
Of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
They're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts
Ooh-ooh, love hurts 
Ooh-ooh
