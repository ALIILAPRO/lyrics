		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dim all the lights and I sink in my chair
The smoke from my cigarette climbs through the air
The walls of my room fade away in the blue
And I'm deep in a dream of you
The smoke makes a stairway for you to descend
You come to my arms, may this bliss never end
For we love anew just as we used to do
When I'm deep in a dream of you

Then from the ceiling, sweet music comes stealing
We glide through a lover's refrain, you're so appealing
That I'm soon revealing my love for you over again
My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep, every memory I'll keep
When I'm deep in a dream of you

My cigarette burns me, I wake with a start
My hand isn't hurt, but there's pain in my heart
Awake or asleep, every memory I'll keep
When I'm deep in a dream of you
