		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything is so complex
Everyday is like a test
For the obstacles that seem most impossible

And I'm thinking, just another breath.
Not a minute left, how long have I been drifting!.

Pass the glass pipe, hit the flashlight, now I break it
People say I'm a star, but I still think I'll never make it

And I'm thinking, just another prayer.
Not a second left. I feel there's something missing.

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away,
Or am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning..

I've been to hell and back, looking for the answers to life. 
Looking at myself trying to get things right

And I'm feeling, just another breath.
Not a minute left, I feel the darkness lifting!

There was a time that I questioned if I'll ever be all right
Running getting high, staying tracked by sleepless nights

And I'm thinking, just another breath.
Not a minute left. I feel there's something missing.

I'm running from myself and all the things I don't like.
Living every night like it's the last night.

And I'm thinking. just another prayer.
Not a second left. I need to stop resisting.

Sometimes I hate that chaos surrounds me
When all the answers that I seek are around me
Am I drowning, am I fading away,
Or am I living up to all your dreams that made me this way
Am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning, am I drowning

Drowning in the drama, lost in the light
Trapped by the currents of life, caught in the riptide.
