		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the real, I was comin' to apologize
Didn't come to have the talk that I think you're tryna have tonight
It's hard to see you without the love in your eyes
Now I kinda think it's been, yeah, it's been that way the whole time

It's crazy in this moment realizin' I'm goin' from

Someone who loved you
To someone you once knew
So at least let me bleed here in peace
Why you keep tryna cut through
Someone who loved you?
Is this what it's come to?
But at least I can sleep with some peace
'Cause all I had to lose
Was someone who didn't love me
You lost someone who loved you

I look away as you're tellin' me it's for the best
I fuckin' hate that I don't know how to hate you yet
Baby, what we had was incredible, don't you know the come down is inevitable
You'll have a lot to miss when you send me that, "I miss you" text

It's crazy in this moment realizin' I'm goin' from

Someone who loved you
To someone you once knew
So at least let me bleed here in peace
Why you keep tryna cut through
Someone who loved you?
Is this what it's come to?
But at least I can sleep with some peace
'Cause all I had to lose
Was someone who didn't love me
You lost someone who loved you

Oh (someone)
Oh (oh)
Oh (ooh)

Someone who loved you
To someone you once knew
So at least let me bleed here in peace
Why you keep tryna cut through
Someone who loved you?
Is this what it's come to?
But at least I can sleep with some peace
'Cause all I had to lose
Was someone who didn't love me
You lost someone who loved you
