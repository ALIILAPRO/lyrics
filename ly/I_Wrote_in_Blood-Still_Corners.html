		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrote a little book where I put your name
Turn the page and wrote the same
I wrote in blood

Turned around the corner and saw your face
Every time I look, well something breaks
I wrote in blood
I wrote in blood

We can leave now, just drive away
Only you and me, we could leave today
Let's take a chance, like we used to
We can go back, find something new

Made a little call on the telephone
Tried to see if you're alone
I wrote in blood

Took a little pill to see your face
Fell asleep in your embrace
I wrote in blood
I wrote in blood

We can leave now, just drive away
Only you and me, we could leave today
Let's take a chance, like we used to
We can go back, find something new

We can leave now, just drive away
Only you and me, we could leave today
Let's take a chance, like we used to
We can go back, find something new

We can leave now, just drive away
Only you and me, we could leave today
Let's take a chance, like we used to
We can go back, find something new

We can leave now, just drive away
