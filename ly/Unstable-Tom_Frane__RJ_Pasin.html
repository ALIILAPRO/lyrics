		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm unstable
I don't want anyone thinking
That I'm still not able
To hear you're happier now
You've been moving on
And you've made it look so easy
While I'm still talking to your ghost in my memory

Five am, I'm walking home again
On my own, would you pick up the phone?
I cleaned my place, put down our picture frames
Cause I don't want these strangers to know

Now I'm lying in pieces,
Cutting deeper with every move
And I'm fighting these feelings,
Pretending I'm over you

I'm unstable
I don't want anyone thinking
That I'm still not able
To hear you're happier now
You've been moving on
And you've made it look so easy
While I'm still talking to your ghost in my memory

In my head, I have the words you said
On repeat, I'm not used to being weak
Acting reckless, cause I'm way too jealous
To admit I'm not what you need

Now I'm lying in pieces,
Cutting deeper with every move
And I'm fighting these feelings,
Pretending I'm over you

I'm unstable
I don't want anyone thinking
That I'm still not able
To hear you're happier now
You've been moving on
And you've made it look so easy
While I'm still talking to your ghost in my memory

I'm unstable, oh
I never felt this pain before
And now your voicemail is playing all along
Could you pick up now?

I'm unstable
I don't want anyone thinking
That I'm still not able
To hear you're happier now
You've been moving on
And you've made it look so easy
While I'm still talking to your ghost in my memory
