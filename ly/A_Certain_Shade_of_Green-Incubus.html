		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A certain shade of green
Tell me, is that what you need?
All signs around say, "Move ahead"
Could someone please explain to me
You're ever present lack of speed?
Are your muscles bound by ropes
Or do crutches cloud your day?
My sources say, "The road is clear
And street signs point the way"

Are you gonna stand around 'til 2012 A.D?
What are you waitin' for
A certain shade of green?
I think I grew a gray watchin' you procrastinate
What are you waitin' for
A certain shade of green?

Would a written invitation
Signed, "Choose now or lose it all"
Sedate your hesitation
Or inflame and make you stall?
You've been raised in limitation
But that glove never fit quite right
The time has passed for hand-me-downs
Choose a new, please evolve
Take flight

Are you gonna stand around 'til 2012 a.d?
What are you waitin' for
A certain shade of green?
I think I grew a gray watchin' you procrastinate
(Talk that thing)

Green?
What are you waitin'?
What are you waitin'?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'?
What are you waitin'?
What are you waitin' for?

What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin'?
What are you waitin'?
What are you waitin' for?
What are you waitin' for?
Waitin' for?

I think I grew a gray watchin' you procrastinate
Are you gonna stand around till 2012 A.D?
What are you waitin' for
A certain shade of green?
I think I grew a gray watchin' you procrastinate
What are you waitin' for?
