		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the ending
From the beginning
You chewed me out on the first date
Pulled in the driveway
Said hit the highway
Then spent a few weeks at your place
And now I'm
Regaining consciousness
Dug up my common sense
Came to the cruelest conclusion
That there was nothing left
In me to make amends
All we did was make a mess
Just gotta get it off my chest
That I hate your friends
And you never liked mine
No it never felt right
So why did we even try
Did we stick together out of cold-blooded spite
Wasting each others time
Ruin each others lives
I wish you nothing but the worst I mean it
My favourite part was when
You said you're leaving
Thank god you're gone
Sleeping better at night
I guess it ended so wrong
Cause' it never felt right felt right
I think I've lost count
Of the times I've gone out
To meet you and you weren't even there
Gave me the run around
Then made me run around
And I don't think that I even care
We both deserve so much better
Knew it wasn't forever
Looking back on whatever this was
That I hate your friends
And you never liked mine
No it never felt right
So why did we even try
Did we stick together out of cold-blooded spite
Wasting each others time
Ruin each others lives
I wish you nothing but the worst I mean it
My favourite part was when
You said you're leaving
Thank god you're gone
Sleeping better at night
I guess it ended so wrong
Cause' it never felt right felt right
Regaining consciousness
Dug up my common sense
Came to the cruelest conclusion
That there was nothing left
In me to make amends
All we did was make a mess
Just gotta get it off my chest
That I hate your friends
And you never liked mine
No it never felt right
So why did we even try
Did we stick together out of cold-blooded spite
Wasting each others time
Ruin each others lives
I wish you nothing but the worst I mean it
My favourite part was when
You said you're leaving
Thank god you're gone
Sleeping better at night
I guess it ended so wrong
Cause' it never felt right felt right
