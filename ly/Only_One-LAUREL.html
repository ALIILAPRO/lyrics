		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull me aside
To touch my face
Like I’m the only place there is
I’m out of my mind
In comes madness, when we’re just having fun
Down by the sea
You pull me nearer like I’m nothing short of paradise
And when I’m alone again
I wonder about the words you said

So I get wild and pull your hair
Riding summer high clouds
Oh you pray I’m a golden girl
Guess you never know, but

You’re the only one
That sets fire to my sun
Burning with a fire when you look at me
You're the only one who can water me, ah
Dream on, dreamer
Dream on, dreamer

We run with the night
Wake up slow, on a bed of dandelions
I bloom with the spring
Hold me down if I go running with the wind

Back in the city
I find you near
Guess nothing’s ever as clear as paradise
And when I’m alone again, I think about the words you said

Oh I get wild and pull your hair
Riding summer high clouds
Oh you pray I’m a golden girl
Guess you never know, but

You’re the only one
That sets fire to my sun
Burning with a fire when you look at me
You're the only one who can water me, ah
Dream on, dreamer
Dream on, dreamer

You’re the only one
That sets fire to my sun
Burning with a fire when you look at me
You're the only one who can water me, ah
Dream on, dreamer
Dream on, dreamer
