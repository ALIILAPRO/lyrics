		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got me stressed (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I don't wanna rest (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Smokin' cigarettes (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Get it off my chest (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I don't wanna stress (whoa)
But I can't help it thinkin' if I lose the rest (oh, whoa)
And I can't help it, I don't wanna stress (oh, whoa)
But I can't help it, yeah (oh, oh)
No, no, no

Rocky Balboa, I'm boxin' with ya, yeah (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I don't know if I wanna sock it to ya, hey (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I told her buy Huaraches for me (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Skeletons out the closet for me, hey (whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I don't know if I wanna expose this to you (oh, you)
I don't know if I wanna caress you (oh, oh)
I don't know what I wanna do with you, girl (oh, whoa)
I don't know what I wanna do with you

Well, it's that gat totin', pistol holdin' nigga on your damn street
Pussy nigga usually pop a trigger if the hand speak
Lackluster, I'ma smack suckers this year
I'ma make a hundred thousand racks off of this here
Do the math, hunnid million for the slow ones in the class
Type of bags I be gettin' be too big to pay in cash
Send the wire, send it fast, 'fore I might just change my mind
Nowadays a million dollars barely worth a nigga time
I ain't sayin' I'm the richest nigga that's in this shit (but I'm one of them)
Barely check my account, nigga, I'm admittin' it (I don't give a fuck)
Fuck around with my bread, bet you I'ma find out (I'ma catch you, nigga)
Couple niggas I deaded, know what I'm talkin' about
Nigga, don't play with me, I got a wife, I got a baby to feed
I got a mama to spoil, I got a brother, got a few legal fees
I got a daddy and shit, medical bills, credit to fix
People to pay, label to run
You play with your life if you play with my funds, nigga

Got me stressed (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I don't wanna rest (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Smokin' cigarettes (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
Get it off my chest (oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I don't wanna stress (whoa)
But I can't help it thinkin' if I lose the rest (oh, whoa)
And I can't help it, I don't wanna stress (oh, whoa)
But I can't help it, yeah (oh, oh)
No, no, no

Old sweats, road, jets, tote TECs, no flex
Bad bitches, no let's, on deck, broke, next
Pill popper, square niggas bare witness (oh)
Blunt twisters, fuck niggas (oh, got me stressed, oh)

I've been stressin' 'cause I still ain't buy my dad a house (stressin')
I've been stressin' 'cause my girl said, "We can't work it out" (got me stressed)
I know some people that start sinnin' soon as church get out (church get out)
And I don't think like I used to think, 'cause I'm older now (older now)
When you broke, you doin' more for less (yeah)
You ain't findin' no success (no success)
Sad to say my girl just left, and I really love her to death (I do)
Told her I can't call her my ex
'Cause I feel like we ain't finished yet (we not done)
I just text her phone and I said, "Are you out your feelings yet?"
And my brother, he just called, he need that lawyer money (that lawyer money)
They said he did it, but I know he didn't (nah)
But you need O.J. money when you tryna get acquitted (yeah)
This shit is sickenin', nobody listen when you in prison (prison)
I was hangin' on the corner, with some Jordan's on, no designer (no designer)
Servin' up that white girl, back then we called her "Fine China" (yeah)
I was lookin' for a bad bitch
But I didn't know where to find her (where to find her)
All this pressure and this stress made me a diamond (diamond)
I'm just tryna show love, some people never grow up
Sometimes I wish I could trust, but that's how feelings get crushed
I used to ride on the train, I used to ride on the bus
They wanna hang with the gang, but no, they not one of us
