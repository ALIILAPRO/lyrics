		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a moment
Right before all the singin' ends
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
There ain't gonna be another chance

It's not gone until
(All that I have)
And everything's still
(One more hour)
Minutes erasing

Whatever I've done
I did it for love
I did it for fun
Couldn't get enough
I did it for fame
But never for money
Not for houses
Not for her
Not for my future children
Until now

How could I love again?
How could I ever ask for more?
And to the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
(Lose her) how could I love again?
(Move her) how could I love this path for sure?
(Don't)
(Lose her) with no more time to spare
(Move her) I know the answer more and more

As long as I can
Long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
Long as I can
Be the man I am

Oh, life is strange
One more hour
I could wait
One more hour

As long as I can
As long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
As long as I can
Remember who I am
As long as I can
As long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
As long as I can
Be the man I am

Just a minute, batter up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute, babe
One more hour and you know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go through here
All these people said we wouldn't last a minute, dear
I'm with you and I can roll into another year
Just a minute, batter up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute, babe
One more hour and you know your life is one to share
Just a minute, baby, right before we go through here
All these people said we wouldn't last a minute, dear
I'm with you and I can roll into another year
Just a minute, batter up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute, babe
