		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rainy day every day
Go away, go away
I'm not afraid, I'm praying
For despair, for despair 

 Welcome to my down town, behind the mountain
Where the stress is a style of your life, man
Fear is all you know all you want is gold
Everyone is fall for this money, bro 

Have you ever been afraid of a night time
For your soul, for you hapiness, for your life
When you talking to yourself there is no time
Just remember, this is life you dont (knew?) cry 

 Rainy day every day
Go away, go away
I'm not afraid, I'm praying
For despair, for despair 

 I see the rise in the mirror
Take my hand i can help you to find ourselves in this limbo
And now i can go, forget it detail
When i falling down i run away in compton 

I was so far in my whole map
In mellow homie close eyes, say my love untill a better times
No matter what a kinda feeling inside me
What i know in this world in an dark light tend 

Da dee Da dee Da dee day
I can dying every day
If i cannot see your face again
And shape of natty fance 

On the moon
Please dot rules
Our mummies
In this room 

(Why?) you're stressed In a bloody lips
Looking for your side of list
Hungry kiss
When a tingle hapinness. God bless! 

You know what it is
Are you come for this?
You know what it is
Are you come for this? 

 Rainy day every day
Go away, go away
I'm not afraid, I'm praying
For despair, for despair
