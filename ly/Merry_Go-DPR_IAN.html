		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Night drives
Session one, part two

Broken down headlights
My car is down again
I think I missed your flight
You know I'll long the boring nights
We used to rock
Just remembered I was at the spot
Unknown dead ends
We were all that, you know I'll long

I must have passed out last night
I'm still fumbling
With your memories
About the last time we tried
When our worlds were falling
Away from us

I know, I know
Oh, I know
I know, I know
Oh, I know

Now here you are
Alone again
And it spins me right around this
Merry go

You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done (go)
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me
Merry go

You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done (go)
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me

The fire drowns me inside
Now darling I'm a mess
And I've been here too many times
Just to know I'll miss your

Boring nights we used to rock
Just remembered I was at your spot
Unknown dead ends
I want it all back on this
Merry go

You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done (go)
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me
Merry go

You don't know what you've done to me
You don't know what you've done (go)
You don't know what you've done to me
And now you got me

Have I made it any further
Told you I was being nervous
You know I didn't mean to murder
The moments had with you

Now I left you for the show
Told myself I'm better off alone
Never been the same since I let go
Don't you know it sends me back around this
Merry go
Merry go
Merry go
Merry go, oh
