		  Nice legs, Daisy Dukes makes a man go 
That's the way they all come through like 
Low-cut, see-through shirts that make ya 
That's the way she come through like 

'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know 
How to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L-O-V-E's just another word I never learned to pronounce
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out
Now, L-O-V-E's just another word I never learned to pronounce

Tight jeans, double Ds makin' me go 
All the people on the street know 
Iced out, lit up make the kids go 
All the people on the street know 

'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down
'Cause I just set them up, just set them up
Just set them up to knock them down

I think I should know 
How to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L-O-V-E's just another word I never learned to pronounce
How do I say I'm sorry 'cause the word is never gonna come out
Now, L-O-V-E's just another word I never learned to pronounce

Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
I got my gun cocked tight and I'm ready to blow
Push it baby, push it baby, out of control
This is the same old dance that you already know

I think I should know 
How to make love to something innocent without leaving my fingerprints out
Now, L-O-V-E's just another word I never learned to pronounce
