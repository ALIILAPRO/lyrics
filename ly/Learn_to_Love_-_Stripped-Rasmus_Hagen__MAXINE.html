		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're skin to skin paper thin
How did I lose control
A strangers heart
So close to mine
It's hard to hold on when

It rips and it cuts, and it hurts when you trust
How it feels when you think that you're not good enough I could leave you right now and maybe I'll be fine
But I'll regret for the rest of my life

With every touch you make it burn But I'm ready to learn to love
With every kiss you make it worse But I'm ready to learn to love
You, you- I'm ready to learn to love You, you- I'm ready to learn to love

It's dangerous
To tear down walls
And I lay my life in yours
Fingers crossed we
Get across
So hard to hold on when

It rips and it cuts, and it hurts when you trust
How it feels when you think that you're not good enough I could leave you right now and maybe I'll be fine
But I'll regret for the rest of my life

With every touch you make it burn But I'm ready to learn to love
With every kiss you make it worse But I'm ready to learn to love
You, you- I'm ready to learn to love You, you- I'm ready to learn to love

I never thought it was possible to be myself with somebody else Pick me apart and then build me up so I can stand stronger again

With every touch you make it burn But I'm ready to learn to love
With every kiss you make it worse But I'm ready to learn to love
You, you, I'm ready to learn to love
