		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you said
Leave your keys on the counter
And you said
Call me back at eight
I don't care
That you left me there for hours
But you said
We had what it takes

Why's it feel, like you're there
When you're already gone
Why's it feel, like you care
When I know that you don't
Everybody needs a chance at love
That's all we need
If you wanna have a chance at us
Then try with me

Too proud for love, he tells me
Too hurt to give it one more shot
Don't drawl me in, he warns me
But now it's too late to give up

So don't say
You'll leave your keys on the counter
And don't say
You'll call me back at eight

Why's it feel, like you're there
When you're already gone
Why's it feel, like you care
When I know that you don't
Everybody needs a chance at love
That's all we need
If you wanna have a chance at us
Then try with me

Don't say a word
If you know that it hurts
You know that it hurts
You know that it hurts

Don't say a word
If you know that it hurts
You know that it hurts
You know that it hurts

Why's it feel, like he's there
When I know that he's gone
Why's it feel, like he cares
When I know that he don't
Everybody needs a chance at love
That's all we need
If you wanna have a chance at us
Then try with me

Oh, then try with me
Oh, then try with me
Oh, try with me, oh

Don't say a word
If you know that it hurts
You know that it hurts
You know that it hurts

Don't say a word
If you know that it hurts
You know that it hurts
You know that it hurts
