		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

Love's fever comin' on strong
I don't want the fire without the flame, no
Mother Nature gave me two hands to hold you
I'm not talkin' pressure or material gains

M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I'll never understand what peoples heads are in, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do 
Just a little love
Just a little lovin', this will do 
La-la-la-la
Just a little lovin', this will do 
L-O-V-E, love
Just a little lovin', this will do

Love's karma, so glad you're mine
I don't want your rhythm without your rhyme, no
Easy feelings, ooh, your love keeps getting better
Say you'll leave me never and together we'll fly

?Cause M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my bones that you and I can win, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do 
Just a little love
Just a little lovin', this will do 
La-la-la-la-la-la
Just a little lovin', this will do 
La-la-la-la-la
Just a little lovin', this will do

L-O-V-I-N 
My baby
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do

L-O-V-I-N 
My baby
I need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do

?Cause M-O-N-E-Y never did a thing for L-O-V-I-N
I feel it in my third eye love will never end, oh
Ask me what I need

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'

I need your lovin', yeah
Just a little time

I need your lovin'
And that's the bottom line
I need your lovin'
Just a little time, this will do

Just a little lovin', this will do 
Baby, me and you, yeah
Just a little lovin', this will do 
I just need your lovin'
Just a little lovin', this will do
Just a little lovin', me and you

L-O-V-I-N
I need your lovin'
Just a little time, this will do

L-O-V-I-N 
My baby
I need your lovin'
Just a little time, this will do

I need your lovin'
I need your lovin'

Just a little time, this will do
Just a little time, this will do
Just a little time, me and you

L-O-V-I-N
My baby loves me and I love my baby back

Ha, is that enough love
