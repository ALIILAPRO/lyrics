		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hum this, got it banging like a drum kit
Sun kissed, you don’t want this, you a dumb bitch
Fuck this, I ain’t coming to the function
My trouble a disease, motherfucker, you don’t want this
Goddamn, don’t be wishing me well
I ain’t boxing, motherfucker, but they give me the belt
Gin and tonic in my system, now I’m really myself
We don’t lose, so I’m handing every winner an L
But look around and tell me who done got the trophy
Lighting L’s so I’m telling you to hold me
Imma cause a little more than just a nosebleed
Stopped giving a fuck, and now I’m so free
Yeah, yeah
This a long trip
If you a pussy, don’t be tracking in your paw prints
Stir Sprite, but it’s feeling like the wrong shit
Getting rich, but that really mean a long- okay
Going stupid in the back, it never feel like a rental
I’m even dumber, if I listened when they told me I’m special
Yeah they shot me in a rocket till they sold me the metal
And then they told me what to do to make me fully a rebel, yeah
Break down, cuz I’m busy getting no sleep
Cool air broke, cuz you ain’t deliver no heat
Ooh shit, I got bridges to burn
That bitch a liability, I better get her insured, damn
No pay
So no shame
I touch down, UH
Like olé
No way, that I’m ever going both ways
It ain’t no game
I ain’t boutta fuck with no snakes
Haha, I welcome any rejection
I got a dollar in dimes, with me in every section
You could throw me down the church, you wouldn’t get a confession
Kill the beat and let me go because I’ve hidden the weapon, aye
If this is how it ends, I can make do
And if we talking trends, I’ll be late too
My family and friends, can’t even break through
And I’m a fan of revenge, so I can play too
I’m a psychopathic, and rabid-er maniac
And I’ll attack, if you don’t play me, and you save me for last
Better hand me all the cash, that had came in the bag
I got people running laps, while I’m breaking my back, facts
I’m in a zoo, but I can’t bear the sentence
Especially when I don’t know what their intent is
UH, we all slaves, but we wear a necklace
Yeah, and now I’m out, show me where the exit
