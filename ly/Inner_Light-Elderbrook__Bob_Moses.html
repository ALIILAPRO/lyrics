		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing tired
On your feet
Lightest head
Just like me

You wanna dance
I wanna lead
A sleight of the hand
That you never see

You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light

You count on me
You count on me
You count on me

I can fly
I can breathe
And learn to sing
Like do-re-mi

So you wanna dance
And you wanna be
A bat out of hell
Follow my lead

You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light
(You count on me)

You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes, just follow the inner light
(You count on me)

So follow
Me to
Our old life

Falling
Deeper
Into the light
Into the light

You wanna dance
I wanna lead
A sleight of the hand
That you never see

You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes just for the inner light
You count on me

You wanna dance
You don't know how to get it on the floor
Then don't hold back for anyone
Close your eyes just for the inner light

You count on me
You count on me
You count on me
