		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up one morning to know that I had gone
Finally taken the step and jumped right off the wall
When you come to call on me that's why my eyes are glazed
I've been with the devil in the devil's resting place
I am loathed to say that I have been to stay
I've been with the devil in the devil's resting place

When you ask to drink of me I think out on the case
Look down to my aloe cup and take myself a taste
Bitterness is thick like blood and cold as a wind sea breeze
If you must drink of me, take of me what you please
I am loathed to say it's the devil's taste
I've been with the devil in the devil's resting place

Water won't clean you, water won't clean you
You only hold yourself to the things you do

Come up here to speak to me and hold your face to mine
Any man can hold my gaze has done his job just fine
You just sold your life away to be with me tonight
Hold your head against my chest, I think you'll be just fine
I am loathed to say it's the devil's place
I go with the devil where the devil rests his face
I've been with the devil where the devil rests his face

Water won't clean you, water won't clean you
You only hold yourself to the things you do
You only hold yourself to the things you do
[x2]
