		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're drowning in our eyes 
Don't know what we'll find
I'm not sure, should we fly or fight this?
We're terrified

Pretending now that we don't care
But tension cuts, cuts the air
We're more than scared
I'm drowning in your eyes
I'm terrified

I don't know what's happening to me
Can you hear my pulse beat underneath?
Words are getting hard for me to speak
That's new for me

Letting my fears show 'til I can face 'em
Letting my tears go 'til I can taste them
Hell, what do I know where you and I go?
Damn it, I hope you come back home
(Ooh) come back home

It's hard to sleep at night when
It's do or die
While our world spins 'round and 'round and
We're paralyzed

Pretending now that we don't care
But tension cuts, cuts the air
We're more than scared
So lost inside our eyes
We're terrified

Letting my fears show 'til I can face 'em
Letting my tears go 'til I can taste them
Hell, what do I know where you and I go?
Damn it, I hope you come back home
(Ooh) come back home
(Ooh) come back home

I don't know what's happening to me
Can you hear my pulse beat underneath?
Words are getting hard for me to speak
That's new for me

Letting my fears show
Letting my tears go
Hell, what do I know where you and I go?
Damn it, I hope

Letting my fears show 'til I can face 'em
Letting my tears go 'til I can taste them
Hell, what do I know where you and I go?
Damn it, I hope you come back home
(Ooh) oh, come back home
(Ooh) oh, come back home
