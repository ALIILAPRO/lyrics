		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these holes of fear
Take my hand and stay with me my dear

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these holes of fear
Take my hand and stay with me my dear

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these holes of fear
Take my hand and stay with me my dear

I think you broke my heart again
Please don't leave and take my hand
Drowning inside these holes of fear (you knew before I did)
(Why you crying?) Take my hand and stay with me my dear
(Don't you know?)
(Yes, I know exactly)
