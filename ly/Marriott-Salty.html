		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a big pack room full of bitches, and it’s bigger than the Marriott, Marriott 
They all come to me
Nah, I don’t pay no fees
Big pack room full of bitches, and it’s bigger than the Marriott, Marriott
Painted white on feet
Yeah, you know what that means

Slidin’ down Mulholland 
Late night drives through the city, I just hit the strip club
Had to show some love
I'm in, and I'm outti 
Minutes they counting 
Got these bitches texting my phone pull up
After the club (After the club)
Yeah, they want fuck
(Haven’t had it in months)
Tell me Wassup
You know I’m only slanging after midnight

Who do you think about
When you're on your own
Sitting on your balcony, fresh in your robe
Who do you think about
One call away, yeah, you gone hit my phone

I got a big pack room full of bitches, and its bigger than the Marriott, Marriott
They all come to me
Nah, I don't pay no fees
Big pack room full of bitches, and its bigger than the Marriott, Marriott
Painted white on feet
Yeah, you know what that means

So make it make sense, yeah 
Afterparties to hotel lobbies 
Valet parking
In a rarri 
She excited 
riding shotty 
She excited riding shotty Ima bring her round town
Drop the roof
Ima stunt on my ex bitch
(Ex bitch)
I always level up I feel bad for my exes 

Who do you think about
When you're on your own
Sitting on your balcony, fresh in your robe
Who do you think about
One call away, yeah, you gone hit my phone

I got a big pack room full of bitches, and its bigger than the Marriott, Marriott
Big pack room full of bitches, and its bigger than the Marriott, Marriott
