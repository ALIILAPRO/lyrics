		  All of these bitches, they mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
All of these bitches, they mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh
Ooh, walk with a bag, ooh
Sad, ooh, sad, ooh, mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
Walk in the buildin', I flex on that boy
I flex on that boy with the bag, ooh
Ice on my neck and my mama like, 
"Boy, where you get all of that cash?"

I got a bag, ooh, ice on my wrist
Mama like, "Where you get this?"
I got a sad boo, gave her a brick
Then I gave her a lil kiss, ooh
Yeah, I rock out in the 6, 6
But nigga, we fire, we split
I'm takin' your shit, you college kid, ooh
We really be poppin' shit, ooh
I hit a lick, no kid, ooh
I had a lick but no bit, ooh
She suck me up like a tick, ooh
Damn my weed smell like a pick, ooh
He do that talk and he simp, ooh
Damn that lil got a lil thick, ooh
I told that bitch to come in
I told that bitch to come in

All of these bitches, they mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
All of these bitches, they mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh
I walk in the bank and I laugh, ooh
Ooh, walk with a bag, ooh
Sad, ooh, sad, ooh, mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
All of these niggas, they mad, ooh
Walk in the buildin', I flex on that boy
I flex on that boy with the bag, ooh
Ice on my neck and my mama like, 
"Boy, where you get all of that cash?"

Is you mad, or what

Girl that's bad for us
Say you mad for once
Said she had enough
Girl that's bad for us
She came back for once
Yeah it's probably done
She gon' back that up
I'm gonna spaz for us
Girl that's bad for us
Say you mad for once
Said she had enough
Girl that's bad for us

I guess you're not feelin' me
Not feelin' the energy
Baby girl, we can do plan A
Baby girl, we can do plan B, ooh

Walk in that bitch, eyes on the kicks
Walk in that bitch, eyes on the fit
I look at your bitch, then blow her a kiss
Mwah, ooh, I got that deuce in the coupe
Got a white bitch like YesJulz

Look at that boy, look at his jewels
All of my niggas, they're bool
Lil bitch, bleed in the booth
Ooh, these niggas, they lookin' like who

Hop off the plane, I run to the stage, yah
