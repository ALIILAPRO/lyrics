		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Martyrdom
Drowning now
I wash away
Truly one of a kind
Unbranded flesh, unsevered mind
Forced to suffer fools
I soar alone amongst the endless skies
Freedom is a right yet has a price
And I refuse to pay it
And I refuse to pay it
I will refuse
Martyrdom
Shatter now
I break away
From gagging breath, a simple plea
Exonerating
A lie will suffice
And I refuse to say it
And I refuse to say it
I will refuse
Days are growing shorter
My patience wearing thin
For every face that's starring back
Three are looking in
My patience wearing thin
Martyrdom
Vanish now
I fade away
Destroy my rights before my eyes
They must cover up
Destroy my rights then compromise
Its never enough
Destroy my rights then normalize
They're just acting out
And I refuse to fake it
I will refuse
Agreed upon, a common thought, they slowly start to grin
The knife that slit my back has found its way inside your skin
Martyrdom
Forced upon
I push away
Etched in stone
Carved alone
To commemorate my actions on this day
Commemorate my name
Color leaves your face tonight
Before the paint has time to dry
Unnoticed is the stench of the red soon flowing by
Air escapes your lungs
The silence slowly cries
My legacy will thrive before your blackened eyes
My legacy will thrive before your blackened eyes
Martyrdom
Punish now
Disintegrate
Disciplined
Diligent
Fueled now by results of hate
