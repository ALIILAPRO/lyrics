		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly

Get silly [Repeat: x8]
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly

My chain too silly
My wrist too silly
The girls throw me fish cause my rims big willy
My ride too silly
I ride too silly
We for fantastic hoes cause I got a deally
Cause now I'm I'm worth a million
Forget a rubber band cause you cant put a rubber band around a billion
I be wildin' on a island somewhere just like Gilligan
Drillin' holes like the dentist then I fill 'er in
I pop pop pop I'm the man girlfriend
I'm the reason why you wanna lose ya man girlfriend
I'm calm like the sea
I'm blow like the wind
And now that I'm straight I'm bout to act a fool again

Get silly [Repeat: x8]
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly

My shades too silly cause they made by cavalli
Jays so exotic you cant find em lil' buddy
I'm not nick cannon but I'm wildin' out clubbin'
Watchin' everybody jockin' while I'm poppin' somethin' bubbly

Poppin' somethin' bubbly
I'm tryna do it big
The boy from the A
I'm tryna represent
Them hater in my way
I play this game to win

Watch me take 'em to the alley knock some balls off like some pins
Drop drop drop I'ma sell like silly
Cause everybody dancin' and everybody feel me
With stacks in my jeans just like my name was filly
While I'm jockin' on you haters
Just like a pop-a-wheelie

Get silly [Repeat: x8]
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly

Get silly [Repeat: x8]
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly
The dance floor silly
The ladies goin' feel me
The fellas in the back and they twissin' up a filly
