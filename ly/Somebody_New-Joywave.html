		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With my eyes on the prize
Not a thing to my name
With my head in the clouds
And my body don't waste

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

With my eyes to the south
And my brain up in space
Flip my nervous hips around
I'm a step outta sync

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

(Don't wanna ever wake up)
(Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't)
(Don't wanna ever wake up)

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Don't wanna ever wake up
Next to somebody new

Don't wanna ever wake up
Don't wanna ever wake up, I don't
Next to somebody new
