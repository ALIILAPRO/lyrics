		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been years
Doesn't get any easier
Like they told me that it would
You still flow through my blood

And now I'm wondering
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long?
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long to still be thinking about you the way I do?

I wish you were here
I've been wanting to see you
Do you remember the plans that we drew?
And all that we have left to do?

And now I'm wondering
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long?
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long to still be thinking about you the way I do?
Should I be thinking about you the way I do?

And now I'm wondering
How long should it take to move on?
Just how long would you say is too long?

How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long?
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long?
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long?
How long should it take to move on?
How long would you say is too long to still be thinking about you the way I do?
Should I be thinking about you the way I do?
