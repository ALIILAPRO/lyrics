		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this smoking chaos, our shoulder blades kissed
I found you
I found you
I found you

I found you beautiful
I found you exploding
I found you

I found you
I found you
I found you beautiful
I found you exploding
I found
You

Beautiful
Exploding
I found you

Beautiful
Exploding
I found 
I found
I found you

Your head shakes out your heart
You're pulling yourself apart
With sweat bleeding down
I found you, ay
I found you
With the calm across your face
Look at the state you got this place
I was outside my mind
I found
I found
I found
(I won't deceive you Fred, I'm good)
You

Beautiful
Exploding
I found you
I found you
And I still remember

Beautiful
Exploding
I found
I found
I found
I found
I found you

I found you
I found you beautiful
I found you exploding
I found you

In this smoking chaos, our shoulder blades kissed
