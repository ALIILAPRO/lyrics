		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's callin' me in the dark

She moves, I swear the room around her lights up like the sky
Confidence like a rockstar

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight

I'm movin' to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight, tonight

I found you in my darkest hour
I found you in the pourin' rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your life brought me back again

Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you and the music played
I was lost 

'Til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

The night is gettin' older and I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end

I know she feels the same 'cause I can see it in her eyes
She says, "Can we start again?"

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight

She's movin' to the beat of my heart
We were so lost until tonight, tonight

I found you in my darkest hour
I found you in the pourin' rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your life brought me back again

Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you and the music played

I was lost (lost) 
'Til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

I said, people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light
And we all get low, all get low
Searchin' for that peace of mind
Just when I'd given up
Lookin' for some kind of sign

That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

I found you in my darkest hour
I found you in the pourin' rain
I found you when I was on my knees
And your life brought me back again

Found you in a river of pure emotion
I found you, my only truth
I found you and the music played

I was lost (lost, lost)
'Til I found you (found you)
