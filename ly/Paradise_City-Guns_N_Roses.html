		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home)
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (oh, won't you please take me home)

Just a urchin livin' under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags to riches or so they say
Ya gotta keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble when it's just a game
Ya treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doin' the time

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here I can't quite remember
The surgeon general says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah yeah

So far away
So far away
So far away
So far away

Captain America's been torn apart
Now he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said "turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losing my mind "are you blind?"
I've seen it all a million times

Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah yeah
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

I wanna go, I wanna go
Oh, won't you please take me home
I wanna see how good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
Take me down, lead me 'round
Oh, won't you please take me home

I wanna see, what a woman can be
Oh, won't you please take me home
I wanna see, what a woman can be (oh, oh take me home)
Take me down to the paradise city
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home
I wanna go, I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home, yeah baby
