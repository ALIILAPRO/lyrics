		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you and your friend come around?
Are you and your friend gonna get on down?
Will you and your friend come around?
Or are you and your friend gonna let me down?

If you talk to one another
I'm a hungry man
Let me know one way or the other
So I can make my plans

Will you and your friend come around?
Or are you and your friend gonna get on down?
Will you and your friend come around?
Or are you and your friend gonna get on down?

I relive the situation
Still see it in my mind
You got my imagination
Workin' overtime

Baby, baby
