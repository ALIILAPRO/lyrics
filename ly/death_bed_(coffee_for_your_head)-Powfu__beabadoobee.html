		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

Yeah
I don't wanna fall asleep
I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days

I don't know why this has happened 
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best 
But you know that I'm not perfect

I been praying for forgiveness 
You've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth
Hoping you'll find someone else

'Cause yeah, we still young there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family 
Watch your husband with his son

I wish it could be me 
But I won't make it off this bed
I hope I go to heaven 
So I see you once again

My life was kinda short 
But I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine 
It sucks that it's all ending

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed (yeah, ayy)
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed (ayy, yeah)

I'm happy that you're here with me
I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger 
You would always make me cheer up

Taking goofy videos 
While walking through the park
You would jump into my arms 
Every time you heard a bark

Cuddle in your sheets 
Sang me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays went to church 
On Mondays watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone 
Sorry that you have to lose me

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

Don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed

And I, don't stay awake for too long
Don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
I'll get you up and going out of bed
