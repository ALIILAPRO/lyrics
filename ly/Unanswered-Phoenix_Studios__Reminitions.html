		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How much must I curse your name
And put your beliefs to shame
Before you prove yourself
And end this life?
End this life
And I'll say a fucking prayer
Because I know it won't be answered
Where is your god?
Where is your god?
Where is your fucking god?
And even if I don't believe you
I pray for the day
I pray for the day
That you end this life
So please take me away
I want the hand of god
To come and strike me down
I want the hand of god
To come and strike me down
Where is your god?
Where is your god?
Where is your fucking god?
For all the prayers that go unanswered
For all the prayers that go unanswered
Why do you think that is?
For the families that waste their time
Open your eyes
And all your prayers will go unanswered
Why do you think that is?
For the families that waste their time
Open your fucking eyes
