		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were expecting a sweet rain
You got hit with a hurricane
Dark clouds, heavy debris
I know what it's like to love me

You lost your home in the storm
Baby, when I rain I pour

Sorry to displace your spirit

You're probably not ready to hear this

You gotta know wherever you go
I'll be right there beside you
When your heart breaks baby, when your earth quakes
Call me and I'll come to find you

You can't escape my love it's a hurricane

August of 83 Alicia came to wreck my city
Six days before I was born
I'd like to think that was some kind of warning

They say there's power in the rain
I find more power in my name

You gotta know wherever you go
I'll be right there beside you
When your heart breaks baby, when your earth quakes
Call me and I'll come to find you

You can't escape my love it's a hurricane
