		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you always
Have to hire actors
To play the devils
That talk me
Out of my
Sui-sites?

You're just a ring tone
That happens when
You get sick enough
To call the one
With bullet holes
Bullet holes for eyes

Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels

I broken open the box
When I spoke the spell
And I became
An entrance wound
To your bedroom grave
And I was paid
With the shadow of consensual rape

Your ransom note
Is quoted by
Your death and
Birth certificates
And all of your love
And all of your love letters
Read just like my will

Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels

I don't have to see 
To know that murderers
Are getting prettier
Every day
I don't have to see 
To know that murderers
Are getting prettier
Every day
I don't have to see 
To know that murderers
Are getting prettier
Every day

Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels
Fall on your knees
I hear the horrid voices
Of someone else's angels
