		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, Willy got the second kind of billing
Got me going on a cross-town village
You'll sing a song, I'll sing along
You've got it made now

You've got it made for Saturday, Willy
I'll be around
You've got the sound you've got the feeling
Get it on home, you've got
The song, get it on, Willy

Seven o'clock and you've got to be going
Go get the band, I'll be listen
Play me that song
You'll sing a song, I'll sing
Along, get it on, Willy
