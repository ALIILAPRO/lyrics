		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A little bit outrageous
And really quite contagious
We're gonna go around the world we crazy girls
We know we're gonna make it
I'll show you the way right now
Then we'll break out
And do anything we want

Oh oh oh oh
What'cha waiting for?
Oh oh oh oh
We're kicking down the doors
Oh oh oh oh
Gonna rock the world
Oh oh oh oh
You're gonna get the feeling
It's a matter of time
'Till the world gets in line
With Rock Angelz

Go on and be a hero
You've made it to the big show
Pretend that you could save the world today
And hey don't wait until your bedtime
Every dream is a giant step
To where you wanna go
And do anything you want

Oh oh oh oh
What'cha waiting for?
Oh oh oh oh
We're kicking down the doors
Oh oh oh oh
Gonna rock the world
Oh oh oh oh
You're gonna get the feeling
It's a matter of time
'Till the world gets in line
With Rock Angelz

We're all angelz
All angelz
Rock Angelz
Hold your head up high and
Reach the sky in our world
We're all angelz

Oh oh oh oh
What'cha waiting for?
Oh oh oh oh
We're kicking down the doors
Oh oh oh oh
Gonna rock the world
Oh oh oh oh
You're gonna get the feeling
It's a matter of time
'Till the world gets in line
With Rock Angelz
