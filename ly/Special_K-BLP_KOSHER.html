		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreidel man, I had to water
(Exquisite)
Water, ayy

Fuck a opp, that boy a bimbo
Getting low, they playing limbo
Tried to slice me, I went Kimbo
Opp hoes get turnt to widows
He was stretching shit for shitshow
Now he riding in a limo
I'm the fiddler on the roof, I'm sending fifty out the window
I used to work at Five Below but now I keep that fire below
Them hearts cold, it ain't melt
Robert Frost, it doesn't explode
Them boys up, to each it's own
They tried to slide, epic pwn
So if it's smoke then let me know
They dropped a post to postpone

Make 'em run, Tom Hanks
Every opp gon' walk the plank
In Coral Springs, masked up, I'm looking like I rob banks
(Dreidel man, water)
And I'm forever smoking Nazis, I'ma pass the blunt to Anne Frank
The same ones who switched, the ones who say watch who's around you
So open up, I'm making it out the sewers 'cause that's what clowns do
I put a hole in the wall, and I got bars too
.38 Special, that Special K got lots of carbs too
Said she like my drip, I told her water has a surface
Bloss him like a flower, I was serving multi-purpose
Playing Frogger, I was careless then I peeped I had a purpose
Kyle Rogger, I was sharing all my songs to AEPI
And I be rapping, Ee-I, but I don't owe you shit
'Cause where was y'all at when I was on my dick?
When you're the wolf in sheep skin, you might have to walk in sheep shit
Ain't no strawberry fields until you rich
He ducking, taco Tuesday, got the club going up
ILoveMakonnen like I'm Drake, bitch, let's get lit
And she like sucking toes, especially if they've been out here stepping
But I ain't really into all that shit
Water, ayy

Fuck a opp, that boy a bimbo
Getting low, they playing limbo
Tried to slice me, I went Kimbo
Opp hoes get turnt to widows
He was stretching shit for shitshow
Now he riding in a limo
I'm the fiddler on the roof, I'm sending fifty out the window
I used to work at Five Below, but now I keep that fire below
Them hearts cold, it ain't melt
Robert Frost, it doesn't explode
Them boys up, to each it's own
They tried to slide, epic pwn
So if it's smoke then let me know
They dropped a post to postpone
