		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stack them up 
This pile's getting harder to take
And I'll pull them down plate by plate
Enough, timeless habits need to break 
(break break break)

Tear me down
Coz you've learnt that I give a lot
Somehow, my patience is starting to wear off 
Enough, timeless habits need to break

And I'm sorry you got all dressed up
But I don't wanna go out
Maybe I don't wanna go with you

Fill me up 
To see how much I can take
My arms
Are heavy from holding up your weight
Enough, timeless habits need to break 
(break break break)
 
Burn a bridge
I'm never coming back from this
Huff and puff
And blow this house to the ground

There's nothing wrong with you
But you could treat me better
And all you have to do
Is treat me better
These days I find I can't get past the way that you're treating me
Cos all you have to do
Is treat me better

Now you're all dressed up and I don't want to go out 
Not with you

Could you ever treat me better 
Could you ever 

Treat me better
Treat me better
Treat me better
â€ƒ
There's nothing wrong with you
But you could treat me better
And all you have to do
Is treat me better
These days I find I can't get past the way that you're treating me
Cos all you have to do
Is treat me better
