		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be

Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell but I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
You love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it

Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kind of love
Push me and choke me 'til I pass out

We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

Push me down, hold me down
Spit in my mouth while you turn me out
I wanna take your light inside
Tear me down, snuff me out
Hands on my neck while you push it up
And I'm screamin' now

Give me tough love
Leave me with nothing when I come down
My kind of love
Force me and choke me 'til I pass out

We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (no)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh

Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no force for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Top of the world, but I'm still not free
This is a secret that I keep
Until it's gone, I can never find peace
Waste my whole life just to be

We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (no)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (oh), oh
