		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)

I'm confident I'll never run out of money
They pray that I fall but I kept it a hunnid (a hunnid)
Drop change on a bitch, girl, this bread on your bundles (it's bread)
And she fell back in love with my dick in her stomach
These bitches be clumsy and nosy and rummagin'
She didn't eat before she start drinkin', she vomitin' (eugh)
These niggas ain't eatin', they stomachs be grumblin'
Claim that they fastin' but no it ain't Ramadan (damn)
Keep puttin' out music but nobody cares
He did a show but wasn't nobody there (nobody)
Wanna be me but it's hard to be me 
Known to put on some shit that wouldn't nobody wear
My watch is icy I need a Moncler (burr)
If you run up you get done up right there (right there)
2019 try give me a Grammy and 2005 tried to give me the chair

Street nigga turned legal millionaire
I feel like a billion, one hell of a feelin'
She took a edible say it's incredible
Took off her shirt and start showin' her titties (showin' her titties)
Writers on strike and I know why they did it
Hollywood moguls be payin' 'em pennies
AI can't write the song Gucci would write 
'Cause AI didn't stay up all night in the trenches (hell nah)
I got a lick is you comin' or not?
All this free money they handin' it out
I told my artist to stick to the script 
They show love when you broke but they hate when you hot
I get two, three hundred thousand a feature
I robbed a bank with no mess it was legal
I took the cake and split it with my people
I dropped a classic than came with a sequel
Before it was legal we smoked like it's legal
Stood on the couch and turned over the speakers
And my promo team was the neighborhood geekers
My first Trap House album two naked shit eaters (eugh)
Young nigga listen, go get you some money
This shit won't be easy and I'm bein' honest
They gone talk down when they think it ain't workin'
But when you pop out they gon' all be astonished

I'm confident I'll never run out of money
They pray that I fall but I kept it a hunnid (a hunnid)
Drop change on a bitch, girl, this bread on your bundles (it's bread)
And she fell back in love with my dick in her stomach
These bitches be clumsy and nosy and rummagin'
She didn't eat before she start drinkin', she vomitin' (eugh)
These niggas ain't eatin', they stomachs be grumblin'
Claim that they fastin' but no it ain't Ramadan (damn)
Keep puttin' out music but nobody cares
He did a show but wasn't nobody there (nobody)
Wanna be me but it's hard to be me 
Known to put on some shit that wouldn't nobody wear
My watch is icy I need a Moncler (burr)
If you run up you get done up right there (right there)
2019 try give me a Grammy and 2005 tried to give me the chair

ATL Georgia, one hell of a place
You come for vacation but leave on probation (well, damn)
The way she keeps shakin' her ass with no waist
Shit ain't a game it ain't no recreation (not a game)
Her booty keep clappin' a standin' ovation (clap)
Told me to chill but I'm losin' my patience
Pussy like water and head is amazin'
I'm smellin' like money, she lovin' the fragrance (lovin' the fragrance)
Please call me Gucci but not call me Radric
He signed the contract than flipped through the pages
I fucked her and fell asleep that shit was crazy
The way she kept suckin' was makin' me lazy (damn)
Caught like three nuts so I'm callin' her Tracy
I made her dance so I'm callin' her Stacy (yoom)
Fuck a rich nigga you know that she braggin'
Her titties so perky, hell nah, they ain't saggin'
The moment look like she been draggin' a wagon
My homie so geeked said he's Megan Thee Stallion
Her ex-nigga broke he a dirty, be crabbin'
He make excuses but I make it happen
Started out trappin' but switched it to rappin'
My bitch is a addict addicted to fashion
I'm the one these niggas hate with a passion
My dog turned to snake, could've swore it was magic (well, damn)
