		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell by the way 
There ain't no lights in the windows 
And by the way your curtains hang 
Yeah, I know which way the wind blows 

I said no, I said no, I said no
Ain't nobody home (Nobody home)
Ain't nobody home 

You went away, with your heavy load 
You must have took it with you 
Down and out, to no fixed abode 
But no one can get you

I said no, I said no, I said no
Ain't nobody home (Nobody home)
Ain't nobody home 

I said nobody, nobody home 

From the way that you act 
I guess you haven't been there 
By the look in your eyes 
There's nobody been there 

I said no, I said no, I said no
Ain't nobody home 
Nobody home 

I said nobody, nobody, nobody home 
(Nobody home, Nobody home)

I said no, I said no, I said no no no
Nobody home (Nobody home)
There's nobody home 

I said nobody, nobody home 
(Nobody home, Nobody home) 

Ain't nobody home, nobody home, 
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
Nobody home
