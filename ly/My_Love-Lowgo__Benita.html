		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:
Same game but you don't
follow rules
Same team, but you wanna win solo
Patiently waiting like the fool
Cheering you on, cheering you on
Can't for you much longer
This loves feeling so one sided
Seems like, you already decided. where do I belong?
Cause every time I open up, you shut me out
Every time I try to get some more of you, you say that's enough Supposed to be easy, never this hard
Supposed to be love, but look what we got
Supposed to be us, but its more you first, then me.
Why you gotta be....
Pre Chorus:
Renegade
Why you?
Why you Gotta be, such a Renegade
Why vou?
Why you gotta be, Such a
Chorus: Renegade Yeah Renegade Yeah
Verse 2:
Can't say that I don't try,
Can't say that I don't give it all I got Give it evervthina I have, full stop Can vou say the same? Oh ah
I end up taking the blame, for
All of the fights that we have,
You are so unforgiving that I wonder if I ever had your heart
Wonder if we'll come together... wonder if a future’s what we have You're still stuck in the past, stuck in your ways
Still living for the old days
Living like the Wild West and yous’ a pioneer Thinking you're alone when I'm standing right here Maybe I should go, maybe that would make it clear. Why you gotta be, yeah yeah...
Pre-chorus:
Renegade
Why you?
Why you Gotta be, such a Renegade Why you?
Why you gotta be, Such a
Chorus: Renegade Yeah Renegade Yeah
