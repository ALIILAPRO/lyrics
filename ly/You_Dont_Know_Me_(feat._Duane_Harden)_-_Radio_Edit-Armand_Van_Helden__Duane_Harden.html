		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is my problem with men, you ask
No, I ask you what was man's problem with me

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

I don't ask for nothing
I'm always holding my own
Every time I turn around it's something
People talking about what they don't know

And when I try to move on up
They're always pulling me down
I'm tired and I've had enough
It's my life and I'm living it now

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you jude my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you jude my life

I always wonder why 
People try to hurt me
No happiness in their own lives
So they act out all their jealousies

Who are you to say that I'm living wrong
Always telling me what to do
I've decided I gotta be strong
What makes you think that I needed you
You don't know me

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

Who are you 
You say I'm not livin' right
Anything I try to do
You haven't walked in my shoes
I'm gonna move on
It's my life, it's my life
It's my life, it's my life
It's my life, it's my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life

You don't even know me
You say that I'm not living right
You don't understand me
So why do you judge my life
