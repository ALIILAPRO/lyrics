		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't move on, baby doll
Waitin' on calls, flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
And I'll take it all, baby doll
Whatever's been weighin' you down

Find me on Miami concrete
Lookin' for somebody different
'Cause my daddy was a pimp
My mama had her issues but I miss her anyway
Oh, baby doll
Please don't call me for the wrong reasons
We both know exactly what I'm thinkin'
Weeks pass and I never grow tired
'Cause I never said never and I barely ever lie
I'm on the road to an original place in outer space
I didn't make it up
But you can't find it on a phone or a globe
And I can take you with me if you really wanna go
Oh, baby doll, I can't move on

And I can't move on, baby doll
Waitin' on calls, flippin' through stations
I'm outclassed and it's outrageous
And I'll take it all, baby doll
Whatever's been weighin' you down
