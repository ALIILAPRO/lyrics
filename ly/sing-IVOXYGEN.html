		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you tell me why everything's falling
Cause I can't hold it no more
I don't want everything to break
Cause I am feeling so sore
My eyes are dry from the crying
And I can't even do that
I just want everything to end
So I can take it all back
I just wanna tell you where I've been
I've been out here partying with all my friends
They tell me your no good for me but when will it end
I'm looking at this paragraph just waiting to sin
I know it's never ending can we figure this out
You looking at me different
Like I'm changing but how
You made me turn to villain
Like I can't get out
Why I wanna wait
When I can get it now
Get it now
I'm tired of waiting
Like I'm falling apart
The lust in your eyes
Are like shooting stars
They falling to earth
Making me feel worthless
I did you better
Better
Can you tell me why everything's falling
Cause I can't hold it no more
I don't want everything to break
Cause I am feeling so sore
My eyes are dry from the crying
And I can't even do that
I just want everything to end
So I can take it all back
