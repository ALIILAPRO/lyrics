		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The light in the window is a crack in the sky
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back
The man in the dark will bring another attack

Your mamma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers
Look in the mirror, tell me, do you think your life's in danger here?

No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)

Another day passes as the night closes in
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin

I see the man around the corner waiting, can he see me?
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here

No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)

It's just a sign of the times
Going forward in reverse
Still, these were our first
It's just a hand in the bush
In the bush

So now that it's over can't we just say goodbye? (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say

I never wanted it to end this way my love, my darling
Believe me, when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here

No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)
No more tears (tears, tears)

It's just a hand in the bush
(In-in the bush, in-in the bush, in-in the bush)
(In-in the bush, in-in the bush, in-in the bush)
(In-in the bush in-in the bush)
