		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  MY SIMPLE HEART WILL LIVE AND LEARN
I TOOK A CHANCE
AT THE PRICE MY SOUL WOULD BURN

INSIDE MY DESIRE
I PUT THE QUESTION
DOWN ON MY KNEES
NO PRETTY THOUGHTS THAT WOULD SATISFY MY NEEDS
I NEED HOPE
GIVE ME HOPE
SO THEN I RUN FROM HOME IN SEARCH OF FRIENDSHIPS
THAT WOULDN'T LAST
'COS THEY WEREN'T RIGHT NOT LIKE YOU

YOU'RE THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD
KIND OF FEELING I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR AT LAST
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
SEE ME THROUGH
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY LOVE COULD BE SO TRUE

I'VE FOUND TRUE LOVE...
AND STANDING HERE THEY PASSED ME BY
THEY WERE WASTED
COLD AND EMPTY DEEP INSIDE


I WOULD HOPE
LET ME DIE HERE
AND YOU MAY ASK WHERE ARE THEY NOW-JUST LOOK
AROUND YOU
LIFT YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE CROWD
I KNOW NOW WHAT I DID'NT KNOW THEN
MADE ME RUN FROM HOME IN SEARCH OF FRIENDSHIPS
THAT WOULDN'T LAST
THEY WEREN'T RIGHT NOT LIKE YOU

YOU'RE THE BEST THING I'VE EVER HAD
KIND OF FEELING I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR AT LAST
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
SEE ME THROUGH
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY LOVE COULD BE SO TRUE

I'VE FOUND TRUE LOVE...

YOU'RE THE BEST THING
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
COME SEE ME THROUGH
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT ANY LOVE COULD BE SO TRUE

I'VE FOUND TRUE LOVE...
