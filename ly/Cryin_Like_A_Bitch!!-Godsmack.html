		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Strut on by like a king
Telling everybody they know nothing
And long-lived what you thought you were
And time ain't on your side anymore, anymore

And so you tell me I
Can't take my chances
But I've told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

I'm tougher than nails
I can promise you that
Step out of line
And you get bitch-slapped back
And you can run
Your little mouth all day
But the hand of god
Just smacked you back into yesterday

And so you tell me I
Can't take my chances
But I told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

And you wonder why
No one can stand you
And there's no denying
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch

Lying dead by your sacred faded past times
Only time is your enemy
Granted a second chance
To prove that your arrogance
Is stronger than you'll ever be
It's stronger than you can be

Oh, stronger than you can be
Oh, stronger than you can, be

And so you tell me I
Can't take my chances
But I told you one too many times
And you were cryin' like a bitch

And you wonder why
No one can stand you
And there's no denying,
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch
You were cryin' like a bitch

Oh, bitch
