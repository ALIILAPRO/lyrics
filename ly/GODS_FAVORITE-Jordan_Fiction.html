		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wonder what it must be like to be god's favorite
To take me as I am with all my flaws
No expectations
All I've ever been is all alone
Trying to find a place to call my own
Then once upon a time
Found love and fucked it up
Can't save it
I tried to trust my guts
Oh well, I spilled them on the pavement
All I've ever been is all alone
Run from any place I'd call a home

Beating, beating
Beating, beating
Bleeding, bleeding
Bleeding
My heart on my sleeve
Beating, beating
Beating, beating
Bleeding, bleeding
Bleeding
My heart on my sleeve

Sometimes I'm happy knowing I will never be god's favorite
It's so exhausting keeping up with people's expectations
All I've ever been is all alone (yeah)
In my head I make myself at home

Beating, beating
Beating, beating
Bleeding, bleeding
Bleeding
My heart on my sleeve
Beating, beating
Beating, beating
Bleeding, bleeding
Bleed
Bleed
My heart on my sleeve

My best friend is my imagination
Swallowed the key and I'm safe inside
Lonely I'm at the window waiting
Too strange to live but too rare to die

Beating, beating
Beating, beating
Bleeding, bleeding
Bleeding
My heart on my sleeve
Beating, beating
Beating, beating
Bleeding, bleeding
Bleeding, bleeding
My heart on my sleeve

My heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve
My heart on my sleeve
