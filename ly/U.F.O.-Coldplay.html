		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lord I don't know which way I am going
Which way, the river gonna flow
It's just seems that upstream, I keep rolling
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

Then at last, it's your right, I know, I swear
We'll find somewhere the streets are paved with gold
But it's fly, split the sky
But that's all right, sometimes
The sunlight comes streaming through the holes
