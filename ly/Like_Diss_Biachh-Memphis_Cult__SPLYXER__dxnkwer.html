		  Like this, biatch

Get buck, get buck
Get buck, get buck

It's that nigga MC Spade finna make and break a bitch
Smack a hoe upside her head and let her know my pimpin' thick
She gon' try to make it look as if you goin' out like a hoe
Never think twice bout a bitch 'cause when you pimpin' then you know
Don't get caught up in no women, bitches try to get yo head
Make and break and take that hoe and have that hoe stack in your bread
Rearrange the situation, go lock your door and think before
Always stay a step ahead and make her make your cash flow
Yeah mane, this piece shit 

Get buck, get buck
Get that bitch a beeper, nigga
Keep that hoe up on the call (get buck)
Let her know that what you seeing
Is going be best for both of y'all (get buck)
Take the money, leave her hanging
Pimp that bitch and get your shit (get buck)
Think that bitch gon' get my money
Mane fuck that shit my nigga please (get buck)
Runnin' game is what I do
Because pimpin' make my penis big
Disrespect my pimpin' nigga
I'm gon' have to split your wig
See I'm pimpin' making my money (get buck)
Making them bitches that's my jewel
Get your hoe up out my face
'Cause I'm gankin' these fools (get buck)

Get buck, this face 
Get buck, get buck
Get buck, get buck
Get buck, get buck
Get buck, face
Yeah mane, this piece shit
