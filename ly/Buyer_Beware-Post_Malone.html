		  Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm
Mm-mm

It's been a while since I burned incense
I use my lighter for a pack of twenty
I don't know where the fuck my Bible went
But I'm sure they'll forgive me

So please don't burn a hole in me
I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need
No one knows you better than yourself

So don't worry
You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar-store miracle
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all
So let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone
You're your own oracle, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all

So many restaurants in Beverly Hills
My favorite dinner comes in packs of twenty-four
I came home through the window sill
But I'm sure that she'll forgive me

So please don't burn a hole in me
I-I, I know it seems like they got what you need
No one knows you better than yourself

So don't worry
You shouldn't spend your money on a dollar-store miracle
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all
So let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone
You're your own oracle, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers even though I'm a know-it-all

Let it go, you'll never know, nothing's wrote in stone 
You're your own oracle, it's just a fuckin' poem
Sorry
Baby, I don't have the answers, shit, and maybe I know nothin' at all
