		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come to close to the flame and let it burn away the empty within you
Have me be your one shining turn
Your bridge between hope and despair
Cross from side to side more rapidly
’Til all defenses are broken through
Edge on closer to tragedy
Letting obsession turning you to
Something that feeds the monster in you

Natural born tendencies
Dancing a dance with fatality
There is a thin line between what is love, is hate, is pure insanity

Make your way to me your priority
Force breaking the fourth wall
Once you’re in you’ll become complete
Have me be the savior of all
Fantasize the world and what I should be
Only perfection can be true
One mistake and now you must hate me
For breaking the spell within you
Now I must pay for what I’ve put you through

Natural born tendencies
Dancing a dance with fatality
There is a thin line between what is love, is hate, is pure insanity

Is pure insanity

Natural born tendencies
Dancing a dance with fatality
There is a thin line between what is love, is hate

Natural born tendencies
Dancing a dance with fatality
There is a thin line between what is love, is hate, is pure insanity
We’re dancing a dance
Dancing a dance with fatality
