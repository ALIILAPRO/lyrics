		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh, huh, huh
Just let me tell you now
Uh-huh

When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd
But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me to take a second look

Oh, baby, give me one more chance (to show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms (I want you back) 
Yes, I do now (I want you back) 
Ooh, ooh, baby (I want you back) 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (I want you back) 
Na, na, na, na

Trying to live without your love is one long sleepless night
Let me show you, girl, that I know wrong from right
Every street you walk on, I leave tear stains on the ground
Following the girl I didn't even want around
Let me tell you now

Oh, baby, all I need is one more chance (to show you that I love you)
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh, darlin', I was blind to let you go (let you go, baby)
But now since I see you in his arms, uh-huh

Ah, buh bum, bum, bum 
Ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I want
Ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I need
Ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I want
Ah, buh bum, bum, bum
All I need

Oh, just one more chance to show that I love you
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)
Baby (baby)

(I want you back)
Forget what happened then (I want you back)
Let me live again

Oh, baby, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
(I want you back)

Spare me of this cause
Get back what I lost

Oh, baby, I need one more chance, ha
I tell ya that I love you
Baby (oh), baby (oh), baby (oh)
I want you back, ha
I want you back
