		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll put one in that chamber, lay you in the face of God
Know to be-face the fake fuck, aight
Fuck is a feelin' God, level I'm, feelin' odd
Fairily very Beverly Hill, Westside
Bitch, I'm drillin' your neighbor daughter at Best Buy
If I hit up your jack, then nigga, you best slide
If you totin' that pistol, nigga, you best ride
If you shoot that shit at me, nigga, I best die
'Cause I'm a muh'fuckin' narcissist
Tremble, you catch a clip bitch and you not equipped with that
Pussy boy, don't be talkin' shit
Or you can meet this AK-47, it got kick back
'Cause I'm a muhfuckin' martian, in the heart of a moshpit
Put that boy in a coffin, 'cause the way that he talkin'
Pussy boy, don't be gawkin', I ain't doin' no barkin'
I'ma let that shit rip, leave his ass in the parkin'

Fuckboy, don't test me
Fuckboy, don't test me
Fuckboy, don't test me
Fuckboy, don't test, boy, don't test
Boy, don't test, boy, don't test
Boy, don't test, boy, don't test, boy, don't
Ayy, yeah, ayy
Fuckboy, don't test me
Fuckboy, don't test me
Fuckboy, don't test me
Fuckboy, don't test, boy, don't test
Boy, don't test, boy, don't test
Boy, don't test, boy, don't test, boy, don't
Ayy, yeah, ayy
