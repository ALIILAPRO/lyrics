		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-huh
Helluva made the beat, baby
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh-huh

It's me again (hello)
It's me again (hello)
Ha, it's me again (hey, baby)
It's me again (hello)
It's me again (hello)
Ha, it's me again
I hear that, who that? (Huh)
We don't open doors, I'm askin' questions 'fore I do that (ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta)
Catchin' homi's where the zoo at, but you already knew that
Gator comin' for her troubles, so please, don't do that

A bitch frown her face 'cause she worry who I sit on (sit on)
I'm so well respected that that 'ussy gettin' spit on (spit on)
I quench the thirst so these niggas gettin' pissed on (pissed on)
And once again, I would not 'uck unless the dick long (huh)
It took me like six years to buy it
Now I'm up and my pockets is bias (uh-huh)
Bitches need alliance (grr)
I don't need no guidance (no)
Stand on mines, but I don't start riots (haha)
All about my cheese and my money (you heard)
I don't gotta ask my nigga if he love me (you heard)
Huh, don't disturb the peace when he numbin'
Here I come, here I come, here I come, big gator comin'

(Hello, hello)
It's me again (hey, baby)
It's me again (it's me again)
Ha, it's me again (hello, hello)
It's me again (hey, baby)
It's me again (it's me again)
Ha, it's me again (huh)
I hear that, who that? (Ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta)
We don't open doors, I'm askin' questions 'fore I do that (hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr)
Catchin' homi's where the zoo at, but you already knew that
Gator comin' for her troubles, so please, don't do that

Don't do that with my dog
They 'oot back by any means
Move in tact, hate I gotta tell 'em, "Use that gat" (ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta)
I was kickin' down doors while bitches was pickin' locks
Goin' blood 'bout me, I'm his little Megan Fox (huh)
Bitches know my bop and the twitch can't stop
Can't trust no bitch, should've offed Amanda Knox (ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta)
W-Well connected 'cause the hitters stay plugged in
Selfish little bitch, it ain't no way that I'll love him
Tell a bitch mind her biz if it was him
Said she doesn't like me for the fact that it's because him

(Hello, hello)
It's me again (hey, baby)
It's me again (it's me again)
Ha, it's me again (hello, hello)
It's me again (hey, baby)
It's me again (it's me again)
Ha, it's me again (huh)
I hear that, who that? (Ta-ta, ta-ta, ta, ta-ta-ta)
We don't open doors, I'm askin' questions 'fore I do that (hurr, hurr, hurr, hurr)
Catchin' homi's where the zoo at, but you already knew that
Gator comin' for her troubles, so please, don't do that
