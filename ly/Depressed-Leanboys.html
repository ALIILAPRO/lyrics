		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do what we do
What we do in our imagination
When I do what we do (uh)
What we do in our imagination (uh)
When I-
I don't understand it
Givin' my emotions and they take it all for granted
I can never trust another single woman on this planet
I give you the world and gauranteed
You would still take advantage of the, boy nigga damn it
I mean look at all the damage that you're leavin'
You can never find better, girl I mean it
The combination while your hair tied, but your head back
You ain't Christian but I still had you screaming, "Jesus"
I swear you'll never find a better nigga
But I'ma find a girl and that make it thicker
And you too busy taking selfies with niggas
You probably couldn't see the bigger picture
I regret every single text that I sent
And every little word that I said and time spent
You was just a hoe, I was too dumb to know
They say that love's a drug is guess I overdosed, damn
Do what we do (yeah, uh)
What we do in our imagination (yeah)
When I do what we do (yeah, uh, yeah, uh)
What we do in our imagination (yeah, uh)
When I-
Feeling it all
Swear I never thought that I would feel it at all
Yeah, something
Something new
Something new, yeah
