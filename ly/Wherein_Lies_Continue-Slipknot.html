		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thou shalt not
Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear
Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence, dominion
I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything

The ending's the same, the world will not change
The answer is clear

Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time
We can run, but we are tired of running
We're dropping seconds in a glass till we die
We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything

The ending's the same, the world will not change
The answer is clear? annihilation

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger then I was
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger better more

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves

I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate
Live forever? well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create
This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything
But my solace is I can handle everything

The ending's the same, the world will not change
The answer is clear, obliteration

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger then I
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger better

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger then I
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger better more

We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
We have to save ourselves
