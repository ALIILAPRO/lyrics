		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you shut the door
And close the curtains?
'Cause you're not going anywhere
He's coming up the stairs
And in a moment he'll want to see your underwear

I couldn't stop it now
There's no way to get out
He's standing far too near
And how the hell did you get in here
Semi-naked in somebody else's room?
I'd give my whole life to see it
Just you
Stood there
Only in your underwear

If fashion is your trade
Then when you're naked
I guess you must be unemployed yeah
But 'cause once it's underway
There's no escaping
The fact that you're a girl and he's a boy

I couldn't stop it now
There's no way to get out
He's standing far too near
And how the hell did you get in here
Semi-naked in somebody else's room?
I'd give my whole life to see it
Just you
Stood there
Only in your underwear

If you close your eyes and just remember
That this is what you wanted last night
So why is it so hard for you to touch him
For you to go and give yourself to him, oh, Jesus

I couldn't stop it now
There's no way to get out
He's standing far too near
And how the hell did you get in here
Semi-naked in somebody else's room?
I'd give my whole life to see it
Just you
Stood there
Only in your underwear, come on, come on, come on now

Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo, doo, doo
Oh yeah
I want to see you
Want to see you standing in your underwear, oh
