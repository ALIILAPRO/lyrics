		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the fire inside that burns so bright begins to grow faded
It can be hard to see the ground on which you stand
Though you may not be afraid of walking in the darkness
You will feel like a stranger in this land

You can try to carve a faith out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry out the bone
And the edges of the night may cause you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
Yeah, I'll always be with you

When the hope that you hold tightly to has all but vanished
And there are no words of comfort to be found
You will know what it means to be lost and without love
May you fight to kill that deafening sound

But our holy dreams of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breaking of the day might bring you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You can try to carve a faith out of your own
But a broken spirit may dry out the bone
And the edges of the night may cause you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow

But our holy dreams of yesterday aren't gone
They still haunt us like the ghosts of Babylon
And the breaking of the day might bring you sorrow
You know I may not be around this time tomorrow
But I'll always be with you
I will always be with you
I'll always be with you
I'll always be with you
