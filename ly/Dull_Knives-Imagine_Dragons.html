		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside I'm a mess but I don't let it show
We're just hanging on but you'd never know
I smile all day and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my life?
Is fleeting

Dull knives
Taking my life
A slow burn fire
From the inside
Dull knives
Twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sight, it's barely a spark
Holding on through, every night
Won't someone please save my life?
I'm crying for help, it's such a clich√©
Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save my life?
Is fleeting
No repeating

Dull knives
Taking my life
A slow burn fire
From the inside
Dull knives
Twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

Dull knives
Ripping from the inside
Spare me the ride

From the inside
Dull knives
Twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind
Dull knives
