		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The words are so familiar- 
All the same greats, the same mistakes 
It doesn't have to be like this. 
If you don't make a friend, now 
One might make you- 
So learn 
The gentle art of making enemies 
Don't look so surprised 
Happy birthday...Fucker 
Blow that candle out, 
We're gonnaa kick you 
[Don't say you're not because you are] 
[Don't say you're not because you are] 
[History tells us that you are] 
[History tells us that you are] 
All you need is just one more excuse 
You put up one hell of a fight 
I want to hear your very best excuse 
Never felt this much alive 
Your day has finally come 
So wear the hat and do the dance 
And let the suit keep wearing you. 
This year you'll sit and take it 
And you will like it 
It's the gentle art of making enemies 
I deserve a reward 
'cause I'm the best fuck that you ever had 
And if I tighten up my hole 
You may never see the light again 
[There's always an easy way out] 
[There's always an easy way out] 
[You need something wet in your mouth] 
[You need something wet in your mouth] 
Never felt this much alive
