		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me is your father a good man?
It's surprising how little, he seems to understand
His daughter was my savior
Sure, she can be a little indecisive
But I don't have to make her choose 'cause

This is how it goes
Watching it unfold (watching it unfold)
Playing my own role (runaway on 'em)
Dum-dum-ditty-dum-dum-ditty, daddy, don't
Make me leave this home
This is what you chose (this is what you chose)
I can't let him go (runaway on 'em)
Dum-dum-ditty-dum-dum-ditty, daddy, don't

In our house, the quiet is so loud
I'll never hear a single word, you wanna shout
Oh God, you're just a child
Oh, he can be a little too invasive
And I just want to live

This is how it goes
Watching it unfold (watching it unfold)
Playing my own role
Dum-dum-ditty-dum-dum-ditty, daddy, don't
Make me leave this home
This is what you chose
I can't let him go (runaway on 'em)
Dum-dum-ditty-dum-dum-ditty, daddy, don't

Tell me is your father a good man?
It's surprising how little, he seems to understand
His daughter was my savior
Sure, she can be a little indecisive
But I don't have to make her choose 'cause

This is how it goes
Watching it unfold (watching it unfold)
Playing my own role (runaway on 'em)
Dum-dum-ditty-dum-dum-ditty, daddy, don't
Make me leave this home
This is what you chose (this is what you chose)
I can't let him go (runaway on 'em)
Dum-dum-ditty-dum-dum-ditty, daddy

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
