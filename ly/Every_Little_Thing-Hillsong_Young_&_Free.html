		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every little thing

Your favour waits within the future
My dreams are small compared to Yours
Why should I worry 'bout tomorrow when I know
That all I gotta do is trust you, Lord

Every little thing is gonna be alright
Every little thing is gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know you will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Behind the scenes and in the details
You plan the perfect way for me
Why would I dwell upon the road's uncertainties
When all I gotta do is look to you
Yeah all I gotta do is look to you

Every little thing's gonna be alright
Every little thing's gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know you will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Every little thing
Every little thing, every little thing

Whether I can see it now
I know you will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright
