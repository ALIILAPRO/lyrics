		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun is hot and that old clock,
Is movin' slow, and so am I.
Work day passes like molasses,
In winter time, but it's July.

Getting paid by the hour,
And older by the minute.
My boss just pushed me,
Over the limit.

I could call him something,
Think I'll just call it a day

Pour me something tall and strong.
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane.
It's only half past twelve. But I don't care,
It's five o'clock somewhere.

This lunch break is gonna take
All afternoon, half the night.
Tomorrow morning I know there'll be hell to pay,
But, hey, that's all right.

I ain't had a day off now, in over a year.
My Jamaican vacation's gonna start right here.
If the phone's for me you can tell them
I just sailed away

Pour me something tall and strong.
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane.
It's only half past twelve. But I don't care,
It's five o'clock somewhere.

I could pay off my tab, pour myself in a cab,
And be back to work before two.
At a moment like this, I can't help but wonder,
What would Jimmy Buffett do.

[Jimmy:]
Funny you should ask Alan, I'd say
Pour me something tall and strong.
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane.
It's only half past twelve, but I don't care.

[Together:]
Pour me something tall and strong.
Make it a hurricane, before I go insane.
It's only half past twelve. But I don't care,
It's five o'clock somewhere.

[Alan:]
But he don't care, I don't care.
Together
It's five o'clock somewhere.
