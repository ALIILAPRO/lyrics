		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Woo)
Get it

In the mornin'
Don't say you love me
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door

I know your name is Rita
'Cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter
Since when I saw you down on the floor, guitar, woo

You won't need too much persuadin'
I don't mean to sound degradin'
But with a face like that
You got nothin' to laugh about

Red lips, hair and fingernails
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel
Let's go up stairs and read my tarot cards, come on, honey

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me, oh yeah

Stay with me
Stay with me
For tonight you better stay with me, oh, rock on
Oh-oh

So in the mornin'
Please don't say you love me
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door

Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home
You can even use my best cologne
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up, come on, honey

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with
Sit down, get up, get down

Stay with me
Stay with me
'Cause tonight you're gonna stay with me
Hey, what's your name again?

Oh no
Get out, woo
No, no, no
Woo
Get yourself home

Slow down, babe
Woo
