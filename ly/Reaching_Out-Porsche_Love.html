		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need you right here
No time for arguing
I see the light clear
I'll stop and drive you in
I'm feeling high lows
Live with my mind open
Steer with my eyes closed
Yeah, that's a bright omen
I've been thinking 'bout you lately
I can't even lie
And time's so precious, ain't it baby?
Who am I to cry?
I've been fiending for your love
And I've been dreaming every night
If you need me, call my number
I'll be there before you rise
I know you don't need me
But you know that I need you
And loving you's been careless
Yeah, I'm acting like a fool
I've been reaching out for nothing
You've been busy making moves
Yeah, I see you're up to something
So I'll leave you to your rules
There's a thought in my head
I've been really depressed
I've been moving all these mountains
Yet, I'm feeling the stress
Of the day to day that I go through
You don't know the half
So if I say something rude
Just know I'm dealing with that
But I've been thinking 'bout you lately
I can't even lie
And time's so precious, ain't it baby?
Who am I to cry?
I've been fiending for your love
And I've been dreaming every night
If you need me, call my number
I'll be there before you rise
I know you don't need me
But you know that I need you
And loving you's been careless
Yeah, I'm acting like a fool
I've been reaching out for nothing
You've been busy making moves
Yeah, I see you're up to something
So I'll leave you to your rules
Hi, come stop by my house
Drop in, not out
All the doors are open for you
Come stop by
All the doors are open for you
My house
I know you don't need me
But you know that I need you
And loving you's been careless
Yeah, I'm acting like a fool
I've been reaching out for nothing
You've been busy making moves
Yeah, I see you're up to something
So I'll leave you to your rules
There's a thought in my head
I've been really depressed
I've been moving all these mountains
Yet, I'm feeling the stress
I've been reaching out for nothing
You've been busy making moves
Yeah, I see you're up to something
So I'll leave you to your rules
