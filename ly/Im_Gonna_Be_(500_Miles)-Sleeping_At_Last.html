		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I wake up, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
And when I go out, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you

And when I come home, yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's coming home to you
And when I'm dreamin', well I know I'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you

But I would walk five hundred miles
And I would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When I'm workin', yeah I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's workin' hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass along every cent of it to you

And when I'm lonely, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's lonely without you
And if I grow old, well I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

But I would walk five hundred miles
And I would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door
But I would walk five hundred miles
And I would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door

When I wake up, well I hope I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's waking up to you
And when I'm dreamin', well I know I'm gonna dream
I'm gonna dream about the time I had with you
