		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me all your secrets
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
Days are getting longer
Nights are getting painful too
I've been feeling restless, oh
Feeling like I just can't sleep
So tell me all your secrets
'Cause you already know 'bout me

I have angels calling out my name
They say that everything is gonna be okay
I know I shouldn't worry about your pain
But that's just who I am

Tell me all your secrets
Tell me how you sleep at night
Knowing that I'm hurting
Knowing that you lost the fight
I've been feeling anxious
Feeling like I just can't breathe
Wonder how you're doing
You know you can talk to me

(Secrets, secrets, secrets)

So it's been a while now
Since I've dealt with all your blame
Don't mean to call you out now, woah
But I guess some things never change

I hear angels calling out my name
They say that everything is gonna be okay
I know I shouldn't worry about your pain
But that's just who I am

Tell me all your secrets
Tell me how you sleep at night
Knowing that I'm hurting
Knowing that you lost the fight
I've been feeling anxious
Feeling like I just can't breathe
Wonder how you're doing
You know you can talk to me

(Secrets, secrets, secrets)
(Secrets, secrets, secrets)
