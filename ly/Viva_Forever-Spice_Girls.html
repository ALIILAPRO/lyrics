		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you still remember how we used to be?
Feeling together, believing whatever
My love has said to me
Both of us were dreamers
Young love in the sun
Felt like my savior, my spirit I gave you
We'd only just begun
Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Yes, I still remember every whispered word
The touch of your skin, giving life from within
Like a love song never heard
Slippin' through our fingers, like the sands of time
Promises made, every memory saved
As reflections in my mind
Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever, I'll be waiting
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever, for the moment
Ever searching for the one

Back where I belong now, was it just a dream?
Feelings unfold, they will never be sold
And the secret's safe with me
Hasta mañana, always be mine

Viva forever (viva forever), I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting (everlasting), like the sun (like the sun)
Live forever (live forever), for the moment (for the moment)
Ever searching (ever searching) for the one (for the one)
Viva forever, I'll be waiting (I'll be waiting)
Everlasting, like the sun
Live forever (live forever), for the moment
Ever searching for the one
