		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This town don't feel mine
I'm fast to get away, far

I dressed you in her clothes
Now drive me far away, away, away

It feels good to know you're mine
Now drive me far away, away, away
Far away I don't care where
Just far away I don't care where
Just far away I don't care where, just far away
And I don't care

Far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away I don't care
Far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away I don't care
Just far away 
Just far away, I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away and I don't care where
Just far away, away
Said, far away I don't care where, far away
I don't care just where, just far away
I don't care just where, far away
