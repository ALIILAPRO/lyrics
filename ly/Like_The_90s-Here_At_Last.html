		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Posting pictures on her page,
I know she made her sister take,
Coffee no milk every day,
Even though she hates the taste,

Driving a hybrid so she can post about the climate,
Doesn’t stop her riding planes for weekend breaks,

She’s so different by herself,
You’d think she’s somebody else,
Blinded by the life she thinks she wants,

She only smokes at parties,
She dresses like the 90s,
In her mum's old blue jeans,
Spending daddy’s money,
You know she tries so hard but she never had me fooled,
I knew her before she was cool, it won’t last,
She only smokes at parties,

Yoga mat collecting dust,
The latest thing she’s dropped this month,
Swiping right to feel the rush, bad boys from the upper crust,
Says that she's basic so she can cover up the daydream,
What's it gonna take to feel like she's enough,

She’s so different by herself,
You’d think she’s somebody else,
Blinded by the life she thinks she wants,

She only smokes at parties,
She dresses like the 90s,
In her mum's old blue jeans,
Spending daddy’s money,
You know she tries so hard but she never had me fooled,
I knew her before she was cool, it won’t last,
She only smokes at parties
