		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you scared baby don’t look
Cuz here comes the lone wolf
Scared best you don’t look
Cuz here comes the lone wolf

Howl at the moonlight
The beast come you soon die
I've been killed left for dead now I’m back for they head
My revenge it is tonight

Been down for count and counted out
Was blocked and found a counter route
If you scared baby don’t look
Cuz here comes the lone wolf

Cuz here comes the lone wolf
Cuz here comes the lone wolf

No I don’t need no help or anybody else, Imma do it on my own (Yeah)
Cuz when I tried to ask near everybody laughed, had me feeling all alone (Yeah)
But truly now I’m grateful, cuz all of that hate fueled me into zone (Yeah)
Now I will never stop I’m coming for the top, bitch I deserve the thrown (Yeah)

I’m just being fierce and being feared
Cut right through your flesh the truth can pierce
Drown 'em in they blood I flood the pier
Must apply the pressure to my peers (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Suddenly they love me I’m revered (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Well you can suck my front and kiss my rear (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Sheep got all the wool up in their ears
They must not have heard the wolf is here

Howl at the moonlight
The beast come you soon die
I've been killed left for dead now I’m back for they head
My revenge it is tonight

Been down for count and counted out
Was blocked and found a counter route
If you scared baby don’t look
Cuz here comes the lone wolf

Cuz here comes the lone wolf
Cuz here comes the lone wolf

Fuck with me be careful, turn into a werewolf, hunt you late at night (Yeah)
All the doubters they're shook, they won't even dare look me straight into my eye (Yeah)
I've been moving solo, friendships that's a no-no, you can step aside (yeah)
I unleash the evils, I be going beast mode, bitch you won't survive (Yeah)

If you scared baby don’t look
Cuz here comes the lone wolf
Scared best you don’t look
Cuz here comes the lone wolf
