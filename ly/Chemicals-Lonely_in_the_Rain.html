		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say it’s done when it ‘s done but I run
Still chasing that moment
I never felt that way about someone
Like my chest was wide open
Now I’m trying my best to survive
But I see you in every sunrise
And my paper heart is on fire
Yeah I’m coming
I’m coming off your chemicals
Chemicals
I know it's only temporal
Sensual
But I still got you
In my blood
In my body
And I know it’s bad
But I want you back again
Oh ah eh ah
I want your body like
Oh ah eh ah
I want you back again
Oh ah eh ah
I want your body like
Oh ah eh ah
I want you back again
I wonder if you’re with somebody else
Do you take her to our spot
Was it easy to forgive yourself
For messing it all up
I keep trying my best to survive
But I see you in every twilight
And my paper heart is on fire
Yeah I’m coming
I’m coming off your chemicals
Chemicals
I know it's only temporal
Sensual
But I still got you
In my blood
In my body
And I know it’s bad
But I want you back again
Oh ah eh ah
I want your body like
Oh ah eh ah
I want you back again
Oh ah eh ah
I want your body like
Oh ah eh ah
I want you back again
