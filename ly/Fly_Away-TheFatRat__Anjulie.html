		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and fly away with me
Come and fly away with me
Come and fly away with me
Co-co-come and fly away with me

Come and fly away with me
Come and fly away with me
Come and fly away with me
Co-co-come and fly away with me

Don't you be afraid
Everything will change
You and I
Jumping off the edge
They say dreamers never die

So, come and fly
Come and fly
Come and fly away with me

We're rising, we're falling
We'll make it through
We're climbing, we're soaring
A thousand views

We're rising, we're falling
We'll make it through
We're climbing, we're soaring
A thousand views

Somewhere by the emerald sea
Where the moon and water meet
Somewhere close to harmony
When the world is sound asleep

Something's gonna bring the change
Journeys we are meant to take
Something at the edge of space
Calling us to fly away

Don't you be afraid
Everything will change
You and I
Jumping off the edge
They say dreamers never die

So, come and fly
Come and fly
Come and fly away with me

We're rising, we're falling
We'll make it through
We're climbing, we're soaring
A thousand views

We're rising, we're falling
We'll make it through
We're climbing, we're soaring
A thousand views

Come and fly away
Come and come and fly away
Come and fly away with me

Come and fly away
Come and come and fly away
Come and fly away with me

Something's gonna bring a change
Journeys we are meant to take
Something at the edge of space
Calling us to fly away
