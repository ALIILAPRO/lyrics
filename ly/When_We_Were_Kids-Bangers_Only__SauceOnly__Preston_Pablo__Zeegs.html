		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if we could rewind
I think I'd do it just to feel some things twice
I think I'd do it just to be with you one more night
But that's all in my head
But what if I could go back
Rewind the moments
Tell myself everything that I know right now
What would I know then
But that's all in my head that's all in my head

Maybe if time slowed down then I could figure out
All these thoughts in my head that keep running 'round
All these words in my mouth I can't get 'em out
But I'm trying oh I'm trying

Remember playing music way too loud
Neighbors always yelling to turn it down
Meet me at your window when the sun's down
Remember those nights oh I

Takе me back to when we wеre teens spillin' all our secrets getting cold feet bed sheets
Holding onto memories that we can't keep
It's better when we were nobody oh woah

Body on my body we would try so hard to keep it in
Hotel and lobbies you would always leave me feeling bliss
Out of all the things I know now
You're the most that I missed out
Remember all the laughs we had
If only we could really fly
And if I'm being honest
I wish we had called it

Falling in love like I swear it's no problem
But at times seemed to change when the trees turned to autumn
Yeah you packed all the bags you had
And I never seen you since five

Oh take me back to when we were kids
Smoking cigarettes pressing your lips on my lips
Dancing like nobody else was watching
Oh like nobody was watching oh oh

Oh take me back to when we were young
Ridin' through the city with no purpose up down
I wish time would stop and just stay frozen yeah
And I'd hold onto those moments oh oh

Take me back to
Take me back to when
