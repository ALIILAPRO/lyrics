		  (Not ok, not ok)

My last smile was a while ago
I can show you my fears and how wild I go
I got tattoo tears on my mind I know
That they're really my favorite 
Everything's changing 
Nothing stays the same, but the heart break 
Hole in my chest, can't see it but it's heart-shaped baby 
Pour pain in a champagne glass 
Seat belt for my feelings, 'cause I know it won't last with you

I'm not ok 
Excuse the screaming, I just thought you needed to know
I'm not ok 
Don't you worry, I've got everything in control
I'm not ok
I'm nervous, struggling to be perfect 
And that's ok
I'm hurting, and finally got the nerve to say
I'm not ok (one, two, three)

Ten miles down a winding road 
Tin-roof raindrops that remind me of you
Fourteen karat solid gold teardrops in my coffee
Look at what you cost me 
And I would leave it all in a heartbeat 
Found the lighter that you left in the car seat
(Yeah yeah)
I'ma set fire to the whole thing 
But it wouldn't do much 'cause I won't be over you

I'm not ok 
Excuse the screaming, I just thought you needed to know
I'm not ok 
Don't you worry, I've got everything in control
I'm not ok
I'm nervous, struggling to be perfect 
And that's ok
I'm hurting, and finally got the nerve to say

Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not ok 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not ok
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I'm not ok 
Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

I'm not ok 
Excuse the screaming, I just thought you needed to know
I'm not ok 
Don't you worry, I've got everything in control
I'm not ok
I'm nervous, struggling to be perfect 
And that's ok
I'm hurting, and finally got the nerve to say
