		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's complicated
Well not for me, but maybe for you
We're basically dating
But you say that you just got too much to do
You're compensating
Once called me babe now you're calling me dude
I told you not to do that

What you been doing?
Giving me basically all of your time
What were you thinking?
Telling your friends I'ma make this girl mine
I told you not to do that
If you're not gonna do that

Call me yours
Or don't bother calling at all
I've been way too good to you
Are you sure
That it's just the timing that's wrong?
What's hurting me is best for you
Give me every piece of you or give me nothing
'Cause I'm not tryna be friends who are almost something

My reputation
Making you think that I'm way used to you
Like I've been waiting
For somebody hiding me as if I'm nothing to lose
Not a single post on my birthday
I guess to you it's just another Thursday

Call me yours
Or don't bother calling at all
I've been way too good to you
Are you sure
That it's just the timing that's wrong?
What's hurting me is best for you
Give me every piece of you or give me nothing
'Cause I'm not tryna be friends who are almost something

Call me yours
Or don't bother calling at all
Yeah I've been way too good to you
Are you sure
That it's just the timing that's wrong?
What's hurting me is best for you
Give me every piece of you or give me nothing
'Cause I'm not tryna be friends who are almost something
