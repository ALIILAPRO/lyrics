		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go back I want
So bad to hold you back
It's all I've said and done
Fall in, be gone
I will stand, as I've won again
The reason for no more overnight

The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight

Slow down, never
I know now, I know better
I need it more than ever
Go back under
Hope that I found on the track
It's all I've said and done, overnight

The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
It's overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing it's overnight
