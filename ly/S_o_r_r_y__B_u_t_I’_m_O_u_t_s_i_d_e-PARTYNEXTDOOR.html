		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I shouldn't even be outside
I got somebody inside waitin' on me
And I'm playin' with their emotions, motions (motions)
Sorry, but I'm outside tonight

I might pull up to forty love with forty over
Watch the fuck if you know I don't love ya (know I don't cuff you)
Cold-blooded, but it's warmer than a oven
When I'm talkin' 'bout makin' love with (yeah)
These bitches wanna make sweet love to you, too
Damn, it makes me think that breaking up is stupid
Plus, you got two foreigns right outside of the crib
You could ride every day (you could ride)
You could ride this dick everyday that you needed
It ain't no secret
And my bad if I come back and you won't talk to me (my bad)
You told me a couple days ago you off of me (my bad)
I know you lyin', but I'm makin' it easier
And I know you find me, I should be home

I shouldn't even be outside
I got somebody inside waitin' on me
And I'm playin' with their emotions, motions (motions)
Sorry, but I'm outside tonight (I'm outside, I'm outside)

And I'm back on the block like it's hot
Pop the Hennessy, I didn't lie
Think I need a little bit more (bit more)
You don't know what it's like to be yours
And I ain't tryna blow up your spot
But, girl, you ain't wildin' out no more
Money keep pilling up for sure
You can take me out the dog house for sure
'Cause I'm tryna tell ya
I'm still your fella, Roc-a-Fella
Even though I'm no teller
And I'm outside the crib
With a couple bitches
Doin' dirt
Diggin' ditches
But I hope you only magnify my apologies
I'm standin' ten, ten with every part of me (part of me)
Carpe diem, I ice you out like every week, ayy, ayy
Bought the Benz', 'cause it's so hard to par with a freak
Yeah, yeah, all these bitches wanna fuck you (wanna fuck now)
I know you wanna fuck too
But you know what I been up to

I shouldn't even be outside
I got somebody inside waitin' on me
And I'm playin' with their emotions, motions (motions)
Sorry, but I'm outside tonight (yeah)

To forty love with forty over
Watch the fuck if you know I don't love ya (know I don't cuff you)
Cold-blooded, but it's warmer than a oven
When I'm talkin' 'bout makin' love with (yeah)
These bitches wanna make sweet love to you, too
Damn, it makes me think that breaking up is stupid

Look, I don't know what type of time you're on or what you really wanna do
But you're wasting my time, Jahron
Baby
No, I been doing this with you for so long
What you tryna say?
I'm tryna say I can't keep doing this
There's someone out there for you
And we love each other, but what are we doing?
Wait, what the fuck?
Jahron, you're not doing enough
You're the only nigga out here not focused on his bitch
You're not serious, man
Like, you're not getting any younger and neither am I
Wait, what are you talkin' about? You serious?
Jahron, I'm dead serious
Are you, are you talking to someone else?
