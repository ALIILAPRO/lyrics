		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We go together
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
We change the weather, yeah
I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me

I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (about you), about you (about you)
And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you (yeah)

Don't complicate it (yeah)
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
I can't remember
All of the nights I don't remember
When you're 'round me (oh, yeah, yeah)

I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (about you), about you (about you)
And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you, yeah

(I'm a sucker for you)

I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
You're the medicine and the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
And, baby, you know it's obvious

I'm a sucker for you (yeah)
Say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
I'm a sucker for you, yeah
Any road you take, you know that you'll find me
I'm a sucker for all the subliminal things
No one knows about you (about you), about you (about you)
And you're making the typical me break my typical rules
It's true, I'm a sucker for you

I'm a sucker for you
