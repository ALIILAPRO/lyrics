		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Across the sea to you, 
I've left myself deserted here again
Across the sea to you, 
My pieces are too broken now to mend

In the middle under a cold, black sky
The sun will only burn for you and I
In the moment before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything this time

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything

Across the world for you
My reasons have no reason to remain
I'd cross the world for you
I don't know what I'm doing wrong
But I can't stay the same

In the middle under a clear, blue sky
The sun can only burn for you and I
In the moment before I lose my mind
These hours don't mean anything this time

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything

Give me a sign
Show me the line
Maybe tonight

I'll tell you everything, everything
