		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ride in the shadows, wondering beyond the frame
Float like a feather through space and time outside a dream
Pirouette with divinity in a dance we've shared before
Someone dissolution
This is "I am all" as "I am none"
Here I fly so high, no, I, no coming down

Shedding weight as I'm coming undone
All that's left converging as one
I'm the sun
I'm the sun, yeah

I'm the God
I'm awake
I'm the one in everything
I'm alive
I'm the dead
I'm a man without a head

(I'm the God) I walk with death in final exhalation
(I'm the wake) and come apart through violent separation
(I'm the one in everything) a thousand floors ascend into the ether
A lunatic enchanted by the reaper
(I'm alive) and down below I leave a stranger laying 
(I'm the dead) lifeless as the light begins to shatter the skies
(I'm a man without a head) I ascend and leave behind the "used to be" 
And tear the fabric worn to cover my eyes (and see)
(I see, I see) nobody

Breath in the silence
Ebb and flow among the waves
Blur on the spectrum in like a dark an equal face
All I ever was, has been and always will be

Here I am as I'm starting again
Beyond death and borne on the wind
I'm the sun
I'm the sun, yeah

I'm the God
I'm awake
I'm the one in everything
I'm alive
I'm the dead
I'm a man without a head

A crack in the darkness
A tear in the sky 
(I'm the one in everything) and there the moment when we find ourselves
And all we occupy
Return to the boundless
Immerse in the free
Letting go as you lose your name
And all you've known to be

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody
