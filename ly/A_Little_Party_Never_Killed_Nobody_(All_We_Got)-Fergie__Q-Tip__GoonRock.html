		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got
Just one night all we got

I ain't got time for you, baby
Either you're mine or you're not
Make up your mind, sweet baby
Right here, right now's all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, mm
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got

Islands, diamonds, trips around the world
Don't mean a thing if I ain't your girl

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got (woo-ooh, yeah)
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop, mm
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got

All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we, come on
All we got
Goddamn

Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands and the room's a bust
At the end of the night, maybe you'll find love
Fake chit-chat of the things they got
And my stout reputation of keepin' it hot
At the party of the year and my master plan
Is you make me realize I'm your man

If the people get live underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this pic
Speakeasy, rockin' the feathers, I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, 'cause believe me, I'm a the bee's knees

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa, that ain't gonna fly, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah-ah-ah, ow
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa, that ain't gonna fly, no, ah-ah-ah, ow

Just one night's all we got
Just one night's all we got
Just one night's all we got
Just one night's all we got

What do you think, GoonRock?
Are you ready?

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop (let's go on)
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now's all we got (oh)
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon' dance until we drop
A little party never killed nobody
