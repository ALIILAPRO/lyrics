		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started with phone conversations and I
Flew out to see you, it's raining outside
We sat by the water and talked about life
Oh, said you lost your dad, girl I know how that feels
I lost my mom, tryna deal with that still
I guess we connect on our hatred for pills
It's real

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

You got me thinking things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from saying, "I miss you"
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself
You don't control me

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind

Laying in my bed, I'm just staring at the ceiling, baby
I just wanna know if you feel what I'm feeling, baby
Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately
Yeah, deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm a man of my word, girl believe that
I'm a closed book but somehow you learn to read that
Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Girl I wake up in the morning', all I can think of is you

I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby 
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind (don't you know, don't you know)
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind
I got you on my mind, I got you on my mind, oh yeah
Baby I got you on my mind, ooh yeah
I got you on my mind, baby
I got you on my mind, baby
Got you on my mind
