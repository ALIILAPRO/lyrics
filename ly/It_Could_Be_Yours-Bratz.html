		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The song playing on the radio
I said yeah yeah yeah
The voice talking on the radio
I said yeah yeah yeah
A plane ticket into Tokyo
I said yeah yeah yeah
A calm beach where the palm trees grow
C'mon say yeah yeah yeah

No matter what the dream is made of
That dream is not to be afraid of

It could be yours
It could be mine
It could be yours
It could be mine
It could be yours
It could be mine
At any given time

The front cover of a magazine
I said yeah yeah yeah
The cool image on the silver screen
I said yeah yeah yeah
A star printed in the walk of fame
I said yeah yeah yeah
A guitar rocking like a hurricane
C'mon say yeah yeah yeah

No matter what the dream is made of
That dream is not to be afraid of

It could be yours
It could be mine
It could be yours
It could be mine
It could be yours
It could be mine
At any given time

It's only real if you believe it
If you work hard you can achieve it
No matter what the dream is made of
That dream is not to be afraid of

It could be yours
It could be mine
It could be yours
It could be mine
It could be yours
It could be mine
At any given time
