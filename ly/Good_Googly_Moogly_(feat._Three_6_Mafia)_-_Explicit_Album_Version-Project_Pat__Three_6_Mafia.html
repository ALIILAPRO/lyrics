		  Hypnotize Minds Productions 
Presents 
(Yeah) New Project Pat 
Project Pat 
It's goin' down 
Aah 

Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 

She got a bubble gum cap with a Gucci dats snappin' 
With some rhino legs and a booty that's flappin' 
With some fire-oh head 'cause you know we love cappin' 
Got her toes done up with her fingernails matchin' 
Here dat big ol' butt that you're walkin' cross the street with 
Peep this, for a happy meal can I squeeze it 
Till it go pop, make the juice start to runnin' out 
Greasy lips, thick like a moose what I'm talkin' 'bout 
Them freaky freaks I heard on the loose, let ya pockets out 
Got trick niggaz watchin' your caboose with they wallets out 
You should stop, lil' somethin' somethin' bad to the bone 
That ain't a monkey hangin' off ya back that's Donkey Kong 

Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 

How you gon' prance around with all that, sayin' you ain't all that 
Everybody at ya wanna hit ya like a ball bat 
That thang make ya look back, be like man who is that 
You can see a hiny on a hiny I'm pursuin' that 
A dirty south hoody rat tryin' to hold goodies back 
Waist like a wasp, butt cheeks pokin' really fat 
I'm Crown Vic old school, squeezin' on her boo-boo 
Hugged up, pokin' in her brains so what ya wanna do 
Nice tats on ya body, liquor comin' out ya pores 
Weed stench ya ain't right, G-string for some drawers 
You can call me Mister Whipple, I won't do no harmin' 
Never to the Charmin, come holla at me woman 

Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 
Good googly moogly, that thang is juicy 

I'm a P-I-M-P with diamonds all in my teeth 
I step in the light man, my mouth be shiny 
A ghetto star in the street, the shoppin' and cuttin' the ki's 
They all wanna get with me, these girls be beggin' please 
They call me the Juice Man, I love a striptease 
A girl with a lot of ass, that's down to hit her knees 

Yeah, I beat that thang like it stole somethin' never let her hold somethin' 
Put the staff in her mouth, claimin' that she owe somethin' 
Show 'em somethin' mean on the scene 
When I first seen them jeans, teamed with that booty it's a dream team 
Make me go-go, up and down like a yo-yo 
But I had to pop her blue 
'Cause I'm on that Tonio Montana 

Goog google moogly, that thang is juicy
