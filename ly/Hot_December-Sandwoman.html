		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In hot December
We drove through the burroughs
Thinking of what we had done
My cards were showing
The Fates all knowing
Feeling like I had just won
In hot December
The ground was steaming
The flowers awake in their beds
No unbelieving, only a feeling
That colorful blooms must combust
I want for you
What I've always wanted for a love
And when it's time for you to leave
Be free like oceans do
In hot December
I remember
Holding you inside the room
Adorn you with blankets
Conform in a tight fit
The length of my spine onto you
I want for you
What I've always wanted for a love
What I've always wanted
I want for you
What I've always wanted for a love
What I've always wanted
And when it's time for you to leave
Be free like oceans do
Hot December
In hot December
I wonder what it feels like
Show me what It feels like
In hot December
Show me what it feels like
Show me what it feels like
In hot December
In hot December
Hot December
