		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody told me you were leaving, I didn't know
Somebody told me you're unhappy, but it doesn't show
Somebody told me that you don't want me no more
So you're walking at that door

Nobody told me you were cryin' every night
Nobody told me you were dying but didn't want to fight
Nobody told me that you fall out of love for me
So I'm setting you free

[Chorus]
Let me be the one to break it up so you won't have to make excuses
We don't need to find as set up where someone wins and someone loses
We just have to say our love was true but it never come alive
So I'm tellin' you I love you one last time
Then good-bye 

Somebody told me you still love me, I don't know why
Nobody told me that you only needed time to fly
Somebody told me that you want to come back when
Our love is real again

[Chorus]

Just turn around and walk away
You don't have to live like this
But if you'll understand and stay
Don't keep me waitin' for this final kiss
We can work together through this task
Or we can work through it apart
I just to get this off my chest that you'll
Always be in my heart, let ma be the one

[Chorus]
