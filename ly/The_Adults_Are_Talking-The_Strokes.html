		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They've been sayin', "You're sophisticated"
They're complainin', overeducated
You are saying all the words I'm dreaming
Say it after me
Say it after me
They will blame us, crucify and shame us
We can't help it if we are a problem
We are tryin' hard to get your attention
I'm climbin' up your wall
Climbin' up your wall

Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're tryin' hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same as you

You were waitin' for the elevator
You were sayin' all the words I'm dreaming
No more askin' questions or excuses
Information's here
Here and everywhere

Don't go there 'cause you'll never return
I know you think of me when you think of her
But then it don't make sense when you're tryin' hard
To do the right thing but without recompense
And then you did something wrong and you said it was great
And now you don't know how you could ever complain
Because you're all confused 'cause you want me to
But then you want me to do it the same way as you, and, but

I don't, I don't want anything
I know it's not, it's not your fault
I don't want anyone
Always I do, it's not for you

Ah
Ooh

Stockholders
Same shit, a different lie
I'll get it right sometime
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight
Oh, maybe not tonight

Hello?
Yeah, boy, here we go
And a-one, and a-two, and a-three
Here we go, friends
Hold on, I can't-
Maybe that's kooky situation
So, let's go back to the old key, old tempo, everything
Okay
