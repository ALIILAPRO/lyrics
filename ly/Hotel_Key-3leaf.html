		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suitcase, waiting in the lobby
Everyone is calling, but I'll be back at 3
Ace of spades stays hidden in the briefcase
If I'm forced to play it, I'll have no money
Cause the odds don't seem so low
When the sun holds place, and the street lights glow
I've been here all my life
But I don't see how this could keep happening
It's my time to roll the dice
Shuffle the deck, lose a side bet
But I'm not paying
I think there's a hole in my jeans
No, I can't leave Vegas like this
But I hate to say that
I lost my hotel key
If the cards in my hand fail me
Maybe the queen of hearts will save me
From flushing all my last chips away
But now that I'm locked from my California king
I'm drifting sideways for a new place to stay
Corner store at midnight, I think it's worth it
That neon open sign is begging for my service
In disbelief, every new spot has no vacancy
And I'm stumbling off of cheap wine
Shuffle the deck, lose a side bet
But I'm not paying
I think there's a hole in my jeans
No, I can't leave Vegas like this
But I hate to say that
I lost my hotel key
Once in a while, I forgot how this felt
Barely awake, is this bad for my health?
Shuffle the deck, lose a side bet
But I'm not paying
I think there's a hole in my jeans
(I think there's a hole in my jeans)
No, I can't leave Vegas like this
But I hate to say that
I lost my hotel key
