		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is nothing I can do
As you leave me here to cry
There is nothing I can do
As you leave me here to cry
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

Give you all that I own
That's one thing you can't deny
Give you all that I own
That's one thing you can't deny
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

Gonna leave it up to you
So long, so long, goodbye
Gonna leave it up to you
So long, so long, goodbye
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by

Gonna leave it up to you
So long, so long, goodbye
Gonna leave it up to you
So long, so long, goodbye
You know my love will follow you
As the years go passing by
