		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it all melts down I'll be there

Talkin' to yourself in the bathroom
Losin' your mind in the mirror like you have to
Ooh

Screamin' in your car in the driveway 
Spinnin' out think your life's going sideways 
Ooh

One broken glass turns to total collapse 
Just know this too shall pass
I'm tellin' you now, tellin' you now

Woo
When it all melts down I'll be there 
Woo, woo
When it all melts down I'll be there 
I'm tellin' you now, tellin' you now

Sleep is so thin, outta habit
Hard to tell the real from the dreams you imagine
Ooh 

Nights when one broken glass turns to total collapse 
Just know this too shall pass
I'm tellin' you now, tellin' you now

Woo
When it all melts down I'll be there 
When it all melts down (woo) 
When it all melts down now (woo) 
When it all melts down I'll be there 
I'm tellin' you now, tellin' you now

When there's wolves on your track (wolves on your track) 
Catchin' up fast (catchin' up fast)
Baby, don't you look back (don't you look back)
Don't you look back (baby, don't you look back)
When you're hittin' a wall (hittin' a wall)
And every star falls (every star falls)
Don't you worry at all

Woo
When it all melts down I'll be there 
When it all melts down (woo) 
When it all melts down now (woo)
When it all melts down I'll be there 
I'm tellin' you now, tellin' you now
