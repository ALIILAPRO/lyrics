		  How you gonna, mm-mm, mm-mm

Tryna show out for the Gram
That's what we doin' now? (Doin' now)
Tryna act like you the man
Like you can do without (Do without)
You was just up on my line
Like, "Can we work it out?" (Work it out)
You done got around them niggas
Now you showin' out

Like I wasn't just in your bed, ayy
Chillin' all in your crib, ayy
Like you ain't give me head, ayy
Baby, don't front like that, ayy
Like I didn't hold you down
Like I didn't make you drown, ayy
Baby, don't switch up now
I just wanna know how

How you gonna front on what we had?
Like we wasn't with each other every day
Like you weren't callin' me bae
How you gonna act like I
Ain't have you sprung?
I thought we built a bond they couldn't break
So you tellin' me it's fake?
How you gonna act-

Like you ain't thinkin' 'bout me right now
Boy, don't play if I told you pull up on me
You'll be on your way
Don't try to act like you don't love me
I can tell by how you fuck me
You say you over me, you're bluffin'
Boy, you know that you was just in

You was just in my bed, ayy
Chillin' all at my crib, ayy (Oh)
Like you ain't give me head, ayy
(You ain't give me head)
Baby, don't front like that, ayy
(Baby, don't front like that)
Like I didn't hold you down
Like I didn't make you drown, ayy
(Like I didn't make you drown)
Baby, don't switch up now
(Don't switch up now) i just wanna know how

How you gonna front on what we had?
(Front on what we had)
Like we wasn't with each other every day
Like you weren't callin' me bae (Oh, oh)
How you gonna act like I
Ain't have you sprung?
(Like I ain't have you sprung)
I thought we built a bond they couldn't break
So you tellin' me it's fake?
(So you tellin' me it's fake?)
How you gonna act?

How you gonna act?
Baby, don't front like that
How you gonna act like that? How you gonna-?
