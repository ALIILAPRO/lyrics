		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your heart and your soul
In the suit case
Get out of the city life get out of your place
Heading to the mountain
Heading to the sea
Live your life be free

Whoop woo
Low your car window let the wind blow in
Allow sunlight to come in and touch your skin
Smell the scent of dirt
Listen to the bird singing
Watch those pine tree dancing

This is the vacation time
It's time to slow down your life
Time to take a rest and relax
Time to run away from painful fact
This is the vacation time

Feel the grassland beneath your feet
Lay your body down and roll your weed
Try to get stone
Among the wind breeze
Heaven is the place that we will meet

This is the vacation time
It's time to slow down your life
Time to take a rest and relax
Time to run away from painful fact
This is the vacation time
This is the vacation time
