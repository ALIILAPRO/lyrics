		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been on the road, losing track of days
I pull you in while you pull away
It's like I always play to lose you
I saw your eyes filling up with tears
You pulled the plug and then you disappeared
This home has never felt so empty

Effortless, the way you left me
Cut me open with your own two hands (own two hands)
Breathing is so difficult to comprehend
When the air I breathe is taken from me

It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
There's no light, it's just dark
Feel my body growing numb
Watch me as I come undone

Is there relief in the misery?
Thought we would last an eternity
Forever I will feel this hollow
It's not enough to believe in me
And now I'm left with the memories
One day I'll learn to live without

Effortless the way you left me
Now the air I breathe is taken from me

It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
There's no light, it's just dark
Feel my body growing numb
Watch me as I come undone

A burial plot for you and I
Where we can both learn to die
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt

It's my fault that you're gone
There's no light, it's just dark

It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt
There's no light, it's just dark
Feel my body growing numb
Watch me as I come undone

A burial plot for you and I
Where we can both learn to die
It's my fault that you're gone
I've been digging in the dirt
Finding every way to hurt

A burial plot for you and I
Where we can both learn to die
