		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After the storm had passed
I wondered how long
The break in the clouds would last

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes
I wanted it for myself

I sit and I wait and I stare
Still wishing for a divine intervention
To lift me from my chair

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
There was something in your eyes
I wanted it for myself

You and I have come so far
We've reached beyond the farthest star
Time and time and time again
I want you back
You were a friend
We can't pretend

I saw something in your eyes
I'm sure
Oh baby I saw it
Something in your eyes
I wanted it for myself
