		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People buy views, I know it's old news
But also bad news for everybody
People buy views, I know it's old news
But I got bad news for everybody
Holy water is no juice, but I know us Jews
We don't like to lose to anybody
People buy views but I don't buy views
Don't turn on my fuse and watch your back

And watch your back
I'll break your neck
The pop can of Ironlak
And paint you black your name in black
The list I'm keeping, over packed
The others keep the numbers fake
And cut the ranks, so
Everyday I'm low until I blow
Digging hell like call me Dasha Snow
Money let the puppets run the show
Under radar calling me Jane Doe
Andale, my B, we have to go
See ya later, underrated, still it's me L.M.A.O
At the gate of Eden Garden I'll be on the speedy boarding
Tiny trolley with my slate in, clean and shining
But they don't mind it, you gotta chime in
Now they don't, they don't know what I keep in store
When I be counting big cash they be on the score
They don't, they don't know what I keep in store
Bye fools, buy views, touch wood, no
I don't pop with that
(I don't pop with that)
I don't pop with that

People buy views, I know it's old news
But also bad news for everybody
People buy views, I know it's old news
But I got bad news for everybody
Holy water is no juice, but I know us Jews
We don't like to lose to anybody
People buy views but I don't buy views
Don't turn on my fuse and watch your back

Wait, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
You ain't gettin views and I know ya jealous
Eight, nine, ten Milly like eleven
I'ma elevate the bread 'til we get to heaven

I gotta whole lotta cash
Blowin' it fast
Looking like I've stolen a stash
Whoa, I'm the best baby
Y'all lotta hate
Not getting cake
I can tell that you represent that fakeness

Yeah, shut the fuck up
I could tell your whole damn career is goin' under
Last year I heated up the winter like the summer
So this year I'm messin' up the budget

Now they don't, they don't know what I keep in store
When I be counting big cash they be on the score
They don't, they don't know what I keep in store
Bye fools, buy views, touch wood, no

Shit just hit the fan
(Shit just hit the fan)
Shit just hit the fan
(Shit just hit the fan)
Shit just hit the fan
Shit just hit the fan

People buy views, I know it's old news
But also bad news for everybody
People buy views, I know it's old news
But I got bad news for everybody
Holy water is no juice, but I know us Jews
We don't like to lose to anybody
People buy views but I don't buy views
Don't turn on my fuse and watch your back
