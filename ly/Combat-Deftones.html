		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time you get the finger pointed right at you
Which side are you on? Which side are you on?
I asked you what side you wanted on
Which side are you on? Which side are you on?

A waste of time
Don't believe
Can't decide to
Hit the ground
Make your mind
It's holding me
Down
And always did
Down
And all we get
Down

This time you think it pointed right at you
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
I asked you what side did you point it at?
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
On?
Huh?
Why?

A waste of time
We don't believe
Can't decide till you've
Hit the ground
Thank you much
If you don't believe
Can't decide
Till you 
Hit the ground
Make your mind
It's holding me
Down
I wanna get it
Down
And I wanna get it
Down
And I wanna get out

You don't think that I don't know
'Cause I do
Nice try
'Cause that's what you really got
Lie.
Lie.
Lie.
Lie.

That's something else
You say
You say you're something else
Decide
Whose side
You're on
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
C'mon
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
Whose side are you on? Whose side are you on?
Decide one
