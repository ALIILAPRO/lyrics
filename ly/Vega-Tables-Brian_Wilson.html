		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna be 'round my vegetables. 
I'm gonna chow down my vegetables. 
I love you must of all, my favorite vegetable. 

If you brought a big brown bag
Of them home, I'd jump up and down
And hope you'd toss me a carrot

I'm gonna keep well, my vegetables. 
Cart off and sell my vegetables. 
I love you must of all, my favorite vegetable. 

I tried to kick the ball, but my tennie
Flew right off. I'm red as a beet
'cause I'm so embarrassed. 

Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy. 
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy. 
Sleep a lot, eat a lot, brush 'em like crazy. 
Run a lot, do a lot, never be lazy. 
Da da da da

I threw away my candy bar and I ate
The wrapper. And when they told me
What I did, I burst into laughter. 

I know that you'll fee better, when you send us in your letter. 
And tell us the name of your...Your favorite vegetable.
