		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The underdogs are my lions
The silent ones are my choir
The women will be my soldiers
With the weight of life on their shoulders

Drink until you;ve had enough
I'll drink from your hands
I will be your warrior
I will be your lamb

Oh eh oh ah eh oh ah ah
Ah ah oh eh oh 
Till queendom come
Till queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come

The sea waves are my evening gown
And the sun on my head is my crown
I made this queendom on my own
And all the mountains are my throne

Drink until you've had enough
I'll drink from your hands
I will be your warrior
I will be your lamb

Oh eh oh ah eh oh ah ah
Ah ah oh eh oh 
Till queendom come
Till queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come

Ah oh ah
My queendom come
My queendom come
Oh oh 

I hunt the grounds for empathy
And hate the way it hides from me
Of care and thirst I have become
You have a home in my queendom
You have a home in my queendom
You have a place in my queendom
You have a home

Till queendom come
Till queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come
My queendom come

My queendom come
My queendom come
