		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You might been hurt, babe
That ain't no lie
You've seen them all come and go, oh
I remember you told me
That it made you believe in
No man, no cry
Maybe that's why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't want to lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

You've got no choice, babe
But to move on, and you know
There ain't no time to waste
You're just too blind, to see
But in the end, ya know it's gonna be me
You can't deny
So just tell me why

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you
You don't want to lose it again
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody
Guess what
It's gonna be me

There comes a day
When I'll be the one, you'll see

It's gonna gonna gonna gonna
It's gonna be me

All that I do, is not enough for you
I don't want to lose it
But I'm not like that
When finally (finally)
You get to love
Guess what? 
It's gonna be me

Every little thing I do
Never seems enough for you 
You don't want to lose it again (don't want to lose it)
But I'm not like them
Baby, when you finally
Get to love somebody 
Guess what
It's gonna be me
