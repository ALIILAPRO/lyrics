		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said fuck me
Now she saying do you even love me
You ugly
Bitch you only want my fuckin money
I'm cunning
Cunnalingus with a hoe that knows
Where she roams
Knows her place
Not my home
Fuck out my way
I'm crackin domes on the chrome
Im a yautja
Rippin out ya spine at ya home blood on the counter
Turn ya to a mime cut yo tongue out makin a fountain
Make it flowin red like gidora on the mountain
What the fuck you sayin to me
You know we're playing fo keeps
Right Ima play with her bean
Then go back aimin the beam
Sight
To ya face I
Will Neva change I
Will find a way I
Will make it rain, make it rain
If you’re tryna to find me
Then stare through the sun
Coming from a fucking place
Where there’s no where left to run
Facing everything you hate
And its never fun
I'm the one who wants your words
So I’ll cut out your tongue
Yeah!
Slimed that bitch with ectoplasm
Call me Danny phantom
Blast her with my yucky goo
Like what the fuck you gonna do
This year I need some saving
All the time that I’ve been waiting
Being patient
Tryna take my time to work on my creations
Gotta move,
While you kiss your bitch
My nut all up in her drool
Just to go and do this I went and dropped out of school
Lost my mind a of couple times but you know I'm still in tune
How the fuck you switching sides, looking like a buffoon
Im the one that you’ll need the most
Underestimating me
Til I’m biting out your throat
Don’t need no choppa or the stick blade’ll gut em like a goat
Tie em up shibari
Lighter with hairspray cook em like toast
Melt yo fucking face off
Ion need a chainsaw
Light a mothafucka up like charcoal
Now his brains charred
Guess I'm kinda fucking mean
And obscene
The lurking stalker I been watching in your dreams
