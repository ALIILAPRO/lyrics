		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go on, say it a little louder
Bet your mum couldn't be prouder
Puff that chest out big boy
Take your time, make your point

Tongue out, oh, I know you like that
How's that for you, any feedback?
I should be so lucky
If you'd only fuck me
Is this as good as it gets?

Call me crazy if you wanna
Make my clothes a little tighter
Think I left my body years ago 
Make some noise

I should be so lucky
If you only fuck me

Is this as good as it gets?
Is this as good as it gets?

You told me I was one in a million
I send you songs and you don't even listen
Said this time would be different
Is this as good as it gets?
Oh yeah
