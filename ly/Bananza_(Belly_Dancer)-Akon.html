		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza (hey, girl)
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon, girl
Do you have any idea what you're starting, girl?
You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Steppin' off, lookin' bootylicious and jingling
When you walk, I see it, baby girl
When you talk, I believe it, baby girl
I like that, thick, petite and pretty
Little touch of saditty
Love to work the kitty, like purr
She loves to stir it up (purr)
I can hear her purring up
'Cause she's the type that will get to 'rousing ya
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (oh no)
What's a plan without the Plan B?
We can meet up at the hutter house for the TV
So stand by like a buddy pass
While I watch this beautiful thing shake that

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Girl, I must say, you're the flyest thing in here (uh-huh)
You're so hot, we gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here (uh-huh)
Girl, you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it, girl, you look outstandin' (uh-huh)
And now you got me spending (uh-huh)
The way you got that body bendin' (uh-huh)
An ass like that, girl, you gotta be kickin' (uh-huh)
Have me goin' to church next day repenting
Lap dancing for my FA crew
Slide it over to Boo 'cause he want some too
Up in the VIP with no fee
Blessing you with the G even though we gettin' it free, so

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Girl, shake ya body, body
With somebody, body
Whatever you do don't break your body, body
After the party, party
Grab a hottie, hottie
In the back seat of your Maserati-rati
Jiggle jiggle it to the left (ah, ah, ah)
Jiggle jiggle it to the right (ah, ah, ah)
Jiggle it to the front then jiggle it to the back
And jiggle jiggle it all all night (ah, ah, ah)

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
