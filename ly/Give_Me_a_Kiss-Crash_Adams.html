		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes
I wish that I could just quit
But then the other times
There's nobody better than this
Even though you never listen
And you're always right
I guess I would've never fit your type
Except for that first night
We're two kids under that moonlight
We ate McDonalds at midnight
Became the best of friends
I remember our first time
In Barcelona
That morning I was so hungover
I never thought that all roads led to this
So give me a kiss
Sometimes
You say that I'm just too much
But then the other times
Feels like I give you the world and I won't give up
Oh I never listen
And I take too long
And I guess I would've never fit your song
Except for that first night
We're two kids under that moonlight
We ate McDonalds at midnight
Became the best of friends
I remember our first time
In Barcelona
That morning I was so hungover
I never thought that all roads led to this
So give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Except for that first night
We're two kids under that moonlight
We ate McDonalds at midnight
Became the best of friends
I remember our first time
In Barcelona
That morning I was so hungover
I never thought that all roads led to this
So give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
Give me a kiss
