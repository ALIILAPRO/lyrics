		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing's right, nothing's wrong
Just a feeling
I was right all along

If I tried to hold on, I'd be broken
I was there, but I'm gone

Holding out, holding on, unforgiven
I'll decide what I want
If I tried to move on, I'd be broken
If it's right, what is wrong

I confess I lost what we had in mind
We can't ever get back what we had in time

You once said your love wasn't worth it all
It's too late, late for this
I don't need my heart wanting any more
You can't wait, wait for this

You once said your love wasn't worth it all
It's too late, late for this
I don't need my heart wanting any more
You can't wait, wait for this

Nothing's right, nothing's wrong
Just a feeling
I was there, but I'm gone
