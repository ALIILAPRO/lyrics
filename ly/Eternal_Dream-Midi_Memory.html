		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Going down
From above
I will wait eternity for you
Going down

From above

we can go anywhere you want to
And when the time is right
We'll drive into the night
I'll never leave your side
No matter where we are
You are a part of me
I see you in my dreams
And when the lights go out
I know you'll still be here
No matter where we are
I know you'll still be here

Going down
From above
I will wait eternity for you
Going down
From above
we can go anywhere you want to

I will go where you wander
There's no other place to be
