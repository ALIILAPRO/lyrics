		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't go tonight
Stay here one more time
Remind me what it's like, oh-oh
And let's fall in love one more time
I need you now by my side
It tears me up when you turn me down
I'm begging please, just stick around

I'm sorry, don't leave me
I want you here with me
I know that your love is gone
I can't breathe, I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me that your love is gone
That your love is gone

I'm sorry, don't leave me
I want you here with me
I know that your love is gone
I can't breathe, I'm so weak
I know this isn't easy
Don't tell me that your love is gone
That your love is gone

(Don't tell me that your love is gone)
That your love is gone

Don't tell me that your love is gone
That your love is gone (gone, gone)

That your love is gone

I know this isn't easy (easy, easy)

That your love is gone
