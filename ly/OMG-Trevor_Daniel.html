		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? Look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
Shakira's hips don't lie, watching your silhouette move in the light
Don't got a type but I'm feeling the vibe
You're the type of girl I want by my side
Wish I could feel how I'm feeling tonight for the rest of my life
Somethin' between us, baby, I like it
I can tell by the way that you eye me
I-I don't like to wait, so baby, come on over
And I don't have time to waste, anticipation goin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
Oh, you got me asking God,""Please?
Can't she be my baby before I leave?""
Oh, you got me asking God,""Please?
Can't she be my baby before I leave?""
And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? Look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
And I'm like,""Oh my God, oh my God,"" shorty too fine
How you do that? look so bad without even tryin'
And for you babe, I'm crazy, I plead insanity
And honestly, we don't gotta speak, your body language I read
