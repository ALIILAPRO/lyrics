		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I feel it
I feel it in my bones
Baby, I feel it
More than you'll ever know

Something in the darkness that you hide
There's something that you don't wanna show
You're reaching for the light that you can't find
Well, I'm knocking at your door

If my eyes were closed
I could follow where you go
Give me highs and lows
Love me every way you know

Baby, I feel it
I feel it in my bones
Baby, I feel it
More than you'll ever know
You're just what I'm needing
I need it in my soul
Baby, I feel it
I feel it in my bones

Chasing all the shadows on your skin
Watching as they dance in the light
Tell me are your secrets worth keeping
I'll hold them 'til the day that I die

If my eyes were closed
I could follow where you go
Give me highs and lows
Love me every way you know

Baby, I feel it
I feel it in my bones
Baby, I feel it
More than you'll ever know
You're just what I'm needing
I need it in my soul
Baby, I feel it
I feel it in my bones (in my bones)

Baby, baby, I feel it (I feel it in my bones)
Baby, I feel it in my bones
