		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone
You dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long 'til I called you mine
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I pictured me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so movin' on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get what I want
Since you been gone

How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah
Since you been gone

How come I'd never hear you say
"I just wanna be with you"?
Guess you never felt that way

But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so movin' on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you
Now I get, I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again, and again, and again, and again

Since you been gone (since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so movin' on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get, I get what I want
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so movin' on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you (thanks to you)
Now I get (I get)
You should know (you should know)
That I get, I get what I want

Since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
