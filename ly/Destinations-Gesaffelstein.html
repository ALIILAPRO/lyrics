		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just a temporary slide back in the abyss
I shoulda seen it coming from miles away
Open-armed in a thick coat of structure
Shielding me from my own blades and dagger

There was a purpose upon the horizon
A destination
Tangible and fragrant

And I marched as I knew
And I marched as I knew
And I marched as I knew
And I marched with a thousand

It's not surprising I should find myself flailing
Having crossed the bridge of certainty
Back behind enemy lines with no work 'til Tuesday
I didn't even buckle to temptation
Guard down with little to do
I welcomed old habits like a long lost friend
To spite you

Egged on by weakening days
Giving themselves up to the strengthening menace of darkness
The shrinking hours of light are grey and feeble
The soggy trees sigh, dropping their leaves in defeat

The temperature falls
The big lights switch on
And from time to time
Fireworks frightened the cats
