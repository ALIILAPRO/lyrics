		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh no)

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
She was sitting at the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Would you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at a window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
Came into her apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

You've been hit by
You've been struck by 
A smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, but a black day
I could make a salutation
Sounding heartbeat, intimidation

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?

Annie, are you okay?
Would you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign at a window
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie
Came into her apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been struck by 
A smooth criminal

Annie, are you okay? (Oh no)
Would you tell us that you're okay? (Oh no)
There's a sign at a window (oh no)
That he struck you
A crescendo, Annie (oh no)
Came into her apartment (oh no)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (oh no)
And then you ran into the bedroom (oh no)
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay, you okay, you okay, Annie?
