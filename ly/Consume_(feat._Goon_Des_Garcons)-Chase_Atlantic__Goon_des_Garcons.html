		  本当は私 気づいていたんです
あなたが私を見ていてくれたこと
じゃあ リセさんも

Alright, alright, whoa
Why you pointing at me with that knife?
I've been cutting corners all my life, girl
But terror doesn't blossom overnight, no

She's running through the city in a rampage
Pressing on her fingers 'til the bones break
There's blood all in her nose from the propane
Bet a needle to skin will make the pain fade

Yeah, ah-ah
This is what I do, ah-ah
Take another bite, ah-ah
Big enough to chew

She said, "Careful or you'll lose it"
But girl, I'm only human
And I know there's a blade where your heart is
And you know how to use it
And you can take my flesh if you want, girl
But baby, don't abuse it
These voices in my head, screaming, "Run now"
I'm praying that they're human

Rollin' rollin, rollin' back your eyes to your mind, like
Oh, whoa, the pressure in the gland's tight
Yeah, whoa, yeah, it's either kill or be killed, like
Oh, whoa, the blood is either poured or it's spilt, like

Yeah, ah-ah
This is what I do, ah-ah
Take another bite, ah-ah
Big enough to chew

She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"
But girl, I'm only human
And I know there's a blade where your heart is
And you know how to use it
And you can take my flesh if you want, girl
But baby, don't abuse it
These voices in my head, screaming, "Run now"
I'm praying that they're human

Alright, alright, whoa
Love you but you cannot spend the night
Nah, I've been alone almost all my life, girl
And shit like that don't change up overnight
Sweet, I let you sleep in my tee (tee)
Tell me the things that you don't normally tweet (tweet)
Acid and LSD and smokin' blunts on the beach (beach)
69 down 69 so we can both get a piece, yeah
I've been cutting corners like my whole life
Backstabbing bitches tryna kill me with a whole knife
Day I die will be the only day a nigga ghostwrite
When I go they'll treat me like a god if this shit goes right

She said, "Careful, or you'll lose it"
But girl, I'm only human
And I know there's a blade where your heart is
And you know how to use it
And you can take my flesh if you want, girl
But baby, don't abuse it (calm down)
These voices in my head, screaming, "Run now" (don't run)
I'm praying that they're human

Please understand that I'm trying my hardest
My head's a mess but I'm trying regardless
Anxiety is one hell of a problem
She's latching onto me, I can't resolve it
It's not right, it's not fair
It's not fair, it's not fair
It's not fair, it not fair
Oh, no, no, no, ooh-ooh
Don't run, don't run
