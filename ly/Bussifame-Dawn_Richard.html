		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A second line is a dance
Where everybody is happy
And they're doing how they feel
They don't necessarily have any set steps to do
They're just getting down

Oh, this feel good
Turn me up
Hi-hats
Yeah
Uh
Bring the beat

She better do it lux, you getting the heat
Sound system like the wave, she riding the heat
Southern girls do it better, you take defeat
Setting up the ProTools, you take a seat

Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me

Louie on my vest, matching the seats
Gotta mean head but that matches heat
Hopscotching on you hoes, trick watch the feet
They tell me slow down, bitch never me

Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me

In case you niggas been missing that I been giving you hits
You been sleeping on bitches and been living to fit
I second line on you hoes, making new ways
That's what we do babe, and we do it our way, yeah

Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me, yeah
Feet, feet move with the beat
Feet, feet move with the beat
Buss it for me
Second line
Buss it for me
Second line
Buss it for me
Buss it for me
Buss it for me (go)

They never see me sweat 'cause I'm too cold
I got a big dick, make a deep throat
Swallow for a nigga, that's all I know
Put the foot work in, shit make it blow

You'll get your chance to move your feet, feet (ugh, buss it for me, buss it for me)
You'll get your chance to move your feet, feet (buss it for me, buss it for me)
Buss it for me
Buss it for me
You'll get your chance to move your feet, feet (buss it for me, buss it for me)
You'll (buss it for me)
You'll (buss it for me)
You'll, you'll, you'll
You'll get your chance to move your feet, feet
Buss it for me (ugh)
Buss it for me (ugh)
Buss it for me

Can you feel the pressure
Can you feel the pressure, yeah
Can you feel the pressure
Feel the pressure
Can you feel
Can you feel the pressure
Can you feel the pressure

Pressure
Pressure
Pressure, I feel
I feel
The pressure
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Pressure
