		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't have to speak
Don't need to talk to me
Baby, I already know

The shadows in your head
They've got you down again
Got you feelin' low

But it's time to rest, now
Let it all melt now
Wipe your tears

The sun's already set, now
Won't you go to sleep, now?
I'll see you in your dreams

'Cause I'm right here
Darlin', I'm right here
Close your pretty eyes, my butterfly
Baby, have no fear

The future's lookin' bleak
Your will to live is weak
But honey, hold on for me

I know that you're an angel
But it's not your time to fly, now
We need you here on earth

Stay right here
I'll stay here with you, my dear
Look up to the sky and know
I am still alive
Because you want me to be

Remember, my dear
You're strong
You're loved
You're beautiful, so beautiful
And you belong here on Earth
I love you
