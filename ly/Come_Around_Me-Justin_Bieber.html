		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me

Diggin' the way you feel on my skin
Got influence on me, can't comprehend
Oh no, next thing you're on top of me
Okay with this I call that a win-win

So, when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me

Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Put me down aggressively

Who taught you how to drive stick?
You a fool wit it
Love the way you fool wit it
And the way you motion
Motion in my lap
Love the way you move with it

So, when you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
When you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me

Let's not miss out on each other
Let's get it in expeditiously
All that I want for you is perfection
Put me down aggressively

When I rise up
Baby don't shy up
Open your mind
Don't knock it 'til you try it, darling
Show off
When you come closer
Don't waste no time
I love it when I'm in it, shawty

When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
So, when you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me

When you come around me
Treat me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me
So, when you come around me
Do me like you miss me 
Even though you been with me

(So, when you come around me)
(Do me like you miss me)
