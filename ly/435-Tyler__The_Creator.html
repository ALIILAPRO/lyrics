		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ayo
Ayo

I put the feline in my hair, looking like a chia pet
And you know they getting green, if a flower on their neck
If a flower on their neck, hit Clancy on the text
I ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?
I ain't gas niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand
Passionfruit in D.R., had me dripping in the sand
New nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands
Sticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams
They was playing at the grams, one nom' ain't enough
I'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again
Golf boys, it's them golf boys
In that 12 seater, wings looking like a hawk, boy
Getting to the paper, better re-up on the chalk board
Because the student turned into the teacher
Don't talk boy, class in session
1 through 5, I'm a 7
I'ma god, nigga, ask your reverend
And that crib in Bel-Air is heaven
Hot-coco outta chinas nigga pass the beverage, yeah
Comme Des on that hombre
Haters with the long face
New whip is Pirelli tire'd like a long day
Big dollars, the scent Prada
Skinny nigga also big poppa, women they adore me
If you see me out in public, no picture don't record me
I don't really fuck with y'all niggas, selfish at the orgy, uh

Bitch
One take, yeah
