		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't now the way I feel, oh no
Well, you think we're just friends
So I go along like nothing's wrong
But I know that is only pretense

I wanna be your lover
(I wanna be your lover)
I don't wanna be your friend
(Don't wanna be your friend)

Well, I don't know what to tell you, oh no
I just can't find the words
Cause there's so many things
That I wanna say
But I just don't know where to begin

I wanna be your lover
(I wanna be your lover)
I don't wanna be your friend
(Don't wanna be your friend)

You don't know just how much I love you
Though it's easy to see
Cause if you knew how much I love you
And maybe someday, well, you might love me

So I hope in time you'll love me, oh yeah
Love me as I love you
But if this can't be, I'd rather see
The whole thing come to an end

I wanna be your lover
(I wanna be your lover)
I don't wanna be your friend
(Don't wanna be your friend)

No, I don't wanna be your friend
(Don't wanna be your friend)
