		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're the underground
We're the lost and found
Never see the day
While we hide away (hide)
Soft spoken like a gun
At the top of my lungs
We're the underground
We never die

If you don't mind me
I won't mind you
The game is for two
Your first move
Igniting
I'll never lose
Lost hypocrites
Lies never quit
Avoiding the truth
So delicate
Hard to predict
So out of the blue

We're the underground
We're the lost and found
Never see the day
While we hide away (hide)
Soft spoken like a gun
At the top of my lungs
We're the underground
We never die

I've seen it
I mean it
I found the truth
They try to
Contain it
We set it loose
I'm sick of it
We're infinite
It's time to move
We're not the winners
But we'll never lose

We're the underground
We're the lost and found
Never see the day
While we hide away (hide)
Soft spoken like a gun
At the top of my lungs
We're the underground
We never die
