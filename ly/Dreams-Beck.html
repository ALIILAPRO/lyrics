		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on out of your dreams
And wake up from your reverie
Time is here don't go to sleep
Streets are running on the brink
They say that we've got nothing
But a dollar for a life of sin
'Cause there's trouble on the way
Oh there's trouble on the way
Get a dog and pony for a judgement day

Here we are
Running circles around around around around
When nothing's right just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams dreams dreams d-d-dreams oh oh 
She's making me high, she's making me high
Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
She's making me high I wanna get me free

Nothing gonna get me in my world

Now can these broken wings free me
About a light year from reality
If you want to fall in a dream
You could put the weight right onto me

Here we are
Running circles around around around around
When nothing's right just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams, dreams, dreams, d-d-dreams ohoh
She's making me high, she's making me high
Dreams, dreams, dreams, d-d-dreams oh oh
She's making me high I wanna get me free

Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world

Ah, stop fucking with my dreams dreams yeah
Ah, stop fucking with my dreams dreams yeah
Ah, here we are

Running circles around around around around
When nothing's right just close your eyes
Close your eyes and you're gone

Dreams, dreams, dreams, d-d-dreams oh oh 
She's making me high, she's making me high
Dreams, dreams, dreams, d-d-dreams oh oh
All day and all night, I wanna get me free

Nothing gonna get me in my world

I wanna get me free
Nothing gonna get me in my world
Nothing gonna get me in my world
