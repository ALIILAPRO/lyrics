		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  WAYLON:
It seems like yesterday, but it was a long time ago
She was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in the darkness with the radio, playin' low
The secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
There was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove
JOHNNY:
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it would never end
I remember how she held me oh, so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then
CHORUS (ALL):
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
But just running against the wind
WILLIE:
And the years rolled slowly past, I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
I found myself further and further from my home
I guess I lost my way, there were oh, so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worrying about paying or how much I owed
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules I could bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again
CHORUS (ALL):
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
I found myself seekin'
Shelter against the wind
WILLIE:
All those drifter's days are passed me now
I've got so much more to think about
JOHNNY:
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out
CHORUS (ALL):
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
Well I'm older now and still
Running against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
Against the wind
