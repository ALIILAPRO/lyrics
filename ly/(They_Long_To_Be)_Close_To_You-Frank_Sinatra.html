		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Close to you - I will always stay
Close to you - though you're far away

You'll always be near - as though you were here
By my side
No matter where - in my dreams, I'll find you there

Close to me - sharing your caress
Can't you see - you're my happiness

Where ever you go - my heart will go too
What can I do
It only wants to be - close to you
