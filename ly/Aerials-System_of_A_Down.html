		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fall

Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go, but you never want to stay

And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play but you never want to lose

Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river
Then we turn around and put up our walls

Swimming through the void, we hear the word
We lose ourselves, but we find it all

'Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go, but you never want to stay

And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play but you never want to lose
Oh

Aerials in the sky 
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize
Aerials in the sky
When you lose small mind, you free your life
Aerials, so up high
When you free your eyes, eternal prize

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
