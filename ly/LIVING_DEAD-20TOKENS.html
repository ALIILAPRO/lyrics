		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like living dead
I walk the dark streets
They drown in pain
Anxiety and cold winds
I hide my eyes
Just like a ghoul
Just slowly dying
Crucified by you
Like living dead
I drown in pain
Anxiety and cold winds
Like living dead
I'm slowly dying
Crucified by you
Crush my back with your stones
And then leave me alone
Infect me with poison
Won't change my mind, and you know
Nothing to feel
Nightmare is real
I can't resist
This spell on me
I'm high as hell
By words you say
I'm not sad
I just feel so dead
Like living dead
I drown in pain
Anxiety and cold winds
Like living dead
I'm slowly dying
Crucified by you
Of all things
To play with
You're choosing
My feelings
My weakness
Is meaningless
For all of
My demons
Of all things
To play with
You're choosing
My feelings
My weakness
Is meaningless
For all of
My demons
Like living dead
I walk the dark streets
They drown in pain
Anxiety and cold winds
I hide my eyes
Just like a ghoul
Just slowly dying
Crucified by you
Like living dead
Like living dead
