		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crawl
No
No

Nine hundred days turned into dust
Nine hundred days kisses all dried into rust
Nine hundred days doctors but nobody heard
Of nine hundred days stitches just for saving a bird

She danced along
The road I had drawn
With blood of my trust
I gave her all
Then I gave her more
I thought I had lost

No more can you see me crawling
No more can you see me crawling
I know you know what my feet for
I'm gon' use them for some walking

Nine hundred days that I try to forget
There are nine hundred days kisses to live to regret

Everyone knows
That everything goes
Back to the ground
Everywhere grows
What everyone sows
Now look what I found

More

No more can you see me crawling
No more can you see me crawling
I know you know what my feet for (when the rain comes)
I'm gon' use them for some walking (you'll be my shadow)
No more can you see me crawling (I'll be your arc)
No more can you see me crawling (when the rain comes)
I know you know what my feet for (you'll be my shadow)
I'm gon' use them for some walking (I'll be your arc)

No more can you see me crawling (crawl)
No more can you see me crawling (no)
I know you know what my feet for (more)
I'm gon' use them for some walking (crawl)

No more can you see me crawling (no more)
No more can you see me crawling (okay)
I know you know what my feet for (I gon' use them)
I'm gon' use them for some walking
