		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep believing we're not the same
You have not experienced the pain
To see you kiss some other lips
While I'm drifting under the fist
That life offers to the dreamers
Maybe I should be

I should be dancing dancing dancing
Until I fall between your lies
Dance and dancing dancing
And then I fall between your lies

You're just a ghost
In the future that we've lost
You're just a name
Tattooed on someone else's hand
I'm surely better on my own
Right in this shimmering hole
You're just a ghost and I am real
You're just a stone and I'm the wind
But it still burns, but it still kills

The future comes on sleeping pills

I should be dancing dancing dancing
Dance and fall between your lies
Dance and dancing dancing
Dance and fall between your lies

I should be dancing dancing dancing
Dance and fall between your lies
Dance and dancing dancing
Till I fall between your lies

Dirt's in my eye
But I won't cry
I've killed the pain
That lived inside
Please walk away my devil's dove
It's been a while
I need to love

It's not the day that falls
It's the night that rises
