		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
(Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, uh

Big percentage
Might not recognize me through the smoke 
And the tinted windows, I'm still in business
So every time niggas tryna say I changed 
I don't get offended, they wasn't even with me (no)
When I was gettin' mail from a cell 
Knowin' sentences couldn't change a sentence, I aged with visits
When I ain't write back, put dem lines into rap 
Got famous with it, now they payin' attention

Grew up in the struggle, I ain't really know much 
Except I ain't wanna end up in the same conditions
All my niggas diamonds and most did time on them chains 
You could say that I hang with pendants
And I don't wanna network 
Niggas workin' for a blue check on the net, tryna claim official
Between me and you it's a major difference
I wasn't ever in this for no recognition

I'm just makin' up for a lifetime of losses
Heart wanted help but my soul wanted vengeance
I just wanna turn the whole roster to bosses
Whatever it cost us, you know I'ma spend it
This for all them nights I was turnin' and tossin' 
For anybody crossed me I hate 'em like Chris
I'ma let em watch me but no they can't sit
Only got stand up guys in attendance, uh

Stand in the fire when I'm in it
I done hurt many of they pride and feelings
I'll let the whole world paint me a villain
Long as they know I ain't ever been pretendin'
Long as they know I ain't ever paint a image
I been gettin' more and each time I'm givin'
Long as they know when I die, can't nothin' come with me
I can't lose nothin' I'm winnin'

Uh, uh, oh, uh
What they wanna know about me? I'm winnin', uh
Mob in a crib by twenty, uh
None of these whips ain't rented
Uh, uh, oh, uh
What they wanna know 'bout me? I'm livin', uh
Bands in the cup I'm sippin', uh
Stand on my own, independent

Uh, uh, oh, uh
I ain't gotta show too much, I'm gettin' it, uh
Bread gettin' touched, quick digits, uh
More after more it's plenty
Uh, uh, oh, uh
They ain't gotta know much if they ain't with it, uh
I don't wanna hear no limits, uh
I remember pinchin' on pennies

Uh, uh, oh, uh
Mh, mh, mh, mh, mh, mh, mh
Yeah
