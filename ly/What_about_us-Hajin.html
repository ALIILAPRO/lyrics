		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you say the place
before we both liked it
Passed the bed time
you gave the halo away
Try to be okay be alright
Cause I I always break down
when you cry
What about us
We could have all
we could have all the things
we liked
Forget about that
When I lose control
I wanna see you again
What about us
What about us
Today
And I say it takes pills
to feel awaken
For a good time
you cant resist my array
Try to be okay I wanna say
Cause I Im always beat down
when you fly
What about us
We could have all
we could have all the things
we liked
Forget about that
When I lose control
I wanna hold you back
What about us
What about us
Today
I saw something wrong
When you just left the door
Im still here for you
What about us
We could have all
you could have all the things
you liked
Upset about that
When I lose control
I want to get you back
What about love
What about loss
What about lost
What about us
Today
