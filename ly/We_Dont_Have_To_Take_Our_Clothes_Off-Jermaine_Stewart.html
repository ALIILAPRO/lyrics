		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not a word, from your lips
You just took for granted that I want to skinny dip
A quick hit, that's your game
But I'm not a piece of meat, stimulate my brain

Night is young, so are we
Let's get to know each other better, slow and easily
Take my hand, let's hit the floor
Shake our bodies to the music
Maybe then you'll score

So come on baby, won't you show some class
Why you wanna move so fast
We don't have to take our clothes off

To have a good time
Oh no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine

Uh huh
We don't have to take our clothes off (no no no)
To have a good time
Oh no

We could dance and party all night (all night)
And drink some cherry wine
Uh huh
(Na na na na na na na)

Just slow down if you want me
A man wants to be approached cool and romantically
I've got needs
Just like you

Give me conversation
Good vibrations through and through
So come on baby, won't you show some class
Why you wanna move so fast

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no
We could dance and party all night (all night)

And drink some cherry wine
Uh huh

We don't have to take our clothes off
To have a good time
Oh no
We could dance and party all night (all night)

And drink some cherry wine
Uh huh
(Na na na na na na na)

So come on baby, won't you show some class
Why you wanna move so fast
We don't have to take our clothes off

To have a good time
Oh no
We could dance and party all night
And drink some cherry wine

Uh huh
We don't have to take our clothes off (oh no)
To have a good time
Oh no (oh no)

We could dance and party all night 
And drink some cherry wine (cherry wine)
Uh huh
(Na na na na na na na)
