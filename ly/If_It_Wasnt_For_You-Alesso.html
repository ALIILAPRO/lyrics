		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was alone
I was made of stone, you took me home
We built a world, a world for us
We flew like birds, a new beginning

It's better, better, better
You keeping me together, gether, gether
You know that I will never, never, never
Try to pull you down, down
Lover, lover, lover you can always be here
I'll take cover
You know that I will never, never, never
Leave you all alone
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you

I was a fool always keeping a distance
If I'd ever know, oh
You found a way, I thought I always stayed the same
Because of you, I saw a new beginning

It's better, better, better
You keeping me together, gether, gether
You know that I will never, never, never
Try to pull you down, down
Lover, lover, lover you can always be here
I'll take cover
You know that I will never, never, never
Leave you all alone
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
If it wasn't for you
I'd be nothing if it wasn't for you
Nothing if it wasn't for you
