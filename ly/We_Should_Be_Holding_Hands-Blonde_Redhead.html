		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in the dim light
Living in the dim dim light
There are people saying
It's going to be a long long night
So we should be holding hands

Living in the dim light
All around you and I
There are people praying
There are children saying
We should be holding hands

No one in the right mind
No one I have ever known
Was given light to begin
Finding out what we really are

Will there be stars will there be stars
Will there be stars on our crown
Will there be stars will there be stars
Will there be stars on our crown

It's never gonna be like
It's never gonna gonna be like
The way it's meant to be
It makes no sense to me
We should be holding hands
Will there be stars will there be stars
Will there be stars on our crown
Will there be stars will there be stars
Will there be stars on our crown

And if I only had
Just you in the end and no stars will be left on my crown
Then you will never see that much in me
If no stars will be left on my crown
