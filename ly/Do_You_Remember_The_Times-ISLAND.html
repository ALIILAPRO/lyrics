		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm a child
Just a kid with a butterfly in my hand
Tryna get up to the clouds where he likes it
Always looking up
Never looking down

Hey yeah, do you remember the times?
We said that the city was yours and mine 
Hey yeah, do you remember the times?
We'd forget the world and just stare at the sky 

And now I think about it 
They said at school we could be what we liked 
And I said I'd be a spaceship pilot
But life's a little different when I look around 

Hey yeah, do you remember the times?
We said that the city was yours and mine 
Hey yeah, do you remember the times?
We'd forget the world and just stare at the sky

Hey yeah, do you remember the times?
We said that the city was yours and mine 
Hey yeah, do you remember the times?
We'd forget the world and just stare at the sky
