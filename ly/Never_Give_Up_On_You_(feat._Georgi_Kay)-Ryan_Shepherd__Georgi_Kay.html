		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t like to sit in silence, any more than you do
But our words become our violence and I hope to keep you
Away from the danger and safe from the hurt
Cuz you say that love won’t save us
Nothing I don’t deserve

I don’t wanna say goodbye
Just wanna stay one night
Anything to make it right
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you

Do you try to run away, could you ever forgive me
And all the words I hear you say, they leave me feeling empty
Forgot in the darkness, so lost in the blue
Cuz you say that love won’t save us, but I’ll never give up on you

I don’t wanna say goodbye, just wanna stay one night
Anything to make it right, I’ll never give up on You
Can I bring us back to life, If our love is dead in the moonlight
There’s nothing I can do this time, but I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up

I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you
I’ll never give up on you

You can run but I follow, my heart is all yours to borrow
I hold on till tomorrow, my heart is all your to borrow
