		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Robin Hood and little John
Walkin' through the forest
Laughin' back and forth
At what the other'ne has to say
Reminiscin', this-'n'-thattin'
Havin' such a good time
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally golly, what a day

Never ever thinkin' there was danger in the water
They were drinkin', they just guzzled it down
Never dreamin' that a schemin' sheriff and his posse
Was a-watchin' them an' gatherin' around

Robin Hood and little John
Runnin' through the forest
Jumpin' fences, dodgin' trees an' tryin' to get away
Contemplatin' nothin' but escape an' fin'lly makin' it
Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally, golly, what a day

Oo-de-lally, oo-de-lally golly, what a day
