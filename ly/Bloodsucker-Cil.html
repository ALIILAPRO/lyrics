		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the way that you make promises
That you can't keep
How you tell a girl to rock your world
And shy into the sheets
You're calling me the girl of your dreams
Oh really? Honestly

Yeah, I think you're just a tease, you tell me that you're sweet
But I just see your bitter ridden insecurities
You say you serve to please, is that what you believe?
'Cause all I ever hear about is me, me, me

God, you're just a bloodsucker
Yeah, you're draining all the hope out of me
I ain't your mother
Don't think you're 'bout to feed off of me
'Cause I'ma find real man who ain't gotta pretend
That he knows the ways around a woman like me
I don't need a bloodsucker
Just draining all the life out of me

I think you're special, don't get me wrong
It takes a special kinda man to piss me off
Read the room, boy, writing's on the wall
Did you really think that I was gonna call?

Oh, please, you tell me that you're sweet
But I just see your bitter ridden insecurities
You say you serve to please, is that what you believe?
'Cause all I ever hear about is me, me, me

God, you're just a bloodsucker
Yeah, you're draining all the hope out of me
I ain't your mother
Don't think you're 'bout to feed off of me
'Cause I'ma find real man who ain't gotta pretend
That he knows the ways around a woman like me
I don't need a bloodsucker
Just draining all the life out of me

I don't need a bloodsucker

Time to find real man who ain't gotta pretend
That he knows the ways around a woman like me
I don't need a bloodsucker
Just draining all life out of me
