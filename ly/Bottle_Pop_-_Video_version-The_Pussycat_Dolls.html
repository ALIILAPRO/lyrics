		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tip top, drip drop
Bottles pop, lips lock
Hips rock, don't stop
Big Snoop Dogg is back on the block
PC, Disney
Shake that thing to this beat
Taste like Brandi, shaped like Landi
Sweet like candy, candy, candy

All them other models bottling like mama's bottle tasty
If you pop my bottle, all them models gonna hate me

When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

Every girl dreams of herself in pearls
Wanna be the fast driver of a shiny car
But the good girls suddenly the bad girls
Just because they wanna be a movie star

When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

Every girl feels this world belongs to her
No matter who make her purr, she's a superstar
Never worry; there's us, my girl with curves
That'll make this mutha burn when her bottle pops

When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

Pass the fifth, I pass it back
Turn around lil' mama, got ass in the back
See, it's a fact, a bottle of pop
If you shake it, then drop it like it's hot
Time is money and money is time
And if you're with me, all your money is mine
Yup, yup, do it to death
Is it true that you get wet? (Wet, wet)

When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

You're turning me on
You're shaking me up
So don'tcha wanna take me
Just because
I'm the chosen one
All them models gonna hate me

All them other models bottling like mama's bottle tasty
If you pop my bottle, all them models gonna hate me

When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me

When my bottle pop, shake me

When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop (Bottle)
When my bottle pop, shake me
