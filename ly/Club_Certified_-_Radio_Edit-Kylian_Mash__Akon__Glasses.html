		  Look tha king

I know you want it all, you won't wait anymore
Hey girls get it busy, Kylian Mash is in the house, get it crazy
Those ways you loose control
- 
Glasses into the party, Kylian Mash and Akon to be easy

I ain't for all that beef-ay
Got niggas to bust ya head for no reason
Ask around the streets man, I'm certified
Cross seas, all my customers are satisfied
See I ain't for all that beef-ay
Matter a fact, I'm just tryin' to chill with the squeeze-ay
Ask around the hood man, I'm certified
Now I'd hate to have to put a bullet in ya mind
I ain't for all that beef-ay
Got niggas to bust ya head for no reason
Ask around the streets man, I'm certified
Cross seas, all my customers are satisfied
See I ain't for all that beef-ay
Matter a fact, I'm just tryin' to chill with the squeeze-ay
Ask around the hood man, I'm certified
Now I'd hate to have to put a bullet

You know we're certified round all around of the floor
Hey shawty I can take you higher, I know you want some more
- 

Look tha king

Baby girl back back back back it up
Bad girl, let me see (-)
And he's too ugly (-)

I know you want it all, you won't wait anymore
Hey girls get it busy, Kylian Mash is in the house, get it crazy
Those ways you loose control
- 
Glasses into the party, Kylian Mash and Akon to be easy

I ain't for all that beef-ay
Got niggas to bust ya head for no reason 
Ask around the streets man, I'm certified 
Cross seas' all my customers are satisfied 
See I ain't for all that beef-ay
Matter a fact, I'm just tryin' to chill with the squeeze-ay
Ask around the hood man, I'm certified
Now I'd hate to have to put a bullet in ya mind

Big friends (-)
This sound all around of the floor

This sound all around of the floor

This sound all around of the floor

I know you want it all, you won't wait anymore
Hey girls get it busy, Kylian Mash is in the house, get it crazy

Ask around the hood man, I'm certified
Now I'd hate to have to put a bullet in ya mind.
