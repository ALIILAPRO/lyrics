Get money, yeah yeah
Get money, yeah, get money
Get money, yeah, yeah
Get money, yeah yeah (get money)
Get money, yeah yeah

Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Why you gotta sleep on my crew?
You know that my VVS' blue
Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My gang gonna eat real soon (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All you little haters is doomed

Ooh, wait, wait, ooh
Ooh, wait, ooh, ooh (woah, woah)
Get money, yah, yah
Get money, yah, yah
Get money, yah, yah (oh my)
Get money, yah, yah (oh my)

Like wait, wait, uh, ska-ate, uh
Spin on my dick like a Beyblade, uh
My dick'll hit her like AK, uh
These boys is mad 'cause they basic, uh
Tie up your lace, why you trippin' like ayy?
Run up, get done up, say this every day
Uh, these niggas jealous and uh
Boy you is bitter like medicine, uh
Are you okay, bitch? Uh
Slap that pussy like I'm Jason, uh
Huh, fuck on my face, bitch, uh
1-0 like the Matrix, uh
Nigga try me, I tell Ice to go get ya
Fuck around, I keep a blade like the Witcher
I want your auntie, your grandma, your sister
I eat the pussy for breakfast and dinner

Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Why you gotta sleep on my crew?
You know that my VVS' blue
Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Like ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My gang gonna eat real soon (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All you little haters is doomed

Ooh, wait, wait, ooh
Ooh, wait, ooh, ooh (woah, woah)
Get money, yah, yah
Get money, yah, yah
Get money, yah, yah
Get money, yah, yah
