		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  But would it be the worst thing
If your car wouldn't start up
We had to fog up the windows
When it gets dark just to keep us warm? (Yeah)

I wish we never met sometimes
'Til I'm with another ex, and I
Forget that you're the best sometimes
Wonder if I'm in your head
'Cause I hate this and I hate that
You're making me say this
'Cause I ain't one to say this but

We claim we're better off apart (oh)
Pretend that we don't get along

But would it be the worst thing
If your car wouldn't start up
We had to fog up the windows
When it gets dark just to keep us warm?
And would it be the worst thing if we both fell asleep
Woke up to twenty calls each
Wondering where the hell have we been?
If it means that we'd have eight more hours alone
Or even if we never make it home
I guess that wouldn't be the worst thing

Don't wanna overcomplicate
I tend to overcompensate
When you're not here, can't help it
My thoughts are automatic
Keep pulling me in, under my skin
I should admit, I-I'm in a gridlock
With my same thoughts of you

We claim we're better off apart (oh)
Pretend that we don't get along

But would it be the worst thing
If your car wouldn't start up
We had to fog up the windows
When it gets dark just to keep us warm?
And would it be the worst thing
If we both fell asleep
Woke up to twenty calls each
Wondering where the hell have we been?
If it means that we'd have eight more hours alone
Or even if we never make it home
I guess that wouldn't be the worst thing

Would it be, would it be the
Would it be the worst thing?
Would it be, would it be the
Would it be the worst thing? (I guess that wouldn't be the worst thing)
Would it be, would it be, no, oh, oh
The worst thing, yeah (oh)
Worst thing

But would it be the worst thing
If your car wouldn't start up
We had to fog up the windows
When it gets dark just to keep us warm?
And would it be the worst thing
If we both fell asleep
Woke up to twenty calls each
Wondering where the hell have we been?
If it means that we'd have eight more hours alone
Or even if we never make it home
I guess that wouldn't be the worst thing
