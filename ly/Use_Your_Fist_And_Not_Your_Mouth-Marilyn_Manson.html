		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am overground and
Out-selling it.
Since god thinks I don't exist
The beatings happen per minute
This is not
Blue-collar-white-corrective politics
I'm on a hate American style
Kick.

This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(come on, come on)
This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(come on, come on)

I'm on a campaign for pain
And when I get elected
I'll wipe the white of your house
The smile off your face

This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(come on, come on)
This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(come on, come on)
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to be like anyone else
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to even be myself

I said, no, this isn't your song
We can't all get along
It's too hard to hold hands when
Your hand's a fist
My hate-pop won't ever stop
I'm fucking glad we're different
This is my hate american style
Hit.

Don't bring, don't sing it
Use your fist and not your mouth.

This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(come on, come on)
This is the black collar song
Put it in your middle finger and sing along
Use your fist and not your mouth
(come on, come on)
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to be like anyone else
I woke up today and wished for tomorrow
I don't want to even be myself
