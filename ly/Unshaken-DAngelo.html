		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world

Did I hear a thunder?
Did I hear you break?
I can't quite remember
Just what guided me this way, oh, oh

May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world

The pines, they often whisper
They whisper what no tongue can tell
He who drinks from the deep water (ooh, ooh)
May he know the depths of the well (ooh, ooh)
Well

May I stand unshaken (may I)
Amid, amidst a crashing world (mmm)
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world

Mmm, oh, traveler
What have you seen?
Were there crossroads
Where you been, where you been?
I once was standing tall
Now I feel my back's against the wall

May I stand unshaken (oh)
Amid, amidst a crashing world
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world
Solo

The morning light
When it comes to me
It was there but I could not see
Am I to wander
As a wayward son?
Will the hunter be hunted
By the smoking gun? (oh)

May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst a crashing world (world)
May I stand unshaken (may I)
Amid, amidst a crashing world (world)
May I stand unshaken (may I)
Amid, amidst a crashing world
