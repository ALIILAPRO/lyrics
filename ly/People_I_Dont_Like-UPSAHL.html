Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like
Ah-ah-ah-ah

This room is so suffocating
Walkin' on ice, but nobody breaks it
Stuck in this one-way conversation
Guess I'll be here for a while
And you're blowin' smoke in my face (ew)
And tellin' me all about your paycheck
Take a shot with a fake smile to chase it (cheers)
Guess I'll take another round

Everybody in this party's fuckin' fake
I really wish that I could say it to your face
But I won't, so

Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like
Ah-ah-ah-ah
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Blah, blah, blah, I'm so bored
Love your shoes, tell me more
On and on about yourself
Can't you bother somebody else?
Raise a glass if you're like me (yeah)
Getting trashed 'cause you can't leave (yeah)
Guess we're in this together
Makes my head hurt (la-da-na-na-na)

Everybody in this party's fuckin' fake
And so am I
But I just got here, so I gotta show some face

Hello, it's so good to see you
We met before, but nice to meet you (we met before, right?)
Yeah, I don't really wanna be here like
Ah-ah-ah-ah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
What's my name? Do you remember?
I'm pretty sure you have my number
So let's pretend we like each other like
Ah-ah-ah-ah (yeah)

To the people I don't like (yeah)
You're trying too hard (keep trying, keep trying, keep trying)
To the people I don't like
To the people I don't, don't, d-don't, don't, don't
