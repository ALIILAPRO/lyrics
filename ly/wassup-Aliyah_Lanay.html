		  Wassup
Nobody can do it for you
If it's too much
I'm sorry for putting it on you
And it's like that
No breaks until it's over
Gotta get right if you around me
When you shoot don't hesitate
Wassup
Nobody can do it for you
If it's too much
I'm sorry for putting it on you
And it's like that
No breaks until it's over
Gotta get right if you around me
When you shoot don't hesitate

How you movin when it's gettin loud
You kept doubting but it's not allowed
You the reason it just sold out
You the reason
Fuck them ceilings
Brand new season
Put ya pride aside
To the side

Didn't do it for no likes
Drop another track
Cause it's on me
Pretty little liar
No it's not me
Pull up skrt can you show me
Jumpin out the 5 on this one

Wassup
Nobody can do it for you
If it's too much
I'm sorry for putting it on you
And it's like that
No breaks until it's over
Gotta get right if you around me
When you shoot don't hesitate
Wassup
Nobody can do it for you
If it's too much
I'm sorry for putting it on you
And it's like that
No breaks until it's over
Gotta get right if you around me
When you shoot don't hesitate
