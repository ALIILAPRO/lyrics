		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What’s that song
Playing in the car
It reminds me of a time I forgot

Is it those guys
You toured with years ago
But never made it to America

Look outside
It’s your favourite type of morning
The drive to work you’re used too
Seems like a different way

Don’t know why
When I try to speak my mind
It echos like a joke I’ve told
Far too many times

Can you feel the waves
Drawing in and out again

It’s alright
I don’t need those empty promises
Leaving doesn’t have to be
This complicated game

Every time
Before we say goodbye
A part of me is holding on
To each and every line
