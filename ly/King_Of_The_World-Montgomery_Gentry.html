		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cane poles hanging out of a four door window
Bucket full of minnows in the front floorboard
Box full of greasy cold fried chicken livers

A day on the river's what I live for

Got the radio playing and my boat while I float
Take a toke and listen to Merle
Hot sun, cold one, I'll be a son of a gun
I'm king of the world

They grow big gators in south Louisiana
My neighbors in the swamp take an evening nap
Shoo fly, shoo fly, Polk salad Annie
Listen to the bull frogs hip hop rap

I got a pretty thing waiting downtown
I'm in love with a green eyed girl
I'm gonna catch me a fish, go home, get a kiss, play
Yes I'm king of the world

Got a stringer full of bass and a hookie in my finger
Sun burnt face and a Tylenol buzz
Take the good with the bad and the bad with the better
The weather isn't bad so better not cuss

I got a roof over me and enough to eat
And a Labrador I call Earl
He lays by my feet, looks up at me
Like I'm the king of the world

Cane poles hanging out of a four door window
Bucket full of minnows in the front floorboard
Box full of green cold fried chicken livers
A day on the river's what I live for

Got the radio playing and my boat while I float
Take a toke and listen to Merle
Hot sun, cold one, I'll be a son of a gun
I'm king of the world

King of the world
I'm king of the world
