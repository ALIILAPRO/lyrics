		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you were young and your heart 
Was an open book
You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)

But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die

What does it matter to ya
When you got a job to do you got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

You used to say live and let live
(You know you did)
(You know you did)
(You know you did)

But if this ever changin' world
In which we live in
Makes you give in and cry
Say live and let die
Live and let die
