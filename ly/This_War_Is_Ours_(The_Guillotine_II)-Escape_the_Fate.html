		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We have to find a better way
Out of this tragedy
As the battle rages on
Blood stains the ground we're on
My ears hear only screams
Brave soldiers are dying
One spartan stands alone and shouts
This war is ours.

This war is ours!

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the front lines of war
We have to find a better way
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all
We have to find a better way.

Through the fire and the flames
A sea of dead drives men insane
We march the fight into the cold
This is as far as it will go
The battle ends on top of here
This is where we conquer fear
On blackout armed with our swords
This war is ours.
Yeah.
This war is ours.

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the front lines of war
We have to find a better way
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all
We have to find a better way.

Till we conquer them all
We have to find a better way.
Till we conquer them all!

Yes I will meet you.
Through the smoke and flames
On the front lines of war
And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all.

We will conquer them all

We will conquer them all

We will conquer them all

This war is ours!
Yeah!
This war is ours!

Yes, I will see you
Through the smoke and flames
On the front lines of war

And I will stand my ground until the end
Till we conquer them all

So I will fight my battle till I fall
And I conquer them all
Till we conquer them all
War! [Repeat: x7]

Go, yeah!
This is war!
War! [Repeat: x7]
This is war!
