		  Rockstar
inside of my head
been working for this since ten
Know it now
Same as
I knew it then
I can't Prove it just yet
Wondering if I Got it all wrong
I don't wanna try For no one
Is this healthy Behavior
Or am I in need of a Savior
We all got
Dreams to make
Tangible
All I can feel are mistakes
Try to adjust to the weight
It's been pushin' down on me
Oh it's time to change
Been feeling Like
To get myself out
I gotta
Dig six feet down
Come to terms
With all my demons
Run away
Run away
It's the only way
To be safe
Mask the pain
I can always avoid
Until your leaving
I was never
Taught
How to thrive
Been teaching
Myself
From the jump
Just to survive
But that's why
We strive
Just to grow
While we
Got the time
When I'm on top
Ain't never been
A reason
To fall
Until
There's treason
We all got
Dreams to make
Tangible
All I can feel are mistakes
Try to adjust to the weight
It's been pushin' down on me
Oh it's time to change
Been feeling Like
To get myself out
I gotta
Dig six feet down
Come to terms
With all my demons
(No lie, No lie, No lie, No lie, Survive)
(No lie, No lie, No lie, Just gotta survive)
