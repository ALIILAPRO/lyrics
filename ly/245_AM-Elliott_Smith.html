		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're going out sleepwalking
Where mute memories start talking
The boss that couldn't help but hurt you
And the pretty thing you made desert you
I'm going out like a baby
A naive, unsatisfiable baby
Grabbin' onto whatever's around
For the soaring high or the crushing down

With hidden cracks that don't show
But that constantly just grow

I'm lookin' for the man that attacked me
While everybody was laughin' at me
You beat it in me, that part of you
But I'm gonna split us back in two

Tired of livin' in a cloud
If you're gonna say shit now, you'll do it out loud

It's 2:45 in the morning
And I'm putting myself on warning
For waking up in an unknown place
With a recollection you half-erased

Lookin' for somebody's arms
To wave away past harms

walking out on center circle
The both of you can just fade to black
I'm walking out on center circle
Been pushed away and I'll never go back
