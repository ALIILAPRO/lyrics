		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're my rockstar, baby got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancing right before my eyes
You can love me, you can love me tonight

You're my rockstar

I think I had a dream of you
Now I'm lost in this crazy mood
You make the crowds go high
You sing a song for me all night

There's a hole in me, hole in me here tonight
It has control over me, over me for life
Gotta go back to sleep, seal your eyes
Got those cowboys roots and I miss you every time

You're my rockstar, baby you got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancing right before my eyes
You can love me, you can love me tonight
You're my rockstar

Everybody came to see you play
Standing in the mirror, I can't look away
And I hear them sing out so
What a sweet sound, I wish they'd go on

There's a hole in me, hole in me here tonight
It has control over me, over me for life
Gotta go back to sleep, seal your eyes
Got those cowboys roots and I miss you every time

You're my rockstar, baby you got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancing right before my eyes
You can love me, you can love me tonight
You're my rockstar

You're my rockstar, baby you got me hypnotized
See the whole world dancing right before my eyes
You can love me, you can love me tonight
You're my rockstar

(You're my rockstar)
(You're my rockstar)
