		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know
Gangster, I know
Gangster, I know
Gangster, gangster, gangster

Gangster, gangster, gangster, gangster
Gangster, gangster, gangster (gangster)

Let's go
Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe 
In the blue Range across my view
Met a crush, like my kind too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Let you fine about lifetime sunshine boo (say you'll remember)
Bandanas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down, the thug life living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bonnie to his Clyde hold it down like an anchor (say you'll remember)
Hardcore vibe, attracted more to his anger
Passion like fever, hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem, Malaya
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's lied down with his flamer
Really like his flavor, wanna slow dance with the devil
With-with the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting the lasers while laughin' at haters
Gangsters not bred I make them
Gangsters not dead I raise 'em (gangster)

Gangsters not dead
Gangsters not bred I make them
G-gangsters not dead I raise 'em

Say you'll remember
(Gang, g-gang, g-gang)
Say you'll remember
(Gang, g-gang, g-gang)

(Gangster)
(Gangster)

(Gangster)

Say you'll remember
