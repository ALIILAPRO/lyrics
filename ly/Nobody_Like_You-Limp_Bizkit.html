		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm convinced that you hate (that you hate), you hate me
You like (you like), you like to see me cry
It's already a proven fact
That you hate and you wait on me to die
It's so scary, I find it hard to confine
I will make you see it my way
You give, I take
You say, you want to be away from me

You bring me
I've got a reason and I won't wanna let go
Take me down
I've got a reason and I want to know

I'm convinced that you (fucked me) real good
You did (you did), but I won't let it go
I got my reasons and I'm not leavin'
So I'll wait on you to die
Please take this time for me to be unforgiven
I give my life to you
I lay my life on the line for you
For you, for you, for you

You bring me
I've got a reason and I won't wanna let go
Take me down
I've got a reason and I want to know

I got (got no)
No reason
I got (got no, got no, I got no, got no)
No reason (I got no)
I've got the reason (no reason) 
No fucking reason
No reason (I got no)
And I don't wanna let go (I got no)
No reason (I got no)
I've got the reason (I got no) 
No fucking reason (I got no)
No reason
And I won't let go (I got no reason)

(You) You (bring) bring me 
I've got the reason and I don't wanna let go
(Take) Take (me) me down
I've got a reason and I want to know

Go 
Got no reason
No fuckin' reason
Go
Got no reason (fuck you)
No reason
Go
I got no reason
No fucking reason
Go
And I won't let go
I got no reason (go)
