		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thank you and goodnight I've been erased
Thank you and goodnight I've been erased
My brain breeds a sickness I can't escape 
My brain breeds a sickness I can't escape

At the end of the road know you'll find me cold 
Been told my bones will break I'm lost in a world that I can't control 
I've been a waste of breath decomposing in the unknown 
They'll feed me medication unloading an overdose and watch me fall  
So find some solace in silence I'm letting go another moment held afloat by the nightmares that stay untold 
Burning through my skin like the venom taking its toll 
I'm poisoned poised to self destruct leave me hanging from broken rope

Take me home 
Take me home
Take me home
Take me home 

Thank you and goodnight I've been erased
Thank you and goodnight I've been erased
My brain breeds a sickness I can't escape 
My brain breeds a sickness I can't escape
