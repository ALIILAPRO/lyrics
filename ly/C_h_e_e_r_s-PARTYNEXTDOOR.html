		  Cheers when we drink, oh yeah
Cheers when we drunk, oh yeah
Cheers make me numb, oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Love hangin' out, oh yeah
Hate hangin' up (oh), woah
Don't say it (say it) until you mean it (mean it, yeah)

Watch, I'll run through a quarter milli' with ya, baby (baby)
We hit the strip club, we goin' crazy (yeah)
I'ma talk to you nice, I'ma treat you like a lady (yeah)
'Fore we get in the car (yeah)
I'm pullin' on yo' lace wig while you give me top (top)
Don't stop, oh girl, it's so much fun with ya
Your love when whatever, it's whatever when you need it (period)
Like signin' off, I'll be your little secret
I'm never too far
Pushin' the bar (the bar)
Twice as (as far)
When I'm what you need (need)
You ain't gotta work as hard
It won't take much to make you mine
But for now, I'm sayin' (I'm sayin', yeah)

Let's cheers when we drink (yeah), oh yeah
Cheers when we drunk (yeah), oh yeah
Cheers make me numb (cheers), oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah-ah, yeah
Love hanging out (love), oh yeah
Hate hanging up (hate hanging up), woah
Don't say it (say it) until you mean it (no sex, yeah, no sex)

Let's take another shot, then we out of the party
Let's take it up the block, I ain't gon' tell nobody
What we doin', where we goin'
What type of time that we on tonight
Let's take a trip, a trip to Italy (yeah)
Bussdown that watch and now you're kissin' me
Talk 'bout my past
I ain't even wanna talk 'bout that last (yeah)
Tamia, Tamia, officially missin' me
She feel like Beyonce when she wear Tiffany
I don't even wanna talk 'bout the past
I wanna talk 'bout the times that's gon' forever last
I'm saying

Cheers when we drink (yeah, yeah), oh yeah
Cheers when we drunk (yeah), oh yeah
Cheers made me numb (cheers), oh yeah (come on, come on, come on)
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Love hanging out (love), oh yeah
Hate hanging up (hate hanging up), woah
Don't say it until you mean it (yeah)

Do I look stupid to you? That was so rude
Look, look, look, baby
You should be embarrassed, you should be embarrassed
That bitch was just lookin' at me and that's it 
It don't mean nothing
I watched her, I watched her, I just watched her walk to you 
What's going on?
I don't even know her
You're tripping 
You got me messed up for real 
You don't want me to embarrass you in here
Look, she off, she offered me a drink and that's all that happened
Nah, it's cool, it's whatever 
I'm out, I'm out, I'm done
She came and she leaned into me 
She was just offering me a drink and that's it, promise to God
Yeah okay, we'll see
I do not know her
Listen, it's over drop it
