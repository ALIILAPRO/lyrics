		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know when the sun goes down
I'll be waiting for you
So tell me when you come around
'Cause I've been saving a spot for two
So turn around and let your feelings go
'Cause flowers grow the most when they're free

So take me to the sun
Where the light never fails
And tell me you're the one
That our love's never fading

Take me to the sun, take me to the sun
Take me to the sun, take me to the sun
Take me to the sun
We've got nowhere to run, we've got nowhere to run from
We've got nowhere to run, we've got nowhere to run

It's the signs of the time
When I look into your eyes
You know where to find me in the night
So please just stop your searching
'Cause you're lost again
You don't need to tell me it's alright
'Cause I know when it's not and you need a friend

Time stops around you
And I don't care

Take me to the sun, take me to the sun
Take me to the sun, take me to the sun
Take me to the sun
We've got nowhere to run, we've got nowhere to run from
We've got nowhere to run

Take me where the light will never stop shining
And when it gets dark I know that you'll find me
Take me where the light will never stop shining
And when it gets dark I know that you'll find me
