		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another day goes by and I'm floating in an ocean of emotion
Same old look on my face
Another day goes by I realize that I wasn't really open
When you came my way
Now I know you got hurt in the past
And I told you I'm sorry for that
I don't sleep without you at my back
Now I can't lay my head in your lap
Don't usually miss shit, but I wanna fix it
Really wanna fix why I feel so bad
Cuz you moved on and I can't accept that
Truth is I really want you back
Save your words for me
I'll make my heart the one you want
Save your words for me
I'll make my heart the one you want
I was much more mellow then
I decided to say hello when
You came into my life
never thought I'd see the day I'd have to say goodbye
(I, I, I)
I live every single day on repeat
Now that you're not here with me
I just need you on my arm, but you seem so far
Guess that's why they call it Karma
I'm sorry that I wasn't strong enough
I didn't hold on long enough
And I know we went through some stuff
But trust me I ain't ready to give you up
Can't even look me in the eye
Can't bear to see you with another guy
I'm so so sorry for wasting your time
And I hope you take me back in another life
Save your words for me
I'll make my heart the one you want
Save your words for me
I'll make my heart the one you want
Save your words for me
I'll make my heart the one you want
Save your words for me
I'll make my heart the one you want
