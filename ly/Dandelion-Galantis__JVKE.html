		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picked up a dandelion
You had me mesmerized
You and me
So pretty
Just when I start to like you
You just get up and leave
In the breeze
Why'd you leave?

Picked up a dandelion
You had me mesmerized
You and me
So pretty
Just when I start to like it
You just get up and leave
In the breeze
Why'd you leave?

Picked up a dandelion
You had me mesmerized
So pretty
Just when I start to like it
You just get up and leave
In the breeze
Why'd you leave?

Here today, gone tomorrow
Temporary
(Temporary)
Why does this gotta be
Temporary
The day you left
It felt like death
You're all I ever needed
(All I ever needed)

Picked up a dandelion
You had me mesmerized
You and me
So pretty
Just when I start to like it
You just get up and leave
In the breeze
Why'd you leave?

Picked up a dandelion
(Why'd you leave?)

Here today, gone tomorrow
Temporary
(Temporary)
Why does this gotta be
Temporary
The day you left
It felt like death
You're all I ever needed
(All I ever needed)

Picked up a dandelion
You had me mesmerized
So pretty
Just when I start to like it
You just get up and leave
In the breeze
Why'd you leave?

Picked up a dandelion
You had me mesmerized
You and me
