		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

R I S E, let's light a match and ignite the streets, screaming
R I O T, but now it's time to give 'em something to say
So dig a little bit, never quit, keep on that hustle
Get up and take another hit, hold on through the struggle, screaming
R I S E, let's light a match and ignite the streets

Let's light 'em up, light 'em up

You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believe
You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

The road is long, but it's the one to take
You gotta put in the work, it's time to make or break

Though the road is long, but it's the one to take
You gotta put in the work, it's time to make or break

You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believe
You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

Make them believe, write down your name in history, you gotta
Make them believe, one day they'll remember me
You gotta stand up tall give 'em something to say
With you back against the wall be somebody to hate
Make them believe, write down your name in history

You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
This is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believe
You gotta fight through the pain, to get to the top
You gotta push through it all, if it's what you want
Screaming this is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers

Make them believe, dig a little deeper, make 'em believers
This is a call to the dreamers
Dig a little deeper, make 'em believers
