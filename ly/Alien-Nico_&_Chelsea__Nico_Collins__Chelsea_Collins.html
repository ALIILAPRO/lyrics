		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (So will I ever feel at home again?)
(So will I ever feel at home again?)

Never been one to talk about my emotions
I'm exhausted from my thoughts
And then my mouth won't open
So terrified, you look behind
The mask I wear so well
'Cause I'm confident you hate me
Like I hate myself

I don't care to fit in
'Cause I got no friends
Swear I'm trying my best
But I'm an alien
I wish I could let you get under my skin
But I'm alone in this world
Guess I'm an alien

So will I ever feel at home again?
So will I ever feel at home again?

I apologize
For my jaded mind
It never really figured out the perfect words
Swear I mean well when they crash and burn
Don't look me in the eyes for long
You'll make them suffocate
I'll fixate on how I don't belong
Give up and finally say

I don't care to fit in
'Cause I got no friends
Swear I'm trying my best
But I'm an alien
I wish I could let you get under my skin
But I'm alone in this world
Guess I'm an alien

So will I ever feel at home again?
So will I ever feel at home again?

Wish I could be a bit more human
Not lost in permanent confusion
Wish I could be a bit more human
Find peace in all of my delusions

I don't care to fit in
'Cause I got no friends
Swear I'm trying my best
But I'm an alien
I wish I could let you get under my skin
But I'm alone in this world
Guess I'm an alien

So will I ever feel at home again? (Yea-yeah)
So will I ever feel at home again? 
(I don't belong, I don't belong)
So will I ever feel at home again? (Never feel like home)
So will I ever feel at home again?

(So will I ever feel at home again?)
(So will I ever feel at home again?)
