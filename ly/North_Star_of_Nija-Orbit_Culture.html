		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Combust
The opulence of all the human faults in flames
You've killed
But you see yourself for real in here
The serpent, black God
The north star of Nija
Don't cry
You'll see what you want to see
Charcoal crown
The leviathan of all the things we thought we heard
Of all there is to see

Don't cry
You are here where you need to be
Yeah, don't cry
You'll be the one that you need to kill
You'll follow me

To the somewhere between
In the darkest of nights
There's something to see
In the circles of the light
In the deepest of dreams
I can see the flash coming down on thee
'Cause the weight of this world
Now won't slow us down
But I don't know how long
So you better go now
Before I'll show you what's coming

Adjust the ornament to fit the true king of our realm
You bow to a darker power that's real in here
The serpent, the black God
The north star of Nija
I've lived through some grey days
But I've never really given it a thought
How I live, how it's feasting on me
How it's taking me

Don't cry
You are here where you need to be
Yeah, don't cry
You'll be the one that you need to kill
You'll follow me

To the somewhere between
In the darkest of nights
There's something to see
In the circles of the light
In the deepest of dreams
I can see the flash coming down on thee
'Cause the weight of this world
Now won't slow us down
But I don't know how long
So you better go now
Before I'll show you what's coming

I'm the leader of all that's dead
I'm the crows that you witness next
I'm the leech that steals from the mother's breast
I'm the serpent in hell

Fighting, surviving for life
No one will ever see the truth
Leaving the world to die
No one will ever see the truth
So I've been surviving for life (Life)
No one will ever see the truth
Leaving the world to die (Die)
No one will ever see the truth

You'll stay here for a long time
You'll dry your tears from off your face
But you can't look back now
You'll fade away

I'm the reason for all that's been
I'm the cross-bearer of all of human race
I'm the kingpin of all your hate
I'm the serpent in hell
I am the serpent of all (A serpent of all)

I've sent down the crows to hell
To gather the bones of you
I've given the piece of skin
To the gods of the broken man, I am complete
I've sent down the crows to hell
To gather the bones of you
I've given the piece of skin
To the gods of the broken man, I am complete
