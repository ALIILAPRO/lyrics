		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you saying love
Or are you saying nothing
Still life is a crime
That I can't ignore
Your perfect ways will follow
The temperature that's rising
All this time you never let me think

It was the hardest part to know
It was the fastest we could run
It was the farthest we could go
We are a lie my angel

Cause for hate and
A cause for ending
It sounds so easy
But everytime we were supposed to let go
We'd make love
Now pull me closer let the heat take over

Call me your way
Call me away
Don't end it open
I tried to love you like before
If this was our night
It was the best one of our lives

Are you saying now
Or are you saying never
The still frame in my mind cannot be ignored
And all I can remember
Is the way you moved your body
And how your lips never said no
But it was killing you inside
Cause you thought I was the one
And now it's out of your control
You have arrived my angel

Cause for hate and
A cause for ending
It sounds so easy
But everytime we were supposed to let go
We'd make love
Now pull me closer let the heat take over you
You

And we were drawing lines not to cross
So we would never feel a thing
And now it's breaking you apart
Just like it broke your heart

Cause for hate and
A cause for ending
It sounds so easy
But everytime we were supposed to let go
We'd make love
Now pull me closer let the heat take over

Call me your way
Call me away
Don't end it open
I tried to love you like before
If this was our night
It was the best one of our lives
