		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair
I'm just a shot, then we can die
Ah

I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, "don't you know?"
You say you don't know
I say, "take me out"

I say, "you don't show"
Don't move, time is slow
I say, "take me out"

I say, "you don't know"
You say you don't go
I say, "take me out"

If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

I say, "don't you know?"
You say you don't know
I say, "take me out"

If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out

If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
