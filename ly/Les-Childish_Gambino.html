		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Uh)
Baby, you're the baddest, uh
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom, girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Time-wise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit (shit)
And you's a hipster, bitch (bitch)
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different
Right, that's why your friends need wristbands?
Fuck you
Can I have this dance?

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom, girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom, girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

We can pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started dating at your art school
'Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time
Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other, I'm takin' you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow 911 Persian girl in the back car
But me writin' a verse the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic, bitch, I love Rugrats
Watchin' lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analing anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl crying on Ludlow
She still look good though
Love is East Side, who are you to hate?
Movie ass, not a 10 but a Super 8
You ain't see me at the show, I was super great
Hotel penthouse, go on let it ruminate
City never sleeps, so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could, then I kept going

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
(I hope nobody catch us)

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

Ooh, girl, I wanna know
Are you ready to cry? 'Cause I'm no good, no good
Ooh, girl, I wanna try
I'm an awful guy and I'm always away
And I'm tryin' to say
I'm a piece of shit
Believe in this, I'm tellin' you
'Cause we barely knew what we had
I'm not that bad, the fun we had
Oh, oh

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway

Baby, you're the baddest
Baby, you're the baddest girl, and, uh
Nobody else matters
Nobody else matters girl, and, uh
We're kissing in the bathroom
We're kissing in the bathroom girl, and, uh
I hope nobody catch us
But I kinda hope they catch us, anyway
