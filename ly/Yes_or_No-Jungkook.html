		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't just another love song, baby
It's my way of putting feelers out
All the traffic in my head's going crazy
I'm gonna trust my heart right now

And if it's better to bet on us, then I'll double down
And if we end up in bed and I put the covers out
And if I'm wrong, I'll just bury my head deep underground
I gotta know

Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us?)
If so, then I think I know what's (know what's) going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no

Everybody in this club so faded
I'm trippin' over getting lost on you
If we forever started out as strangers
I think my ever after just came true

If you could see what I see, then let's see what it's about
We will go higher and higher but we're not looking down
If it's a dream, there's no telling when I'll be coming 'round
And I gotta know

Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us?)
If so, then I think I know what's (know what's) going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no

Something about you, do you feel the way I do?
There's magic in the room, tell me do you feel it too?
Something about you, do you feel the way I do?
There's magic in the room, tell me what we gonna do?

Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Are you thinking 'bout us? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If so, then I think I know what's (know what's) going on 
And are we falling in love? (What's going on?)
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
