		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whip with the peanut butter insides, yeah
Dip if you tryna kill a nigga vibe, yeah
Slid through the crib, I'm in her insides, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah

Your name will never die, lil' homie
Whoa
(Maybach Music)
Niggas wanna kill me 'cause I'm rockin' stones (huh)
Diamonds on my neck, I'm in another zone (huh)
Wings on my whip, I pray we meet again (woo)
Jealousy is obvious, no, I don't need a lens
Got my homie's name tatted all over my flesh
That boy a hustler to the core, got it correct (huh)
Murals of Nipsey (huh), reppin' for X (woo)
They want a Wet William, Russian Roulette

Whip with the peanut butter insides, yeah
Dip if you tryna kill a nigga vibe, yeah
Slid through the crib, I'm in her insides, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
Whip with the peanut butter insides, yeah
Dip if you tryna kill a nigga vibe, yeah
Slid through the crib, I'm in her insides, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah (ayy)
She said, "Oh my God," I changed her fucking life, yeah
