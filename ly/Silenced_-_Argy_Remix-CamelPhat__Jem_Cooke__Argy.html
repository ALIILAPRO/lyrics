		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stars above
Used to be my eyes
So low
My high is gone
Swallowed by the tides
So strong

Been losin' my way, baby
Been losin' my way
Tell me what you waitin' for
Tell me what you need
You don't have to suffer here alone in silence
Come and let me hold you close
Wash away the tears
You don't have to suffer here alone in silence

(Silence)

I fall
Heavy as a stone
Sinkin'
My skies are cold
But somethin' in my bones
Is callin'

Been losin' my way, baby
Been losin' my way
Tell me what you waitin' for
Tell me what you need
You don't have to suffer here alone in silence
Come and let me hold you close
Wash away the tears
You don't have to suffer here alone in silence

(Silence)
You don't have to suffer here alone in silence
