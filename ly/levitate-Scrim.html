		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)
(Damn, son, where'd you find this?)
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go (okay, okay)
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay (okay)
Go, go, go, go, go (okay, okay)
yeah, yeah, yeah, okay (go, go, okay, okay, go)

Ride for my shawty, I won't hesitate (I won't hesitate)
Die by my shawty if we separate (if we separate)
Her love got me sick, 'bout to medicate ('bout to medicate)
Her love got me high, 'bout to levitate ('bout to levitate)

Go, go, go (levitate)
Go, go, go (yeah, levitate)
Her love got me, 'bout to levitate
Go, go, go (levitate, go)

Tell me your love is forever
Even if you gonna lie
yeah, you know it's whatever
For you, I'll bring down the sky
Tatted her name on my arm
I put her up in a foreign
Don't really know how to love
All I know is that I feel
Her love is better than pills
Her love is better than drank
For her, I'm a dealer
For her, I'm robbing a bank
Prolly gon' give her a baby
Even if I get played
Just tell me it won't be today
Tell me it won't be the same (let's go)
They say love is blind
But they cannot be
'Cause when it's time to die
Hope it's you I see
Won't go in without you
I'll wait at the gates
Just reach your arm for me
As you levitate

Go, go, go (levitate)
Go, go, go (yeah, levitate)
Her love got me, 'bout to levitate
Go, go, go (levitate, go)

Ride for my shawty, I won't hesitate (I won't hesitate)
Die by my shawty if we separate (if we separate)
Her love got me sick, 'bout to medicate ('bout to medicate)
Her love got me high, 'bout to levitate ('bout to levitate)

Go, go, go (levitate)
Go, go, go (yeah, levitate)
Her love got me, 'bout to levitate
Go, go, go (levitate)
