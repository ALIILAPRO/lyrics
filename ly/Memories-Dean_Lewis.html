		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought I'd see the day
That I wouldn't see your face
Lookin' back, god, I wish I had known
That I'd love you then have to let go
'Cause you brought out the best in me
You always saw a light no one else could see
Now I know that you're gone, but I promise I won't forget

So, thank you for all the memories
'Cause you'll never know what it meant to me
'Cause you were the one who gave me peace when I had none left
Held me close at my loneliest
Thanks for the memories
Here's to the memories

I wish that I could call you up
Just to hear your voice, that would be enough
And we'd laugh like we're back at the start
And pretend we're not falling apart
And sometimes we would hurt each other
But you saved me from goin' under
We didn't last forever
But I won't forget you

So, thank you for all the memories
'Cause you'll never know what it meant to me
'Cause you were the one who gave me peace when I had none left
Held me close at my loneliest
Thanks for the memories
Here's to the memories

'Cause I miss you more than you know, than you know
'Cause I miss you more than you know

So, thank you for all the memories
'Cause you'll never know what it meant to me
'Cause you were the one who gave me peace when I had none left
Held me close at my loneliest
Thanks for the memories
Here's to the memories
