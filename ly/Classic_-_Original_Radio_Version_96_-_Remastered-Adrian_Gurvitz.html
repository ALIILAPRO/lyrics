		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got to write a classic
Got to write it in an attic
Baby, I'm an addict now
An addict for your love

I was a stray boy
And you was my best toy
Found it easy to annoy you
But you were different from the rest
And I loved you all the wrong ways
Now listen to me say
If it changed to another way
Would the difference make it
Would it be a classic
I gotta send it right away

Got to write a classic
Got to write it in an attic
Baby, I'm an addict now
An addict for your love

Gotta write it down and send it right away

Got to write a classic
Got to write it in an attic
Baby, I'm an addict now
An addict for your love

Now I'm living my life
One day at a time
Since losing your love
I've been losing my mind
No more can I see
The future so clear
And it's not what I mean
I mean it's not what it seems
I just keep living for dreams
And it's not what I mean
I mean it's not what it seems
I just keep living for dreams

Got to write a classic
Got to write it in an attic
Baby, I'm an addict now
An addict for your love

Gotta write it down and send it right away.
