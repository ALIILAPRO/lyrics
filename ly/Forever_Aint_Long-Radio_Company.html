		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to heaven 
Or wherever you're from 
Back where it started 
Before the hurt came along 
The truth is it knowin 
Only makes it feel wrong 
So we go right back
To that old feeling 
We want it to be 

In all the hours I spent here 
Was it wasted all this time
Cause I'm slowly losing all hope 
cnd along with it my mind 

Take me forever 
Forever ain't long 
Back where it started 
Before the hurt came along 
The truth is that knowin 
Only makes it feel wrong 
So we go right back 
To that old feeling
We want it to be 

In all the hours I spent here 
Was it wasted all this time 
Cause I'm slowly losing all hope 
cnd along with it my mind

That old piano sounds so clear
It keeps playing on my mind
Reminding me that all hope 
Is something I just can't find

Take me forever 
Forever ain't long 
Back where it started 
Before the hurt came along 
The truth is that knowin 
Only makes it feel wrong 
So we go right back t
O that old feeling
We want it to be 
Yeah we go right back 
To that old feeling
We want it to be 
cnd we go right back t
O that old feeling
We want it to be
