		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night when we say goodbye
I know that I can see myself as a man
When I put on that suit, I don't have to stay mute
I can talk all the time 'cause my shoulders are wide

And I'm falling like the leaves on Leningrad
I follow your footprints when I can't hold your hand
My darling, believe me, I was born to be with you
But it'll be me that the world will answer to

And just for a second, I could be one of the greats
I'll be Caesar on a TV screen, champion of my fate
No one can tell me to stop, I'll have everything I want, anyone
And everyone will like me then
Everyone will like me then

When I was a child, I never felt like a child
I felt like an emperor with a city to burn
I got down on my knees, begged the men in the trees
To give me an answer, je ne peux pas comme Ã§a

And it's raining like it did in Leningrad
My lover would like to buy a flat in Leningrad
And I'd trade my tongue in just to hear him every night
To talk about Red Scare and how they got it right

And just for a second, I could be one of the greats
I am Caesar on a TV screen, champion of my fate
No one can tell me to stop, I'll have everything I want, anyone
And everyone will like me then
Everyone will love me
