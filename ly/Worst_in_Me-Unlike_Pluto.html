		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you standing there and I knew
I'm done for, it's over, I'm through, oh
Playing games from the start, no
Sinking your nails in my heart, no

You bring out the worst in me, oh oh
You bring out the worst in me, oh oh

Looking back in my rear view
Nothing, no nothing can change you, no
I decided to play when I knew you were fire, oh
It started off warm but now I hear the choir
(Yeah) who do you think you are? Oh
Leaving your keys in my car, no

You bring out the worst in me, oh oh
You bring out the worst in me, oh oh

You bring out the worst in me, oh oh
You bring out the worst in me, oh oh
You bring out the worst in me, oh oh
You bring out the worst in me, oh oh
