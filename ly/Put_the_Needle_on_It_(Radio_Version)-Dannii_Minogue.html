		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put the needle on it   Put the needle on it   Put the needle on it   Put the needle on it     Take the bait, bite the line   I got the place, you got the time   I'm lickin' my lips did I make you blush     I'll let you in, the sweat you're in   The temperature is, rising   So hot I may wanna take my clothes off   Ah, ah, ah     Come inside, you're drippin' desire   Let the music make you rise up   Dirty hands, is what I demand   Let the music make you rise up     Oh put, the needle on it   I'll tell you where I want it   C'mon and spin me on it   All my freaks say   Put, the needle on it   I'll tell you where I want it   C'mon and spin me on it   All my freaks say     I dare you now, to be bad   D'ya want the best you've ever had?   You look so tame boy let me wild you up   Keep the lights, dark and low   I'll keep you up all night until you   Feel it vibrating through your bones     Dirty hands, I demand
