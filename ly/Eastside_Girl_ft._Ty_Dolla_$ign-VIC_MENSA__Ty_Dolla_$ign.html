		  Don't take my love
Don't take my love
Don't take my love and run

Don't take my love
Don't take my love
Don't take my love and

Don't take my love
Don't take my love
Don't take my love and run

Don't take my love
Don't take my love
Don't take my love and run

East side girl
She want a westside nigga
North side girl
She want a south side nigga
She wanna ride a chevy with me
She wanna make love on the beach
She wanna pull up to my hood
Know how to roll up a Backwood
East side girl
She want a west side nigga

She got a east side address, but the west side the best
She got a south side ass, with some brand new breasts
And she built like a model
And she fine like Tyra
And she told me I'm her idol
And she wanna meet my mama

Where yo' mama stay
What yo' daddy gang bang?
Where yo' Benz parked at?
What's yo' girlfriends name?
Is she coming with?
Look like she tryna get saved
Put it on my face
Wanna know how it taste

East side girl
She want a westside nigga
North side girl
She want a south side nigga
She wanna ride a chevy with me
She wanna make love on the beach
She wanna pull up to my hood
Know how to roll up a Backwood
East side girl
She want a west side nigga

I'm tryna smoke you out
When you ride the dick I'ma choke you out
Hit it from the back blow the vocals out
That's the type of shit we on
Put it in her buns she gone lick it clean
She say it taste like Krispy Kreme
You might want this Listerine
That's the type of time I'm on

Where yo' mama stay
What yo' daddy gang bang?
Where yo' Benz parked at?
What's yo' girlfriends name?
Is she coming with?
Look like she tryna get saved
Put it on my face
Wanna know how it taste

East side girl
She want a westside nigga
North side girl
She want a south side nigga
She wanna ride a chevy with me
She wanna make love on the beach
She wanna pull up to my hood
Know how to roll up a Backwood
East side girl
She want a west side nigga
