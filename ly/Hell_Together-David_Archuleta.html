		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bow your head, don't be bold
You'll survive by doing what you're told
Said love is earned and we can't choose
But the more you grow, you know the truth
And all I want is to make you proud
If I would run would I let you down?
You said

If I have to live without you
I don't wanna live forever
In someone else's heaven
So let 'em close the gates
Oh, if they don't like the way you're made
Then they're not any better
If paradise is pressure
Oh, we'll go to Hell together

You and me, that's all we need
Blood is thicker than the pages that they read
I'm afraid of letting go
Of the version of me that I used to know
Crying tears in Sunday crowds
Took my hand, and we walked out
You said

If I have to live without you
I don't wanna live forever
In someone else's heaven
So let 'em close the gates
Oh if they don't like the way you're made
Then they're not any better
If paradise is pressure
Oh, we'll go to Hell together

Hallelujah, what's it doing for ya?
When it's in the way?
Hallelujah, wish we knew it sooner
Walking out with grace

You said
If I have to live without you
I don't wanna live forever
In someone else's heaven
So let 'em close the gates
If they don't like the way you're made
Then they're not any better
If paradise is pressure
Oh, we'll go to Hell together
