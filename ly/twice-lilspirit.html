		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wake me up 'cause she frustrated
'Bout some girl I used to date in 2019
What's her name I can't recall?
Don't wanna have this conversation
Girl, you're way too fucking faded
She's been mixing up cocaine with alcohol

And I guess I can't
Put the blame on you
'Cause when you're not around
Oh, the things I do, baby
And you're all I have
Think I need some help
'Cause all my nights are filled with bottles
I drink by myself (baby)

So I fuck you once
Then I fuck you twice
And I'm not okay
But I'll be okay for the night
If I sip this once
And I smoke that twice
And we're not okay
But it feels okay when we get this high
(And I'm not okay)
(But I'll be okay for the night if I sip this-)
(And we're not okay)
But it feels okay when we get this high

And when it's all done
Oh, when it's all done
I smoke it off and tell her I'm the wrong one
'Cause I don't do love
And I know what you want
I'll fuck you twice 
So, girl, I'll only tell you once

And I guess I can't (guess I can't)
Put the blame on you
'Cause when you're not around
Oh, the things I do, baby
And you're all I have (all I have)
Think I need some help
'Cause all my nights are filled with bottles
I drink by myself (baby)

So I fuck you once
Then I fuck you twice
And I'm not okay
But I'll be okay for the night
If I sip this once
And I smoke that twice
And we're not okay
But it feels okay when we get this high
(And I'm not okay)
(But I'll be okay for the night if I sip this-)
(And we're not okay)
But it feels okay when we get this high
