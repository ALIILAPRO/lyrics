		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bellows of pain
And scraping of chains
The echoes they taunt and deceive me
Oceans of blame
And rivers of shame
The fury it never leaves me

Grief in the snow
The winter of woe
Has come here to judge and bereave me
Lock up the rage
It rattles the cage
The fury it never leaves me

Always within
To lurk in the skin
The wounds ever aching so deeply
Try as I may
To hide it away
The fury it never leaves me

Long I've suffered the hunger
Long I've silenced the cry
Long I've fled from the thunder
To ascend
Still I try
To carry the pain
To keep it contained till the end

Pour out the anger and hide it away
Lest it spill to the blameless and lead them to pain
In the steel and the rags I will cover the shame
So the innocent need not be judged in my name

Long I've suffered the hunger
Long I've silenced the cry
Long I've fled from the thunder
To ascend
Still I try
To carry the pain
To keep it contained till the end

Bellows of pain
And scraping of chains
The echoes they taunt and deceive me
Oceans of blame
And rivers of shame
The fury it never leaves me
