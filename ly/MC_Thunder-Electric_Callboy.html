		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's almost 6 in the morning
Rolling out of the club
No penny left in my pocket
It went all to the shots

I'd kill for a burger
Or a cab to ride home
I'd like to call my mom
But where the fuck is my phone

Oh my god, what do my eyes spot there at the parking place?
Fine curves, good shape, nice rack
I wanna ride this impressive beauty
Every night and day
Burn all the rubbers
Better get out the way

I'm driving in a Cadillac, Cadillac
And I don't wanna give it back, give it back
I'm driving in a Cadillac, Cadillac
So fuck that, fuck that
This is not my Cadillac

It's always time for a burnout
Waiting at the McDrive
Gimme 20 chicken nuggets
And some nudes of your wife

And the night is my witness
As I drive into town
Check my new whip baby
With the V8 sound

Oh my god, what do my eyes spot there at the parking place
Fine curves, good shape, nice rack
I wanna ride this impressive beauty
Every night and day
Burn all the rubbers
Better get out the way

I'm driving in a Cadillac, Cadillac
And I don't wanna give it back, give it back
I'm driving in a Cadillac, Cadillac
So fuck that, fuck that
This is not my Cadillac

Like a brave man in tights
I only take from the rich
Call me MC Thunder
Mc Thunder

Like a brave man in tights
I only take from the rich
Call me MC Thunder
Mc Thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder, thunder 

Like a brave man in tights
I only take from the rich
Call me MC Thunder
Mc Thunder

Like a brave man in tights
I only take from the rich
Call me MC Thunder
Mc Thunder

I'm driving in a Cadillac, Cadillac
And I don't wanna give it back, give it back
I'm driving in a Cadillac, Cadillac
So fuck that, fuck that
Now this is my Cadillac
