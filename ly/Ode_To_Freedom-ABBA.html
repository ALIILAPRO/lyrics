		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I ever write my ode to freedom
It will be in prose that chimes with me
It would be a simple ode to freedom
Not pretentious, but with dignity
I would like to think that freedom is
More than just a word
In the grand and lofty language
Odes to freedom often go unheard

If I ever wrote my ode to freedom
Being privileged and spoiled for choice
Then I fear that you would be suspicious
Of the cause to which I'd lend my voice
It's elusive and it's hard to hold
It's a fleeting thing

That's why there is no ode to freedom
Truly worth remembering
I wish someone would write
An ode to freedom that we all could sing
