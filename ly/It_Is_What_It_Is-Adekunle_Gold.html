		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People wey no dey feed you
Always the first to talk about your life
Look at the irony
Shame you for public, come dey beg for side
Don't get it twisted o
I no dey kiss ass
That shit is not healthy
Keeping my distance o
Some people are worse than pandemic

If e go cost my peace
Den I go take my leave
If e no be money
Do not disturb me please
If e go cost my peace
That's some expensive shit o
If e no be money
Do not disturb me please

Majisoro, hold on
It is what it is, yeah
Mawobe, leave am

Majisoro, hold on
It is what it is, yeah
Mawobe, leave am

Money no dey bring happiness o
Na when I get money I realize o
But I no be hypocrite
I dey pray make you get your own too
See bad times will never last
Elemi lo ma last o, whoa, whoa, whoa
Life come at you so fast
Small time you don become wetin you hate o
Lowkey, they hate their lives
And they're lonely
No energy for nobody
Wey no dey happy for me, for me
Lowkey, you hate your life
And you lonely
No energy for nobody
No waste your time
Man, I no see you, yeah

If e go cost my peace
Den I go take my leave
If e no be money
Do not disturb me please
If e go cost my peace
That's some expensive shit o
If e no be money
Do not disturb me please

Majisoro, hold on
It is what it is, yeah
Mawobe, leave am

Majisoro, hold on
It is what it is, yeah
Mawobe, leave am

(Leave am)
(Leave am)
It is what it is
It is what it is
