		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I almost liked the way you fooled me
To make me feel like this would last forever
But twice a night, I'd wake up sweating
To sleep without you here would do me better

I-I, I-I
Called you out and labeled you a problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

You represent the codependence
I was down, you wore the shining armor
The side-effect is cold resentment
Tricked me into thinking you were stronger

I-I, I-I
Called you out and knew you were my problem
I-I, I-I
I should know that it takes one to know one

Hold me slowly, you don't even know me
Home now, lights out, pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and tell me that you want it bad
Hold me slowly, you don't even know me
Home now, lights out, pictures just destroy me
Come through late, and tell me that you want it bad
