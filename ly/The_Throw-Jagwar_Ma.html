		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even care, if you're in my hand
You've got something, show me what
So why should I care
You've got what I want
But I can't get to it
I keep my mind touched
Even mouth shut
Entice my love, entice my love

Searching days and feeling
Coasting through your love
Watch the running river stream
Till they call you love
Entice my love, entice my love
Entice my love, entice my love
Entice my love, entice my love
Entice my love, entice my love
Entice my love, entice my love

Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
Cause you found someone like, like the truth
