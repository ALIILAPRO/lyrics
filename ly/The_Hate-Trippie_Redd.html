		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Way too lit
Way too lit to be treated like this
Yeah, yeah

When the waters get deep you better tread lightly
Thought we was locked, I called bullshit like, "Scam likely"
You been around since we was kids, but really don't like me
Don't, huh
Nigga don't get me hype, I'm on bullshit
Gang say, "Take 'em to church," I'm at the pulpit
I say pull on my leg, tell me you pulled this
Stomach's been bubblin' up, you niggas full of shit
And I don't be tellin' the truth about you niggas
I always protect villains, I'm too good to you niggas
Sick of the high roads, I'm U-turning this bitch
'Cause you turned to a bitch, I'm too turnt for this shit

How many times I tried to give niggas the shirt off my back?
Jumpin' through hoops, thinkin' the love is gon' come hurdlin' back
I even squabbled up, ain't even asked you what the problem was
Same nigga turn around ask you for a favor, you probably turn it down
I hit LA to get a check, that's when the envy start eatin' you up
All my success start keepin' you up (tuh)

I just hold my, oh
High, high, high, high
Yeah, high, high, high, high
Yeah, high, high, high, high
Yeah
