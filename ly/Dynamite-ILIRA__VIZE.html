		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you, would you love me, would you hold me
If I told you that it hurts?
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me, so explosive?

Boom, boom, boom, boy, you better be runnin', yeah (ah-ah-ah)
Boom, boom, boom, pull the trigger with no warnin', yeah (ah-ah-ah)
Too many people
Broke my heart and I got lonely
Like Lady Monroe
I just need someone to love me when

When I'm moody in the mornin'
When I'm lonely in the night
Someone to hold me when I'm fallin'
And to love me with no pride

Boom, boom, boom
Would you, would you love me, would you hold me
If I told you that it hurts?
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me, so explosive?
Boy, you better run, run, call you like a siren
'Cause I got you under my spell (uh-uh-uh))
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me, so explosive? (Like dynamite)

Boom, boom, boom, boy, you better be runnin', yeah (ah-ah-ah)
Boom, boom, boom, pull the trigger with no warnin', yeah (ah-ah-ah)
They call me crazy
'Cause I run my mouth like Slim Shady
I got no control
I just need someone to love me when

When I'm moody in the mornin' (uhh)
When I'm lonely in the night (uh-uhh)
Someone to hold me when I'm fallin'
And to love me with no pride

Boom, boom, boom
Would you, would you love me, would you hold me
If I told you that it hurts?
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me, so explosive?
Boy, you better run, run, call you like a siren
'Cause I got you under my spell (uh-uh-uh)
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me, so explosive (like dynamite)

Boom, boom, boom

Boy, you better run, run, call you like a siren
'Cause I got you under my spell (uh-uh-uh)
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me, so explosive? (Like dynamite)
