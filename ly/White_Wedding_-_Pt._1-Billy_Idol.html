		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, who's the one you want?
Hey little sister, shotgun

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

Hey little sister, who is it you're with?
Hey little sister, what's your vice and wish?
Hey little sister, shotgun, oh yeah
Hey little sister, who's your Superman?
Hey little sister, shotgun

It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

Pick it up
Take me back home, yeah

Hey little sister, what have you done?
Hey little sister, who's the only one?
I've been away for so long (so long)
I've been away for so long (so long)
I let you go for so long

It's a nice day to start again, come on
It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again

There is nothin' fair in this world, girl
There is nothin' safe in this world
And there's nothin' sure in this world
And there's nothin' pure in this world
Look for something left in this world
Start again, come on

It's a nice day for a white wedding
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
It's a nice day to start again
