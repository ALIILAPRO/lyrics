		  (INTRO)
IM SO TIRED OF ALL THE FAKE
NEED THE RAW
IM SO TIRED OF ALL THESE SNAKES
IN MY LAWN
CHOP IT UP
TILL THEY CANT FUCK AROUND NO MORE
SHE HATE ME BUT GOD DAMN GOD DAMN....
IF I WAS YOU ID HATE ME TOO

WHY EVERYBODY ACTING COOL
FUCK ALL THAT FAKING

BITCH DONT KNOW

AND MY HEART CHILL LIKE THE POLES

(VERSE)
WHY YOU HATING

(HOOK)
IM SO TIRED OF ALL THE FAKE
NEED THE RAW
IM SO TIRED OF ALL THESE SNAKES
IN MY LAWN
CHOP IT UP
TILL THEY CANT FUCK AROUND NO MORE
SHE HATE ME
BUT GOD DAMN I HATE ME MORE
IF I WAS YOU ID HATE ME TOO
AINT GOTTA TELL EM BUT YOU KNEW
WHY EVERYBODY ACTING COOL
FUCK ALL THAT FAKING
