		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got that boot stomp, stomp doing that dosey doe
She got that honkytonk going out of control
She got them cowboys' jaws all hittin' the floor
All I know (all I know) is this ain't her first rodeo

She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)

Right out the gate, right when I seen her
Bought her a drink, man, I was sold
Yeah, she could pearl snap her fingers
And I'd get that girl whatever she wants

Look like Annie-O in that neon glow while she drop it low tonight

She got that boot stomp, stomp doing that dosey doe
She got that honkytonk going out of control
She got them cowboys' jaws all hittin' the floor
All I know (all I know), all I know (all I know)
She got me all worked up on a Saturday night
She got them jeans hangin' on like an eight second ride
She got that lasso look, baby, pullin' me close
All I know (all I know) is this ain't her first rodeo

She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)

She got me shootin' down my second triple crown
I gotta giddy up, show her what I'm about
I'm talkin' side to side, spin her around and around
'Round, 'round

She got that boot stomp, stomp doing that dosey doe
She got that honkytonk going out of control
She got them cowboys' jaws all hitting the floor
All I know (all I know), all I know (all I know)
She got me all worked up on a Saturday night
She got them jeans hangin' on like an eight second ride
She got that lasso look, baby pullin' me close
All I know (all I know) is this ain't her first rodeo

She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
She buckin' like a bronco when she get down (whoa)
