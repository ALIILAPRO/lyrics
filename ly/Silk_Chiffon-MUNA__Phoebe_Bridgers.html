		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun down and I'm feeling lifted
Downtown, cherry lipstick
Watch her silk dress dancing in the wind
Watch it brush against her skin
Makes me wanna try her on

Like, life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm out 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

I'm high and I'm feeling anxious
Inside of the CVS
When she turns 'round halfway down the aisle
With that 'you're on camera' smile
Like she wants to try me on

And life's so fun, life's so fun
Got my mini skirt and my rollerblades on
Bag on my side 'cause I'm out 'til dawn
Keeping it light like silk chiffon
Life's so fun, life's so fun
Don't need to worry about no one
She said that I got her if I want
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

It feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oh, why wouldn't it be? Oh, why wouldn't it be?
It feels good to me, it feels good to me
Oh, why wouldn't it be? Oh, why wouldn't it be?
She's so soft like silk chiffon

Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me
Silk chiffon
That's how it feels, oh, when she's on me

(Oh, when she's on me)
