		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Da da da da
Da da da da
I never lose
When I'm with you

Think I lost my mind or you could call me crazy
Think I lost my mind when I met you
Take me back to the time right when I first felt something
Take me back to the time when I met you

If we go together like drinkin' and summer
I think it'd be better if we were together
I'd fall into nothing
If you were to be there
So why don't we try it?
Us being together

Da da da da
Da da da da
I never lose
When I'm with you

Da da da da
Da da da da
I never lose
When I'm with you

Da da da da
Da da da da
You feel it too
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
You feel it too
When I'm with you

You feel it too
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
You feel it too
When I'm with you

Runnin' outta time, no, let's not waste it, baby
I lose track of time When I'm with you
Yeah
Spin the bottle, We could drink the whole thing, Mm-mm
You and me, oh yeah, That's how we do

If we go together like drinkin' and summer
I think it'd be better if we were together
I'd fall into nothing
If you were to be there
So why don't we try it?
Us being together

Da da da da
Da da da da
I never lose
When I'm with you

Da da da da
Da da da da
I never lose
When I'm with you

Da da da da
Da da da da
You feel it too
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
You feel it too
When I'm with you
When I'm with you
