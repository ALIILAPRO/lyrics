		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're breaking promises we thought we could keep
We trigger avalanches unknowingly
We travel in and out we take off, we land
We're live in airports like we don't have a plan
This is a journey and we call it home,
And when it stops we're feeling miserable, well

We're breaking promises we thought we could keep
We trigger hurricanes unwillingly
It's our fault
When it all
Breaks into everyone's lives
But are we really to blame?

It's like a pain in the chest
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy
So many people around
We disappoint and let down
And though we're trying our best

Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy

We're breaking promises we thought we could keep
We trigger avalanches unknowingly, oh
We're not so different from convicts on the run
Freedom could kill us but we'd rather go home
This is a journey and we wanna go far
They say we're selfish but this plane is on fire
We're breaking promises we wanted to keep
We trigger hurricanes unwillingly

It's our fault
When it all
Breaks into everyone's lives
Still we would do it again

It's like a pain in the chest
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy
So many people around
We disappoint and let down
And though we're trying our best
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy

Like a pain in the chest
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy
So many people around
We disappoint and let down
And though we're trying our best
Despair, Hangover and Ecstasy
Our only mission, our destiny
