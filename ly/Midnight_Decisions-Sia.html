		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we had it all?
Remember when you took my calls?
You were my whole world
You were my whole world
Not a thing said to me
Question now if my heart bleeds
You were my whole world
You were my whole world

I can't stop watching my phone
Can't turn it off
What is wrong with me? I can't, baby
But if you change your mind then I'll miss it
Now I'm crying alone
Hotel, never much fun
Not when there's nobody to catch your tears
Out here

I know
Last night we made some midnight decisions
Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't
It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions

Soothe me now, soothe me, old friend
Warm my body, dunk my head
He was my whole world
He was my whole world
Kill the chattering
Keep the voices from screaming
He was my whole world
He was my whole world

I can't stop watching my phone
Can't turn it off
What is wrong with me? I can't, baby
But if you change your mind then I'll miss it
Now I'm crying alone
Hotel, never much fun
Not when there's nobody to catch your tears
Out here

I know, last night we made some midnight decisions
Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't
It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions

Pull me out, I wanna fall
Fall into the rabbit hole
Just pull me out, the pain is great
The pain of losin' you today
I'm in here bawling, just a friend
Never thought we'd meet again
But here you are, one more, again
You're calling me
You're calling me

I know, last night we made some midnight decisions
Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't
It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
