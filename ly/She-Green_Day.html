		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She
She screams in silence
A sullen riot penetrating through her mind
Waiting for a sign to smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

She
She's figured out 
All her doubts were someone else's point of view
Waking up this time to smash the silence with the brick of self-control

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you

Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?
Scream at me until my ears bleed
I'm taking heed just for you
