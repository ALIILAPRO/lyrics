		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Portray sincerity
Act out of loyalty
Defend your true country
Wish away the pain
Hand out lobotomies, to save little families
Surrealistic fantasy
Bland boring plain

All we have is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is there hope? Please show me faster
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough up the words as you go along
And sing your song

Sickening pessimist hypocrite master
Conservative communist apocalyptic bastard
Thank you dear God for putting me on this earth
I feel very privileged in debt for my thirst

All we have is restitution
Living out your date with fusion
Is there hope? Please show me faster
Don't feel guilty, master writing

Somebody said that they're not much like I am
I know I can
Make enough up the words as you go along
And sing your song
