		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  <Lee>
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight

	<Nancy>
	Flowers growing on a hill, dragonflies and daffodils
	Learn from us very much, look at us but do not touch
	Phaedra is my name

<Lee>
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
I'm gonna open up your gate
And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
And how she gave me life
And how she made it end
Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight

	<Nancy>
	Flowers are the things we know, secrets are the things we grow
	Learn from us very much, look at us but do not touch
	Phaedra is my name

<Lee>  Some velvet mornin' when I'm straight
	<Nancy> Flowers growing on a hill
<Lee>  I'm gonna open up your gate
	<Nancy>  dragonflies and daffodils
<Lee> And maybe tell you 'bout Phaedra
	<Nancy> Learn from us very much
<Lee> And how she gave me life
	<Nancy> look at us but do not touch
FADE
<Lee> And how she made it end
