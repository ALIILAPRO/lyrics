		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these girls wanna take me away 
But I swear dem no go see my face 
Cause I know say 
Na you be the one wey I wan dey see on top my bed
Even if dem turn giveaway
Omo man go still runaway
Cause I know say 
Na you be the one way dey cool the fire on top my head o
What am I trying to say
If you leave me na craze
I no fit concentrate 
Without you in my space
Many guys for your page 
Like say na giveaway 
I just wan see your face 
Come hypnotize me 

Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down
Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down
Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down
Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down oo oo oooo o ooo Onome iyo 

Daughter of Jezebel
Make you love me as I dey
I don see hell on earth 
Please don't maximize my pain
No let my love for you 
Make me look like a fool
Reason for existing 
Na make your heart my room
So if I come your way 
Make you no run away 
I just wan see your face 
Come hypnotize me

Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down
Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down
Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down
Onome don't let me down
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down oo oo oooo o Onome iyo 

Don't let me down o ahh
Don't let me down o ahh ahh
Don't let me down o ahh
Don't let me down o ahhah 
Don't let me down o ahh
Don't let me down o ahhah
