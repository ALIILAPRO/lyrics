		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girlfriend
I'm gonna tell your boyfriend, yeah
Tell him (yoo-hoo)
Exactly what we're doin', yeah
Tell him what you do to me
Late at night when the wind is free 

Girlfriend
I'm gonna show your boyfriend, yeah
Show him (yoo-hoo)
The letters I've been savin', yeah
Show him how you feel inside
And how love could not be denied, oh no

We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, ha
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, ooh
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, woo

We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine

Girlfriend
You better tell your boyfriend, yeah
Tell him (yoo-hoo)
Exactly what we're doin', yeah
Tell him what he needs to know
Or he may never let you go, yeah

We're gonna have to tell him
You'll only be a girlfriend of mine, ha
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, hoo
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, yeah, yeah, yeah
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, yoo-hoo

I'm gonna be your boyfriend
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do (yoo-hoo)
You be my girlfriend, girlfriend
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do (yoo-hoo), woo
Do-doot-do-do-do-do-doot-do-do-do, woo
