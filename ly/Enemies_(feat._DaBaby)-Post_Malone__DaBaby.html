		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Used to have friends now I got enemies (ooh)
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me (damn)
Used to have friends now I got enemies (ooh)
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah (shut the fuck up)
So, where did y'all go?
When I was shit broke couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show (stadium show)
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh

I know it's hard
To swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I

Used to have friends now I got enemies (damn)
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (damn)
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

Close to my enemies (let's go)
I need better energy (huh?)
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh? (Yeah, yeah)
But I meant the shit literally
She wanted to vibe, but I told her fuck that (nope)
She look at me like she surprised
The pack in the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners
They turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
If you reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Give a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga, I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he fold, and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know your bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy your bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck her on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
And I

Used to have friends now I got enemies (damn)
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (ooh)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (damn)
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

It's too late to turn this shit around (it's too late)
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around (it's too late)
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now

Used to have friends now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close now they dead to me (dead to me)
Money tend to show all they tendencies (tendencies)
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Sometimes, every time, they let me down
Used to have friends now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah it's so sad

Ooh, it's too late
It's too late
