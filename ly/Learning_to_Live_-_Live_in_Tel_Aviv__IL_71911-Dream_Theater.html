		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was no time for pain 
No energy for anger 
The sightlessness of hatred slips away 
Walking through winter streets alone 
He stops and takes a breath 
With confidence and self-control 

I look at the world and see no understanding 
I'm waiting to find some sense of strength 
I'm begging you from the bottom of my heart 
To show me understanding 

I need to live life 
Like some people never will 
So find me kindness 
Find me beauty 
Find me truth 
When temptation brings me to my knees 
And I lay here drained of strength 
Show me kindness 
Show me beauty 
Show me truth 

The way your heart sounds 
Makes all the difference 
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel 
The way your heart beats 
Makes all the difference 
In learning to live 

Here before me is my soul 
I'm learning to live 
I won't give up till I've no more to give 
No more to give 

Listening to the city 
Whispering its violence 
I set out watching from above 
The 90's bring new questions 
New solutions to be found 
I fell in love to be let down 

Once again we dance in the crowd 
At times a step away 
From a common fear that's all spread out 
It won't listen to what you say 
Once you're touched you stand alone 
To face the bitter fight 
Once I reached for love 
And now I reach for life 

Another chance to lift my life 
Free the sensation in my heart 
To ride the wings of dreams 
Into changing horizons 
It brings inner peace within my mind 
As I'm lifted from where I spilt my life 
I hear an innocent voice 
I hear kindness, beauty and truth 
  

The way your heart sounds 
Makes all the difference 
It's what decides if you'll endure the pain that we all feel 
The way your heart beats 
Makes all the difference 
In learning to live 

Spread before you is your soul 
So forever hold the dreams within our hearts 
Through nature's inflexible grace 
I'm learning to live
