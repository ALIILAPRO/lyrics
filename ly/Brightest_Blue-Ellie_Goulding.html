		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everything is heightened now
It's looking so much brighter now
I was lost and now I'm found
Fell off the merry-go-round
I was in the politics
Obsessed with things I couldn't fix
Kissing bigger with a fist
Addicted to the thrill of it

And with these colors fading
People changing feelings
Faking some kind of love
A different flavor, seek the danger
Feeling life rush into my blood
Illuminated never shaded
See the future when I look in the sky
When I look in the sky, you give me
You give me

The brightest (blue, blue, blue, blue) 
The brightest (blue, blue)
Tonight (blue, blue)
Give me the brightest (blue, blue, blue, blue)
The brightest (blue, blue)
So bright (blue, blue)

There's no blue in the odyssey
Even in the calmest seas
Now it's all I wanna be
A semi-precious mystery
Yeah, I love me more than you
Doesn't mean I can't be true
Slip into the blue lagoons
I could be your muse

Times are hard, people scarred
We don't know if we're gonna fight
Break a heart, play the card
We just came along for the ride
But in the dark, you're the spark
See the future when I look in your eyes
'Cause you've given me, you give me
You give me

The brightest (blue, blue, blue, blue) 
The brightest (blue, blue)
Tonight (blue, blue)
Give me the brightest (blue, blue, blue, blue)
The brightest (blue, blue)
So bright (blue, blue)

Don't you worry about the future
'Cause this is the blue evolution
I don't think this love's an illusion
So let's wake up
Don't you worry about the future
'Cause this is the blue evolution
I finally see you're my greatest
You're my greatest revelation

The brightest (blue, blue, blue, blue) 
The brightest (blue, blue)
Tonight (blue, blue)
Give me the brightest (blue, blue, blue, blue)
The brightest (blue, blue)
So bright (blue, blue)
