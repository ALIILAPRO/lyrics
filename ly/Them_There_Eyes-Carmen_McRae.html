		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love with you the first time I looked into them there eyes
And you have a certain lil cute way of flirtin' with them there eyes
They make me feel so happy, they make me feel so blue
I'm fallin', no stallin' in a great big way for you

My heart is jumpin' you started somethin' with them there eyes
You'd better look out little brown eyes if you're wise
They sparkle, they bubble, they're gonna get you
In a whole lot of trouble, oh baby, them there eyes

I fell in love with you the first time I looked into
You have a certain lil cute way of flirtin'
They make me feel so happy, they make me feel so blue
Fallin', no stallin' in a great big way for you

My heart is jumpin' you started somethin' with them there eyes
You'd better look out little brown eyes if you're wise
Sparkle, bubble, get you in a whole lot of trouble
I'm lookin' for the boy with the wistful eyes
I fell in love with them there eyes
