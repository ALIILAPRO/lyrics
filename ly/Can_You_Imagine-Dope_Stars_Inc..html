		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thounsads of stars surround
this world and i allways
wonder where the border
gets to the end.
Thousands of questions in my head.

How many times you have been standing
in front of millions lights still flashing
lights years away?
down to hole of time and space.

How can you tell where all this world end
matter and form or just disorder
filling this space.
Multidimensional arrays
just take a trip and try to imagine
how many stars that now keep flashing
vanished away
down to the universe embrace

[Chorus]
Can you imagine worlds
so many miles away from here?
How many different words
how many ways to feel the same.
Can you imagine words
so many miles away from here
but i would bet for sure
the meaning of love is still,
is still the same.

Thounsads of stars surround
this world and i allways
wonder where the border
gets to the end.
Thousands of questions in my head.

How many times you have been standing
in front of millions lights still flashing
lights years away?
down to hole of time and space.

[Chorus]
Can you imagine worlds
so many miles away from here?
How many different words
how many ways to feel the same.
Can you imagine words
so many miles away from here
but i would bet for sure
the meaning of love is still,
is still the same.
