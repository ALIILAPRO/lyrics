		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who would you die for? Who would you lie for, lie for?
This ain't the Bible, 'cause I got a rifle, rifle
Don't ever fuck with me, 'cause I got enemies, I got enemies
Nobody's there for me
So, Father, forgive me, for You know that I am always sinnin'
I take no interest, partyin' with liquor, fuckin' up my system
Excuse my language, that's a hang-up on how shitty I been feelin'
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
'Cause I've been so low for so long
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah
'Cause I've been so low for so long
Oh, oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who do you ride for? Who do you cry for, cry for?
It's now or never, gotta keep it together, oh Lord
It's takin' over me, 'cause I got enemies, I got enemies
Nobody's there for me
So, Father, forgive me, for You know that I am always sinnin'
I take no interest, partyin' with liquor, fuckin' up my system
Excuse my language, that's a hang-up on how shitty I been feelin'
I'm sorry I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
'Cause I've been so low for so long
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah
'Cause I've been so low for so long
Oh, oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
You do know I
I tried my best, yeah
Only to fuck up
Going in and out of love
Burning rubber, ridin' solo, yeah, head too fucked up
Tell me what you really want from me- is that too much?
Is that too much? Is that too much?
'Cause I've been so low for so long
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah
'Cause I've been so low for so long
Oh, oh-oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
(So low)
(So low)
