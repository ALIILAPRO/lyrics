		  Breathe
Breathe
Ain't too many pics
Bluetooth don't send me none
Press know who in this whip
Please roll these windows up

White truck I'm poppin' out
Black truck come pick me up
G-town jawn she eat me up
Deep down, said
Breathe

I ran them boys into hiding
Don't war with the block
If them boys ain't about it
Got work in the hoods
And got hoods in the tropics
I walk in the projects with 400.000
She got me she won
Now she want a deposit

Got whips with no mileage
them hoes wanna drive
Three for the five
You can shoot him a dime
We got chutes with the ladders
It's more if we sliding
Breathe

they want exotic hoes
I want dracos and women who not in vogue
Wipe my denim tears off with the cotton clothes
Got designer homies I could huuu haaa
Black on black Sprinter when I, leave
I don't do dinner to talk, eat
Jumped up the window my front, seat
Now she wann suck in they gut, breathe

I can make them hoes stop breathing
Breathe
I can make them hoes stop
Breathe
I can make them hoes stop breathing
Breathe
Half a box of chocs can make them hoes stop
Breathe

Now she trynna fuck
But ain't got friends for my niggas
Okay, plans I need kan
'Fore she cancel her twitter, mmm
Fans on deliver, mmm
candle her liquor she said
I can't call her bae
Till I see bands bands bands
Ok bet
I got more trucks than Obama
No funny sh!T
I got a presi full diamonds
No funny sh!T
I keep 2 watches no time for
No funny sh!T
35 thousand can't slide in
No money slip

I went from popping to pulished
can't pop out in public
she rocking a bucket
Got shops in the driveway
That baccarat covered
You locked the cops
You can stop all that puffing say
Breathe

Don't get the door cuz the feds on it, feds aye
Seven thirty seven, it's a bed on it, bed aye
Marble counter top I spent some bread on it, bread aye
B!tch you bet not try to put your legs on it
Breathe

I can make them hoes stop breathing
Breathe
I can make them hoes stop
Breathe
I can make them hoes stop breathing
Breathe
Half a box of chocs can make them hoes stop
Breathe
Take a deep breath in
Breathe
Relax your mind
Inhale, breathe
Just don't forget
To stop breathe
