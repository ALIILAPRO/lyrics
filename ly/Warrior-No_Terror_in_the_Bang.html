		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poor little thing, tiny, thin
Though you already know how to sin

You are really young
However you are so strong
Screaming from the top of your lungs

Here you just went to bloom
Right in front of the gloom
You enter a new world
Leaving behind a dark room

But you've gone through a lot
Right on the target you've been shot
The remembrance that kills won't ever be the final dot

Cos' little thing you're now a warrior
In your skin there's something that's still warm
That'll do anything to expel harm
Ready to fight, throwing up your arm

You're looking for
An adventure of freedom
Your feet show you
The way to an ice cold kingdom
Knowing that here
Every step's breaking the universe down

Trampled the grown harder than ever
Everywhere you go you sow terror

Are you willing now to fight the chaos ?
In this land full of hideous bugs
Monsters and vile creatures
Are waiting to eat you up
But there's nothing new for you
Evil tracks you down since the day you were born
But the rage inside your body
Won't ever be defeated

Poor little thing, tiny, thin
Though you already know how to win

Here you just went to bloom
Right in front of the gloom
You enter a new world
Leaving behind a dark room

But you've gone through a lot
Right on the target you've been shot
The remembrance that kills won't ever be the final dot

Everywhere you go you sow terror
Everywhere you go you sow terror (terror)
