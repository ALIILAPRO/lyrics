		<p>
		  Yeah, ooh

Don't try to forget me, I wanna be in your life
I wanna keep you but you think you're wastin' time
You're gonna miss me when I won't be there tonight
I trust in your decision, I know you can do what's right

Yeah, yeah, I know I could be a dog
I didn't return your calls
So I commend you for puttin' up with me
You and I been through it all
Girl, you paid the cost
So why'd you choose right now to up and leave?
(Don't try to forget me)

Don't try to forget me, I wanna be in your life (oh)
I wanna keep you but you think you're wastin' time
You're gonna miss me when I won't be there tonight
I trust in your decision, I know you can do what's right
Don't try to forget me, I wanna be in your life (oh)
I wanna keep you but you think you're wastin' time
You're gonna miss me when I won't be there tonight
I trust in your decision, I know you can do what's right
