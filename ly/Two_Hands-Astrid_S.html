		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I get angry I don't shout, I start hysterically crying
Can't hold it back when I'm trying
And when I'm sad, I wanna go out and get so drunk I can't even stand
And you probably can't even stand it

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) you're lucky if I let you sleep
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm a nightmare but

I'll give you a feeling (like no one can)
Both hands on the wheel, I'm (gonna drive you mad)
If I'm too much to handle (I understand)
'Cause I know I'm a handful (ah)
But that's why you got two hands

(That's why you've got two hands)

When I'm in the mood, I'm on the moon
So high on myself, I'm up in the air
Like, "How is it going down there?"
If I'm a mistake, that's okay
'Cause I'll just make you wanna make it
Over and over and over again

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) you're lucky if I let you sleep
(Ooh-ooh-ooh) I'm a nightmare but

I'll give you a feeling (like no one can)
Both hands on the wheel, I'm (gonna drive you mad)
If I'm too much to handle (I understand)
'Cause I know I'm a handful (ah)
But that's why you got two hands

(That's why you've got two hands)

Say the word and I'll take you there
I'll be the time of your life, I swear
Close your eyes and just take the chance
I'm the reason you got two hands
Highs and lows with no in-betweens
Ride or die, you know what I mean
Close your eyes and just take the chance

I'll give you a feeling like no one can
Both hands on the wheel, I'm gonna drive you mad
If I'm too much to handle, I understand
'Cause I know I'm a handful (ah)
But that's why you got two hands

(That's why you've got two hands)
