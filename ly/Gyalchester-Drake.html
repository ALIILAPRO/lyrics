		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hermès link, ice blue mink (woo)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is (yeah)
They want me gone, wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger 
That's word to my nigga (woo)

Yeah, October Firm in the cut (yeah)
Stay at the top like I'm stuck 
That's just how I'm giving it up
She wanna get married tonight 
But I can't take a knee 'cause I'm wearing all white
Me and my broski are twins but we don't look alike
I don't take naps
Me and the money are way too attached to go and do that
Muscle relax (hahaha)
That and a spliff put me right on my back, I gotta unpack (yeah)
Virginia Black (doo-doo)
I could go make enough money off that and not even rap
What's that? Facts (facts, nigga, yeah)
Contract max, I gotta bring that shit back (blatt)

Hermès link (woo, woo), ice blue mink (yeah)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone, out of the picture (yeah)
Bury me now and I only get bigger 
That's word to my, word to my

I'm so hot, yeah, I'm so right now (right now)
Who's not gang bitch? Let me find out (ha)
Keep hearing clicks when I'm talkin' on the iPhone
Feds in the city hate to see us on a high note (woo)
I switch flow like I switch time zone
Can't get Nobu, but you can get Milestone (Baka)
I gotta do it mansion, 'cause I outgrew condo
Gotta do Maybach, she wan' fuck on the drive home
Yeah, met her once and I got through (yeah)
I'm never washed, but I'm not new
I know I said top five, but I'm top two
And I'm not two and I got one
Thought you had one, but it's not one, nigga, nah

Hermès link, ice blue mink (yeah)
Tat on my ribs like I do not know what permanent is
They want me gone (gone, gone), wait for the kicker
Bury me now and I only get bigger 
That's word to my nigga (woo, woo)
(Yeah)
