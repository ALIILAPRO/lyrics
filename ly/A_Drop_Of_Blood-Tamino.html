		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen the trees
In heart of storm
In clearest skies
I've seen them breathe 
I've seen them fall
I've seen them fly

The gentle breeze that stirs their crown
Flows from the storm that lays them down
Oh, may we fight
And may we waltz
And may we find harmony
Like wind and tree

I've seen the sea 
Give men a home
And drown them too
I've seen her lead
Men back to shore 
To start anew

But it's never long before 
An old yearning rises for
The cradled nights
The siren's call
Let me always return to thee
Like sailors to the sea 

One day I fell 
And broke my wrist
lay still on the ground
Ants were carrying little twigs
Over my still hand
Some kids around were scorning me 
Yet I heard no sound
Then as they started to kick my back
I sank into the sand

Deep down, sank deep down
'Til I was part of everything 
And in a grain of sand, saw peace in holy land 
and saw you right in front of me
Shapeless, sacred dust, beaming light and trust
Covering all harm in shade
Then in a drop of blood 
Saw wars be fought for good
And saw you make way for man's truth 

Just for a while
Though just enough 
To lose my youth 
From that day on
I've been corrupt

For I've held on to faith
And I've been knocking on its gate
To let me see you one more time
Begging to never speak the truth
More than I speak of you
