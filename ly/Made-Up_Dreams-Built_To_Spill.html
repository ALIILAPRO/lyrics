		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These thoughts are old
Let's keep it cold
Dry lines on me
Dry history
Dryology 

That stupid sound
That awful feel
Don't bring them down
And it never will
No it never will
No it never will
No it never will 

Hard to believe
That after all this time
That after all this I'm
Still me 

No one wants to hear
What you dreamt about unless you dreamt about them
Don't let that stop you
Tell them anyway
And you can make it up as you go
I'm already gone now
You were outside just waiting
I'm already nothing
You just noticed me fading
It takes a lot to make me crazy
And a lot is always going on
