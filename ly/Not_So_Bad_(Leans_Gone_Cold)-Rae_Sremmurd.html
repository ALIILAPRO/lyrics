		  (Three-point-five clouds up my window, and I can't see it all)
(Paddy on the track)
(It reminds me that it's not so bad)

My lean's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all
Three-point-five clouds up my window, and I can't see at all
And even if I could, it would all be grey
But these racks stack up too tall (yeah)
It reminds me (Reminds me), that it's not so bad, it's not so bad at all

Fuck sittin' on the windows, been playin' with the bands, like Dido (Dido)
I don't smoke weed, indoor by my lonely, like a widow (widow)
Ice cubes, pour me some more (oh), she pop like a pistol (oh)
Restart, new vehicle, I done jumped out, G.I. Joe
God forgives, but I don't (I don't), Lord, have mercy, I don't (oh)
Big shot, big dog, block too hot, gotta cool off (cool off)
Cctv runnin' 24/7, you better not move wrong (move wrong)
I can see the wallet, chain hangin' off my shadow (shadow)
Usd's in euros, I do 'em so fast, do free-throws (free-throws)
Just left the jeweler, weigh my neck down with two kilos (kilo)
It's you, it's not me though, speed limit sixty, over
Twist up three-point-five and I smell older, I'm in the ozone

My lean's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all
Three-point-five clouds up my window, and I can't see at all
And even if I could, it would all be grey
But these racks stack up too tall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad at all

Started off in last place (last place), started passin' niggas (zoom)
I always had faith (had faith), never saw no competition (yeah)
Never saw no competition (competition)
And lately, I don't know why I've been reminiscin', yeah (reminiscin')
More money, more problems (more problems)
Well, I think I like those problems (those problems)
Yeah, they see me winnin' now
But you ain't see me when I was starvin' (yeah)
You ain't know me at the bottom (Bottom)
You weren't with me on that grind (grind)
Couldn't call you when I was hurtin'
So ain't gon' call you when I shine (yeah, yeah)
The lean's gone cold (gone cold)
The lean's gone cold, 'cause I don't pour up anymore (no)
Eyes so low, that I can't roll up anymore
But I'm a lonely stoner, so I'm still gon' smoke one more

My lean's gone cold, I'm wonderin' why I got out of bed at all
Three-point-five clouds up my window (ayy), and I can't see at all (yeah)
And even if I could, it would all be grey
But these racks stack up too tall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad at all

(Bad at all)
(Bad at all)
(Bad at all)
(Bad at all)
