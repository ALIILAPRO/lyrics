		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The music taking me higher
Moving my body
You turning it up yeah (Becky G!)
I can't get enough yeah (Mister WorldWide!)
I'm feeling inspired (y'all know the game plan)
Don't want you to stop it (it's the world)
You turning it up yeah (in the palm of my hand)
I can't get enough yeah

Yeah, Pit thanks for the introduction
When I rap no interruption
From the back going in the front now
Fired up, too hot to touch, ow
Little miss 3-1-O
Can't tell, we're about to blow
Jump on if you're ready to go
Up, up and around the globe

Quiero ver toda mi gente
Cali girls get muy caliente
Oh, we so diferente
Hands up from the back to the frente
Don't matter what you're repping man
Inglewood to the foreign land
All night long and do it again
All night long and do it again

The music is taking me higher
Moving my body
I keep turning it up, yeah
I can't get enough, yeah
I'm feeling inspired
Don't want you to stop it
Keep turning it up, yeah
I can't get enough, yeah

We dance in the streets
We rock to the beat
We sing from our hearts
Got this on repeat
We're all off our seats
We dance for the stars

P to the I, I to the T
I see the future Becky to the G
I own companies, yeah, that's sweet
I also wanna coach her, yeah, that's me
I see the vultures I love them to death
It's for the queen, you shout out the meth
The world is mine, who wanna bet?
4, 5, 6 I'm stopping to bank
I see them boys switching their plans
'Cause they see the way I'm flipping the game
I'm Jordan, their pimping man
I'm scoring they slipping, man
They falling and tripping, man
Come on baby, let's do this thing
All night long and do it again
All night long and do it again

The music is taking me higher
Moving my body
I keep turning it up, yeah
I can't get enough, yeah
I'm feeling inspired
Don't want you to stop it
Keep turning it up, yeah
I can't get enough, yeah

We dance in the streets
We rock to the beat
We sing from our hearts
Got this on repeat
We're all off our seats
We dance for the stars

We got that fire
They want that fire
Let's give 'em that fire, fire
Tenemos, fuego
Quieren, fuego
A que dales fuego, fuego

We got that fire
They want that fire
Let's give 'em that fire, fire
Tenemos, fuego
Quieren, fuego
A que dales fuego, fuego

The music is taking me higher
Moving my body
I keep turning it up, yeah
I can't get enough, yeah
I'm feeling inspired
Don't want you to stop it
I keep turning it up, yeah
I can't get enough, yeah

We dance in the streets
We rock to the beat
We sing from our hearts
Got this on repeat
We're all off our seats
We dance for the stars

Keep turning it up, yeah I can't get enough, yeah
Keep turning it up, yeah I can't get enough, yeah
