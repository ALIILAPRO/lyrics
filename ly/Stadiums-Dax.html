		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Dax oh, yeah (LexNour)

Back when the times was hard, I swear, nigga
I was savin' up
I stayed in my lane, ridin' on the wave
'til I I knew I was brave enough
Hangin' out too late
Mama used to pray that her
Son would make it up
Now I'm graduated school
Going on tour sellin' out stadiums

I was never one to brag a lot
Head down when I'd splash the mop
Flow wet, that's a after thought
Same feelin' when I crash the yacht
Put my foot up in the
Game, crossin' off names
Promise that I can't stop
All I do is drop hit's, people throw fit's
'cause they know they can't top
All I see is people hate
I don't pay it 'less I go to the bank
I won't never give those people a chance
Jealousy is weak and I don't relate
All the people tryna clown me are fake
Same people wanna eat off my plate
You will never get the time of day
I'm too busy going state to state

I'm promise you niggas I'm
Buildin' a dynasty, yeah
My success is payback
I don't know what you say
'cause my language is foreign
I speak what is written on paychecks
I invest in myself
My money and wealth connect
My life is a racetrack
I spit gas, deliver, I mail, man
Reign supreme, I hit like hail, man
I don't stop, I'm on but go off
I get paid to breathe and write songs
You not on my level, I blast off
Ain't it funny? I used to get passed on
Now they all call me for help
I tell 'em to deal with
The hand they were dealt
You fuckin' people never knew how I felt
I didn't complain and went and got it myself
Now I'm off that
Got drive, you can check it on Carfax
I remember days people wouldn't call back
Now they see me on TV, wanna call Dax
You gon' have to CC me on the PC
My fees times three, what you mean? Fall back
You gon' have to CC me on the PC
My fees times three, what you mean?
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back

I was never one to brag a lot
Head down when I'd splash the mop
Flow wet, that's a after thought
Same feelin' when I crash the yacht
Put my foot up in the
Game, crossin' off names
Promise that I can't stop
All I do is drop hit's, people throw fit's
'cause they know they can't top
All I see is people hate
I don't pay it 'less I go to the bank
I won't never give those people a chance
Jealousy is weak and I don't relate
All the people tryna clown me are fake
Same people wanna eat off my plate
You will never get the time of day
I'm too busy going state to state

-State, so stay away from me
You ain't never even gonna get a day from me
Everybody want it
Don't know what it take to be
You don't know what I did, I basically
Built a name myself, can't label me
Self-funded, I'm payin' me
I'm independent, baby greatest in the making
And I won't switch, I'm already rich
Constipated when it comes to the money
I don't give a shit, give it to charity
Give it to God, reverse His Name
That's you, a bitch, if you hatin' on a kid
People said I wouldn't make it
Look what I did, look how I live
Concentrated on myself and I put all
My time in these writ's
So if I don't got time for games
Just remember I drive in a different lane
I don't care if we human
We focused on different things we
Are not in the same
I see all the hate, I see all the fakes
I live in they brains, they live on my page
They chasin' the fame, I cannot relate
I'm changin' the game

I was never one to brag a lot
Head down when I'd splash the mop
Flow wet, that's a after thought
Same feelin' when I crash the yacht
Put my foot up in the
Game, crossin' off names
Promise that I can't stop
All I do is drop hit's, people throw fit's
'cause they know they can't top
All I see is people hate
I don't pay it 'less I go to the bank
I won't never give those people a chance
Jealousy is weak and I don't relate
All the people tryna clown me are fake
Same people wanna eat off my plate
You will never get the time of day
I'm too busy going state to state
