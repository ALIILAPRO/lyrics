		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might just call and catch a plane I might just come see you today
You hate I'm stuck up in my ways but love it when I'm playing games
That's the only way we get away We stuck together, you mines forever
That's why I cannot go away I'll leave you screaming anything

You'll find a way to keep me in Make me think you threw some magic in it
Act like you did it, mm-hmm, yeah Don't be tripping, I'll be there in a minute
You itty-bitty, and I'll be there
I might just call and catch a plane I might just come see you today

You ain't I'm stuck up in my ways We love it when I'm playing games
That's the only way we get away We stuck together, you might as forever
That's why I cannot go away I'll leave you screaming anything
You'll find a way to keep me in Make me think you threw some magic in it

Act like you did it, mm-hmm, yeah Don't be tripping, I'll be there in a minute
You itty-bitty, and I'll be there
