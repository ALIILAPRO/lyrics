		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening

Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine

We see people, brand-new people
They're something to see

Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?

Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town

Nightclubbing, we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost

We learn dances, brand-new dances
Like the nuclear bomb

When we're nightclubbing, bright-white clubbing
Oh, isn't it wild?
