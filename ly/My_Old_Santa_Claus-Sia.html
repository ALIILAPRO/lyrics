		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, I woke up and I watched the snow fall from my sky
Babe, I woke up and I felt a tear slip from my eye
Babe, I woke up and I wished for just another night
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no

Babe, I can hardly breathe without you right next to me
Babe, I can hardly breathe, who'll carry my Christmas tree?
Babe, I can hardly breathe, wish I hadn't let you leave
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no

Oh, it's so chilly without you near me
My everyday Santa Claus
So, baby, come quickly
It's starting to heal me
I need my old Santa Claus

Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?

Babe, I woke up solo, wished I hadn't let you go
Babe, I woke up solo, saw your footsteps in the snow
Babe, I woke up solo, loved you so, I loved you so
No-no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no-no

Oh, it's so chilly without you near me
My everyday Santa Claus
So, baby, come quickly
It's starting to heal me
I need my old Santa Claus

Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?

Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
Well, if this is what the season is bringing, then
I gotta shoot through
I gotta shoot through
'Cause if Christmas is so green and so red, then
Why am I so blue?
Why am I so blue?
