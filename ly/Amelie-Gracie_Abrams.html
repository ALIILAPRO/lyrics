		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a girl once
She sort of ripped me open
She doesn't even know it
She doesn't know my name
We sat on the sofa
She asked me a million questions
I answered and by eleven
Memorized her face

Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know

Why'd it feel louder
When all of it went unspoken?
All I can do is hope that
This will go away
She had her hair up
She cried about her obsessions
But she doesn't know I'd let her
Ruin all my days

Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
Tell me no

Tell me more, I would give all my time
All your words felt like a nursery rhyme
Comfortable, handing you my whole life
When all your words felt like a funeral rite

So where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know

So where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
I don't know, oh
Where did you go
Amelie, Amelie, Amelie?
Where'd you go?
Or were you all in a dream
Amelie, Amelie?
Tell me no
