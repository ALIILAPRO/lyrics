		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone crashed the party, baby
Someone left the light on
Someone tipped the bottle over
And now all the wine's gone

But how sweet, sweet, sweet it'd be, be, be
Just to dream, dream, dream
Next to me, me, me you speak, speak, speak
You're asleep, sleep, sleep
Not to me, me, me not to me, me, me

Someone's on the bathroom tiles
Someonе's in the backyard
Someone ran homе empty handed
Someone bagged the rockstar

But how sweet, sweet, sweet it'd be, be, be
Just to dream, dream, dream
Next to me, me, me you speak, speak, speak
You're asleep, sleep, sleep
Not to me, me, me not to me, me, me
