		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see your face I feel some type of way
I can't help it, I can't help it
Every time you come around we celebrate
We can't help it, we can't help it oh yeah

Bailando contigo te quiero i want you more
Que quando bebero te quiero i want you more

I want you more the more, more
I touch you, I kiss you, I love you
I want you more

I want you more

I want you more

I know you know me more than I know myself
And you're honest (yes, you're honest)
Eh eh
And if only you know I don't need nobody else
And that's a promise (that's a promise)
Oh yeah

Bailando contigo te quiero i want you more
Que quando bebero te quiero i want you more

I want you more the more, more
I touch you, I kiss you, I love you
I want you more

I want you more

I want you more

When you call my name and I see your face
Why? I love it why? I love it
Eh, here's to better days now we celebrate
Why? I love it why? I love it
Eh

I touch you, I kiss you, I love you
I want you more

I want you more

I want you more
