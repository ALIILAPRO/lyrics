		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Tried to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kind of hard to face
Like actual facts and flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly same, it's macro, micro
Crack your ad and let your light glow
One day you can be the king of pop
And the next one just be wack ol' Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Ooh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologize, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality, yeah)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality (oh oh oh oh oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality (oh oh oh oh oh)
