		  Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah

(You ain't nothin' but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothin' but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
(You ain't nothin' but a)

Player gettin' valeted around in that ho whip
Two fingers up, one down with my toes ten
Flewed out with my boobs out, put a cork in it
Love it when you be cryin' out when I'm corseted
I don't think you gon' make it, do not let me start ragin'
I'm losin' my patience, this ain't stayin' in Vegas (you ain't nothin' but a)
There's more sides to the story, I'ma tell everybody
Had your ass sittin' courtside with your arm around me
Had your ass sittin' first class with your burnt ass out in Abu Dhabi
Could've been what we should've been, but you lost a bet, now you gotta find me
Find a seat, I ain't playin' this hide and seek
High school when you finally peaked
Hound dog, come find a treat
I'm a bad bitch, but (you ain't nothin' but a)

Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothin' but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

Yeah, yeah, said (you ain't nothin' but a)
I get it, I know you got some other- you wanted
I get it, you needed someone that could prove you wrong
So I reckon, you leave all of your problems at the door to my city
You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks
When I release you in them streets (you ain't nothin' but a)
And keep my nina in discrete, keep the cleanin' my Jeep
And put that Yeezy in your teeth, let my demons off they leashes
If you even think to speak I'ma give a whole new meaning
When you said you live in a dream, we can keep that- asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R-I-P (you ain't nothin' but a)

Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothin' but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog
(You ain't nothin' but a)
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
(You ain't nothin' but a)
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

(La-da-da-da) you ain't nothin' but a
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, yeah, ah, get it
Yeah, you ain't nothin' but a
