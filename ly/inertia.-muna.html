		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a sip of the drink
Strike a pose with a pole
Blood leaks from the folds of my nose
In the holes in the sink
Nowadays I don't know to think
Feel like I'm getting close to the brink
Going to step off the edge, get it like
Going to skate outside in the dead of night
Going to do it again to get it right
Get a light and a candle
And I know that there ain't nothing that I can't do
If I plan to, shoot, even getting cancelled

Because I'm the goat with the wordplay
Man, pull up to my crib about thursday
Got a couple drinks if you thirsty
I need more friends
I don't need like 10
I just need like 2
And I'll be content
I'm flowing so lazy, so easy
It feels like some smooth motion
Executing inertia
If I pull up on you I won't hurt you
Practicing lines like rehearsal
Pen to the paper, write it in cursive
Spaz on these verses
This ain't no, this ain't no surface
Boy this is deeper than that
It's deeper than rap
I ain't talking sweat or tears
I'll bleed on the track
Riding through the city cruising
With my feet on the dash
They be saying I got flows
Like we don't know that
I already know I'm the GOAT
Let the people know that
Lay back and play on my piccolo
But we know he won't beat Goku tho, just saying
Heh, more like Super Saiyan
You know we turning up when Muna playing
