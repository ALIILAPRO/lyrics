		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only smoke weed when I need to
And I need to get some rest, yo, where's the sex
I confess, I burnt a hole in your mattress
Yes, yes, it was me, I plead guilty

And at the count of three I pull back the duvet
And make my way to the refrigerator
One dry potato inside, no lie
Not even bread, jam
When the light above my head went bam

I can't get no sleep

I can't sleep something's all over me
Greasy, insomnia please release me
And let me dream about making mad love on the heath

Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no relief
I'm wide awake in my kitchen
It's black and I'm lonely
Oh if I could only get some sleep
Creaky noises make my skin creep
I need to get some sleep
I can't get no sleep

No sleep
I can't get no sleep
No sleep
I can't get no sleep
