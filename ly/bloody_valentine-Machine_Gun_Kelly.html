		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, the simulation just went bad
But you're the best I ever had
Like handprints in wet cement
She touched me, it's permanent

In my head, in my head
I couldn't hear anything you said, but
In my head, in my head
I'm callin' you, "Girlfriend," what the fuck?

I don't do fake love, but I'll take some from you tonight
I know I've got to go but I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

I'm overstimulated and I'm sad
I don't expect you to understand
It's nothing less than true romance
Or am I just making a mess

In my head, in my head
I'm lying naked with you, yeah
In my head, in my head
I'm ready to die holding your hand

I don't do fake love, but I'll take some from you tonight (take some from you tonight)
I know I've got to go but I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight

I can't hide
How I feel about you
Inside
I'd give everything up
Tonight
If I could just have you be mine
Be mine, baby 

I can't hide
How I feel about you
Inside
I'd give everything up
Tonight
If I could just have you be mine
Be mine

Ayy, I don't do fake love, but I'll take some from you tonight (take some from you tonight)
I know I've got to go, but I might just miss the flight
I can't stay forever, let's play pretend
And treat this night like it'll happen again
You'll be my bloody valentine tonight
