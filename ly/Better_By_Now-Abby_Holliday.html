		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The same time for the 3rd day this week
Maybe this will be the one where my feelings change
Your hand in mine in the passenger seat
Convincing you that it'll stay the same
But it won't stay the same

'Cause I don't feel it
I was hoping you could help me
Get where you are, fix where I'm not
But it's not like that
I don't wanna fight the feeling
Should this be easy?

Do I even love you?
I think I love you
But I should love you better by now
I should love you better by now
I should've figured it all out
I don't need you as much as I need to
And I don't miss you enough when you're not around
If I don't love you better by now, I don't think I'll ever know how

They say, "When you know you know"
Well maybe I don't know myself
I'll admit that I'm afraid I wouldn't even cry
If I saw you driving around with somebody else

It's so selfish
That I don't want the consequence
But how come when I tell you I love you
I say it under my breath
Like there's a secret that I'm keeping from myself

Do I even love you?
I think I love you
But I should love you better by now
I should love you better by now
I should've figured it all out
I don't need you as much as I need to
And I don't miss you enough when you're not around
If I don't love you better by now, I don't think I'll ever know how

I don't think I'll ever know how
If I don't love you better by now
I don't think I'll ever know how

It won't stand the test of time
I know it, I know it, I know it
You say, "Give it one more try"
But what's the point if
I know it, I know it?
It won't stand the test of time
I know it, I know it, I know it
You say, "Give it one more try"
You don't know how hard I've been trying

Do I even love you?
I think I loved you
But I should love you better by now
I should love you better by now
I should've figured it all out
I don't need you as much as I need to
And I don't miss you enough when you're not around
If I don't love you better by now (Why can't I love you better by now?)
I don't think I'll ever know how (I wish I loved you better by now)
If I don't love you better by now (Why can't I love you better by now?)
I don't think I'll ever know how (I wish I loved you better by now)
You should drop me off at my house
If I don't love you better by now
