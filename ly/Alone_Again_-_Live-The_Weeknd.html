		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take off my disguise
I'm living someone else's life
Suppressing who I was inside
So I throw two-thousand ones in the sky
Together we're alone (together we're alone)
In Vegas I feel so at home (in Vegas I feel at home)
Falling only for the night
So I throw two-thousand ones in the sky (the sky)
How, how much to light up my star again
And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh baby, won't you remind me what I am?
And break, break my little cold heart

(Oh, oh-oh, ooh)
(Ooh-oh, ooh-ooh)
(Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)

Call me up and I'll send for you
Take me down to your altitude
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can sleep alone again (alone again)

Check my pulse for a second time (second time)
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can sleep alone again

(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)

Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
Count it up, it's all for you, count it up
'Cause I don't know if I can be alone again
I don't know if I can be alone again (alone again)
