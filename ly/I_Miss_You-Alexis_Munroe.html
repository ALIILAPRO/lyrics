		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanted to protect you
Turn your shadows into light
Was I the demon or the angel
Was I your peace, was I your fight
And if I die if I fall
Was it worth it in the end
Because you aren't here anymore
I lost my lover and my friend

I miss you, I miss you 
Now you got me wishing
Everything was different
I didn't wanna hurt him
That was never my intention

I just wanted to protect you
Turn your shadows into light
Was I the demon or the angel
Was I your peace, was I your fight
And if I die if I fall
Was it worth it in the end
Because you aren't here anymore
I lost my lover and my friend

I miss you, I miss you
