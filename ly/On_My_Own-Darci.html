		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No rush
You just take your time
Tell me I'm alright
Take me through your mind
Say I'm tryna fuck
I think that you're right
I still feel a thing 
when I look you in your eyes

Maybe you're my weakness
Or just part of the season
You know I've been speeding
So maybe I just need this
Or maybe I just feel you for no reason
Maybe I just feel you for no reason
(Yeah)

No rush
They say that I'm on a roll
Maybe I just lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
Find me out here on my own
But I'm ending up with you home
You keep picking up the bone
Still I keep colder than stone
'Til you blowing up my phone
Keeping with sexual tone
When I wanna leave alone
'Til you blowing up my phone
Keeping with sexual tone
When I wanna leave alone
(Yeah)

They say that I'm on a roll
Maybe I just lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
Find me out here on my own
You keep blowing up my phone
Maybe I just lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
On my
On my
On my own

They say that I'm on a roll
Lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
Find me out here on my own
You keep blowing up my phone
Lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
On my
On my
On my own

No rush
You just take your time
Tell me I'm alright
Take me through your mind
Say I'm tryna fuck
I think that you're right
I still feel a thing 
when I look you in your eyes
(Yeah)

They say that I'm on a roll
Maybe I just lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
Find me out here on my own
But I'm ending up with you home
You keep picking up the bone
Still I keep colder than stone
'Til you blowing up my phone

On a roll
Maybe I just lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
Find me out here on my own
You keep blowing up my phone
Maybe I just lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
On my 
On my
On my own

They say that I'm on a roll
Lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
Find me out here on my own
You keep blowing up my phone
Lost control
These nights keep on taking tolls
On my
On my
On my own
