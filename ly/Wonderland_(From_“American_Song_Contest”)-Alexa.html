		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alexa
Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Pullin' the strings on my heart (ah-ah)
How did you make it this far? (Ah-ah)
Duckin' and dodgin' security measures
I put up to make catching feelings hard

I just wanna know
How you could warm my heart that's so cold
Losin' my control
You got me close to letting you closer

But I know how these things work out
Fun to believe, but they always leave

Heart fillin' up, I think I'm in trouble
Bet that you'll let me down by double
Off with your head, stop thinking I love ya
Wonder if we had a chance, maybe back in wonderland

You threw my head and heart off balance
You gave me thoughts of a prince and palace
난 길을 잃어버린 Alice
Wonder if we had a chance, maybe back in wonderland

Boy, you got me goin' down the rabbit hole
Got me foamin' at the mouth like a rabid dog
I'ma have to put myself on a leash though
Livin' rent-free in my head, here's your lease though

Again and again, you keep my thoughts comin' back
And you ain't even a dealer, but I still beez in your trap
I need a doctor, a doctor, my heart is under attack
But it's too good to be true, but then it's usually that

But I know how these things work out
Fun to believe, but they always leave

Heart fillin' up, I think I'm in trouble
Bet that you'll let me down by double
Off with your head, stop thinking I love ya
Wonder if we had a chance, maybe back in wonderland

You threw my head and heart off balance
You gave me thoughts of a prince and palace
난 길을 잃어버린 Alice
Wonder if we had a chance, maybe back in wonderland

Hey!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (oh, yeah)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (ooh-ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

I'm caught in a sweet illusion
난 깨지 않은 것처럼
I admit it's drivin' me mad
I should quit, but I want it so bad
Yeah

Heart fillin' up, I think I'm in trouble
Bet that you'll let me down by double
Off with your head, stop thinking I love ya
Wonder if we had a chance, maybe back in wonderland

You threw my head and heart off balance
You gave me thoughts of a prince and palace
난 길을 잃어버린 Alice
Wonder if we had a chance, maybe back in wonderland

Ooh-ooh
Hey, yeah
Yeah-yeah 
Hey, yeah
Wonder if we had a chance
Maybe back in wonderland
