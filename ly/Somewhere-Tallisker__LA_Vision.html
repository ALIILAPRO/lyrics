		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I care & I would give you all I got
I would be sad if you had somebody
I care & would tell you all I know
And I would be mad if you had somebody

Maybe I should get out-of town
Stop messing around with you
You waste my time
I just wanna get out of that
And I wanna get back to where
we were seen

Somewhere we weren’t lonely
Somewhere far from nowhere
Some day we gotta be somewhere
We gotta be somewhere loving it some way

I care & I would give you all I got
I would be sad if you had somebody
I care & would tell you all I know
And I would be mad if you told somebody

Maybe I should get out-of town
Stop messing around with you
You waste my time
I just wanna get out of that
And I wanna be back to where
We were seen

Somewhere we wouldn’t be lonely
Somewhere far from nowhere
Some day we gotta be somewhere
We gotta be somewhere loving it some way

I’ve given up the tensions
You’re looking for attention
I’m looking for some peace of mind
And you drive me crazy fool sometimes

You fool me every deal after deal

Somewhere we wouldn’t be lonely
Somewhere far from nowhere
Some day we gotta be somewhere
We gotta be somewhere loving it some way
