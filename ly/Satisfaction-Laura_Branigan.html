		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know what you're doin', but you're doin' somethin' I think I like 
Not sure what I'm feelin', but it feels like somethin' so right 
The sound of your sigh, the touch of your skin 
Is takin' me places I've never been 
I want to go there again and again 
''cause you give me -- 

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me 
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me 
Satisfaction, I just never knew that I could feel this way 
Oh babe, I love you 

Holdin' you close now, I keep thinkin' of times before 
When nothin' was good enough, I was always left wantin' more 
You took my world, turned it around 
I know you won't be lettin' me down 
''cause baby, you showed me that love could be found 
When you gave me -- 

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me 
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me 
Satisfaction, I just never knew that I could feel this way 
Oh babe, I love you 

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me 
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me 
Satisfaction, I just never knew that I could feel this way 
Oh babe, I love you 

Satisfaction, when you're touchin' me 
You start a chain reaction deep inside of me 
Satisfaction, I just never knew that I could feel this way 
Oh babe, I love you ... [fade out]
