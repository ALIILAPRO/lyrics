		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DNA, welcome to my DNA
Stupidly who wants to stay
With my DNA
DNA, you cannot fix what you get
Things that I try to forget
In my DNA

Can you forgive me?
For things that I've said
Things that I've done
Go now and never come back

DNA, we all got expiring dates
Trust me there's no get away
From my DNA
DNA, Wires of sadness and pain
Always remaining the same, my DNA

Disarmed by the music, there's bombs in my head
You'll always get burned
Go now and never get back

My deadly venom, Soon I'll be dead
Go now my lover
Go now and never come back
