		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your mama is a werewolf with long, sharp teeth
I'm up all night when the world should sleep
I curse the darkness when it's killin' time
I got a river of fear runnin' through my mind
When the moon shines through those parting clouds
I hear the call and I howl out loud
I stalk the streets where the shadows lie
And I pray to God that that sun will rise
But that sun don't always rise

If my good intentions go runnin' wild
If I cause you pain, my own sweet child
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun

When I awaken and I'm reborn
My body aches and my soul is torn
I search the void for any clues
And I feel ashamed for what I've put you through
This curse a gift from my father's kin
They fought the beast I feel within
But we don't talk about it and we don't call its name
We just carry on, hopin' it'll change
But we know it'll never change

If my good intentions go runnin' wild
If I cause you pain, my own sweet child
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun
Would you strike me down right where I stand?
Would you change me back, make me kind again?
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun

If my good intentions go runnin' wild
If I cause you pain, my own sweet child
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun
Would you strike me down right where I stand?
Would you change me back, make me kind again?
Won't you promise me you'll be the one?
My silver bullet in the gun
