		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One foot on the pavement and one foot in the milky way
And I'm soaring
Soaring

My branches scrape the sea of stars
My roots dig deep into this world of ours
And I'm grounded
Grounded

My reality is what I perceive
What I attract into my orbit
Worries fade into the haze
The air feels different this time 'round
Different this time 'round

Let's set sail
Start a fire
Learn to live a little higher
Let's pick the lock
Grab the reigns
Forget there ever were chains
'Cause there never were chains
Never were chains

Days move on and times they change
In a blink of an eye things rearrange
We're moving
Moving
We're sucked in and we're spat out
On the other side of the rabbit hole
But we find our way
Find our way

Do you want to be just a machine in this crazy society?
Pick the lock
Grab the reigns
Forget there ever were chains
'Cause there never were chains
