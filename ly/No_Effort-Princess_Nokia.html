		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Excuse me, you wack-ass bitches
I need y'all to know, it's no competition, bitch
You could never, bitch, you see me?
And you see you?
Brrat-tat-tat-tat

Look at me, so clean, no effort
Ponytail, ripped jeans, no effort
Face clean, gold ring, no effort
Insane, my chain, big pressure
Look at me, so clean, no effort
Ponytail, ripped jeans, no effort
Face clean, gold ring, no effort
Insane, my chain, big pressure

I don't like diamonds much and I think rappers suck
I'm in the ice cream truck, I got the ice creams on
I just cheech and chong, baby rip the bong
Marc Jacobs shirt with the sequin thong
It's a hot girl summer and I pulled up on my bike
It's a wet hot summer and I feel like cherry pie
Get a threesome going 'cause you know that's what I like
It's the all-girl party and they fuckin' right outside
Wet hot summer, wet hot summer
Going everywhere, I'm a track star runner
Subi on the jeans, I'm a mad hot stunna
I'm a Bape star girl and these boys all bummers
Boys all funny, I don't want no pause
Take five steps from me with a playboy heart
I'm the UFO in the sky with the stars
Put the Tripp pants on, come fuck with this art

Look at me, so clean, no effort
Ponytail, ripped jeans, no effort
Face clean, gold ring, no effort
Insane, my chain, big pressure
Look at me, so clean, no effort
Ponytail, ripped jeans, no effort
Face clean, gold ring, no effort
Insane, my chain, big pressure

Now what the fuck these bitches want?
I ain't got shit for them
These bitches are still basic like they shop on Fordham
These bitches are still basic with the ten spot dress
These bitches are still basic in they Rainbow best
If you think you doin' somethin', I think the fuck not
I'll put you on blast and blow up ya spot
I'll blow off yo' top and make you all drop
If dick was your mouth, these bitches would suck cock
I been parting off the waters when the waves get hot
Ain't no other bitch like me that could take my spot
When I hit the stage runnin', bitches panties drop
I been signin' boobs, call 'em tater tots
And in case you wonderin', I'm from Harlem, babe
I'm the diplomat girl with the Harlem Shake
I'm on First Ave, gang, we at Hajji's, babe
You don't know me, nena, you just know my name

Look at me, so clean, no effort
Ponytail, ripped jeans, no effort
Face clean, gold ring, no effort
Insane, my chain, big pressure
Look at me, so clean, no effort
Ponytail, ripped jeans, no effort
Face clean, gold ring, no effort
Insane, my chain, big pressure

No-no-no effort
(M-My chain, big pressure)
Look at me, no effort (look at me)
Ponytail, no effort (ponytail)
Face clean, no effort (face clean)
No-no-no effort (effort, effort, effort)
