		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullabies,
Come fly away.

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullabies,
Come fly away.

Feels like your beatin', beatin' the drumbeats into my heart.
Feels like there's nothin', nothin' around to make me stop.
You are a motion that makes me high.
You are a dream that burns inside.
A magic potion, that's my soul.
Come fly with me.

Feels like your beatin', beatin' the drumbeats into my heart.
Feels like there's nothin', nothin' around to make me stop.
You are a motion that makes me high.
You are a dream that burns inside.
A magic potion, that's my soul.
Come fly with me.

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullabies,
Come fly away.

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullabies,
Come fly away.

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullabies,
Come fly away.

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullabies,
Come fly away.

I'm glidin' in the beautiful sky,
It's such a clear day.
Go ridin' in,
Your sweet lullab√Øes,
Come fly away.
