		  I see, I see, ooh, yeah, yeah

I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes, yeah)
I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (oh yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (oh yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (under the scenes)

I don't wanna make a fuss, I just wanna make love
I wanna fuck you 'til the sun come down, I'm tryna take you to the moon right now
I'm tryna take you to the moon right now
I see what you're doin', how you doin'? I'm proud
I seen colours, I'm in the moon
Must be in love, it must be you (I don't regret, I don't regret, nah)
(I don't regret, I don't regret, nah)
(I don't regret, I don't regret, nah)
(I don't regret, I don't regret, nah)
(I don't regret, I don't regret, hey)

I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes, yeah)
I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (yeah, under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (ooh, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (yeah-yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (under the scenes)

She lookin' for yeah, she just want
She lookin' for yeah, she just want
She lookin' for yeah, she just want yeah
She lookin' for yeah, she just want yeah, yeah
She don't want she don't want no mediocre
If you ain't got it, then she gonna leave, I'm done
I just spent a minute with a freak, I'm done
Said she fell in love, I can't believe it (oh-oh)
She just wanna take me to the queen (oh-oh)
She just wanna see what she can't see, uh
Money feels like ecstasy (feels like) 
Money make her cum, money set free, yeah, yeah

I seen colours under the moon (yeah, under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (yeah, under the scenes)
I seen colours under the moon (under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (oh yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you (yeah, yeah, under the scenes)
Must be in love, it must be you
