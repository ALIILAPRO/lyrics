		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you wanna talk to me
Know that I am planning to see
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey
I don't want this thing to be
Staining my reality, yeah, yeah

Don't lift me up
To turn me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the floor
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below

Don't lift me up
To turn me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the floor
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below

If you bought the fantasy
It's murder in the first degree, yeah
Yeah
Is my sexuality
Creating such a tragedy, yeah
Yeah

Don't lift me up
To turn me down
I just want a lover
Baby, stay with me on the floor
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below

Don't lift me up
To turn me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the floor
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below, ooh

I'm so tired of playing this crazy game
Someone's always left out in the rain
Is there a chance that we can make it, uh
Just keep it real 'cause we can't fake it, yeah

'Cause you and I can't take this anymore
We've got to keep our feet right on the floor
There's no more secrets, no more lying
Baby I'm really, really trying
To get to love

Don't lift me up
To turn me down
I just want a lover
Baby stay with me on the floor
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below

Don't lift me up
To turn me down
Baby stay with me on the floor
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below, ooh
Don't lift me up
To turn me down
Baby, stay with me on the floor

Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below
Talk with me, let me go
Got to keep below, ooh
