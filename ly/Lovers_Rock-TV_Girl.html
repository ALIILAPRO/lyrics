		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you sick of me? 
Would you like to be? 
I'm tryna tell you something 
Something that I already said 

You like the pretty boy 
With a pretty voice 
Who's tryna sell you something 
Something that you already have

But if you're too drunk to drive 
And the music is right 
She might let you stay 
But just for the night 
And if she grabs for your hand 
And drags you along 
She might want a kiss 
Before the end of the song 

Because love
Can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing 
And leave you alone with nothing 

While the others talk 
We were listening to Lovers Rock 
In her bedroom 
In her bedroom 

And if you start to kiss 
And the record skips 
Flip it over 
And sit a little closer 

But if you're too drunk to drive 
And the music is right 
She might let you stay 
But just for the night 
And if she grabs for your hand 
And drags you along 
She might want a kiss 
Before the end of the song 

Because love
Can burn like a cigarette
And leave you alone with nothing 
And leave you alone with nothing 

Now, how many men have you kissed? (Very few)
But you offered me a kiss, why?
Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid, I just wanted to kiss you 

Do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do

Because love (do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do)
Can burn like a cigarette (do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do)
And leave you alone with nothing (do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do)
And leave you alone with nothing
