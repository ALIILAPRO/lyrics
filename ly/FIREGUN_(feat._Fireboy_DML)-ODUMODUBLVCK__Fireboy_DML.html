		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black sheep for life, black sheep forever
Izgaaju 'til we kpeme, Antiworld gangsters GE records, you get me? ODUMODUBLVCK
Fire in my condo, Django (NATIVE)
Ayy-ayy-ayy, yeah

There is fire in a condo (condo)
Shayo dey my home zone (home zone)
Her bobby dey my goal-post
My money dance azonto ('Zonto)
Kamakazi kentro (kentro)
Fire, Odumodu, them go turn up and go (mmm)
Pop some champo (mmm)
Ikebe supper, na where I die, I be like Django (Django)
Lover boy, no control (kentro)
Lover boy, no con

Anything, anything fit sup tonight
Gimme champagne, make I bop tonight
You know say me I no dey compromise
If you come tonight (you go cum tonight)
Wa jo, wa jo, I'm a bachelor
Dangerous, I'm a bachelor
As she wine 'pon me, all the girls jealous (komolop-cholop)

So, just grind me slow
I'll do anything you want me to
If I leave you, make you find me go
I can do this many times with you

Yeah (ekelebe Stunner, ayy, Ekele)
Make she no go enter inside my carban
Odumodu-fire be like jagabans
Philomena, can I be you padi man?
Make I pattern Okrika for the parol and?
E get the melody wey I been dey forget (Gbase)
Make I sing am for the shawty, fire, peck her neck
"Modu touch my breast"
She gimme consent (yes)
I go dey content
I cannot bragado
Her pressure put me on the bench

6:30, all the girls wan flex (flex)
Weekend trips on a London jet (yes)
Recently I just need my peace
I'm on DND, so no calls, just text
You and I, we dey together like suit and tie
We go together like juice and ice
I no go mind if you move tonight

Just grind me slow (baby)
I'll do anything you want me to (i'll do anything-ng-ng)
If I leave you, make you find me go (ayy)
I can do this many times with you (make I feel among)
(make you find me, find me)

Make I feel among my shawty, tell me what you want (want)
Louis V and Prada, Puma, you can have it all (all)
Akpuruka flendjour, serve you like a god (like a god)
Akpuruka flendjour, serve you like a god (like a god)
Money dey my kolo (ayy, kolo oh)
Your kele my bando (bando, ah)
Sipping on my shayo (shayo)
She don roll my igbo (igbo, ayy)
She no smoke your kolo (kolo, ayy)
Odumodu come close (Odumodu come close)

Just grind me slow (slow)
I'll do anything you want me to (want me to)
If I leave you, make you find me go (find me go)
I can do this many times with you (Times with you)

Can I whine? Can I dine?
Can I whine? Can I dine? Can I dine?
Make she no go enter inside my karban
