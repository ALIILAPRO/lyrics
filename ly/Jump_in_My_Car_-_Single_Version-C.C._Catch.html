		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me tight in your arms
Take me in your heart tonight
If you really want me
Got to learn to love me right

It's tearing me apart
Babe, believe me in your heart
'Cause all I ever want is only you

Jump in my car, don't be afraid
Only young heroes can never wait
You are my number one
Till the morning chance to dawn

Jump in my car, I want some fun
Baby, when the working day is done
You are my everything, you give me more
You fill my dreams

You are dancing in my mind
Take me to the end of time
'Cause tonight is the night
Darling, oh you hold me tight

Oh baby, you've got style
When you give that special smile
You've got something
That I really love

Jump in my car, don't be afraid
Only young heroes can never wait
You are my number one
Till the morning chance to dawn

Jump in my car, I want some fun
Baby, when the working day is done
You are my everything, you give me more
You fill my dreams

Jump in my car, I just can't wait
Jump in my car, do not be late
Jump in my car, give me your heart
It doesn't matter when we'll start

Jump in my car, don't be afraid
Only young heroes can never wait
You are my number one
Till the morning chance to dawn

Jump in my car, I want some fun
Baby, when the working day is done
You are my everything, you give me more
You fill my dreams

Jump in my car, don't be afraid
Only your heroes can never wait
You are my number one
