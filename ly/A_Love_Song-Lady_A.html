		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're pretty good at goodbyes
Almost theres, and second tries
At carousel of round and rounds
Of promises and let you downs
We've fallen in, we've fallen out
Let the wine let us talk about
Holidays and baby names
We play forever like it's a game

It drives me insane

Why can't we be a love song
That lasts 'til the end of time?
The kind that walks you down the aisle, never gets old
Always makes you smile, greatest story told
Gets the world singing along
Why can't we be a love song?

When lonely's on the radio
I turn the dial because I know
It's a soundtrack of you and me
I hate that most of our memories
Are some sad melodies

Why can't we be a love song
That lasts 'til the end of time?
The kind that walks you down the aisle, never gets old
Always makes you smile, greatest story told
Gets the world singing along
Why can't we be a love song?

Oh, every other kind of song, we've got it covered
If we walked away, I'll always wonder
Why we couldn't make history
That's the broken record on repeat

Why can't we be a love song
Oh, that lasts 'til the end of time?
The kind that walks you down the aisle, never gets old
Always makes you smile, greatest story told
Gets the world singing along
Oh, why can't we be, why can't we be
A love song, a love song
