		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, look

You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at 'Chella
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

Staying in big six-six with woes
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts
They do anything except road
Still can't see them after it snows
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control
Take all that shit up with P and his bro
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes
Wanna be free and I wanna let go
We came around and you showed us the most
I know so much shit that I cannot expose
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust
They got no direction, they're followin' us
I come from a city that they never touch
Your man is a goofy and he could get brush
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust, ay, ay, ay

Yeah
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes
I like Rs and Vs and Os
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe
Been with Roxx through highs and lows
We seen man last night, they froze
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose
Just like that one time at Nobu
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones

Think you know me? That's not true
We got ties in West End too
She came over and she got slew
Throwin' up six like man had flu
I got way too big off Views
Back to the basics, I won't lose
They wanna link when they got no chunes
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes
I don't give a fuck about jeans and crep
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met
I just wanna make these songs for the set
I just wanna load that and let that wet
I got so much tings in the stash
Fold up anyone, dun that clash
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh
Big and bad like leader and shh
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached
Phone get broke and whip get scratched
I'ma just take my knots in cash
They can never tie me down, that's facts
All that bark but we know he's a cat
I don't really like goin' tit for tat
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat
I'ma just end that there, that's that
