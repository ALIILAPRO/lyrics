		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember the feeling of my fingertips on your skin
And the way that our kisses taste sweeter after drinkin'
And the way that I rage into your love while you breathe me in
Just so you can feel me with you even when I'm not around

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love

Tantrums, set fires
Two dice, we roll, excite
Your eyes, inhale the love
Play in the dark
Rules break, why pretend?
We take what we can
We ride 'til the end, 'til the sun
Push that weight on me like a fiend
Let's rage in the moonlight calm
Like a shot rings out in the darkness
So you don't forget my love

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love

Don't forget my love, don't forget my love
Don't forget my love, don't forget my love
Don't forget, don't forget, don't forget, don't forget
Don't, don't, don't

Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love (my love, my love)
(Love, my love, my love)
Don't forget my love
(Love, my love, my love)
(Love, my love, my love)
Don't forget my love

Don't forget my love
