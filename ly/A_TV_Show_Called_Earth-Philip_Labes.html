		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if aliens are real, and they live a trillion years
And they've watched every single one of us since birth
What if aliens exist, as an endless consciousness
And for fun they watch a tv show called Earth
There's a bunch of different storylines, the moral isn't clear
And it feels like the writing's gone downhill in the last year
And everyone's a hero painted in the proper light
And the show's in multicolor though it acts so black and white
In its hundred-millionth season for what it's worth
A tv show called Earth
As we gaze out into space, they're a few feet from our face
Eating popcorn drinking soda with their friends
Though to us it might seem cruel, how they keep a betting pool
On the way the human storyline will end
And everyone's a villain who just looks out for their own
And be careful picking favorites, 'cause they all end up as bones
And the ensemble is pretty good, the leads all mostly suck
And recently they've trashed the set to make a couple bucks
And a plot like that has not been seen before
They might only have a couple seasons more
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
And when the show is done, by war or storm or sun
I wonder if they'd want to watch again
Or grow bored with what what we do, and move on to something new
Saying "Earth was decent, seven out of ten"
"I liked the dancing and the music and and the sea foam on the shore
I wish the writers had been kind enough to sprinkle that in more
'Cause the war bits and the poverty, I wasn't a fan of
But I really dug on all the parts where humans fell in love"
See they've watched us from our primordial dawn
Until the very last one of us was gone
And one turns to the other with the clicker in his hand and says
"That was fun, let's see what else is on"
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
