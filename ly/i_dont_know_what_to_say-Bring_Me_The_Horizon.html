		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll see you at the gates when it gets dark
You jump the wall, I'll find a place to park
Cue the angels if they're keeping guard
How do I start?
When you don't know what to say?
No, I don't know what to say

You said "The worlds already full enough"
Defeat will peak when you will not give up
Always the choice to move yourself along
You'll find better and I hope that's where you are
Yeah, I know that's where you are

A doppelganger with a telling scar
I saw the universe hidden in your heart
Wish I told you this before it got too dark
Where do you start when you know it has to end?

How a flower in the rain only grows more when it's grey
You just shined on brighter, making gold out of the pain
"I can die, but I can't break," you said
"You can rule, I won't obey"
As long as I'm still smiling
Well, I don't know what to say
