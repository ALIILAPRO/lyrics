		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why'd you go and tear me apart
If you gonna come back if you were lonely?
It's messed up how you'd
Give me these scars
Then you're gonna go ask if I am okay (Yeah)

I can't go away
All these thoughts and my heart
Won't let me sleep
I think about you and the times we keep
All tangled up in our mind when
We lay in the sheets i know it's fucked up
But without you I feel so stuck
When you're deep in my mind
With that old love and
I just think about the times that I showed up
You always let me pull you in
I think it's 'cause we tried to
Make it work as friends
That nevеr works in the end
It always leads to somеone getting hurt again
So I keep coming back
I know it breaks your heart
And I don't want that
But when I close my eyes
No I don't see black
All I see is your face and I want it back

Why'd you go and tear me apart
If you gonna come back if you were lonely?
It's messed up how you'd
Give me these scars
Then you're gonna go askin' if I am okay
Are you okay? Are you okay?
I'm so fuckin' far from being okay
Are you okay? Are you okay?
I'm so fuckin' far from being okay

Are you okay? Please stop
Askin' if I'm okay
I'm not alright, ha no way
I'll just save that shit for another day
I ain't playing girl
And that shit all around needs some changing
World it's all up in flames
To the pavement girl
It got me so sick I'm about to hurl
All I can change is me
So I try to do it so gracefully
But reminders all around hit blatantly, so
I'll sit in my room, wait patiently
I don't need this drama, just
Hand me the vodka, i'll do what I wanna
I'll do what I gotta 'cause I just
Can't handle these thoughts any longer

Why'd you go and tear me apart
If you gonna come back if you were lonely?
It's messed up how you'd
Give me these scars
Then you're gonna go askin' if I am okay
Are you okay? Are you okay?
I'm so fuckin' far from being okay
Are you okay? Are you okay?
I'm so fuckin' far from being okay
