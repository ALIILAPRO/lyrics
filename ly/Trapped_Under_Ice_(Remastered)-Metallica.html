		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know how to live trough this hell 
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell 
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core 
Break the ice, I can't take anymore 

Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under ice 

Crystallized, as I lay here and rest 
Eyes of glass stare directly at death 
From deep sleep I have broken away 
No one knows, no one hears what I say 

Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under ice 

Scream from my soul 
Fate, mystified 
Hell, forever more 

Scream from my soul 
Fate, mystified 
Hell, forever more 

No release from my cryonic state 
What is this I've been stricken by fate 
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free 
Hand of doom has a tight grip on me 

Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under ice

Freezing 
Can't move at all 
Screaming 
Can't hear my call 
I am dying to live 
Cry out 
I'm trapped under ice
