		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was down, my dreams were wearing thin
When you're lost, where do you begin?
My heart always seemed to drift from day to day
Looking for the love that never came my way

Then you smiled and I reached out to you
I could tell you were lonely too
One look and then it all began for you and me
The moment that we touched I knew that there would be

Two less lonely people in the world and it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world, I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong, something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight

Just to think what I might have missed
Looking back how did I exist
I dreamed, still I never thought I'd come this far
But miracles come true, I know 'cause here we are

Two less lonely people in the world and it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world, I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong, something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight

Tonight I fell in love with you and all the things I never knew
Seemed to come to me somehow 'cause baby, love is here and now there's

Two less lonely people in the world and it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world, I just can't believe you're mine
In my life where everything was wrong, something finally went right
Now there's two less lonely people in the world tonight

Two less lonely people in the world and it's gonna be fine
Out of all the people in the world, I just can't believe you're mine
Something finally went right, now there's two less lonely people
Two less lonely people, two less lonely people in the world tonight

Two less lonely people in the world
