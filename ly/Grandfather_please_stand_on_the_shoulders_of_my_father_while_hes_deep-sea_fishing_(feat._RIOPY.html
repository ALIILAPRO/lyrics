		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three white butterflies to know you're near

I know they think that it took somebody else
To make me beautiful, beautiful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong
I know they think that it took thousands of people
To put me together again like an experiment
Some big man behind the scenes
So I am Frankenstein, black dreams into my song
But they're wrong

God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or an owl to know know you're listening, sitting while I'm drinking
Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for sharks in the Pacific
'Cause I'm good on spirit, warm-bodied
A fallible deity wrapped up in white
I'm folk, I'm jazz, I'm blue, I'm green
Regrettably you're so a white woman

But I have good intentions if even I'm one of the last ones
If you don't believe me, my poetry and my melodies
Feel it in your bones
I have good intentions even if I'm one of the last ones
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah

Grandfather, please stand on the shoulders of my father
While he's deep-sea fishing for all the things he's wishing
God, if you're near me, send me three white butterflies
Or a map to know you're fishing, impart on me your wisdom

It took somebody else to make me beautiful
Wonderful
As they intended me to be
But they're wrong

Three white butterflies to know you're near
