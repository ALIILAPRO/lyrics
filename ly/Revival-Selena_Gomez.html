		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dive into the future
But I'm blinded by the sun
I'm reborn in every moment
So who knows what I'll become

I feel like I've awakened lately
The chains around me are finally breaking
I've been under self-restoration
I've become my own salvation
Showing up, no more hiding, hiding
The light inside me is bursting, shining
It's my, my, my time to butterfly

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

I'll walk through the fire, I'll begin again
I'll burn through my skin
'Cause I, 'cause I wanna feel it
Reaching for the truth, not afraid to lose
What shot out of me like a rifle, was a revival, revival
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I admit, it's been painful, painful
But I'll be honest, I'm grateful, grateful
It's my, my, my time to realize

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

This won't take too long, you'll see
I'm just tryna get to me, ooh
What shot out of me like a rifle, was a revival, revival

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival
This is a revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Revival

What I've learned is so vital
More than just survival
This is my revival, this is a revival
