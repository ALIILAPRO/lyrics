		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ooh!
If you got troubles let 'em go
Let 'em soar so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh!
Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon

Monday morning
Shoot up like a rocket
Yeah, the sun is shining
Keep it in my pocket
Got this golden feeling
Never gonna stop, it just goes on and on
Keep on clapping
Join the celebration
Turn the music louder on my favorite station
Wanna spread my magic all across the nation
Do it all day long

Today, I opened my eyes
And now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side
And that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in
'Cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Today, I opened my eyes
And now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side
And that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in
'Cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long

Ah-ooh!
If you got troubles let 'em go
Let 'em soar, so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh!
Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)

Bees are buzzing
Butterflies are dancing
And the trees are humming
Birds are singing songs
Oh, can't you see it's lovely?
Life is beautiful, and it goes on and on

Today, I opened my eyes
And now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side
And that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in
'Cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long
Today, I opened my eyes
And now I'm so happy and free
I've got my friends by my side
And that's all that matters to me
So, come on, get up and join in
'Cause this is just what you need
Let's do it all day long

Ah-ooh!
If you got troubles let 'em go
Let 'em soar, so high, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
Ah-ooh!
Don't let your worries get to you
Let 'em float on by, high into the sky
Just like a red balloon
So turn it up now! (Oh!)
So turn it up now! (Ah-ooh!)

So turn it up now!
