		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The alarm rang for days
You could tell from conversations
I was waiting by the screen
I couldn't recognize my photograph
Me, I disconnect from you

I was walking up the stairs
Something moved in silence
I could feel his mind decaying
Only inches away from me
And I disconnect from you

Please don't turn me off
I don't know what I'm doing outside
Me and the telephone that never rings
If you were me, what would you do?
Me, I disconnect from you
