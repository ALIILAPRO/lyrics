(Moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, moo, mooooo)
Yeah

Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
I'm not a cat
I don't say meow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow

I go "mooo" (I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow)
Mooo (I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow)
Mooo (I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow)
Mooo (I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow, I'm a cow)
Yeah

I say, bitch, I'm too smooth
I'm not in the mood
Tryna make moves
Tryna make moves
Bitch, I'm too smooth
I'm not in the mood
Tryna make moves
Tryna make moves

Got milk bitch? Got beef? (got beef?)
Got steak ho? Got cheese? (got it)
Grade A ho, not lean (not lean)
Got me A1, sauce please
These heifers got nothin' on me
Steaks high, need a side of collard greens
Cash rules everything around me (everything around me)
Ice C.R.E.A.M, ice C.R.E.A.M (ice cream)
You a calf bitch, you my daughter (you ma daughter)
I ain't bothered (I ain't bothered)
Get slaughtered (get slaughtered)
Got the methane, I'm a farter (woo)
With my farmer (woo)
McDonald (woo)
And they feed me real good, it's a honor (it's a honor)
Philly cheesesteak all in that order (get that order)
Chili cheese fries as a starter (as a starter)
Got the steroids keeping me stronger (strong)

Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
I'm not a cat
I don't say meow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow

I go "mooo"
Mooo
Mooo
Mooo
Yeah
I say, bitch, I'm too smooth
I'm not in the mood
Tryna make moves
Tryna make moves
Bitch, I'm too smooth
I'm not in the mood
Tryna make moves
Tryna make moves

Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow
Bitch, I'm a cow (yeah)
Bitch, I'm a cow

Old McDonald had a farm
I give him a titty tryna keep him calm
I'm just tryna turn up in the country
I ain't in the city 'cause they ain't got lawns
Suck a nigga dick, or somethin' E-I-O
Shittin' on these bitches only thing I know
Tippin' on his dick, I see the chickens in the pens
They wanna catch us ridin' dirty with them fiends, I know

I ain't a moose, bitch
Get out my hay, get out my hay
Bitch, get out my hay
I ain't a moose, bitch
Get out my hay, get out my hay
Bitch, get out my hay
I ain't a moose, bitch
Get out my hay, get out my hay
Get out my hay
I ain't a moose, bitch
Get out my hay, get out my hay
Bitch, get out my hay

My milkshake brings all the boys to the farm
And they're like
It's better than yours
Damn right
It's better than yours
I can treat you
But I have to charge
My milkshake brings all the boys to the farm
And they're like
It's better than yours
Damn right
It's better than yours
I can treat you
But I have to charge

It's better than yours
It's better than yours
But I have to charge
It's better than yours
It's better than yours
But I have to charge

I want a cheese burger
Fucking vegans
