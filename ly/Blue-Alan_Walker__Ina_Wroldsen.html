		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay next to me, come see the sky
It fuses with the mighty, mighty ocean
They fell in love like you and I
And now they rule and man cannot control them

They force the moon and sun
They never bow down to anyone
Whenever they strike, it's hit and run
Sea and sky, you and I
I never loved someone
But then I found you, now I'll belong
And you begin where I end, my love
Sea and sky, you and I

We're blue, all the colors
Of sea and sky, you and I
We're blue, all the colors
Of sea and sky, you and I

I told you centuries ago
I'll lead the way and hold you in the darkness
We told the stars to guide us home
And we will make the world into a fortress

They force the moon and sun
They never bow down to anyone
Whenever they strike, it's hit and run
Sea and sky, you and I
I never loved someone
But then I found you, now I'll belong
And you begin where I end, my love
Sea and sky, you and I

We're blue, all the colors
Of sea and sky, you and I (oh yeah)
We're blue, all the colors
Of sea and sky, you and I (oh yeah)

We're blue
