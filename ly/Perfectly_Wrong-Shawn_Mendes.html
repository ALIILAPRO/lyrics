		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Taste the poison from your lips
Lately, we're as good as gone
Oh, our love is drunk and it's
Singin' me my favorite song

Me and you, we were made to break
I know the truth, but it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
You're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, you know how much it hurts
Every time you say you hate me
But when we're makin' love, you make it worth it
Can't believe the places that you take me

There's no use, we were made to break
I know the truth, and it's much too late

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard to leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
All the stars in the sky could see
Why you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh, and why can't I quit 
When you break my heart open?
I need you more than I know, oh
And I can't resist 
When you're up against my skin
I never wanna let you go

You're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, mm
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me

Oh
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
And that's why it's so hard for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me, yeah
Oh, you're perfectly wrong for me
Hate that you know that I won't leave
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
Yeah, you're perfectly wrong for me
