		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We fall for each other at the wrong time
Only for a moment, but I don't mind
Guess I don't know where to draw the line, the line, the line
We're playing the same game every night

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh, I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done, you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you doing just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh, I know, yeah I know, it's over

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done, you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
I know I should leave, I know I should, should, should
But your love's too good, your love's too good, good, good
Yeah

You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done, you pull me closer
You're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober

You've got a hold on me
You're like a wasted dream
I gave you everything
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober
