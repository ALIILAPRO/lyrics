		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Mike Willy, Zaydiggy
It's Gucci
Burr
Go

I get so much cash in Vegas, I feel like I'm Elvis (wow)
I just bought a new Ferrari, it came with a helmet (go)
Drip my bitch in Ferragamo, you can't even spell it (damn)
I come repoed up dope from you if you couldn't sell it 
Well connected and respected, how you didn't expect it? (How?)
Zay pulled up in the front, new Hummer, it's electric (Ziggy)
These niggas goin' PC but Big Wop don't need protection (no)
They keep talkin' 'bout the old Wop, well here, this the resurrection (yeah)
The old one known for sippin' lean and freestylin' congested (leanin')
Tried put that pistol on my buddy, it got me arrested
These rappers gettin' extorted and it's really gettin' depressin' (sad)
We know you'll take the witness stand, we all read your confession (damn)
I do it so big, I spent two million on a wedding (two milli')
I don't fuck with panhandlin'-ass bitches that be beggin' (whores)
I hate goin' to court, I see the judge and get to sweatin' (whew, whew, whew)
He tried to get away, he couldn't escape, Drac' broke his pelvis (brrt-brrt-brrt-brrt)

Ain't shit nobody can tell me (nah)
"Critter, why you gettin' selfish?" 
I'm up now, ho, you helpless
Drippin' in Giorgio Armani, you smell me?
I do a walkthrough, switch in my trench 
Ain't wastin' my breath, ho ain't worth a cent
And this shit personal, make sure we hit
Spin they block back to back, workin' the switch
He open his mouth, the only hide stick (pussy)
These niggas rats, lil' police bitch (snitchin')
I'm in a Scat, bend a curb in this bitch (gone)
Supposed to chase the racks but they chasin' a bitch 
My cousin in the 'Raq, he deliver the shit
Ho, my main focus is money
Ayy, I want these millions to come in abundance 
I run to the money, I'm Mac Critter Sonic 
Good pussy, get in her stomach
It's hard for niggas to keep it a hundred
It'll hurt a nigga head to keep it a hundred
Your family'll cross you for money, niggas'll cross you for nothin'
When a ho cross you she gon' want somethin' (for real)
I gotta thank God, wasn't none of this promised
I gotta thank God I made it out the dungeon
I'm the .556 God, I'm the one who spark
My ho pretty and dark, the other one caramel
And the red Dominican, she love the Hennessey
I love the energy, money boost my energy
Killin' my enemy and lovin' my frenemies
Enemies kin to me, they wanna finish me
Twelve can't surrender me, ho, you can't handle me
I got rose gold trophy, the street keep my focused
The beef ain't over, that what they were hopin'
Two hunnid fifty in jewelery, I'm psoted 
Fake ass diamonds you got on bogus
Ayy, look at my pocket, them motherfuckers loaded
We spin they block 'til somebody dead posted (brrt, bah-bah, brrt)
North Memphis havin' motion
1017 Mafia, boy, get your choppers up (brrt)
Fuck the feds, they ain't stoppin' us
They tryna boss me up, won't let 'em lock me up
I got my wealth, ho want me to help her
Any ho fuck the city, can't accept her (nah)
I put on Prada, put my ho in Prada
Prada my glasses but they look like goggles
Girl, you in college and you a show stopper
She go to school for nursing but think she a model
Pull out the blue hundreds, pop it, I pop it
I'm the king of North Memphis, pussy, just stop it (stop it)
