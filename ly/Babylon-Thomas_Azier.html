		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the marbles in the garden
Have a sadness in their eyes
And all the birds retuned to silence
In our lonesome paradise
'Cause I got madness in my arms
But you're my lucky charm
When all the birds return to silence
Get some sleep and I'll be fine

You know our Babylon will fall
When dreams will turn to dust
Will you believe in us?
You know our Babylon will fall
Wenn dust turns into time
Our water turns to wine

We are dancing on the tables
We are lovers taking baths
We're the royals in a fable
And the neighbours make us laugh
And everything that I adore
Just mattress on the floor
When all the birds return to silence
Get some sleep and I'll be fine

You know our Babylon will fall
When dreams will turn to dust
Will you believe in us?
You know how Babylon will fall
When dust turns into time
Our water turns to wine

And I will make you mine
Again
