		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby are you down, down, down, down down? (Down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down? (Down, down)

You oughta know, tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show, I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me, as we make our great escape

So baby don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down, down, down, down, down? (Down, down)
Baby are you down, down, down, down, down? (Down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down? 

Just let it be, come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away, hey, turn this place into our private getaway
So leave it behind 'cause we have a night to get away
So come on and fly with me, as we make our great escape 
(So why don't we run away?)

Baby don't worry, you are my only (ooh)
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down down down down down? (Down, down)
Baby are you down down down down down? (Down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down?

Down like she 'posed to be
She gets down low for me
Down like her temperature, 'cause to me she zero degrees
She cold, over freeze
I got that girl from overseas
Now she my Miss America
Now can I be her soldier please?
I'm fighting for this girl
On a battlefield of love
Don't it look like baby cupid sendin' arrows from above
Don't you ever leave the side of me
Indefinitely, not probably
And honestly, I'm down like the economy (yeah)

Baby don't worry, you are my only
You won't be lonely, even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only, no need to worry
Baby are you down, down, down, down, down? (Down, down)
Baby are you down, down, down, down, down? (Down, down)
Even if the sky is falling down
Ooh, no
And the sky is falling down
