		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
This is another story about dogs
For the dog that don't pee on trees is a bitch
So says Snoop Dogg
So get your pooper scooper, 'cause the nigga's talkin' shit
Roof, roof, roof, roof

I'm sippin' on Tanqueray
With my my mind on my money and my mouth full of ganjay
R-A-G to the motherfucking E
Back with my nigga S-N double O-P (yeah, and ya don't stop)
Rage in effect, I just begun to rock (I said yeah, and you don't quit)
(Hey yo, Rage, would you please drop some gangsta shit?)
I rock ruff and stuff with my Afro Puffs
Handcuffed as I bust, 'bout to tear shit up
Oh, what? Did ya think I, didn't ever think I
Would be the one to make you blink eye? I'm catchy like pink-eye
Never will there ever be another like me
Um, you can play the left, 'cause it ain't no right in me
Out the picture, out the frame, out the box I knock 'em all
Smack 'em out the park, like, "A Friendly Game of Baseball"
Grand slam, yes, I am
Kickin' up dust and I don't give a goddamn
'Cause I'm that lyrical murderer
Pleading guilty, you know for my skills I'm about to be
Filthy large, Rage in charge
You know what's happenin', don't try to play Raj
This ain't no rerun, see hun, don't you want to be one
However, Rage'll wreck ya
'Cause I'm def, I kick my vocals
I'm loco, coast to coast or local, uh
I'll make 'em go cuckoo for my cocoa
Puffin' stuff, hey yo, Snoop, you're up
Let these niggas know that niggas don't give a fuck

This is just a small introduction to the G-Funk era
Every day of my life, I take a glimpse in the mirror
And I see motherfuckers tryna be like me
Ever since I put it down with the D-R-E

Foamin' at the mouth and waggin' his tail
Searchin' through the yard with a keen sense of smell
Lookin' for the business in heat
And when he find her, he'll be sniffing her seat
We travel in packs and we do it from the back
How else can you get to the booty?
We do it doggystyle, all the while we do it doggystyle
Yo motherfuckin' ho
He fucked the fleas off the bitch
He shaked the ticks off his dick
And in her booty, he buries his motherfuckin' bone
And if there's any left over
He'll roll over and take a doggy bag home

Damn, that Tanqueray is talkin' to a nigga
(I ain't bullshittin', one of y'all niggas gotta get it)
Man I got to piss
(Breath test?)
