		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think about death sometimes
I think about dying next to you
I think about my ex sometimes
I think about the things I'll never do
I think about the mess sometimes
That I always seem to cause
I light a cigarette sometimes
To forget 'bout all the thoughts

Yeah, I'm young and in love with someone who don't love me
I'm dumb, I get drunk to pretend that he does, see
I live and I learn but forget all the lessons
I'll see you in Hell if there's such thing as Heaven, oh

I'm six feet under but the world won't stop for me now
I keep moving 'cause, no, time don't turn back around
Yes, I love you but there's so much room for the doubt
Six feet under, I'm six feet under now
I'm six feet under but the world won't stop for me now
I keep moving 'cause, no, time don't turn back around
Yes, I love you but there's so much room for the doubt
Six feet under, I'm six feet under now

I get a little sad sometimes
I get a little scared and insecure
I go a little mad sometimes
Yeah, my mind climbs up the wall
I can't really comprehend sometimes
The places that I've been
I think about the end sometimes
The end of everything

Yeah, I'm young and in love with someone who don't love me
I'm dumb, I get drunk to pretend that he does, see
I live and I learn but forget all the lessons
I'll see you in Hell if there's such thing as Heaven

I'm six feet under but the world won't stop for me now
I keep moving 'cause, no, time don't turn back around
Yes, I love you but there's so much room for the doubt
Six feet under, I'm six feet under now
Six feet under but the world won't stop for me now
I keep moving 'cause, no, time don't turn back around
Yes, I love you but there's so much room for the doubt
Six feet under, I'm six feet under now
