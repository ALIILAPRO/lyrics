		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bring back the color)

Rose, light on her toes
Dancing in heels, her eyes on me
Rose already knows
That she's a dangerous maker of beauty

Chimney of the core 
Will you open for somebody who waits for time?
Speaking rhymes
Dreams and lies

Would I carry back the sun, carry back the sun
And beg for the mother to bring back the color?
Everyone I know and everyone I love
I beg for a lover to bring back the color

Bring back the color

Stone, sinks to the floor
And never returns back to before
The stone already knows
That it can crush all that has grown

Chimney of the core will you open for somebody who waits for crows? (Inhale)
Hides below (exhale)
A fading glow (inhale)

Would I carry back the sun, carry back the sun
And beg for the mother to bring back the color?
Everyone I know and everyone I love
I beg for a lover to bring back the color

Bring back the color

Would I carry back the sun, carry back the sun
And beg for the mother to bring back the color
Everyone I know and everyone I love
I beg for a lover to bring back the color

Oh, to bring back the color
