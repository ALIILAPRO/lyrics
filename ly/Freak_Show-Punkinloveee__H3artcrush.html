		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me pretty little lies
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Cameras flashing in my eyes
I wish it was still Christmas time
I'm gon' break her fucking spine
Wanna dance until we die
Sing along like lalala
I'm gon' cum all in her eyes

It was a starry night
You looked so horrified
Dance with a kitchen knife beautiful suicide
Fuck life, I'm traumatized
I'ma get lobotomized
Rockstar pants really tight
Hang myself on IG live
Lookin' through the peep hole
Welcome to the freak show
I don't fuck with people
I'm a skeleton in a tuxedo
Black cats 'n' broken mirrors
Why the fuck are you so serious?
My deep and darkest secrets?
Bitch, are you fucking serious?

Tell me pretty little lies
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Cameras flashing in my eyes
I wish it was still Christmas time
I'm gon' break her fucking spine
Wanna dance until we die
Sing along like lalala
I'm gon' cum all in her eyes

Oh, it's all a lie, I'm CGI
I'm all dolled up, turning up tonight
Party hard, let's party rock
OMG, she's a heart throb
Shut the fuck up and gimme top
My shit is hard as a rock

You answer all the time
And you fill me up with lies
Come into the mic see me when I cry
And you're such a fucking dime
And I really love your eyes
Pretty when I cry more and more sore
You love me too can you read my fears?
Can you read my fears? Kill me like a deer
Kill me like a deer can you read my fears?
Can you read my fears?
