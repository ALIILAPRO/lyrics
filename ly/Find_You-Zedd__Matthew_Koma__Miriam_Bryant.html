		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silent love is calling faith
To shatter me through your hallways
Into echoes you can feel
And rehearse the way you heal

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make go

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you

High on words
We almost used
We're fireworks with a wet fuse
Flying planes with paper wheels
To the same Achilles heels

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make go, oh

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you

(Yeah you always make me go)

Open up your skies
Turn up your night
To the speed of life
Turn up your night
Put your love in lights
Turn up your night
I will find you

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make go

(Yeah you always make me go)

I'll run away with your foot steps
I'll build a city that dreams for two
And if you lose yourself, I will find you

(Yeah you always make me go go go go go)
Turn up your night (go go go go)
Turn up your night (go go go go, turn it up, turn it up)
Turn up your night
I will find you

Make them dance
Just like you
'Cause you make me move
Yeah you always make go
