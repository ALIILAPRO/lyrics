		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  George Bush, George Clinton, Bill Clinton
Chris Farley, Chris Rock, Bob Marley
Rick James, knew how to throw a party
"Smoke some weed"
Snoop Dogg, all the way to Cheech and Chong
Cypress Hill, Robert Downey hit the bong
Ricky Williams, fuck how Miami feeling
"Smoke some weed"

This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you niggas drinking
Smoke some weed
This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking
Smoke some weed

If you a baller, nigga I'm a hall of famer
Lion tamer, with two fo'-fifth flamers
Understand, that yo' life's in danger
Didn't your momma, tell you not to talk to strangers
Lil' nigga, I'm the Hillside Strangler
Have a banger, calling for the Lone Ranger
Most rappers, they wanna fuck sangers
I'm a nigga, that wanna own Topanga
G4, pull it up out the hanger
A lil' something, to fuel you niggas anger
The swine, I'm your face rearranger
In a mansion cause Jesus born in a manger
Motherfucker, belong on Jerry Spranger
I'm a gangsta, up in your CD changer
I'll gank ya, for 20 bucks then I'll thank ya
Police, still get the middle fanger

This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you niggas drinking
Smoke some weed
This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking
Smoke some weed

Lil' niggas, don't try this at home
Momma in the bathroom leave her ass alone
Cause she probably taking chronic straight to the dome
Go play you lil' fucker, stop being grown
Dave Chappelle, 50 million and a throne
With a big Zulu bitch, nigga getting blown
Watch your tone, if your wear Coppertone
Go back to Africa used to be a theme song
I'm in the zone, do anybody got a zone
I ain't your poppa, but daddy is a rolling stone
Youse a clone, who don't know the shit you on
Unless it's on, a motherfucking ringtone
I'm in a room with two bottles of Patron
You need a loan, to fuck with the Family Stone
Nigga go on, tell 'em Ice Cube is home
Gorilla niggas, here come King Kong

This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you niggas drinking
Smoke some weed
This is West coast nigga thinking
California quicksand got a nigga sinking
I can give a fuck what you bitches drinking
Smoke some weed

Ice Cube motherfucka
West Coast motherfucka
Smoke some weed
