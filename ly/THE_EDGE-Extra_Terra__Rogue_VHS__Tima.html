		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been to the ocean
Got lost in the waves
Been everywhere you go
In sunshine and rain

Got washed up to the sun laying by your side
But I got up
You think I would have drowned if it wasn’t for you
But you pull me down

I'm around
Tonight
But I don’t know how long
You’re on the edge
But I
Can’t wait for you to come

How long will it take you
I'm holding my breath
It's lightning and thunder
I see that you’re scared

Yeah, you make such a mess speaking to yourself
Shouldn’t be so harsh
And I can’t trust myself when you string me along
So I cut you off

(Yeah, I cut you off)

I'm around
Tonight
But I don’t know how long
You’re on the edge
But I
Can't wait for you to come
I'm around
Tonight
But I don’t know how long
You’re on the edge
But I
Can't wait for you to come

I'm around
Tonight
But I don’t know how long
I'm on the edge
But I
Can't wait for you to come
