		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, do you want a bag?

I tried to kiss the taste of you away
Drink 'til I forgot your name
Love someone to love no one at all
Now I go out to feel at home again
Taking shots like medicine
Called him up 'cause you refused to call

So I fill my cup
Fill it way past the top
Everything is never enough
And nothing is far too much
I spend my time
Tryna make you not mine
Falling under guys I don't like
Thought that it'd make things right

But they say "Don't shop when you're hungry
Don't wait 'til you're starving
Don't spend all your money to buy what a heart gives
Don't drink in recovery
Or love when you're, love when you're lonely"
Don't shop when you're hungry or love when you're lonely

I tried to spend away the way it hurts
Knock offs turned into returns
'Cause nothing can compare to me and you, oh
Yeah, I try to play the game but it's never that easy
Little dinner dates always leaving me empty
Desperate dice roll and bad decisions that I wish I didn't, so I

So I fill my cup
Fill it way past the top
Everything is never enough
And nothing is far too much
I spend my time
Tryna make you not mine
Falling under guys I don't like
Thought that it'd make things right

But they say "Don't shop when you're hungry
Don't wait 'til you're starving
Don't spend all your money to buy what a heart gives
Don't call 'til you're sober
Don't help while you're hurting
Don't close all the doors just to see if one opens
Don't drink in recovery
Or love when you're, love when you're lonely"
Don't shop when you're hungry or love when you're lonely

Oh excuse me, sorry, your heart was declined
