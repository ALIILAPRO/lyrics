		  Yeah, yeah (ooh)
Yeah (yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh, hey)
I just pulled up in a lamb' and that big body slam
That big body flam, that big body, fuck (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, what?)
Big body sittin' outside, got big body truck
Got big body truck, don't give a fuck (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, what?)
This a wide body, we keep on the juice, got molly, got shrooms, got everything plus
Slidin' everywhere, bitch, you can't fuck with the gang, no, you cannot fuck wit' us
(Phew, rippin' the curb up the, phew)
Rippin' the curb up the bitch (swerve)
I put the swerve in that bitch (swerve)
I put the swerve on the tank (swerve)
I put the swerve in the tonka (hey)
I put the swerve on everyone's head, bitch, we gon' pull up, luh chonka (luh chonka)
Don't give no fucks, uh, luh chonka (yeah)
I got racks, bitch, don't pay me what you wanna
(Yeah, yeah) fill 'em with lead (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah), make him slumber (yeah, yeah, what?)
I don't give a fuck what you said (nah), delete my number (what? Dulio)
Yeah, I'm on the edge (yeah)
Yeah, I'm on the edge (yeah)
Yeah, I'm on the edge (yeah)
Yeah, I'm on the edge (yeah, yeah)
Poppin' they ass (yeah, yeah)
It's hot to flex (twenty-four seven)
I'm on they necks, yeah, sprayin' the tecs (bwah)
Yeah, I'm on they necks, got a couple of sticks, got a couple of blicks (bwah, bwah)
Feel like osama, this shit 'bout to stick, this shit 'bout to blow (yeah)
Pull up at shows (yeah), pull up at my show, I'm golden (yeah)
I'm not from London, bitch (yeah), I'm not your average bloke (woah)

No average shows, no average shows (ugh)
Nothin' on me is average (no)
We don't do average shoes (huh)
To half of these kids, I'm really they dad (huh)
I already had the results (huh)
You can't even handle this shit (huh)
You're like a joke, you better grab you some rope (huh)
This wave that you on, flam big, never gets old, do what you supposed
Play in your role, you is a hoe, I let y'all know, just stick to a pro

(Dulio-dulio-dulio)
Yeah, yeah (ooh)
Yeah (yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh, hey)
I just pulled up in a lamb' and that big body slam
That big body flam, that big body, fuck (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, what?)
Big body sittin' outside, got big body truck
Got big body truck, don't give a fuck (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, what?)
