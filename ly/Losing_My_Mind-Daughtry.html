		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought a train goin' any place could've changed my life
Never thought I'd say I could go insane, 'til I saw your eyes
And I had to take another look to know for sure
That you could be for real

You found an empty seat sittin' next to me
And I asked your name
Where you comin' from?
Where you headed to this Saturday?
'Cause I'm gonna be out on the town
As long as you are goin' there with me

Yeah and my head keeps spinnin'
You got me trippin'
There's something about the way you move
Yeah, every little single thing you do is like
One part angel and one part danger
But, oh, the kind of crazy I like
You got me losing my mind
I'm losing my mind!

It's getting hard to sleep
Getting hard to think 'bout much these days
'Cause everywhere I go
Only thing I see is your glowing face
And the way you light up every room you walk into
Just makes me want to scream

Yeah and my head keeps spinnin'
You got me trippin'
There's something about the way you move
Yeah, every little single thing you do is like
One part angel and one part danger
But, oh, the kind of crazy I like
You got me losing my mind
I'm losing my mind!

Can't understand why you got me so far gone
You're gonna have to lock me up before too long
You've got me losing my mind

Yeah and my head keeps spinnin'
You got me trippin'
There's something about the way you move
Yeah, every little single thing you do is like
One part angel and one part danger
But, oh, the kind of crazy I like
You got me losing my mind
I'm losing my mind!
You got me losing my mind
I'm losing my mind!
