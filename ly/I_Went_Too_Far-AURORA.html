		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went too far when I was begging on my knees
Begging for your arms, for you to hold around me
I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
Waiting for your love, waiting for our eyes to meet

Crying 'give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
I went too far when I was begging on my knees
When I cut my hands, so you could stand and watch me bleed
I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet
Standing in my blood, it was a taste of bittersweet

Crying 'give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight

Why can't I turn around and walk away?
Go back in time?
I had to turn around and walk away
I couldn't stay, I had to walk away

I'm left behind with an empty hole
And everything I am is gone
I tried to reach for another soul
So I can feel whole

Oh, give me some love
Oh, give me some love

Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight
Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me
Give me some love and hold me tight

Why can't I turn around and walk away?
Go back in time?
I had to turn around and walk away
I couldn't stay, I had to walk away
