		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ain't fall in love with me
You fell in love with the man I could be
You ain't fall in love with me
You fell in love with your vision of me

She said, "Boy, you ain't no good," yes, I know
Fuck I'm 'posed to do 'bout that? I'm on go
I been movin' state to state, I went pro (went pro)
Baby, plenty dough, heavy flow, shit crazy
I can ease your mind if you goin' through somethin'
That don't mean I can cure depression (can't cure a thing)
I'll free my night if you wanna do somethin' (do somethin')
But I'm takin' your direction

You ain't fall in love with me
You fell in love with the man I could be
You ain't fall in love with me
You fell in love with your vision of me

She said "Boy, who you been with?" I been low
She says she don't believe that shit, she think I'm gross
I can't even hug a bitch, she gon' know
Then fight me for the hell of it
I gotta dip, gotta go somewhere
Have I been wrong?
Have I been gone too long to know where I belong?
Whoa

You ain't fall in love with me
You fell in love with the man I could be
You ain't fall in love, no
You fell in love with your vision of me
