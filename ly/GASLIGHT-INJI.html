		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He knew me as a sweet a little girl
That was all for his own
He's never seen this side of my world
'Cause I've lost all control
I wanna drive him crazy
Like he did me
'Cause he did me wrong
All this behavior
I'm projecting
It was really all his fault
Girl I can show you
What to do
The thought of you
Won't leave of him alone (Ooh)
Let me tell you now
Gaslight, gatekeep
Call his new bitch mainstream
Toxic, hypnotic
Grab a couple bills from his wallet
Leak his photos naked
Lil' bitch think his dick's gold plated
Joyride in his new Mercedes
You still want me to have your babies
When I walked in the club
Everything changed when I walked in the club
He was looking at me like wow
Dior on my body, I drip and I drown
So he says
I heard you're a singer
I live in a penthouse it's on the East Side
I could tell what he implied
I don't trust my decisions I make after midnight
Love
Gaslight, gatekeep
Call his new bitch mainstream
Toxic, hypnotic
Grab a couple bills from his wallet
Leak his photos naked
Lil' bitch think his dick's gold plated
Joyride in his new Mercedes
You still want me to have your babies
He knew me as a sweet a little girl (Sweet little girl)
That was all for his own (Oh yeah)
He's never seen this side of my world
'Cause I've lost all control
I wanna drive him crazy
Like he did me
'Cause he did me wrong
All this behavior
I'm projecting (Wooh)
It was really all his fault
Girl I can show you
What to do
The thought of you
Won't leave of him alone (Ooh)
Let me tell you now
Gaslight, gatekeep
Call his new bitch mainstream
Toxic, hypnotic
Grab a couple bills from his wallet
Leak his photos naked
Lil' bitch think his dick's gold plated
Joyride in his new Mercedes
You still want me to have your babies
I'm the one in control (Yeah)
I want you all on your own (On your own babe)
Crawling into his momma's bed (Yeah)
Poor baby crying alone
When I walked in the club
Everything changed when I walked in the club
He was looking at me with love
But I could tell it was only the drugs
I went to his best friend's
He lives in a penthouse, it's on the West End
I'm here for the weekend
It's driving him crazy but I'm not your girlfriend
Gaslight, gatekeep
Call his new bitch mainstream
Toxic, hypnotic
Grab a couple bills from his wallet
Leak his photos naked
Lil' bitch think his dick's gold plated
Joyride in his new Mercedes
You still want me to have your babies
Gaslight, gatekeep
Call his new bitch mainstream
Toxic, hypnotic
Grab a couple bills from his wallet
Leak his photos naked
Lil' bitch think his dick's gold plated
Joyride in his new Mercedes
You still want me to have your babies
It's like genuinely all a joke
