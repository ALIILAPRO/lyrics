		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitches scared of me
They hate to make me wanna fight and shit (you pesky turtles)
I can tell by the smell
I can tell by the smell (out of my way)
Bitches scared of me
They hate to make me wanna fight and shit
I can tell by the smell
I can tell by the smell
Bitches scared of me
They hate to make me wanna fight and shit
I can tell by the smell
She been busy all night
Bitches scared of me
They hate to make me wanna fight and shit
I can tell by the smell
I can tell by the smell

Bitches scared of me

Bitches scared of me
Bitches scared of me
Bitches scared of me
Bitches scared of me
All night
Bitches scared of me
All night
Bitches scared of me
All night
Bitches scared of me
They hate to make me wanna fight and shit
