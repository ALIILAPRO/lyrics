		<p>
		  ""You'll find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame  You'll find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame I'll take my aim  Shaded windows Can I make it shout out The painful view Cover up Hide from here  Shed a tear Say no more Until you tell me when Silent stabs Are echoing again  You'll find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame I'll take my aim  Find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame I'll take my aim  Struggling to endure I can't say more Than I have said before Searching to be found When you're not around  No rest no support This has been my last resort Hoping I am blind Leaving me behind  You'll find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame I'll take my aim  Find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame I'll take my aim  You'll find me here When I'm gone Where I made My surrender From the flame I'll take my aim""
