		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A higher level of hate.
Running down your spine, into the back of your mind.
Stare it in the face, a higher level of hate.

Formulated free thought control is a prison.
A swarm of devices hum in dissonance.
Ill-intentioned and armed to strike at a distance.
Fall into it, fall into it, no escape.
Refine, eliminate obsolete civil ideology.
Hostages to the shadow state, a higher level of hate.

Running down your spine, into the back of your mind.
Stare it in the face, a higher level of hate.
Chaos by design, burnt into your eyes.
Stare it in the face, a higher level of hate.

Beta tested districts are slowly enlisted.
Bent to the persuasion of the architect.
All emotion reduced into analytics.
Fall into it, fall into it, no escape.
Refine, eliminate obsolete civil ideology.
Hostages to the shadow state, a higher level of hate.

Nothing more than a wrench in the machine, disposed of effortlessly.
Nothing more than a wrench in the machine, destroyed so effortlessly.

They know how to clean a crime scene.
Careful, it’s listening.
They know how to clean a crime scene.
Refine, eliminate.

Gears turn through the bone.
They don’t all go quiet, but they all fucking go.

Wires and chains.
A higher level of hate.

Running down your spine, into the back of your mind.
Stare it in the face, a higher level of hate.
Chaos by design, burnt into your eyes.
Stare it in the face, a higher level of hate.
