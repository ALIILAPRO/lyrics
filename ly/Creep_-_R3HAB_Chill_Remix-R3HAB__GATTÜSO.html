		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
And I wish I was special
You're so fucking special

But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

'Cause I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
And I want you to notice
When I'm not around (when I'm not around)
You're so fucking special (you're so fucking special)
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep
(I'm a creep)
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
(What the hell am I doing here?)
I don't belong here
(I don't belong here)

'Cause I'm a creep

'Cause I'm a creep
(I'm a creep)
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
(What the hell am I doing here?)
I don't belong here
(I don't belong here)

'Cause I'm a creep
