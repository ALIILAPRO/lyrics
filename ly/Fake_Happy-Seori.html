		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I read an old diary that I had less
It seemed happier than now
I read the people's faces
And I feel wasted, all feels like lies
Everybody laughing, looking charming
Showing off on the feeds
Why do I run hard for something?

Oh 또 새벽이 찾아올 때면
Oh-ooh

Why do I feel fake happy?
Always thought I've been dreaming
It's like I know I lost innocence
How funny, a life full of nonsense

Why do I feel like fading?
Like crumpled notebook pages
I'm constantly running for something
But I fear what awaits me is fake happy

화면 속 내 모습이 어색해 보이지
마치 내가 아닌 듯이
So it's like a dummy
Filled with images that people would love me

I don't even know the feeling of love
I spent a lot of time on what can't be touched
What I'm holding on, it's just too hard to let go

Oh 또 새벽이 밝아 올 때면
Oh-ooh

Why do I feel fake happy?
Always thought I've been dreaming
It's like I know I lost innocence
How funny, a life full of nonsense

Why do I feel like fading?
Like crumpled notebook pages
I'm constantly running for something
But I fear what awaits me is fake happiness

Why do I feel fake happy?
Why did I run for something?
Why do I feel fake happy? (Happy, oh)
Why do I feel like fading?
Always thought I've been dreaming
Why do I feel like fading?

Why do I feel fake happy?
Always thought I've been dreaming
It's like I know I lost innocence
How funny, a life full of nonsense

Why do I feel like fading?
Like crumpled notebook pages
I'm constantly running for something
Could it have already been close to me?
