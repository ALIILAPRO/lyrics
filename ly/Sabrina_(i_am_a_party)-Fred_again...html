		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a party
I know I should want to go
It's just not that much fun having fun
When you don't wanna have fun

I am a party
Inside of my head
Inside of my house
So I don't wanna go
I am a party
Inside of my head
It's just not that much fun having fun
When you don't wanna have fun (I'm gonna have fun)

I am a party
(Party)
I am a party

I am a party
Inside of my head
Inside of my home
Wherever I go
I am a party
Inside of my head (head-head-head-head)
I don't feel like someone that you know

I am a party
Inside of my head
So I don't wanna go

I don't wanna go
