		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine)
Candy man, candy man

(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine)
Sweet, sugar, candy man

I met him out for dinner on a Friday night
He really got me working up an appetite
He had tattoos up and down his arm
There's nothing more dangerous than a boy with charm
He's a one stop shop, makes the panties drop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man

He took me to the Spider club on Hollywood and Vine
We drank champagne, and we danced all night
We shook the paparazzi for a big surprise (a big surprise)
The gossip tonight will be tommorow's headlines
He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man (oh yeah)
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man

He's a one stop shop, makes my cherry pop
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man (oh)
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man

Well, by now I'm getting all bothered and hot
When he kissed my mouth, he really hit the spot
He had lips like sugar cane, oh
Good things come for boys who wait

(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine)
Candy man, candy man
(Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine)
Candy man, candy man

(Sweet, sugar, candy man)
He's a one stop, gotcha hot, makin' all the panties drop
(Sweet, sugar, candy man)
He's a one stop, got me hot, makin' my (uh) pop
(Sweet, sugar, candy man)
He's a one stop, get it while it's hot, baby, don't stop
(Sweet, sugar)

He got those lips like sugar cane
Good things come for boys who wait
He's a one stop shop with a real big (uh)
He's a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man
(Say what) a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man
(Say) a sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man, woo
A sweet talkin' sugar coated candy man

Candy man, candy man
Candy man, candy man
Candy man, candy man

(Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Tarzan and Jane were swingin' on a vine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Sippin' from a bottle of vodka double wine
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Jane lost her grip and down she fell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell
Squared herself away as she let out a yell)
