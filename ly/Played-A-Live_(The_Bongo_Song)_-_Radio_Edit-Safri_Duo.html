		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looked into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above)
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above)

Take me to take me to take me to 
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to take me to take me to 
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above)

There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looked into my eyes
Take me to the clouds above
There's a boy I know
He's the one I dream of
Looked into my eyes

Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above)
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above)

Take me to take me to take me to 
Take me to the clouds above
Take me to take me to take me to 
Take me to the clouds above
(clouds above clouds above)
