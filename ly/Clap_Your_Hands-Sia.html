		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I've been neglecting the good things, oh, oh, oh
Well I've been desiring the good things, oh, oh, oh
I'm biting the lighting the good things, oh, oh, oh
I've minding what to see the good things, oh, oh, oh

Shake me out of my misery, oh, oh, oh
Oh, on a night like this
Get out of misery, oh, oh, oh

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance, we only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance, we only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands

I'm trying to fly in 
The good things, oh, oh, oh
I'm finding this might be 
A good thing, oh, oh, oh

Shake me out of my misery, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, make me get out and wiggle it, oh, oh, oh

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance, we only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance, we only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Clap your hands, clap your hands

Clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance, we only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Turn the lights on my nights this is life and we only get one chance
Oh, clap your hands, clap your hands
Come on dance, take a chance on romance, we only get one shot at love
Oh, clap your hands (oh, clap your hands)
