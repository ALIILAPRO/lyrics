		  I see the star lalalala lalalala 

I see the star lalalala lalalala 

My reality all my fantasy 
Ever single star in the sky calling is to me 
My reality all my fantasy 
Ever single star in the sky calling is to me 
Is calling to me
Every time I looking in ur eyes
Feeling oh I need

I see the star lalalala lalalala

My reality all my fantasy 
Ever single star in the sky calling is to me 
My reality all my fantasy 
Ever single star in the sky calling is to me
