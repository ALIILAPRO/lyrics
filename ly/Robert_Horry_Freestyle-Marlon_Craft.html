		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah they say they miss the old Craft
No they don’t, that line’s for all you cats
Who got no growth path far as I can see
They fuckin' with the grown Craft
Far as I can see
I stayed me and I growed that
Far as I can see
You puppets got your nose back
Know that you a tweet away
From an exposed act
We don’t need no discussion
No loyalty don’t mean nothin’
If there’s traffic you just pick a
New jersey like D Hudson
Y’all be switchin’ teams
Runnin’ from the work, frontin’ isn't worth
I turn an assumption to a perk
Used to lump 'em in with
Bunches couldn’t carry my water
Ahh, look what I taught 'em
If I ever lost, then I learn (then I learn)
You don’t worry ‘bout the
Cost when it’s earned (whеn it's earned)
If therе’s one thing I’m not, it’s concerned
Bout a flashy rapper ahead of me
Talkin’ it’s his turn (not concerned)
We’ll see who’s tank is on what and when
We gon’ see who flake when that summer ends
When that easy pavement all under
Them turn to schemes
Mistakes and all frontin’ friends
And these dreams I made from up under
Them made from genius, patience, and blood
Cement and I win i’m about impact
I’m a name yours type of guy
I ain’t with the apps
I’m a main course type of guy
I ain’t in the mix
I’m a straight pour type of guy
I don’t do the scripts, I’m a
I’m a make yours type of guy
Look, bitch I’m Robert Horry
Hit the shots that count so
Now you can’t ignore me
I own all my energy, hoe you can’t afford me
You’ll see when we countin’ up the rings
