		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I wanted to break
Laugh it all off in your face?
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor
Couldn't take this anymore?
What would you do, do, do?

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you

What if I wanted to fight
Beg for the rest of my life?
What would you do? (Do, do, do)
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you (from you)

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me, killing me
All I wanted was you

I tried to be someone else
But nothing seemed to change
I know now, this is who I really am inside
I've finally found myself
Fighting for a chance
I know now, this is who I really am

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you, you, you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me, killing me
All I wanted was you

Come, break me down (bury me, bury me)
Break me down (bury me, bury me)
Break me down(bury me, bury me)

(Say you wanted more)
What if I wanted to break
(What are you waiting for?)
(Bury me, bury me)
(I'm not running from you)
What if I, what if I, what if I, what if I
(Bury me, bury me)
