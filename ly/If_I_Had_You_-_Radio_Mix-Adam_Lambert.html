		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I got my boots on,
Got the right amount of leather
And I'm doing me up with a black color liner
And I'm working my strut but I know it don't matter
All we need in this world is some love

There's a thin line between the dark side and the light side baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble, tryin' to find it
But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

From New York to LA getting high rock and rolling
Get a room trash it up 'till it's ten in the morning
Girls in stripper heels, boys rolling in Maserati's
What they need in this world is some love
There's a thin line between the wild time and a flat-line baby tonight
It's a struggle gotta rumble tryin' to find it

But if I had you, that would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-you
If I had

The flashing of the lights
It might feel so good but I got you stuck on my mind, yeah
The flashing and the stage it might get me high
But it don't mean a thing tonight

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
If I had you, life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-you
If I had you

That would be the only thing I'd ever need
Yeah if I had you, then money fame and fortune never could compete
(never could compete with you)
If I had you, life would be a party, it'd be ecstasy (it'd be ecstasy with you)
Yeah if I had you
You y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-y-you, y-y-y-y-you
If I had you
