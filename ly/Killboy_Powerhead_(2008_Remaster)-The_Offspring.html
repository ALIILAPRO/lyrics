		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
Always busts his knuckles 
When he's wrenchin' up his shit

He's killboy powerhead, killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead, killboy powerhead, yeah

You know I saw his woman
She was writing his name in blood
Yeah, I saw his woman, hard as a rock
She said she was his baby
Lookin' just like the Hoover Dam
Yeah, I saw his woman, hard as a rock

He's killboy powerhead, killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead, killboy powerhead, yeah

He's a pistol grip
And a lightning rod hammer step
Always busts his knuckles 
When he's wrenchin' up his shit

He's killboy powerhead, killboy powerhead
Killboy powerhead, killboy powerhead, yeah
Killboy powerhead, yeah
He's a killboy powerhead, yeah
