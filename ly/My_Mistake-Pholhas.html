		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a place that I lived 
And a girl, so young and fair 
I have seen many things in my life 
Some of them I'll never forget 
Everywhere... 
I was sent to prison 
For having murdered my wife 

Because she was living with him 
I lost my head and shot her 
This was my story in the past 
And I'll go to reform myself 
I am paying for my mistake 
I will never be the same man again
