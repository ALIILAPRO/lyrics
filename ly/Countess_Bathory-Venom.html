		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcoming the virgins fair, to live a noble life
In the castle known to all - the Count's infernal wife
She invites the peasants with endless lavish foods
But, when evening spreads it wings, she rapes them of their blood
Countess Bathory 
Countess Bathory 
All day long the virgins sit and feast on endless meals 
The Countess laughs and sips her wine - her skin doth crack and peel 
But when nightime fills the air one must pay the price 
The Countess takes her midnight bath with blood that once gave life 
Countess Bathory 
Countess Bathory 
Living in her self styled Hell, the Countess dressed in black
Life's so distant - death's so near - no blood to turn time back 
The castle walls are closing in, she's crippled now with age
Welcomes death with open arms - the reaper turns the page 
Countess Bathory 
Countess Bathory
