		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anyone but you couldn't get it
You're gonna back up off it for a minute
You owe me peace of mind
Just take your time, just take your time

Anyone but you couldn't open
Up my eyes and help me see this moment
You are my peace of mind
So I'll take my time, I'll take my time

You got me so bad
I got nothing left
It's just us in bed
And I can't go back

I can't go back
And I can't go back

And you feel so right (I'm falling now)
This could be every night (I'll be around)
Don't ever leave my side (look what we found)
When I'm holding you so tight

Holding you
So tight
Holding you
So tight
