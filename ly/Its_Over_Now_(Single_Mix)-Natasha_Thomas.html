		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She never really loved you
It was right from the start
The only thing she gave you
Was a broken heart

And the emptiness you feel inside
So come take my hand
You know the time has come for you to face
The truth

And I will pull you through
Washing away all your tears
And you'll start again
Throw away all your fears all your fears

[Chorus]
After the rain, all the birds want to fly
And when the wind breezes a sigh
And after the rain when you touch one again
Losing your pain
Sunshine after rain

After the rain it is peaceful and warm
Sunshine comes after the storm
And after the rain when you touch one again
Losing your pain

Sunshine after rain
Gotta keep your head up
Gotta stay and be strong
And by now you should know

She never ever loved you
You're love never grow never grow

[Chorus]

And though you don't know just what magic
A raindrop contains uh a raindrop contains
But I know that everything is
Wonderful after rain

Uh after the rain
After the rain, all the birds want to fly
And when the wind breezes a sigh
