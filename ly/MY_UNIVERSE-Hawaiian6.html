		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly! My voice echoes
through the sky.
But I don't know the reason why.
My body is in pain
I can't explain.
Everytime I was annoyed.
The sun is setting way
beyond the sea.
It always makes a fool of me.
Running through the night
I dry my tears and.
Keep repeating."Fuck you."
Life, Life, Life, it sticks
like a knife sometimes.
Insecurity, it falls like rain.
I I I I wonder what is life?
All my self abhorrence
and my worried
they just weigh me down.
weigh me down.
Everything disappears
and passes away.
My hopes and my dreams
have changed to nightmares.
When I awake inside My Universe.
I open my eyes screaming.
Everything passes away.

Fly! My voice echoes
through the sky.
But I don't know the reason why.
My body is in pain
I can't explain.
Everytime I was annoyed.
The sun is setting way
beyond the sea.
It always makes a fool of me.
Running through the night
I dry my tears and.
Keep repeating."Fuck you."
Life, Life, Life, it sticks
like a knife sometimes.
Insecurity, it falls like rain.
I I I I wonder what is life?
All my self abhorrence
and my worried
they just weigh me down.
Everything disappears
and passes away.
My hopes and my dreams
have changed to nightmares.
When I awake inside My Universe.
I open my eyes screaming.
Everything passes away.
I open my eyes screaming.
Everything passes away.
I open my eyes screaming.
Everything passes away.
