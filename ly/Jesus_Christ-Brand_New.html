		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face
The kind you'd find on someone that could save
If they don't put me away
Well it'll be a miracle

Do you believe you're missing out
Everything good is happening somewhere else
But with nobody in your bed
The night's hard to get through

And I, will die, all alone
And when I, arrive, I won't know anyone

Well Jesus Christ I'm alone again
So what did you do those three days you were dead
'Cuz this problem's gonna last
More than the weekend

Well Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die
I'm a little bit scared of what comes after
Do I get the gold chariot
Do I float through the ceiling

Do I, divide, and fall apart
'Cuz my bright, is too sly, to hold back all my dark

And the ship, went down, in sight of land
And at the gates, does Thomas, ask to see my hands

I know you'll come in the night like a thief
But I've had some time alone, to hold my lions at bay

I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up(and you won't know)
So do you think that we could work out a psalm
So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try

I know you're coming for the people like me
We all got wood and nails, we try n' tear down hate and factory
We all got wood and nails, don't tear down hate n' factory
We all got wood and nails, and we sleep inside of this machine
