		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I liked her more when it was just fantasy
Never expected that you’ll be haunting me
The possibility for it to be real
For you and me is history

And if you were coming back
They say unlike minds attract
While I’m at home making sense of it (sense of it)

Mistakes are so well designed
No point for us to rewind
The ball is in my court
And I just need you to know

Like our validation is even relevant
And you just hurt me for the hell of it
Taking it back just to say it again
I think we’re better off as friends

Like opinion mine’s irrelevant
But you won’t hear the other half of it
Calling it quits just to start it up
No no we’ll never have enough

You found me lying here in my fantasy
You made this comfy and I don’t want to leave
My instincts tell me that I should pack my things
Cause we just have no chemistry (you and me we’re history)

And if you were coming back
You’d say I like you like that
But none of that makes sense to me

Mistakes are so well designed
No universes aligned
The ball is in my court
And I just need you to know

Like our validation is even relevant
And you just hurt me for the hell of it
Taking it back just to say it again
I think we’re better off as friends

Like opinion mine’s irrelevant
But you won’t hear the other half of it
Calling it quits just to start it up
No no we’ll never have enough

Like our validation is even relevant
And you just hurt me for the hell of it
Taking it back just to say it again
I think we’re better off as friends

Like opinion mine’s irrelevant
But you won’t hear the other half of it
Calling it quits just to start it up
