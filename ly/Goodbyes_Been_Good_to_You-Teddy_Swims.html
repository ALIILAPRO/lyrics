		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye, my love
You tore me up
I heard you found somebody new
Looks like goodbye's been good to you
Good days I'm on
And I can't move on
Quite as easy as you do
Looks like goodbye's been good to you

I been a-hurtin' since you walked out the door
Nothing's workin' like the way it did before
Oh, I cry, oh, I cry, oh, I pray a little to the Lord
Oh, I try, oh, I try, but it only make me miss you more (yeah)
You took the dog and the Honda and half my shit
Kinda mad at my mama 'cause y'all still friends
I gotta move so I never gotta see you again
I never see you again, so long

Goodbye, my love
You tore me up
I heard you found somebody new
Looks like goodbye's been good to you
Good days I'm on
And I can't move on
Quite as easy as you do
Looks like goodbye's been good to you

Looks like, looks like, looks like
Looks like goodbye's been good to you
Looks like, looks like, looks like

Gave you all my love, all my time
All my money, baby
It wasn't enough, I'm still smilin'
'Cause 'cause the finer things
I'll get better like
Changin' weather
And you're gonna miss me like how
Like how I miss you right now

Goodbye, my love
You tore me up
I heard you found somebody new
Looks like goodbye's been good to you
Good days I'm on
And I can't move on
Quite as easy as you do
Looks like goodbye's been good to you

Looks like, looks like, looks like (whoa)
Looks like, looks like, looks like

(Sleep) well, I can't get no sleep
(Eat) and I ain't ate in weeks
(Drink) I did plenty of that
(Weed) yeah, I roll 'em up fat
(Sleep) well, I can't get no sleep
(Eat) oh, and I ain't ate in weeks
(Drink) well, I did plenty of that
(Weed) yeah, I roll 'em up fat

Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
