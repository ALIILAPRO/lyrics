		  Justin Bieber
Pop star Justin Bieber
Denied he fathered a child
There, there is a lot of good that comes with celebrity, you know that
(Yeah) there is also a pretty white hot spotlight
(Of course) and you found yourself under it recently, (yeah) some headlines
(Set the record straight, none of it is true)
Do you know this woman? (Never met the woman)
No? (So) okay, alright, well, obviously this is what comes along with, uh (exactly)
Life in the fast lane as they say

She says she met me on a tour
She keeps knocking on my door
She won't leave me, leave me alone
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong

'Cause she wanted all my attention, oh
And she was dragging my name through the dirt (no)
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, Maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby (no), that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby (no), that ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now, this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth
She's faking, faking it all

'Cause she wanted all my attention (yeah)
And she was dragging my name through the dirt (no)
She was dying for my affection
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her

I'm talking to you, Maria
Why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby (no), that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby (no), she ain't my girl
But she talking in, and she needs to quit
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby (that's not my baby), that ain't my girl (no)
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now this girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

Why are you trying, trying to lie, girl?
When ain't I never met you at all
Saying goodbye (bye), but how could ya
You throw this, you throw this
Your foolishness, seduces

Maria, why you wanna do me like that?
That ain't my baby (no), that ain't my girl
Maria, why you wanna play me like that?
She ain't my baby, she ain't my girl

But she talking in, and she needs to quit
But never this, all I know she's not mine
That ain't my baby, (that's not my baby) that ain't my girl (no)
'Cause she's wildin' out, what she talking about?
Let me tell you now, that girl she's not mine
She ain't my baby (she is not my baby), she ain't my girl (no)

That ain't my baby (she ain't my baby), that ain't my girl
She ain't my baby (she ain't my baby), she ain't my girl
That ain't my baby (she ain't my baby)
That ain't my girl (she ain't my girl, yeah)
She ain't my baby (she's not my girl)
