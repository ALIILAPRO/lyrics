		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody needs a little time away 
I heard her say 
From each other 
Even lovers need a holiday 
Far away from each other 
Hold me now 
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry 
I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through, 
I will make it up to you 
I promise to 
And after all that's been said and done 
You're just a part of me I can't let go 

Couldn't stand to be kept away 
Just for the day 
From your body 
Wouldn't want to be swept away 
Far away from the one that I love 

Hold me now 
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry 
I just want you to know 

Hold me now 
I really want to tell you I'm sorry 
I could never let you go 
After all that we've been through, 
I will make it up to you 
I promise to 

And after all that's been said and done 
You're just a part of me I can't let go 
After all that we've been through, 
I will make it up to you, 
I promise to 

And after all that's been said and done 
You're just a part of me I can't let go 

You're gonna be the lucky one

Everybody needs a little time away 
I heard her say
