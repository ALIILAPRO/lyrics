		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a look inside your heart
Is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath
'Til you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me
When I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me?
Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair
Was only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly
And one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying?
It was never even love
Did you ever want me?
Was I ever good enough?

The, the boy's a liar
The boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya
You're not lookin' at me, boy
The boy's a liar
The boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya
You're not lookin' at me, boy

Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough

He say that I'm good enough, grabbin' my duh-duh-duh
Think about shit that I shouldn't have (huh)
So I tell him it's one of me, he makin' fun of me (ha-ha)
His girl is a bum to me (grrah)
Like that boy is a cap
Sayin' he home, but I know where he at, like
Bet he blowin' her back
Thinkin' 'bout me 'cause he know that ass fat (damn)
And it been what it been (huh)
Callin' his phone like, "Yo, send me your pin"
Duckin' my shit, 'cause he know what I'm on (grrah)
But when he hit me, I'm not gon' respond (grrah)
But I don't sleep enough without you
And I can't eat enough without you (huh)
If you don't speak, does that mean we're through? (Huh)
Don't like sneaky shit that you do (grrah)

The, the boy's a liar
The boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya
You're not lookin' at me, boy
The boy's a liar
The boy's a liar
He doesn't see ya
You're not lookin' at me, boy

Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
Good eno-o-ough
