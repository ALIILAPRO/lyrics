		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Often I am upset
That I cannot fall in love 
But I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it

Are you, you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now, but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

Cut, cut hair, leave
Cut my hair
Cut, cut hair
Strangely he feels at home in this
Strangely he feels at home in this

Often I am upset
That I cannot fall in love
But I guess
This avoids the stress of falling out of it

Are you, you tired of me yet?
I'm a little sick right now, but I swear
When I'm ready I will fly us out of here

Cut, cut hair, leave
Cut my hair
Cut, cut hair
Strangely he feels at home in this
Strangely he feels at home in this
