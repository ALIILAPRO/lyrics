		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been meaning to tell you
I've been out of my head
Left my heart on your doorstep
Left you out of my bed
Maybe I'm delusional
Is that so unusual?
Didn't mean to offend you
Was it something I said
Put me into your locket
Pull me off of a ledge
Maybe I'm insatiable
I'm feeling so sensational

I'll get by or maybe I won't
I can lie and say that I don't
Waste my time, lately I know
It's everything or nothing at all

Everything or nothing at all
Everything or nothing at all
Now that all the feeling is gone
Everything or nothing at all

Need a new superstition
One I'll never regret
Put your book in my pocket
Put your chain on my neck
Wouldn't it be dangerous
If nothing was restraining us

I'll get by or maybe I won't
I can lie and say that I don't
Waste my time, lately I know
It's everything or nothing at all

Everything or nothing at all
Everything or nothing at all
Now that all the feeling is gone
Everything or nothing at all

Never mind, love and hate
Peace of mind, it's a bit too late

(Nothing at all)
(Nothing at all)
(Nothing at all)
(Nothing at all)
(Nothing at all)

I'll get by with nothing at all
Fill my mind with nothing at all
Waste my time with nothing at all
It's everything or nothing at all

Never mind, love and hate
(Nothing at all)
Peace of mind, it's a bit too late
(Nothing at all)
Never mind, love and hate
(Nothing at all)
Peace of mind, it's a bit too late
(Nothing at all)
