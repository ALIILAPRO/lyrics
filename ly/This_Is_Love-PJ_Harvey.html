		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe that life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress
I can't believe that life's so complex
When I just want to sit here and watch you undress

This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love
That I'm feeling

Does it have to be a life full of dread?
Wanna chase you round the table, wanna touch your head
Does it have to be a life full of dread?
Wanna chase you round the table, wanna touch your head

This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love
That I'm feeling

I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering
When you taste so good
I can't believe that the axis turns on suffering
When my headache burns

That love, love, love, love
That I'm feeling
This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love
That I'm feeling

Even in the summer, even in the spring
You can never get too much of a wonderful thing

You're the only story that I never told
You're my dirty little secret, wanna keep you so
You're the only story that never been told
You're my dirty little secret, wanna keep you so

Come on out, come on over, help me forget
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in
Come on out, come on over, help me forget
Keep the walls from falling on me, tumbling in
Keep the walls from falling as they're tumbling in

This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love
That I'm feeling
This is love, love, love, love
That I'm feeling
This is love, this is love
That I'm feeling
