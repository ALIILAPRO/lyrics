		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could just stay here
Had the best of times in the cold night sky by your side
I knew you were so rare
When you said my name took my breath away, still I know
We've only started but I knew it from the day that I first met you
Even the world and all the stars are pointing us back to where we are

And if I'm honest
I don't wanna lose it all
Cause you're everything that I want
I'm never letting go when your in my arms

I know it when you hold me
We're at the beginning of our start
And it's all unwritten till we write this story
My one and only
Even after all this time
There's never a doubt inside my mind
It's all unwritten till we write this story
It feels like you barely know me yet

Oh you barely know me yet
Oh you barely know me yet
Oh you barely know me yet, oh

Thought I was frozen
Before you were mine didn't know where this road was going
And I was so caught up thinking
I'll never be anyone that would need what you've given me
Now I don't ever wanna live another second without you
Though it's the beginning I look forward to what could
Be the rest of our lives getting to know
Every part of you is everything I want

And if I'm honest
I don't wanna lose it all
Cause you give me everything and more
I'm never letting go when your in my arms

I know it when I hold you
We're at the beginning of our start
And it's all unwritten till we write this story

My one and only
Even after all this time
There's never a doubt inside my mind
And it's all unwritten till we write this story
Feels like you barely know me yet

Oh you barely know me yet
Oh you barely know me yet
Oh you barely know me yet, oh

Know that's there's nothing else that's on my mind
Only you tonight
Knowing the rest of time is you and I
Only you and I

Know it when you hold me
We're at the beginning of our start
And it's all unwritten till we write this story
My one and only
Even after all this time
There's never a doubt inside my mind
It's all unwritten till we write this story
Feels like you barely know me yet
