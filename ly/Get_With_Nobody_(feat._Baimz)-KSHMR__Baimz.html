		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't take my eyes off you
But you can break my heart in two
I always fall in love and what falls in love alone
Still much trust to break
We've had a share of past mistakes
I guess I'm better off, I'm better on my own

Don't want to admit to myself
I don't want you with someone else
I wonder sometimes if you feel like what we have is real

Still, I don't want you here in my bed
I'd rather just miss you instead
Wonder if I'm on your mind 'cause you're on mine

I can't get with nobody
Only you on my mind, babe
Yeah, I can't get with nobody
Only you on my mind
Only you on my mind
Only you

Things that are fragile break
I'm always afraid, a one not to say
These words can twist in far too many ways
Don't want to admit to myself
But I don't want you with someone else
I wonder sometimes what could be if we left boundaries

Still, I don't wanna lay in your bed
I'd rather just miss you instead
I wonder if I'm on your mind 'cause you're on mine

I can't get with nobody
Only you on my mind, babe
Yeah, I can't get with nobody
Only you on my mind
Only you on my mind
It's only you

I can't get with nobody
Only you on my mind, babe
Yeah, I can't get with nobody
Only you on my mind
Only you
