		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Melon and the coconut are sitting on the floor
Coco said to Melly, "I can't do this anymore"
Everything we're doing just feels fucking cold
Everything we're shooting is just fake B-roll
B-sides, killing time, filler, that's all
How did this happen when we were so close?

How did this all go so Pete Tong?
When it all started I thought we would grow old
Living in the city with a baby and a dog
Doing school runs in a 4x4
I'd make pancakes and waffles
I could be a stay at home G.I. Joe

Melly said to Coco, "You can't do this anymore?"
One day, you'll see you're fucking wrong
Sometimes B-sides are the best songs
Sometimes killing time's very fruitful

I know I can't make you younger
I can't stop life moving onwards
I can't hide you from life's horrors
I'm not making you like your father
Too much quinoa and online shopping
Off-white Air Force ones in boxes
You're a fucking coconut, can't even put 'em on
Even if you could you couldn't even pull 'em off
