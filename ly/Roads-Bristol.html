		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel so wrong
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong

Storm in the morning light
I feel
No more can I say
Frozen to myself

I got nobody on my side
And surely that's not right
I got nobody on my side
And surely that's not right

Oh, can't anybody see
We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel, how can it feel so wrong
How can it feel, how can it feel so wrong
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong

We've got a war to fight
Never found our way
Regardless of what they say

How can it feel so wrong
From this moment
How can it feel this wrong
