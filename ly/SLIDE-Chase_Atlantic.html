		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, red eyes, black dragon
Fuck, I think the nitrous did damage
I can't feel my legs yet I'm standing
I barely make it down the stairs without panic
Woah, I won't let it set me off
Man, no pressure, only texting when I'm not enough
I let it fly with all your friends and get them all involved
Feel depression like you never felt it here at all

Uh, slide, I can see the pain in your eyes
I don't wanna say that I'm good, but
I'll take you to heaven if you die
Uh, uh, yeah, slide
I know that you've never been this high
Promise, baby, I'll take you to heaven if you want it
I'll take you to heaven if you die

(Yeah, yeah)
I'm so impatient, self-medicated
Caught in a daze, I persuade her with my own complications
Says I'm stuck in my ways, it's understated
One in the chamber, I shot back
Then she told me I should speak up
I can't even hear you through the speaker
I don't talk to call it out on purpose
Lying to me baby, make you earn it
Make me earn it
They don't deserve you
I can't feel my legs, I can't feel my legs
Yeah, hop right on the ledge, jump right off the edge
Maybe I felt it, yeah, yeah

Uh, slide, I can see the pain in your eyes
I don't wanna say that I'm good, but
I'll take you to heaven if you die
Uh, uh, yeah, slide
I know that you've never been this high
Promise, baby, I'll take you to heaven if you want it
I'll take you to heaven if you die

Slide
'Cause I can feel the pain in your eyes
I can see you sitting on my lap, ooh
Slide, I can see the pain in your eyes
Am I still in your dream?

Uh, slide, I can see the pain in your eyes
I don't wanna say that I'm good, but
I'll take you to heaven if you die
Uh, uh, yeah, slide
I know that you've never been this high
Promise, baby, I'll take you to heaven if you want it
I'll take you to heaven if you die

Slide

Slide
I know that you've never been this high
Promise, baby, I'll take you to heaven if you want it
I'll take you to heaven if you die
