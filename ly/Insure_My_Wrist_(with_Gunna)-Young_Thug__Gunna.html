		  (Taurus)
I don't believe ya
When you say you're different
(Taurus)
'Cause I heard it all before
Yeah

Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, I went got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma, "Be careful, bitch, this all on my expense"
I told her, "Watch the wheels on the Bent', cause' it ain't rented"
Talk about a bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks and pennies
These pussies ridin' waves, so why they motherfuckin' spinnin'?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

My mama told me "Pick up the phone"
I got a call from the label sayin', "It's coming in strong"
I just called up my old lady, told her "Go pick what you want"
I put these racks on your potato, your tomato get gone
She ask me who I am when she see me
I'm just that nigga wit' that million dollar T.P
I came from nothin' but that ain't how the world see me
I'm kinda happy, I guess that's how the girls skeet me
I told my nigga "Don't be worried 'bout no CC"
I'ma have your shit together by your B-day
I told them just don't go out sad or be no cheapskate
I wanna see you on the building out on Peachtree
Yeah, yeah

Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, I went got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma, "Be careful, bitch, this all on my expense"
I told her, "Watch the wheels on the Bent', cause' it ain't rented"
Talk about a bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks and pennies
These pussies ridin' waves, so why they motherfuckin' spinnin'?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

Ho put a trackin' chip inside my watch
Got rich with felons, ain't no tellin', I can never be a cop
Set of Forgi's on Pirelli, got me swervin', dodging pots
My investor done invested all my extras in the stocks
How I make it through the killings?
How I'm here to see the vision?
Save until that money rot
I stack it to the ceiling
Give 'em everything you got
Shoot it fully 'til its empty
Let 'em know "Don't ever tempt me"
Well respected in the city, huh
The money grown, I had to grab my Lamborghini out
Rich on my own, I brought it home and now my family proud
I got some tucked away in case we get a rainy cloud
We poured a couple eights today, I woke up on a cloud

Half a million, got insurance on my watch
Half a million, I went got me some insurance on my wrist
I told lil' ma, "Be careful, bitch, this all on my expense"
I told her, "Watch the wheels on the Bent', cause' it ain't rented"
Talk about a bitch, oh, I got plenty
I'm talkin' 'bout a lot, like a million bucks and pennies
These pussies ridin' waves, so why they motherfuckin' spinnin'?
And my diamonds black like spades, and I'm smilin' and grinnin'

Yeah, I don't believe ya
When you say you're different
(Taurus)
'Cause I heard it all before
