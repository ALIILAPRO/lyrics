		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know that I can't love you more
You know that I can't love you more

Silver tongue, they'll soon be gone
When the sunlight hits the room
Lay down with them if you want
Watch their breath and feel the cold

Raise you hand, bite you tongue
Conversation is over and done
Will you let them out?
Will you let them in?
Will you ever know when it's the tipping point, the tipping point?

So who's that ghost knocking at my door?
You know that I can't love you more
What's that shape climbing over my wall?
You know that I can't love you more

You know that I can't love you more

Winter done, they'll soon be gone
From this unforgiving place
To that vague and distant void
Where the sunlight splits the eye

Life is cruel, life is tough
Life is crazy, then it all turns to dust
Will you let them out?
Will you let them in?
Will you ever know when it's the tipping point
The tipping point, the tipping point
The tipping point, the tipping point? (The tipping point)

So who's that ghost knocking at my door?
You know that I can't love you more
What's that shape climbing over my wall?
You know that I can't love you more

So who's that ghost knocking at my door?
You know that I can't love you more
What's that shape climbing over my wall?
You know that I can't love you more
Love you more, love you more, love you more
