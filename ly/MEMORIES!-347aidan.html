		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn
Another pointless song about someone who doesn't give a shit about me
Hah

So I'm lookin' through my memories
Fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you?
You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young, I know that's not my destiny

So I'm lookin' through my memories
Fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you?
You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young, I know that's not my destiny
So I'm lookin' through my memories
Fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you?
You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young, I know that's not my destiny

Yeah, I'm searchin' for my destiny, trippin' for a better me
I don't wanna break your heart, so you better leave
It's not that I don't love you, I'm just losin' myself mentally
And yeah, I'd rather scream than use you as my remedy
I'm scared to open up
I'm scared to really feel
Afraid of my own mind
I don't know if I will heal
I wish that you weren't real
I wish this ended when I woke up
And my high is my sobriety
I wish someone would save us
I know it's not my destiny to die without a legacy
I guess I am my enemy
Yeah, why'd I look through memories?

So I'm lookin' through my memories
Fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you?
You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young, I know that's not my destiny
So I'm lookin' through my memories
Fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you?
You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young, I know that's not my destiny

So I'm lookin' through my memories
Fallin' into jealousy
How can I miss you?
You're really just my enemy
Breakin' apart, but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young, I know that's not my destiny
