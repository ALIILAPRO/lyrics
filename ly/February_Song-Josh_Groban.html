		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where has that old friend gone
Lost in a February song
Tell him it won't be long
'Til he opens his eyes
Opens his eyes
Where is that simple day
Before colors broke into shades
And how did I ever fade
Into this life
Into this life

And I never want to let you down
Forgive me if I slip away
And all that I've known is lost and found
I promise you I
I'll come back to you one day

Morning is waking up
Sometimes it's more than just enough
And all that you need to love
Is in front of your eyes
It's in front of your eyes

And I never want to let you down
Forgive me if I slip away
Sometimes it's hard to find my ground
'Cause I keep on falling as I try to get away
From this crazy world

And I never want to let you down
Forgive me if I slip away
And all I've known is lost and found
I promise you I
I'll come back to you one day

Where has that old friend gone
Lost in a February song
Tell him it won't be long
'Til he opens his eyes
Opens his eyes
