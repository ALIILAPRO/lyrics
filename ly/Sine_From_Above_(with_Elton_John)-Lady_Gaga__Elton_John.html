		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was young, I prayed for lighting
My mother said it would come and find me
I found myself without a prayer
I lost my love and no one cared
When I was young, I prayed for lightning

Yeah, I looked
With my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there
No, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared
While my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there
No, no, nothing

I heard one sine from above
I heard one sine from above
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was up, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine

When I was young, I felt immortal
And not a day went by without a struggle
I lived my days just for the nights
I lost myself under the lights
When I was young, I felt immortal

Yeah, I looked
With my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there
No, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared
While my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there
No, no, nothing

I heard one sine from above
I heard one sine from above
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was up, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine

Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was up, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine

Healed my heart
Healed my
Heart, heard a
Sine
Healed my
Heart, heard a sine
