		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darkened dynasty
Endless rivalry
Meeting violently
You can't change me
First it's ebony
Then it's ivory
Making revelry
You can't break me

Can't stop and I will never hit the breaks
All nine levels and no matter what it takes
All these places and their shadow figured shapes
'bouta make their last mistakes
There are no more escapes

Branches entwine
Through the dark so we can find
Ourselves in time
Before we lose our mind

All lain aside
It's written in our blood
Two souls divide
Our roots beneath the flood
We've lost control
Angels with bells do toll
No we can't hide
The fire inside

Another casualty
Done waiting patiently
Call me your majesty
Don't take too long
It's my reality
Under the canopy
Of moonlit tragedy
I don't belong

Can't stop and I will never veil my name
Buried lights and I've hidden all my shame
Will keep fighting 'til there's nothing left to claim
Watch my blade is taking aim
And you're gonna end in flame

Branches entwine
Through the dark so we can find
Ourselves in time
Before we lose our mind

All lain aside
It's written in our blood
Two souls divide
Our roots beneath the flood
We've lost control
Angels with bells do toll
No we can't hide
The fire

Inside of me
Don't push beneath
Now I must prey
Don't drift away
I'm not possessed
I just can't rest
All trees decay
Endless dismay

All lain aside
It's written in our blood
Two souls divide
Our roots beneath the flood
We've lost control
Angels with bells do toll
No we can't hide
The fire inside
The fire inside
The fire inside
