		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1:

You with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

Chorus:

But I see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful

Verse 2:

Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there



Chorus:

And I'll see your true colors
Shining through
I see your true colors
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors
True colors are beautiful
