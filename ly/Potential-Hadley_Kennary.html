		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you tell when a habit becomes a pattern
Is it a matter of patience or maybe a matter of time
cnd how can I tell you I know that the glass had to shatter 
That battle is valid but often it's not worth the fight

I know, for the record I know what I do 
But I'd go through the wreckage of this love to find you

I've been trying to hold my, hold my ground
But I want to hold you, hold you now
So have a little faith in who I'm trying to be and
Save a place for the best in me
‘Cause I see the potential 
Yeah I think we got potential, don't you babe

Getting older isn't always a single direction
Will we grow out of growing pains or outgrow each other first?
I'm getting over what you say in a moment of tension
‘Cause I love you too much to be right or prepare for the worst 

I've been trying to hold my, hold my ground
But I want to hold you, hold you now
So have a little faith in who I'm trying to be and
Save a place for the best in me
‘Cause I see the potential 
Yeah I think we got potential, don't you babe

I know, for the record I know what I do 
But I'd go through the wreckage of this love to find you
I know, for the record I know what I do 
But I'd go through the wreckage of this love to find you

I've been trying to hold my, hold my ground
But I want to hold you, hold you now
So have a little faith in who I'm trying to be and
Save a place for the best in me
‘Cause I see the potential 
Yeah I think we got potential, I I I 

I've been trying to hold my, hold my ground
But I want to hold you, hold you now
So have a little faith in who I'm trying to be and
Save a place for the best in me
‘Cause I see the potential 
Yeah I think we got potential
Oh yeah I see the potential 
Yeah I think we got potential, don't you babe
