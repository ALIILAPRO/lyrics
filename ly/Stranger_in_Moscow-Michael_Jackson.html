		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
Kgb was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

How does it feel? (How does it feel?)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
How does it feel? (How does it feel? Now)
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?

Like a stranger in Moscow (Lord have mercy)
Like a stranger in Moscow (Lord have mercy)
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow
