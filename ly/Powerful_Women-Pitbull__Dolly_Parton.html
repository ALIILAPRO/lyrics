		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Who runs this?) It's Mr. Worldwide
(Who runs this?) With the one and only
(Who runs this?) Dolly Parton

(Well, hey)
And this is dedicated to (Who runs this?)

All my powerful women working nine to five
Two, three jobs just to survive
All my powerful women
No man at home
Raising all the kids alone
All my powerful women
Y'all deserve a throne
Keep your head up and stay strong
All my powerful women
No matter what
Never give up

I remember working hard with my mom
You name it, she did it
You name it, she sewed it (yeah)
You name it, she cleaned it (yeah)
You name it, she owed it (yeah)
She had to provide (yeah)
We had to survive
So you name it, she stole it
Our whole life was layaway
Pay, pay, pay
But the bills never went away
Put your hands to the sky
This goes out to the women
Working hard nine to five

Workin' nine to five (nine to five)
What a way to make a livin' (yeah)
Barely, gettin' by (get it, girl)
It's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
And they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

Nine to five (nine to five)
For service and devotion
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead
The boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is
Out to get me (break it down)

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Here's to your mama
And here's to mine
(Take it, Dolly)
(Dolly)

Mama worked hard her entire life
She had twelve kids at thirty-five
Working 24/7, 365
Working five to nine and
Nine to five
They let you dream
Just to watch em' shatter
You're just a step
On the boss man's ladder
You got dreams
He'll never take away (he'll never take away)
You're all in the same boat
With the luck of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
Tide's gonna turn
And it's all gonna roll you away

Workin' nine to five
(Nine to five) what a way to make a livin'
Barely, gettin' by 
(I'm gettin' by) it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind
(They use your mind) and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you
Crazy if you let it

Nine to five
For service and devotion (that's just what I want)
You would think that I
Would deserve a fair promotion (you'd think that I)
Want to move ahead, but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is
Out to get me, he's out to get me

Here's to Jane and Lilly
And the girls that fight
For equal pay
Equal rights
Now some of us
Are pit bulls too
We appreciate
The things you do
Thanks again for shining light
On the women that work
From nine to five

It's my pleasure
Dolly
