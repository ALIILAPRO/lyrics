		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you wanna take a trip or two to I don't know
'Cause soon I'll keep you here with your coffin closed
'Cause the secrets that I'm keeping
Ain't no good to me
When you're six feet under
All you hear are the cries
From a long-bit chest on a widowed bride
From the screamin' tears are seething
Tears wont bother me

I'm dead and gone
The way you did me wrong
I'm dead and gone
The way you did me wrong
Oh baby look what you done

Chokin' on the saddles
We don't want you to know
There's a warm place waiting for you just below
When the grievin' tears are painting
Tears wont bother me
In the middle of the night when you still hear the cries
Suffocation blues will bring you lullabies
Keep a sleepin' with' the creeping
Just you wait and see

Dead and gone
The way you did me wrong
Well I'm dead and gone
The way you did me wrong
Oh baby look what you done

'Til only now I can see
Words you don't hardly speak
It's getting hard and harder to breathe
No more killin' time
Eat you up inside

I'm dead and gone
The way you did me wrong
Well I'm dead and gone
The way you did me wrong
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
Oh baby look what you done
