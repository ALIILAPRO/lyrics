		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay a while, maybe stay a while on the surface
til I’m in the clear
now is your moment to choose
or will you stay away? Maybe stay away
if you were going to go
sometimes the harder thing
could be right thing to do

Maybe it’s true what they say
all that is lost will 
move into place
given time

suddenly, very suddenly
I’m all out of touch
out on a drift with nobody holding me back
Or could it be I’m being made to see possibilities
learning to swim
with only myself to protect?

Maybe it’s true what they say
all that is lost will 
move into place
Just know that it’s a state of mind
Few stay the same
And nothing lasts forever, these
Bruises will fade
given time
