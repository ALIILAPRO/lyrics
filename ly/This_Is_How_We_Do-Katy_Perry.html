		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sipping on Ros√©, Silver Lake sun
Coming up all lazy (this is how we do)
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy
Still up, still fresh as a daisy (oh, oh)
Playing ping pong all night long
Everything's all neon and hazy (this is how we do)
Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah
All my girls vintage Chanel, baby (oh, oh)

It's no big deal, it's no big deal
It's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do, this is how we do
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do, this is how we do (oh, oh)

Big hoops and maroon lips
My clique hopping in my Maserati (this is how we)
Santa Barbara chic at La Super Rica
Grabbing tacos, checking out hotties (oh, oh, oh)
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did
All Japanese-y (this is how we do)
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah Carey-oke (oh, oh)

It's no big deal, it's no big deal (uh-uh)
It's no big deal
This is no big deal

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do, this is how we do
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do (ayy), do-do-do-do (oh), this is how we do (yo)

This one goes out to the ladies at breakfast in last night's dress
(It's how we do, straight stunting like that, uh-huh) uh-huh, I see you
Yo, this goes out to all you kids
That still have their cars at the club valet and it's Tuesday
(It's how we do, straight stunting like that, uh-huh) yo
Shout out to all you kids buying bottle service with your rent money
(This how we do, straight) respect

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do, do-do-do-do, this is how we do
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do (ayy, hey), do-do-do-do (oh, oh)
This is how we do (woo)

This is how we do
This goes out to all you people going to bed with a ten
And waking up with a two (this is how we do)
(It's how we do, straight stunting like that, uh-huh) ha, not me

This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
Straight stuntin', yeah, we do it like that
This is how we do (ayy, what?), Do-do-do-do (oh)
(It's how we do, straight stunting like that)

Wait, no, no, no
(Do, oh, oh) bring the beat back
That's right
This is how we do
Oh, oh
This is how we do
Oh, oh
