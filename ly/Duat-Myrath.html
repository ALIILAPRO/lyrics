		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A blowy sandy wind
On the black land, my river
Iteru dies away
The end is so close, there's no crying
And now time can't go back
Can hear the black creaking doors
Of the eternal land
'Cause Anubis is on the wait
To weigh my soul

Rite of the passage is like a war against the odds
Dangerous gates to cross to reach the afterlife
Walls of iron, lakes of fire, spirits around
I can't bring you with me my dear, to cross Osiris' land
Yeah, I am sailing down the Nile
Memories like ashes in the sand

Relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Isis knows how to bring me back to life
So relieve me
Leave me here dying
Take me to your heart, I'll stay alive

Vices, my heart on scale, time for the weighing
Ma'at's survival
Feather decides, my end draws night
I'm feeling
Peaceful, carried by the wind
Inside my mind
The realm of the dead will guide my mind
Yeah, I am sailing down the Nile
Memories like ashes in the sand

Relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Isis knows how to bring me back to life
So relieve me
Leave me here dying
Take me to your heart, I'll stay alive

Relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Isis knows how to bring me back to life
So relieve me
Leave me here I'm dying
Take me to your heart, I'll stay alive 
I'll stay alive
