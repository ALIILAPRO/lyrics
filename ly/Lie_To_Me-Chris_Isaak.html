		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a woman, far over the sea.
Standing and waiting, praying for me.
Here I lie sleeping, a girl by my side.
Who am I hurting, each time I lie?

Lie to me, lie
Lie to me, lie

There is a woman, trying hard to be brave.
The way that I hurt her, has made her afraid.
Things that I'm doing, are breaking her heart.
Still she's pretending, that we'll never part.

Lie to me, lie
Lie to me, lie
I don't care what people may say, I know everybody lies.
I'm not trying to hurt my love, I'm only trying to get by.

There is a woman, far over the sea.
Standing and waiting, praying for me.
Here I lie guilty, a girl by my side.
Who am I hurting, each time I lie?

Lie to me, lie [Repeat: x4]
