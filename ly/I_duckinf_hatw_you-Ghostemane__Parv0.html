		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (No, no, no, NO) fuck love
I don’t want none, I don’t want love
I’ll be blunt, I'm a time bomb
(Tick, tick, tick, tick) you say I’m a God
But I know I’m not why do I feel like?
(Nothing)

Literally a million other reasons I
Gotta pretend I’m okay
But I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not!
What you want, bitch, I’m nothin' but a notch
I went diggin' thru' my lungs
And it's all I really got
When am I gonna learn to give it all up?
(Nobody wants you, nobody wants you)
When am I gonna learn there’s never
Gonna be a forever for me
A letter from me delivered to me?
Teaming up with demons instead of
Trying to defeat them
Looking shawty in the eyes sayin'
"Take it or leave it"
I'ma keep it under wraps that I rap
Maybe then she won’t become a demon either
And we can live in another reality
Count on me to fuck it up, fuck it up!
Never not the case, level 11 mage
I got it all made
Shouldn’t I be happy? Shouldn’t I be?

Help! I'm not fucking God!
I'm not fucking happy, I'm never happy! No!

I was 15, following my dreams
Holes in my jeans
Daddy hated everything, but his pills
Got his thrills
With his finger in my face, in my face
Then he'd said, "What a waste, what a waste
What a waste–" what a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste! What a waste!
What a waste! What a waste!
