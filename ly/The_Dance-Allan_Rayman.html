		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ive been meaning to ask you
Is everything alright
I feel like ive been bugging you and its keeping me up all night
Ive been needed to talk to you
Get this off my chest
Its never easy to hear but its always for the best
Why do you attack me
Treat me like i mean nothing to you
You get nasty you make me jump through hoops to prove my love to you
And it makes me sad
and it makes me angry it leaves me wanting someone new
But you’re the one i want and you’re the one i choose
Hold you’re breath count to ten we’re going to fall in love all over again
You’re going to be my wife raise my kids we’ll have a happy life kiss by kiss
Hold you’re breath count to ten we’re going to fall in love all over again
You’re going to be my wife raise my kids we’ll have a happy life kiss by kiss
Why do you attack me
Treat me like i mean nothing to you
You get nasty you make me jump through hoops to prove my love to you
And it makes me sad
and it makes me angry it leaves me wanting someone new
But you’re the one i want and you’re the one i choose
B b b baby baby
