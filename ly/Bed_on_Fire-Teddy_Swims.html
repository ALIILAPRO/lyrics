		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate to sleep with one eye open
I see the headlights turn to shadows driving past
I hope one night it's not you going
'Cause you woke up and realized what you could have

You sleep with peace of mind you don't worry
I'm wide awake I know it's gonna hurt me
Least you could do is show a little mercy now

So if you're gonna leave me, leave me
In the middle of the night
Set the bed on fire
Set the bed on fire
If you're gonna leave me, leave me
Don't say goodbye 
Just set the bed on fire
Baby, set the bed on fire
And let it burn, let it burn, let it burn all the way to the ground
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn let it burn on down

Sometimes I wonder what you're thinking
You say you love me but sometimes I have my doubts
Baby, what if our ship was sinking
Would I be the only one hanging on when it goes down

You sleep with peace of mind you don't worry
I'm wide awake I know it's gonna hurt me
The least you could do is show a little mercy now

So if you're gonna leave me, leave me
In the middle of the night
Set the bed on fire
Set the bed on fire
If you're gonna leave me, leave me
Then don't say goodbye
Just set the bed on fire
Baby, set the bed on fire
And let it burn, let it burn, let it burn all the way to the ground
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn on down
Let it burn on down
Let it burn on down

Don't drag it out
Don't hang around
Don't take your time
Don't twist the knife
Don't let me see just let me dream

So if you're gonna leave me, leave me
In the middle of the night
Oh, set the bed on fire
Set the bed on fire
If you're gonna leave me, leave me
Don't say goodbye 
Just set the bed on fire
Baby, set the bed on fire
And let it burn, let it burn, let it burn all the way to the ground
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn on down
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn all the way to the ground
Just let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, let it burn on down
