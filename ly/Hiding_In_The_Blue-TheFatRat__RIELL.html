		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm alone here on my island
Floating in the sky, I'm
High above the world I used to know
And I'm far from any danger
Safe from any failure
Guarded, I found shelter in the storm

I'm hiding in the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found

Was a soldier in the legions
Fought against the demons
Fought against the monsters made of gold
But they stormed across Arcadia
Following the nature
Washed away the place I once called home

I'm hiding in the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
I'm hiding in the blue

I'm hiding in the blue

As time goes racing by, I'm
Wishing I could be fine
But I'm still so stuck on what used to be
Made a prison out of my mind
Watch life as it goes by
Battle-scarred, my own worst enemy

I'm hiding in the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
I'm hiding in the blue

I'm hiding in the blue
Hiding in the blue

The world's passing by, and
I lost sense of time, I've
Gone numb, I miss the days when
We were making legends
Our days come and go, I'll
Wait through sun and snow
For you to come and take me from
This place and bring me home

In the blue
Safe between the clouds
In the blue
Where I can't be found
I'm hiding in the blue

Hiding in the blue
In the blue
