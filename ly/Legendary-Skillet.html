		  (Legendary) Oh
(Legendary)

Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh

My heart bleeds adrenaline
The fire I breathe is where I live
Say my name, incredible
Say my name, an animal
One life to live
I never give up, I never give in

Some people wanna turn and run (run)
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (never falling)
Destiny is callin' me
Go down in history
Every day I'll fight to be
Legendary

Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Legendary

Fly high or will I fall?
Legends made when faith is strong

Say my name, No time to plead
Say my name, I'm conquering
While I'm alive, I'll push through the pain, I'll run for the prize

Some people wanna turn and run (run)
But the strong rise under the gun

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (never falling)
Destiny is callin' me
Go down in history
Every day I'll fight to be
Legendary

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Everyday I'll fight to be
Legendary

Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Legendary

Wings are made to fly, made to fly (made to fly)
Fears are born to die, born to die (born to die)
Pushin' through the pain, through the pain (through the pain)
Pushin' through, breakin' through
Whatever it takes, what I gotta do
Givin' my all, givin' all that I've got
Never will stop 'til I get to the top

Top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop
To the top, to the top
Ain't never gonna stop

Never gonna keep me down (never keep me)
Still the one that's standin' now (never falling)
Destiny is callin' me
Go down in history
Every day I'll fight to be
Legendary
Never gonna keep me down (never keep me) (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Still the one that's standin' now (never falling) (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Destiny is callin' me
Go down in history (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh)
Every day I'll fight to be (oh oh oh)
Legendary

Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Legendary
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Legendary
