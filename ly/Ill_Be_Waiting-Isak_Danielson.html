		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
But all I wanted was to ask for your love
I don't know if I dare

If I say the words too quick
If I plan my every move
Will you leave me hanging on without knowing
'Cause I said too much too soon

Please don't let me go
But if you do, then do it slow

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
Whatever you decide to do with my love
I'll be waiting

Hoping time will tell
Longing for the day
That you realize that I'm all you need
I can't see you walk away

Please don't let me go
But if you do, then do it slow

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
Whatever you decide to do with my love
I'll be waiting

For you to see me smile every time that you're around
I'll be waiting
For you to realize what I feel will never die
'Cause I'll be

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
Whatever you decide to do with my love

'Cause I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
Whatever you decide to do with my love
I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting
