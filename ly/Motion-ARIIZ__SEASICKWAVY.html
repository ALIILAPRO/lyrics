		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is something you should understand
See I'm nothing like your other man
I need you and you need me too
Tell me baby what should we do
All alone and it feels so true
Good to know all the bad is through
Feels so good when I look at you
Everyday I just want this view

Damn you hot girl you smoking
You the one that's been chosen
Lets catch a vibe we in motion
With you and views of the ocean
See we can chill till we meet the stars
I just wanna be wherever you are

Cause
I'm ready
If you ready

My last love she left a couple scars
Took my heart and ripped it all apart
I wish I could just hit restart
Open my eyes and have you in my arms
We can chill right under the stars
I just wanna be wherever you are
Girl I'm ready if you ready
You caught all my attention
You know all my intentions
Your the one that I'm missin
Your love and your affection
You just found my dimension
You look just like perfection
You are my new obsession girl
You feel like a deception

Damn you hot girl, you smoking
You the one that's been chosen
Lets catch a vibe we in motion
With you and views of the ocean
See we can chill till we meet the stars
I just wanna be wherever you are

Cause
I'm ready
If you ready

Damn you hot girl, you smoking
You the one that's been chosen
Lets catch a vibe we in motion
With you and views of the ocean
See we can chill till we meet the stars
I just wanna be wherever you are

Cause
I'm ready
If you ready

You don't need to call him
No more
You know that I'm ready
I'm yours
Now she getting ready
Now it's getting heavy
You been needing love
And I got plenty baby

You don't need to call him
No more
You know that I'm ready
I'm yours
Now she getting ready
Now it's getting heavy
You been needing love
And I got plenty baby
