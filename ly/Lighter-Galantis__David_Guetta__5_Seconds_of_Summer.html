		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're paper planes in the sky
Driftin' where the wind blows
Yeah, gravity held me tight
But with you, I can let go

I know, I know when I'm hollow, hollow
You take it all away and fill the empty spaces
Don't know, don't know 'bout tomorrow, 'morrow
But I know that today

I feel a little bit lighter
When the world's heavy as stone
In the cold, you shine a bit brighter
When I'm with you
Wherever we go, the cold ain't so cold
As long as you're close, I thought you should know
I feel a little bit lighter
When I'm with you

When I'm with you

The tide can pull us away
Don't matter where we are
'Cause when you're inches away
Heaven's never that far

I know, I know when I'm hollow, hollow
You take it all away and fill the empty spaces
Don't know, don't know 'bout tomorrow, 'morrow
But I know that today

I feel a little bit lighter
When the world's heavy as stone
In the cold, you shine a bit brighter
When I'm with you
Wherever we go, the cold ain't so cold
As long as you're close, I thought you should know
I feel a little bit lighter
When I'm with you

When I'm with you
