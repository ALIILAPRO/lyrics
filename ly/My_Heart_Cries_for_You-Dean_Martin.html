		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
And my arms long for you
Please, come back to me

If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you
If you're in Minnesota, I'll be there too
You'll have a million chances to start anew
Because my love is endless for you

My heart cries for you
Sighs for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please, come back to me

The bloom has left the roses since you left me
The birds have left my window since you left me
I'm lonely as a sailboat that's lost at sea
I'm lonely as a human can be

My heart cries for you
Please, come back to me
An unimportant quarrel is what we had
We have to learn to live with the good and the bad
Together we were happy, apart we're sad
This loneliness is driving me mad

My heart cries for you, dies for you
My arms long for you
Please, come back to me
(Come back to me)
