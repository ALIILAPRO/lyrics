		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cause you gotta show up
If we're gonna blow up
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up
No matter what they told us
Nothing's gonna hold us
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up

Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up
Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up

Cause you gotta show up
If we're gonna blow up
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up
No matter what they told us
Nothing's gonna hold us
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up

Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up
Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up

We're not gonna stop until we light up

We're not gonna stop until we light up

Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up
Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up

Cause you gotta show up
If we're gonna blow up
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up
No matter what they told us
Nothing's gonna hold us
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up

Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up
Nananana light up light up light up

Cause you gotta show up
If we're gonna blow up
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up
No matter what they told us
Nothing's gonna hold us
Come and hold your torches in the sky until we light up

Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up
Nananana nana nananana nana nananana
We're not gonna stop until we light up

We're not gonna stop until we light up

We're not gonna stop until we light up
