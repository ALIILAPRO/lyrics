		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we say goodbye to, to the lies you told 
I know I'm wiser, i've been here before   
I believed your stories  
at least the blind in me 
you gave my eyes, what they wanted to see  
 
I've lost my reality 
I've lost everything in me mmmm 
 
you act like a god and you're trying to hard but I need it 
I was once a believer 
now I'm back to believing   
I'm tryna be smart with a stake through the heart but I feel it turning into addiction 
praying in your religion  

Future dosen't matter
I'd give it up for you
even though I know that you'd never do  

You know you're power and i know it too
i'll end up in fire, burning with you  
 
I've lost my reality I've lost everything in me mmmm   
 
you act like a god and you're trying to hard but I need it 
I was once a believer 
now I'm back to believing   
I'm tryna be smart with a stake through the heart but I feel it turning into addiction 
praying in your religion  

you act like a god and you're trying to hard but I need it 
I was once a believer 
now I'm back to believing   
I'm tryna be smart with a stake through the heart but I feel it turning into addiction 
praying in your religion
