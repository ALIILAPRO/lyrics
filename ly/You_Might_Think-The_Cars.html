		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh well, you might think I'm crazy
To hang around with you
Or maybe you think I'm lucky
To have something to do

But I think that you're wild
Inside me is some child

You might think I'm foolish
Or maybe it's untrue
(You might think) you might think I'm crazy
(All I want) but all I want is you

You might think it's hysterical
But I know when you're weak
You think you're in the movies
And everything's so deep

But I think that you're wild
When you flash that fragile smile

You might think it's foolish
What you put me through
(You might think) you might think I'm crazy
(All I want) all I want is you

And it was hard, so hard to take
There's no escape without a scrape

But you kept it going 'til the sun fell down
You kept it going

Oh well, you might think I'm delirious
The way I run you down
But somewhere sometimes, when you're curious
I'll be back around

Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
(You might think) you might think I'm crazy
(All I want) but all I want is you
Oh, ooh, all I want is you
(All I want) all I want is you
