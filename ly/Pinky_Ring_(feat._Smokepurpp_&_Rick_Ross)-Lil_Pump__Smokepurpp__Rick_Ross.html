		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We finna make history
Carol City in this m'fucka
Lil Pump, what's up?
I started right where you at, nigga
50 million later, ya hear me?
Woah
Maybach Music

All the hoes wanna suck dick
All the hoes wanna fuck me
All the niggas wanna hate though
Get whacked in the front seat
Face down when she topless
Can't post all the choppas
Dade County where I came from
No room for imposters
Cocaine on the stovetop
Yayo up, won't lie
Fast break like it's b-ball
Bullet hole like a donut
Bel-Air for the new crib
Bel-Air for the black bottom
Bel-Air my new old school
Gettin' out like I'm John Gotti
Fuck nigga don't want none
Goin' bad like I'm on somethin'
50 grand for the new watch
Rob me and I won't run
Window on the photo
Call her up on the polo
Everybody still gang-gang but your ass die solo
Everybody die solo, everybody die solo
Everybody die solo, everybody die solo

Bang
Lil Pump, ooh, ayy

Spent 20 racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Spent 20 racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring

I fuck your bitch in some Gucci loafers
I bust a nut in her Louis sofa
VVS all on my diamond choker
I crashed the Porsche and I crashed the Rover
I told my mama I'm sorry, ooh
I think I just popped a Molly, yuh
I think I'm whippin' up Whitney
I'm whippin' up Whitney, I turn into Scotty, ooh
Lil Pump in Maserati, ooh
Lil Pump ain't got no license, yeah
I fuck a bitch, I ain't wifin', ooh
Bite a bitch ear like Mike Tyson, yuh

Hard, got lean in my backpack (backpack)
MAC-11 turned to a Big Mac (blat, blat, blat)
Niggas gettin' pulled like a thumb tack (woo)
Let me get the pen, hit a Chase bank (Chase bank)
Niggas want beer, we got that
And I got water on me like flapjack (water, water, water)
Came in the club with a big rack
Bitch, I'm off the lean and I'm doin' up them Zig-Zags
Pinky ring, diamond ring
Fuck up the pot with like 10 chains
Hood rich, bitch, I don't need fame
Pull up on your bitch in an airplane
I just got brand new shoes
All day zap up, crash the Coupe
And I brought a dog in the club, too
Everything I buy, I gotta buy two

Spent 20 racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Spent 20 racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
Spent 20 racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Spent 20 racks on a pinky ring
Walk in the club with a diamond chain
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring, pinky ring
Pinky ring, pinky ring
