		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not a criminal
I'm not the villain
Yeah this is personal
A drive-by killing

Your guns are loaded
And your lies are the bullets
So here is the trigger
Go ahead and pull it now

Are you sure you wanna play this game?
Are you sure you wanna play it?

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put a knife out in my back
Killed any history we had and now it's war
War

You were just like the weathers
And we had each other
We were down for the good times
We were live for the trouble
Like a thief in the night
Robbed daylight
You stole my sanity, and now
You are the enemy, yeah

Are you sure you wanna play this game?
Are you sure you wanna play it?

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put a knife out in my back
Killed any history we had and now it's war
War

(Oh oh)
I still feel sorry for you
(Oh oh)
Watching you drown in your denial
(Oh oh)
But I can't feel sorry for you
(Oh oh)
Watching you trying to show the traitor

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put a knife out in my back
Killed any history we had and now it's war
And now it's war
War

The only thing worse than a hater
The only thing worse than a hater
Is a traitor
A traitor
A traitor
You put a knife out in my back
Killed any history we had and now it's war
And now it's war
War
