		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I got a lot love for the niggas, I did
And I know I gotta lose it
Just to find it right there
Thought the money and the cars
Would've gave me way, Oh nah

And I got a lot love for the niggas I did
And I know I gotta lose it
Just to find it right there
Thought the money and the cars
Would've gave me way, Oh nah

Talk to me talk to me now
Yeah, all on me hmmm
Way too young I didn't know that
I'm sorry that I didn't give
Your love back baby
I couldn't shake off what I wanted
Mmm now baby now yeah yeah

Lot of love for the niggas, I did
And I know I gotta lose it
Just to find it right there
Thought the money and the cars
Would've gave mе way, Oh nah

And I got a lot love for the niggas I did
And I know I gotta lose it
Just to find it right thеre
Thought the money and the cars
Would've gave me way, Oh nah
