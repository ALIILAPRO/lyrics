		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now
My niggas
Our future presentation

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo (uh, uh)

And, uh, as I lay myself to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
The pressure makes me, the journey takes me
To places where history can't stop or break me
You know it rains for somethin', you know the pain's for somethin'
I hope a change is comin', just keep on swangin' on

Swang on, swang on (oh, swang on), swang on, swang on (swang on)
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on (swang on)
Swang on, swang on (swang on), swang on, swang on (swang on)
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on (uh)

Keep on swangin' lil' sis, keep swangin' lil' bro
I'm 'bout to swang on Terry Payne because he said my sister ho
Gettin' high from Swisher Sweets, chariots are swingin' low
Swastikas and the police, hang a nigga, swangin' rope
Peewee tried to swang on me
But I was with like fifty folks and he ain't know
But what was worse, I aint't even want no beef with bro
We was toted, we was soldiers, we was soulless
We was sold and sayin' somethin' 'bout his set
Nigga, that who he swangin' for
Swear you bitches don't know shit about our stress, about our woes
And my obsession with success by definition of my own
Sure as death is waitin' on our flesh and bones
Demon callin' my spirit, had to click the phone
Couldn't get to Courtney quick enough to give her warm big hugs
Told her, "You like the strongest woman on the fuckin' globe"
I watch my momma lose her momma
Go through drama and trauma but had to keep her head high
So we don't fuckin' know, I'm gettin' older
So when the world's feelin' enormous on your back and on your arms
And your feet just as heavy you been draggin' through the storm
Starin' at the city, but you trapped inside a hole
Get your back up off the ropes, keep swangin' on (yeah)

Swang on, swang on (swang on), swang on, swang on
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on (swang on)
Swang on, swang on (swang on), swang on, swang on (swang on)
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on

(Hello?)

Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on
You know we race for somethin' (ah)
Swang on, swang on
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on
