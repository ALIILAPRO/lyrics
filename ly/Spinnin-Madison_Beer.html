		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

Did the world stop spinnin'?
Nothing seems to change
I'm stuck at the beginning, and I'm in pain
Did the sun stop risin'?
'Cause the sky's so gray
Did the world stop spinnin' today?

I woke up, fell back to sleep
'Cause I'd rather live in my dreams
I lay here wonderin' why

Did the world stop spinnin'?
Am I frozen in time?
'Cause the birds stopped singin'
Are we flawed by design?
My heartbeat's racin' like a strange ballet
Did the world stop spinnin' today?

I woke up, fell back to sleep (sleep)
'Cause I'd rather live in my dreams (ah, ah, ah)
I lay here wonderin' why

Did the world stop spinnin' or did I?
The world has stopped spinnin'
The lights are all dimmin'
And ah-ah
The world has stopped spinnin'
The end is beginning, ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah

Will the world stop spinnin'?
Nothing seems to change
I'm stuck at the beginning, and I'm still in pain
Why'd the sun stop shinin'?
Why's the sky still grey?
Oh, the world stopped spinnin' today
