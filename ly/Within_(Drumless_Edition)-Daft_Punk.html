		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
I am lost, I can't even remember my name

I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for sometime, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am

There are so many things that I don't understand
There's a world within me that I cannot explain
Many rooms to explore, but the doors look the same
(Where are the locks to try the key)
I am lost, I can't even remember my name
(And I wondered why)

I've been for some time, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for some time, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for some time, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
I've been for some time, looking for someone
I need to know now, please tell me who I am
