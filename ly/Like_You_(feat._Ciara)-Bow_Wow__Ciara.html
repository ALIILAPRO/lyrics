		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me
And I believe it 
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you 

Now I done been with different kind of girls (oh)
Felt like I done seen em all but ain't none of them at all (like you)
And I done seen the best of the best (oh)
Baby still I ain't impressed' cause ain't none of 'em at all (like you)
And you know how I feel when I chill
If I'm seen with a girl then she gotta be just (like you)
And baby that's the way I feel (oh, you)
And I got no choice but for me to keep it real
'Cause when we first got together, started hanging out you was
Skeptical at first had to figure out if
I was the kind of guy to try to dog you out, but
I ain't that kind of guy you tried to make me out
You found out when you turned into my baby
I showed them other brothers how to treat a lady
I let you drive when I ride that Mercedes
And I ain't trippin' or actin' shady 'cause baby you know

I ain't neva had nobody show me all the things that you done showed me
And the special way I feel when you hold me
We gone always be together baby that's what you told me
And I believe it 
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you 

And every time I think about you I smile
When you ride when you call when you come around
Your love is amazing to me 
I can't wait 'til I see you, I wanna be wit' you again
And every time you're out on the road, I'll make a trip
And whenever I'm doing a show, don't you forget)
That I'm your main chick
Who got that game chick
One and the same chick
The one you can hang with 

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done show me 
And the special way I feel when you hold me 
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me 
And I believe it 
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

Okay when you hit the mall pop tags spend a few G's and (G's and) (oh)
Hit the runway to a new season (season) 
It ain't nothing to spoil the one I care for (oh)
Feel like I ain't doing enough that's when I share more (share more) 
I give you this, give you that, what you need, love? (need, love) 
You know I got it, holla at me if you need love (need love) 
And affection 'cause I'll be your protection (oh, you)
Kinda hard job but I do it to perfection 
And you can tell that I ain't tryna let you go 
I get with you when I can, so that's how I let you know 
And you be tripping 'cause sometimes I gotta go 
But you the first one I holla to right after my shows 
And I was tripping in a sense, I was tense 
But my body loose around you, what I'ma do without you? 
I gotta get it together, say whatever 
But since I met you my life seems so better 

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done show me 
And the special way I feel when you hold me 
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me 
And I believe it 
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you

I ain't never had nobody show me all the things that you done show me 
And the special way I feel when you hold me 
We gon' always be together, baby, that's what you told me 
And I believe it 
'Cause I ain't never had nobody do me like you
