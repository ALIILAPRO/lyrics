		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Haha, haha, uh oh)

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You made a mistake
Uh oh, uh oh
Tell me things that can't be true

Your slacks are on fire
I'm fanning the flames
Like a vampire stood out in broad day
Shoulda been wiser while pickin' out
What you were gonna say, oh

Fool me once, that's one too many
Better luck next time you've met me
Where's the dunce who caught you meddling?
Turn around
Uh oh

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You made a mistake
Uh oh, uh oh
Tell me things that can't be true

You're sweating this time 
I'm reading your eyes 
You're being called out 
'Cause you slipped your mouth 
Your face has turned pale 
Gone faint, you're not well 
While you were distracted 
I cast a spell (haha)

Uh oh, you better run away now 
Uh oh, you've made a mistake aw 
Uh oh, got nothing else to say to you
Uh oh

Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
You made a mistake
Uh oh, uh oh
Tell me things that can't be true

(uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, ooh)
(uh oh, uh oh)

Forgive this wed intermission
Tragically I'm not the victim here
If only I fell for your fiction
Tell me things that can't be true
