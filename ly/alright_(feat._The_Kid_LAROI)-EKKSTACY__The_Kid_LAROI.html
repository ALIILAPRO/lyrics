		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess it's alright
These things happen
And I don't care
I'm too distracted
And the days are too long
Am I doing this wrong?
Or am I just dumb?
Or am I just dumb?

I don't
Don't know where I am
Don't know where I've been
And I
Can't stand
The place that I'm in
I'm back here again

I guess it's alright
These things happen
And I don't care
I'm too distracted
And the days are too long
Am I doing this wrong?
Or am I just dumb?
Or am I just dumb?

I was on my way home
And I got your message
It's a page long
And you're obsessive
About this other girl that you done heard I done met
But you're the one that broke it off, I don't know why you're upset
You said that if there was a chance for us, it's never again
Oh, well, I guess it was meant to end

I guess it's alright
These things happen
And I don't care
I'm too distracted
And the days are too long
Am I doing this wrong?
Or am I just dumb?
Or am I just dumb?
