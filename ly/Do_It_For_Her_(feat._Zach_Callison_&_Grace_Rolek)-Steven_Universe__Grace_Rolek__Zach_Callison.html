		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright, everything begins with your stance
Remember, you do it for him
And you would do it again
You do it for her, that is to say
You'll do it for him

Keep your stance wide
Keep your body lowered
As you're moving forward
Balance is the key
Right foot, left foot
Now go even faster
And as you're moving backwards
Keep your eyes on me

Keep my stance wide (good)
Keep my body lowered (right)
As I'm moving forward (concentrate)
Don't you want him to live?
Right foot, left foot
Yes, but put your whole body into it
Everything you have, everything you are
You've got to give

On the battlefield
When everything is chaos
And you have nothing but the way you feel, your strategy and a sword
You just think about the life you'll have together after the war
And then you do it for her
That's how you know you can win
You do it for her, that is to say
You'll do it for him

Deep down you know
You weren't built for fighting
But that doesn't mean
You're not prepared to try
What they don't know
Is your real advantage
When you live for someone
You're prepared to die

Deep down I know
That I'm just a human (true)
But I know that I can draw my sword and fight (but you know that you can draw your sword and fight)
With my short existence (good)
I can make a difference (yes, excellent)
I can be there for him
I can be his knight

I can do it for him
You'd do it for her
Okay, now do that again (yes, ma'am)
You do it for her, and now you say
I'll do it for him
