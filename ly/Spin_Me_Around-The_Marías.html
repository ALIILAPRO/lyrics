		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Daisy (Daisy)
You got me slippin' actin' lazy (lazy)
Maybe I'm trippin' but I don't mind (don't mind)
Making a picnic on the hillside (the hillside)
I'll save some room for you

'Cause I know what you're thinking about
Babe I'll let you spin me around
I know what you're thinking about
Babe I'll let you spin me

Daisy (Daisy)
Cherry tattoo be lookin' tasty (tasty)
I like the necklace that you made me (that you made me)
My heart is breaking for you baby (for you baby)
But I'll save some room for you

'Cause I know what you're thinking about
Babe I'll let you spin me around
I know what you're thinking about
Babe I'll let you spin me around
Babe I'll let you spin me around
Yeah babe I'll let you spin me around
