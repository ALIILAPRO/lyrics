		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow the yellow brick road,
Follow the yellow brick road,
Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow the yellow brick road.
Follow the rainbow over the stream, 
Follow the fellow who follows a dream,
Follow, follow, follow, follow, 
Follow the yellow brick road.
We're off to see the Wizard, 
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.
We hear he is a whiz of a Wiz if ever a Wiz there was.
If ever, oh ever a Wiz there was, 
The Wizard of Oz is one becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz,
Becoz of the wonderful things he does.
We're off to see the Wizard,
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.
We're off to see the Wizard, 
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.
We hear he is a whiz of a Wiz if ever a Wiz there was.
If ever, oh ever a Wiz there was, 
The Wizard of Oz is one becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz, becoz,
Becoz of the wonderful things he does.
We're off to see the Wizard,
The wonderful Wizard of Oz.
