		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't ask a question, I'll state the truth
It's everything I know and all I do
There's people better off, they're just like you
But no one is someone until I tell them who

This is the way that it is
This is the way that it always will be
Something you love turns to something you miss
Something you say turns to something you mean

This is the way that I know
This is the way and it makes me sick
I feel it inside me like a pulse
It's starting to slow and the meter dips, oh

Why don't you get it? Can't you get it? Understand
They're gonna execute the mother to elevate the man
They're gonna propagate the killer, eliminate the youth
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them too
They're gonna blind date everyone until you love them 

This is the way that it is
This is the way that it always will be
Something you love turns to something you miss
Something you say turns to something you mean

This is the way that I know
This is the way and it makes me sick
I feel it inside me like a pulse
It's starting to slow and the meter dips

Digital style, digital hate
Digital god, digital pain
Digital violence, digital world
Digital boy meets digital girl
Digital silence, digital yell
Digital heaven, digital hell
Digital start, digital end
Digital birth, digital death

This is the answer to the question
This is the sound of the truth
This is the answer to the question
There is nothing you can do

This is the way that it is
This is the way that it always will be
Something you love turns to something you miss
Something you say turns to something you mean

This is the way that I know
This is the way and it makes me sick
I feel it inside me like a pulse
It's starting to slow and the meter dips, oh
