		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haha, Rex did it again
Haha, yeah
(Uh)
(Every time, every time)
(I go to fall asleep)
(Every time I close my eyes)
Yeah

Every time I go to fall asleep
These demons haunting me
Face my fears, face to face as we meet
Evil is grabbing me
Losing my gravity
My mind's a bloody scene
Detached from reality (reality)

I won't, I don't wanna
I don't wanna, I don't wanna implode
I won't, I don't wanna
It's the end of the summer, it's starting to get cold
If I knew all along the Midas touch
Would expose all my wrongs, turn 'em to gold
The ship gon' sink, can't sail no more
I lost my receipt when I sold my soul
I lost my seat, what do I stand for?
The monsters of the deep (the monsters), they take control (control)
No matter where I go, the devil always know
To bring me down, in my dreams, he prowls

Every time I go to fall asleep
These demons haunting me
Face my fears, face to face as we meet
Evil is grabbing me
Losing my gravity
My mind's a bloody scene
Detached from reality (reality)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
