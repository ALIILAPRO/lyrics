		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  MKAY!

Man these streets are cold
But the girls heart was even colder
Let's see how a next man walks if he's
Carrying half of my pain on his shoulders
True say that this life was hard
And that's the reason that most of us smokers
Lately, yeah my thoughts exploding hold on
Can you give me a moment

See I thought that girl was golden but
Deep down she was cold and broken
Don't want a repeat of last time
Best know that I gotta stay woke then
See this wasn't part of my plan
I looked at two years in the can
And I though fuck that, that's not who I am
I got Mumzy driving me mad and now I
Think back that life was just sad
That life was just fuckery
And, that life was just whack
And I can't lie I would do so many
Things to hug those I can't bring back
And thе moment I stepped of track I
Was in a T-Housе serving those cats
Got to much to loose so I can't go back
Man, I swear that I won't go back
(I don't know though man like
Just got me in my feels
You know what I'm sayin'?, Ight listen bro
Fuck that girl i got you My guy)
(Haha Come on)

Man I swear that I won't go back
But, I'm running and running
And running again try
To keep up with half a grand
And if you stop wearing half the
Brands, and stick to your lane
Then start to plan
You might get somewhere in this broken world
Where they say I can't but I can
And ever since all this love began
I've changed as a fucking man
Back day we used to
Rap outside council flats
Go halves on a gram
And then we step to the shops
In the evening, bare leaning
The zoots got us licked
Back day man that block was
A heater, so flames
I gotta lay low no stitch
Fuck that girl she's frozen gold

Man these streets are cold
But the girls heart was even colder
Let's see how a next man walks if my
Carrying half of my pain on his shoulders
True say that this life was hard
And that's the reason why most of us smokers
Lately, yeah my thoughts exploding hold on
Can you give me a moment?
