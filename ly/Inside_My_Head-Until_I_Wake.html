		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One by one, your words have torn me up
I hear them ringing inside my head

To fall apart is a chance to rebuild
At least that's what, I convince myself
To come back stronger when I finally heal
To feel contained and not afraid
Of things I can't change, I can't fix
I can't face

One by one, your words have torn me up
I hear them ringing inside my head
(Inside my head)
Cut me down, I just need silence now
Too many regrets sleep in my bed

It's starting to feel like
I can't be helped
At least that's what, I convince myself
Reminders of a past I can't erase
That make me sick, that I can't face

One by one, your words have torn me up
I hear them ringing inside my head
(Inside my head)
Cut me down, I just need silence now
Too many regrets sleep in my bed

Reminders of a past I can't erase
Too many memories that make me sick!

Things I can't change, I can't fix
I can't face

One by one, your words have torn me up
I hear them ringing inside my head
(Inside my head)
Cut me down, I just need silence now
Too many regrets sleep in my bed

One by one (One by one) inside my head
One by one
