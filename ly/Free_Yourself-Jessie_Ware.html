		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you, baby, don't you
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Baby, don't you

Don't stand there waiting all of your life
For the night to come and find you
The clock is ticking, baby, now is the time
For someone to come and hold you

You are a name, not a number
Extraordinary colors
Don't you hide under cover, baby

Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good, then don't you, baby, don't you
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Baby, don't you

No complications, distractions
Reactions, no retractions
Only obsessions, motivations
Investigation, there's new information

You are a name, not a number
Extraordinary colors
Don't you hide under cover, baby

Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you stop
Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you, baby, don't you
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Baby, don't you

If you feel it (ah)
If you feel it, take it (over)
If you feel it (ah)
If you feel it, take it (over)
If you feel it (ah)
If you feel it, take it (over)
If you feel it (ah)
If you feel it, take it (don't tease me)
If you feel it (don't)
If you feel it, take it (don't tease me)
If you feel it (don't)
If you feel it, take it (don't tease me)
If you feel it (don't)
If you feel it, take it (don't tease me)
If you feel it (don't)
If you feel it, take it

You've got to free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you stop
Free yourself
Keep on moving up that mountaintop
Why don't you please yourself?
If it feels so good then don't you, baby, don't you
Stop, don't stop, don't stop
Baby, don't you
