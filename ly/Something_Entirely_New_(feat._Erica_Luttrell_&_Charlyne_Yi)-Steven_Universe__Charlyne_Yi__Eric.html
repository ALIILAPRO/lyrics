		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where did we go? What'd we do?
I think we made something entirely new
And it wasn't quite me, and it wasn't quite you
I think it was someone entirely new

Oh, um, well I just can't stop thinking

So, um, did you say I was different?

And you hadn't before?

Of course not
When would I have ever?

I'm so sorry

No, no, don't be

And now you're here forever

What about you?

What about me?

Well, you're here too
We're here together

Hm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Hm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Hm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Hm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Hm-mm-mm-mm
Hm
