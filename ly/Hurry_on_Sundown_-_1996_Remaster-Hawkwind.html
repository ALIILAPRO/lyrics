		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well hurry on sundown
See what tomorrow brings
Hurry on sundown
See what tomorrow brings
Well it may bring war
Any old thing
Look into your mind's eye
See what you can see
Look into your mind's eye
See what you can see
There's hundreds of people
Like you and me
Oh, hurry on sundown
Hurry on sundown
Oh, hurry on sundown
Hurry on sundown

Well hurry on sundown
See what tomorrow brings
Hurry on sundown
See what tomorrow brings
Well it may bring war
Any old thing
Look into your mind's eye
See what you can see
Look into your mind's eye
See what you can see
There's hundreds of people
Like you and me
Oh, hurry on sundown
Hurry on sundown
Oh, hurry on sundown
Hurry on sundown
