		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met a man when I was out
And in his eyes was a different shade of brown (yeah)
I liked his vibes, I took his number before I left
All night long he was on my mind
So I sent him a text that said- (yeah)

"Call me" (call me)
"I was thinkin' we should spend some time, babe" (time, babe)
But don't, don't play no game with me, honey (honey)
'Cause I'm workin' all week, Monday to Friday
Let's stay in the weekend (mm, yeah)

I can't buy you bags, girl, you are the bag
They should hang you up, you're an artifact
You're my sweeter love, that's a heart attack
You gon' make me turn that thing into a water tap, drip-drip
London boy, I'm on my Slick Rick
I like my chick fit, gyally wonder if I got a-
Baby, save it for the group chat, still take the roof back
Broke niggas, girl, you just rebuke that (mm, yeah)
Girl, I'm hopin' we can stay friends
Tryna see a bigger picture through the same lens
"What? You know RAYE, yeah?" "Yeah, man, we're from the same ends"
Pretty women gettin' money, yeah, it make sense (oh)
Aight, I ain't always there, but I'm always on time
This little light of mine, girl, you got a shine
I ain't tryna queue, there's a really long line
Let me fast track through to your mind (mm, yeah)
Aight, check it, yeah

"Call me" (call me)
"I was thinkin' we should spend some time, babe" (time, babe)
But don't, don't play no game with me, honey (honey)
'Cause I'm workin' all week, Monday to Friday
Let's stay in the weekend (mm, yeah)

Yo, is Monday alright? (No, Monday I can't)
Aight, Tuesday I'll slide (no, Tuesday is hard for me)
What? Is Wednesday cool? (Wednesday I work late)
I was thinkin' about it
How about a Thursday, ayy? (Hm, Thursday is tight)
Is Friday a vibe? (Aight, Friday we're live)
Oh, the weekend will be just fine
When I am thinkin' 'bout the time (yo, ah)
You gon' be all mine (mm, yeah)

Baby, talk yo shit 'cause you are the shit
Post some fire pics, you're an arsonist
Niggas try a ting but they don't know the half of it
These clown ass niggas make you laugh a bit
The way I beat that pussy up it's like you started it (ooh)
You got that cloud nine, it's like I charted it
You mashin' up my heart a bit, girl, I don't want no part of it
You should sell a bad bitch starter kit (mm, yeah)
You could teach these hoes (teach these hoes)
Teach these hoes a thing or two (yeah)
You gon' make a real nigga put a ring on you
Girl, I throw it down when I put that thing on you
Baby, on the weekend I bring some dinner through (mm, ooh)
Monday to Friday I know it gets peak
True say, I do run the city like Saadiq
I'ma come through at the end of the week
Turn a really good girl into a freak, Big Mike (mm, yeah)

Yo, is Monday alright? (No, Monday I can't)
Aight, Tuesday I'll slide (no, Tuesday is hard for me)
What? Is Wednesday cool? (Wednesday I work late)
I was thinkin' 'bout it
How about a Thursday, ayy? (Hm, Thursday is tight)
Is Friday a vibe? (Aight, Friday we're live)
Oh, the weekend will be just fine
When I am thinkin' 'bout the time
You gon' be all mine

"Call me" (call me, baby)
"I was thinkin' we should spend some time, babe" (we should spend some time)
Don't, don't play no game with me, honey (honey)
'Cause I'm workin' all week, Monday to Friday (aight, Friday we're live)
Let's stay in the weekend (mm, yeah)
