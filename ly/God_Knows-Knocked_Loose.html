		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Flashes of blood and bone
An empty vessel in between its home
You wrap around my feet
Pooling like wet cement, I sink

Clawing to get away
But every branch I hold onto breaks
Where do I go from here?
Panic sets in and I start to shake

Loathing
Crushed by the weight of the terror

All life reduced to stone
A beam of light pulls you above the ground 
Out of the water through the parted clouds
All life reduced to stone

I am withering at the helm 
Suffocating, and overwhelmed  
I hand you to god
Carve your name
Everything burns
Nothing remains

We are gathered here today
Under the pressure of a weary gaze 
Hydrate the garden
Decorate the grave

Lowered beneath the dirt

The trumpet tolls for the blood I harvest

Flashes of blood and bone
An empty vessel in between its home
God knows I belong to hell
Thats why he left me here by myself

GOD KNOWS
