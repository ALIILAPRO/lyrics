		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't hear you leave 
I wonder how am I still here
And I don't wanna move a thing 
It might change my memory

Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

And I won't go, I won't sleep
I can't breathe until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave, and I can't hide
I cannot be until you're resting here with me

I don't wanna call my friends 
For they might wake me from this dream
And I can't leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh, I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

And I won't go, I won't sleep
And I can't breathe until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave, and I can't hide
I cannot be until you're resting here
And I won't go, and I won't sleep
And I can't breathe until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave, and I can't hide
I cannot be until you're resting here with me

Oh, I am what I am 
I'll do what I want 
But I can't hide

And I won't go, I won't sleep
And I can't breathe until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave, and I can't hide
I cannot be until you're resting here
And I won't go, and I won't sleep
And I can't breathe until you're resting here with me
And I won't leave, and I can't hide
I cannot be until you're resting here with me
