		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Liar
You fucking Liar

I draw the line 
More lies from your mouth proceed to carry out
I draw the line
You won't even be able to recognize me anymore
I can't think straight lately because 
You always cloud up my head
I get lost in the clouds because 
That's the only place I ever know 

And I know that you will never see
What you've done to me
Inside of my heart
And times have passed me by
Where I've survived 
But I don't know why
You tried to end my life 

I know you tried
You tried to end my life 
So deep inside
My heart deemed to die

My will is getting stronger 
I only have one life to live
Not wasting time with your shit
You say the words
So choke on them 
Fucking choke on them
You fucking bitch

And I know that you will never see
What you've done to me
Inside of my heart
And times have passed me by
Where I've survived 
But I don't know why
You tried to end my life 

What you've done to me
I know you tried
My heart has died
You tried to end my life
I know you tried
You tried to end my life
So deep inside
My heart is deemed to die

Cross my heart
Hope to die
I try I try I try and it always ends up with the same damn ending, can't comprehend it
Much like the time it happened to you
