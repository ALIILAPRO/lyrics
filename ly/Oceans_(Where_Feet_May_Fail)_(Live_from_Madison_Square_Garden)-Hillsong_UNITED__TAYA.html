		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders
Let me walk upon the waters
Wherever You would call me
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander
And my faith will be made stronger
In the presence of my Savior

When oceans

When oceans

What happens when life breaks down?
When there is systemic contradiction
My name symbolized all that was corrupt to society
His name symbolized all that was pure
And I was being held in the embrace of a man who was pure
And these inviolable sanctities were preserved in those ten words
And it is the de-sacralization of all of these
That has put us in the mess that we find ourselves

Isn't it true, alas it is much worse
A person may end up believing in anything
You know if that human acceptance does so much for you and me 
Think of what it is when God Himself
Puts His arms around you and says, "Welcome home"

What love is this? It is God's love 
And no other love can be defined 
Until that love has properly been understood

When oceans

When oceans
