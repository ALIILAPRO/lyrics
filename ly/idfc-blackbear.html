		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even if it's fake
'Cause I don't fucking care, at all

You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're slurring all your words
Not making any sense
But I don't fucking care, at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
Like they ain't even there
'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I act like I don't fucking care
'Cause I'm so fucking scared

I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care, I don't fucking care, I don't fucking care

Well you tell me pretty lies
Look me in the face
Tell me that you love me
Even though it's fucking fake
I don't fucking care, at all

You've been out all night
I don't know where you've been
You're probably getting fucked
You're probably giving head
And I don't fucking care, at all

'Cause I have hella feelings for you
I'm only a fool for you
And maybe you're too good for me
I'm only a fool for you
But I don't fucking care, I don't fucking care
I don't fucking care, at all, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

(Ooh, yeah)

Oh, I'm only a fool for you
Oh, but I don't fucking care, I don't fucking care
