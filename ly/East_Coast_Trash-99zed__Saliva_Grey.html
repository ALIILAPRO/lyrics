		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cruising around being a menace
What we smoking on is potent
Slinky that Reap and Goldyglocks got promethazine by the ocean
You don't wanna smoke with me sprinkle oxy's in what I'm rolling
I'm always fucked up but you can get your jaw stolen
Bitch I'm trapping off the river yeah we get it in the mail
Our lips are still sealed and our vessel's still a sail
How you came in with your bitch and now she with me getting railed
I'm a jiggy motherfucker hit your head like a nail
I'm figgity-figgity fucked up off some lines of cocaine
I got some oxy residue dripping off my nose rang
Yeah you try to relate but you will never know my pain
Because I'm dead to the world no one will remember my name
East Coast Trash
Got a target on my back bitch
I feel like eyes are on me everywhere that I am at
Rolling Backwoods in the back of the Civic
We murdered volume 1 and motherfucker we ain't finished
Menace in the city
Motherfuckers are not ready
Grey and Zed are coming thru
You know this shit bout to get messy
We finessing in the 4
Chop some lines of that blow
I ain’t snorting no shit
All that powder for your girl
187 own the world
187 show no love
And when I get to summoning
My shootas coming for yo throat
We runnin' the city like Bolt ain't no scooter
Bumping my shit out in Dallas that Luka
Leeching my style you fuckers are moochin
Pack in the Honda you know that I’m cruising
Bout to light me ciggy
Now we menacing jiggy
804 to 187 yeah we reppin' the city
Motherfuckers are wit it
Grey and Zed always sinning
Boutta double suicide
Columbine on the many
Fuck boys wanna talk that shit that shit
See them loose lips gon' sink that ship
And you wanna get buck off rip
Motherfucker better build a fucking boat to get away from the clique
And you Fuckers are sickening
So I be menacing
Don’t need a stick
Just the murderous spit
That Saliva be dripping
It’s oh so acidic
I spill it in disintegrate
All of you fuckers
And I’m back in this bitch with a bucket of piss
And the fuckers are buggin' and tripping all over my dick
I really couldn’t give a fuck if you don’t listen to my shit fuckboy
Don’t even lie to me you bump my shit
But I don’t think you proud to be
Fuck all the people that loved to be doubting me
1 and the 8 and the 7 up next we gon' menace society
