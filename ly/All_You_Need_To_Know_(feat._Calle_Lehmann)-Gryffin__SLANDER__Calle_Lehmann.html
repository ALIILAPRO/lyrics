		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Simple as can be
I got your hands in mine
And you don't have to listen carefully
I'll tell you a thousand times

Anything you feel, put it all on me
All of your thoughts, I want everything
And when you get sad, like you do sometimes
Put it all on me
Put it all on me

I'll lift you when you're feeling low
I'll hold you when the night gets cold
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
No love lost, we've got you and I
No clouds, we shoot them out the sky
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know

Simple as can be
I'm gonna be around
And you know we got everything we need
Look at this thing we found

Anything you feel, put it all on me
Your fears and your thoughts, give me all of it
And when you get sad, like you do sometimes
Put it all on me
Put it all on me
I'll lift you when you're feeling low
I'll hold you when the night gets cold
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
No love lost, we've got you and I
No clouds, we shoot them out the sky
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know

Simple as can be
I got your hands in mine
And you don't have to listen carefully
I'll tell you a thousand times
And that's all you need to know

I'll lift you when you're feeling low
I'll hold you when the night gets cold
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
No love lost, we've got you and I
No clouds, we shoot them out the sky
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know
I'll lift you when you're feeling low
I'll hold you when the night gets cold
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
No love lost, we've got you and I
No clouds, we shoot them out the sky
You'll never have to be alone
And that's all you need to know
And that's all you need to know
