		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well look who showed up in my head
A vision of you crawling in my bed
I've been meaning to tell you that I've been
Dreaming about you rolling a perfect joint
Like you do

You're always perfect
It makes me nervous
Feels like I don't deserve you
I'm living on the surface

Iceberg, Iceberg

I wanna break the surface tension
Turn the ripples that surround us into waves

There's not a limit to love there's an extension
I'm hidden above the passion that hides away

You're always perfect
It makes me nervous
Feels like I don't deserve you
I'm living on the surface

Iceberg, Iceberg
Iceberg, Iceberg
My love is so much deeper than you see

Baby the hardest part is knowing where to start
If I could break this ice then maybe I would melt your heart

If I could dive down baby and show you the truth
You wouldn't only find me but a deeper side of you

Iceberg, Iceberg
Iceberg, Iceberg
My love is so much deeper than you see

You're always perfect
