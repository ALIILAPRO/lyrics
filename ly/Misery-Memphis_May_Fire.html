		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it coming like it's lookin' for some violence
I try to speak, but it's saying to be silent
I grab the bottle, open up and make it quiet
But they get louder every time I try to hide it

Nothing left to lose at rock bottom
Wounds turn to scars, yeah, I got 'em
But I've come to learn, you've gotta let it burn
If you're gonna be forged in the fire

I try to take the pain away, nothing seems to change
When I go through hell, it's when I know myself
And all the lies that I believe are digging me a grave
But when I go through hell, that's where I find myself
Remade in misery

I found myself in the dark with blurry vision
The walls turn to bars, it was a prison
Could have found my way out if I had listened
I had to die to find what I've been missing

Nothing left to lose at rock bottom
Wounds turn to scars, yeah I got them
And I've come to learn, you've gotta let it burn
If you're gonna be forged in the fire
I try to take the pain away, but it kept chasing me
It's never gonna leave

I try to take the pain away, nothing seems to change
But when I go through hell, it's when I know myself
And all the lies that I believe are digging me a grave
But when I go through hell, that's where I find myself
Remade in misery

It's easier to say I hate it
Then to admit that I created it
I'm done running, I'm done running
I'm done running, I can't escape it
It's easier to say I hate it
Then to admit that I created it
I'm done running, I'm done running
I'm done running, I can't escape it

I try to take the pain away, nothing seems to change (nothing seems to change)
But when I go through hell it's when I know myself
And all the lies that I believe are digging me a grave (digging me a grave)
But when I go through hell, that's where I find myself
Remade in misery

Remade in misery
