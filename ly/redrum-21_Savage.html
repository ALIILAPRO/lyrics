		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cai a noite sobre o (nosso amor)
E agora s√≥ restou do amor
Uma palavra
Adeus (adeus, adeus, adeus) ah

Woah, woah, woah

Want it all, I won't leave a breadcrumb
Bitch, what? I thought a nigga said sum'
Thought a nigga said sum'
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
Nigga, all we know is (redrum)

Ridin' in the back, it's a May' (it's a May')
Thirty-two shots in the K (in the K)
Marathon, I really run the A (run the A)
Say you touched me, how Sway? (How Sway?)
Graveyard, that's where the opps stay (opps stay)
Hypnotize, they do what I say (what I say)
21, niggas don't play (don't play)
My Glock Gen5 said hey (said hey)
Take my chopper everywhere, that's bae (that's bae)
Get yo' ass out the car, you givin' Tre (givin' Tre)
We been spinnin' through they hood all day (all day)
Niggas say they outside, okay, okay
I can't let a bitch play me, no way (no way)
You a duck if you believe what ho say (what ho say)
She got way more bodies than my old K (old K)
My lil' brother beat his body, OJ (OJ)
Niggas talkin' 'bout they lit, I'm La Flame (pussy)
That lil' boy a mascot, he ain't gang (pussy)
Watch a half a million dollars and it's plain (pussy)
I don't go through TSA to get on planes (pussy)
You get pussy without head, then you lame (pussy)
She knew I was leavin' 'fore I even came (pussy)
Two revolvers on my waist, John Wayne (pussy)
Smack niggas, then I get on live and sing (yeah)

Want it all, I won't leave a breadcrumb
Bitch, what? I thought a nigga said sum'
Thought a nigga said sum'
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
Nigga, all we know is (redrum)

How many niggas got the belt? (A lot)
Catch 'em at the light, he get nailed (bow)
9-1-1, somebody help
Sub-tweeting bad for your health, pussy
I'm a gangster, I ain't takin' shit back, pussy
I'll never do no song with no rat, pussy
Put a Lego in a stick, it rat-a-tat, pussy
I don't wanna talk, go and catch a hat, pussy
Big Draco come up out that Scat, pussy
He stood on business, now he layin' on his back, pussy
Ask around, I be rappin' nothin' but facts, pussy
We the reason all these niggas runnin' track, pussy (on God)
You ain't never stepped, you can't tell me a thing (21)
I got big cojones and I'm lettin' 'em hang (21)
Keep my mouth closed and that's never gon' change (21)
You get in a jam and go to pointin' and blame (21, 21)
I ain't let it slide, I was sharpenin' aim
Smokin' on my brothers got his ass left slain
You know it's smoke 'cause they ain't even take off his chain
Say it's up with me, your ass must do cocaine (21, 21)

Want it all, I won't leave a breadcrumb
Bitch, what? I thought a nigga said sum'
Thought a nigga said sum'
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
G Block, all we know is redrum
Redrum, redrum, redrum, redrum
Nigga, all we know is (redrum)

Little pigs
Little pigs, let me come in
Not by the hair on your chinny-chin-chin?
Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down
Here's Johnny
