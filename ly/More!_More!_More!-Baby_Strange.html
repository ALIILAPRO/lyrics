		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it funny like a ha ha?
Spent all your money now your nose is bloody 
One day it’s gonna crush ya 
The walls are paper thin

Now that’s what I call music x 3

You’re moving in the wrong direction 
You better take control, you’re wasting all your money 
Wasting all your money

Is it funny like a ha ha?
You’ve opened your eyes now you can’t see nothing 
In the dead of the night I see it 
It’s coming, coming taking you home 
Have you still got the meat on your bones?
Have you still got the whites left in your eyes?
I feel like a fly on the wall 
Two bits of a bacon in a sandwich you dropped on the floor
Oh why do you make me feel so small?
Feel like an idiot, I’m sick of it all, of it all

Now that’s what I call music x 3
Now that’s what I call 

You’re moving in the wrong direction 
You better take control, you’re wasting all your money 
Wasting all your money
You ain’t got no money, you’re wasting all your money 

Now that’s what I call music x4

Is it funny like a ha ha?
You spent all your money now your nose is bloody
You’re moving in the wrong direction 
You’re gonna lose control 

You’re moving in the wrong direction 
You better take control, you’re wasting all your money 
Wasting all your money
You ain’t got no money, you’re wasting all your money 
You ain’t got no money, you’re wasting all your money 
You ain’t got no money, so why’s it always money?
