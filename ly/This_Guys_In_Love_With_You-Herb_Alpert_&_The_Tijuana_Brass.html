		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see this guy 
This guy's in love with you
Yes, I'm in love 
Who looks at you the way I do
When you smile I can tell 
We know each other very well

How can I show you 
I'm glad I got to know you 'cause
I've heard some talk 
They say you think I'm fine
Yes, I'm in love 
And what I'd do to make you mine

Tell me now is it so 
Don't let me be the last to know

My hands are shakin' 
Don't let my heart keep breakin' 'cause
I need your love 
I want your love
Say you're in love 
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die

Tell me now is it so 
Don't let me be the last to know

My hands are shakin' 
Don't let my heart keep breakin' 'cause
I need your love 
I want your love
Say you're in love 
In love with this guy
If not I'll just die
