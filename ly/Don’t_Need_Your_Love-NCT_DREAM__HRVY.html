		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah you and I fell in too deep
Love hate no in between
Too little too late for us
Oh, those dimples on your face
Don't work the same these days
It's clear we've both had enough

(Ye ye ye) you think it's my heart you're holding
You still think you're all that I need
(Ye ye ye) but I know we're fire and ocean
Yeah you ain't got nothing on me

I don't need your love
If you're waiting for a comeback, hold on
I don't need your love
If you think I'm gonna come back, I won't

I don't need your love 
Don't need it 
Don't need it, need it no 
Don't need it 

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it

찰나의 반짝임
이제는 바래진
추억은 먼지 같아 oh
걷잡을 수 없이
우리의 시간은
이제는 끝이 났어

(Ye ye ye) 기억은 더 흐려지지
널 보던 내 눈빛까지
(Ye ye ye) 바람이 머물지 않듯
Yeah 그대로 널 지나쳐

I don't need your love
기다려도 소용없을 거야
I don't need your love
아마 그런 일은 없을 거야

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it
I don't need your love

Ring ring ring ring
부재중 전화 또 부재중 전화
12시 12시 반 2시 또 2시 반
스트레스 받아 미치겠어 제발 너 땜에

잠을 못 자 지금 도대체 뭔 생각으로
이러는 거야 no don't say it
네가 아니라도 지금 내 옆엔
기댈 데가 많아 I don't wanna go back (I don't need your love)

If you're waiting for a comeback, hold on
I don't need your love
아마 그런 일은 없을 거야

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it

I don't need your love
Don't need it
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it

I don't need your love
Don't need it, need it no
Don't need it
