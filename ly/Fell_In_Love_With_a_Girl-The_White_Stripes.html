		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell in love with a girl
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and said "Are you alright?"
I said I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Yeah Bobby said its fine, he don't consider it cheating now

Red hair with a curl
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping
Can't keep away from the girl
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting
Can't think of anything to do yeah my left brain knows that our love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Yeah, I said it once before but it bears repeating, now

(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)

Can't think of anything to do
Yeah my left brain knows that our love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new, well
I said it once before but it bears repeating now

Fell in love with a girl 
I fell in love once and almost completely
She's in love with the world
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading
She turns and said "Are you alright?"
I said I must be fine because my heart's still beating
Come and kiss me by the riverside
Yeah Bobby said its fine, he don't consider it cheating, now

(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)
(Aah, aah, aah, aah)

Can't think of anything to do yeah
My left brain knows that our love is fleeting
She's just looking for something new
Well I've said it once before but it bears repeating, now
