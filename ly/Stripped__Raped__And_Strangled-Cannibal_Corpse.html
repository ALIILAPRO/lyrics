		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They think they know who I am.
All they know is I love to kill.
Face down, dead on the ground.
Find me before another is found.

[Chorus]
I come alive in the darkness.
Left murdered and nameless.
Dead, unburied, and rotten.
Half eaten by insects.

She was so beautiful
I had to kill her.

Tied her up,
And taped her mouth shut;
Couldn't scream;
Raped violently.
Rope tight around her throat;
Her body twitches
As she chokes.

Strangulation caused her death,
Just like all the others.
Raped before and after death;
Stripped, naked, tortured.

They're all dead; they're all dead.
They're all dead, by strangulation.

[Chorus]

It felt so good to kill.
I took their lives away.
Seven dead, lying rotten.
Unburied victims;
Their naked bodies putrify.

Strangulation caused her death,
Just like all the others.
Raped before and after death;
Stripped, naked, tortured.

They're all dead; they're all dead.
They're all dead, by strangulation.

[Chorus]

They think they know who I am.
All they know is I love to kill.
Face down, dead on the ground.
Find me before another is found.
