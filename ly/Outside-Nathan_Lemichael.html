		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my look at the time
A little to late to be going outside
Ain't left my house for the past few nights
Ain't shut my mouth for the past few lies
Oh my look at the time
A little to late to be going outside
Ain't left my house for the past few nights
Ain't shut my mouth for the past few lies
Shawty probably wonder why I always got a attitude
I be ducking girls from the longitude the latitude
Some call it a blessing I ain't even show them gratitude
Cause people are exhausting so I'm napping in the afternoon
Girl take a break wit ya bullshit
Something on your mind you should hold it
Think this a game you should forfeit
You deserve to be alone and you know it
Why I deserve to be alone though
Get her out of here
skirt skirt
Gonna pull up on her block
Walk in to her house and I tell her she a lot
Smack me in the face I don't think she wanna talk
Never even say goodbye I'm just guessing she forgot
Oh my look at the time
A little to late to be going outside
Ain't left my house for the past few nights
Ain't shut my mouth for the past few lies
Oh my look at the time
A little to late to be going outside
Ain't left my house for the past few nights
Ain't shut my mouth for the past few lies
Homies always wonder how I been so focused
Shouts out to Twinkie I ain't talking about hostess
Listen to the song and he ask me who wrote this
Don't need to be rich I'm just trying to get noticed
Never going out I'm uh stay home
I ain't even going charge my phone
Know you wanna see me but you wont
I been stressing on nonsense way to long to long
Skirt skirt when I pull up in my driveway
Just got a burger from T.G.I. Friday's
Waitress was mad cause I looked at her sideways
Forgot all that shit gave me dome on the highway
Oh my look at the time
A little to late to be going outside
Ain't left my house for the past few nights
Ain't shut my mouth for the past few lies
Oh my look at the time
A little to late to be going outside
Ain't left my house for the past few nights
Ain't shut my mouth for the past few lies
