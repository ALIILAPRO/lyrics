		  So when I just got here
I was just a bit like
I don't wanna be here anymore
Pull me out of this
(Hey Fred)
(Hahaha, holy shit)

Pull me out of this

Pull me out of this

You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down

Pull me out of this

Pull me out of this

Music, the music, the music
The music's getting faster
(Oh my God)

Touch me (oh my God)
Talk to me (I knew we were gonna dance, but)
(We danced so hard)
Touch me (hahaha, holy shit)
Talk to me
Touch me
Talk to me

You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down

You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down
You know how to calm me down (play that shit, Fred)
Pull me out of this
