		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is fast but I don't wanna live past you, cause you are my only roots
I was the king of the drug booze thing now I've worn out the soles of my party boots
So call me shit faced Master of Disgrace, I don't care cause my outter skin
Is thick like crust, and a liver thats rusted out, now I'm on a list

Everbody wants to give a shit outta me, I won't give it but I'll give ambivalence
I gotta memory box cause my memory blocks me, from remembering weeks
All the blacked out nights into white out mornings, into grey matter damagings
So call me Fat Fuck, geriatric punk rock, give it straight cause I deserve
a verbal beating from an audience bleating, and a melee with no concern
Everybody wants to give a shit outta me, I won't give it but I'll give irresponsiveness
Everybody wants to drag me up again, I wanna go, but the price keeps going up
Going down is simple and practicl, laying low but keeping it cynical
I'm on the wagon and it's such a drag, without a key kick, shot, and a drag

Evidently no one likes a quitter or an old punk's bitterness
So I'm waiting for the tap, on my shoulder, cause we're all getting older not better
The laughs are no longer with us
So call me Fat Fuck geriatric punk,
call me Fat Fuck geriatric punk
call me Fat Fuck geriatric punk shit-faced master of disgrace
