		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two moons, I can feel myself start catching on fire
But you knew, yeah, you kept it to yourself, to yourself
Two moons, I get lost on my way searching for liars
This ain't good for my health, no, this ain't good for my health

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

I don't feel serene (no)
No, I don't feel too clean (oh)
And I don't want to be the one to make you cry
I'll play inside, I'll start a fire
I'll tell your friends that I lost my mind
It'll take a while but I'll start to smile
Broken windows and broken tiles
Frozen willows, we'll go for miles
Hope will let go, yeah, that's its style
And you don't know where my soul's headed
I'm forgetting you, so I'll say

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

Left, right, my eyesight is diminishing
My life sucks at night, I try to finish it
Early, pearly, whites get blurry
Surely I'll go bite the dirty dust
Cuts deeper as my head goes nuts
I'll be a believer if I ever see trust
I must be disgusting rust
God, I hate myself, I just wanna unplug
Yeah, fuck no
I go where I want to
But I'm stuck in my bedroom
I'm telling lies to keep myself from hurting those around you
Yeah, after all these years I found you
I found you again

Sorry, please excuse me for my mess
My heart's been pouring through my chest
I fell through corridors of broken floors
I'm sorry that I left
Fell asleep in my new bed
I can't feel happy in my head
I see two moons and nothing more
I close my door, I'm left with less

(I close my door, I'm left with less)
(I close my door, I'm left with less)
