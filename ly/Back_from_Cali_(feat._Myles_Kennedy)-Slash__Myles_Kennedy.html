		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up this morning all alone
I got a ringin' in my head
I couldn't take it anymore today
She left me here for dead
Oh, I (echoed)

And it don't come as no surprise
I should have known if from the start
The lights are faded
And I can't deny this place ain't got no heart

Oh, you can hear me tonight
You can hear me tonight

You'll have to carry me
Back from Cali
I'm tired and broken and I lost my way
You'll have to carry me
Back to where I belong
You'll have to carry me
Back from Cali
I don't want money
I don't need the fame
You'll have to carry me
Back to where I belong

I got to leave this angel city
I can't do it by myself
So if you please
Mama, can you save me
Before I blow this life to hell

Oh, love
Mama drag me by the feet
And just drag me home

You'll have to carry me
Back from Cali
I don't care if you think I'm to blame
You'll have to carry me
Back to where I belong
You'll have to carry me
Back from Cali
The angel city where the devils play
You'll have to carry me
Back to where I belong

Yeah, you can hear me tonight
You can hear me tonight
You can hear me tonight
You can hear me tonight

I've lost my way
I'm so alone
And all I want to do is come home
