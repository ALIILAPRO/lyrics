		  Homixide
Huh, what?
Huh, what?
Huh, what? What?

Yeah, these diamonds on my neck and my wrist, huh, yeah
You know that shit froze (what)
I walk in to check on my bitch (what, yeah)
You know I do the most (what)
And diamonds sit right on her toes (what)
We duggin' oregano, no smoke (what)
The chopper be right by my side, you know it's gon' blow (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
I'm stickin' to my motherfuckin' gang, we cannot go (woo)
We been on a bean and we rollin' (rollin')
We stackin' this paper, get paid (paid)
Lil' bitch, I'm stuck in my ways
We in the trap, yeah, shit rollin' (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, homixide)

We been on the beat, 25/8
You know we get paid (ha)
I'm stackin' my bread every day (ha)
We been on a bean and we rollin' (rollin')
The chopper on me, (what) you know I'm totin' (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
The chopper on me, (what) you know I'm totin'
Okay, yeah, okay (okay)
I'm keepin' that chopper every day (what)
There's a hundred-round on my K (what)
And that's what I'm totin' (totin', Homixide)
You play with this shit, (what) you know we gon' roll 'em (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
You play with this shit, (what) you know we gon' spin 'em (spin)
Chill with my brother', I'm with 'em
You playin' this shit? We gon' bend 'em
Ayy, rockstar, yeah, my lifestyle, huh
Remember them day ones with us, huh
But back then, (what) it was more realer (what)
Now they on my dick, talkin' 'bout they don't remember (what)

Yeah, these diamonds on my neck and my wrist, huh, yeah
You know that shit froze (what)
I walk in to check on my bitch (what, yeah)
You know I do the most (what)
And diamonds sit right on her toes (what)
We duggin' oregano, no smoke (what)
The chopper be right by my side, you know it's gon' blow (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
I'm stickin' to my motherfuckin' gang, we cannot go (woo)
We been on a bean and we rollin' (rollin')
We stackin' this paper, get paid (paid)
Lil' bitch, I'm stuck in my ways
We in the trap, yeah, shit rollin' (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, homixide)

The chopper so big you can't hold it
You shoot it, it knock off your shoulders
We gettin' them drugs and we rollin'
I like codeine inside of my soda
She like, "Boy, you been gettin' a little older"
I hit from the back and I hold her
I hit from the back and I stroke it
I hit from the back and I hold it
Ridin' 'round with my boy, we count these racks, huh
Catchin' all these plays, you know we teax yeah
Comin' out at night, we dressed in all black, yeah
Demons on my left and on my right, huh
It's a murder scene about my boys, huh
Pullin' up with heaters, that's my boys, huh
Bitch, you know we geekin', yeah, you know it
My diamonds out the freezer, they so frozen

Yeah, these diamonds on my neck and my wrist, huh, yeah
You know that shit froze (what)
I walk in to check on my bitch (what, yeah)
You know I do the most (what)
And diamonds sit right on her toes (what)
We duggin' oregano, no smoke (what)
The chopper be right by my side, you know it's gon' blow (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide)
I'm stickin' to my motherfuckin' gang, we cannot go (woo)
We been on a bean and we rollin' (rollin')
We stackin' this paper, get paid (paid)
Lil' bitch, I'm stuck in my ways
We in the trap, yeah, shit rollin' (Homixide, Homixide, Homixide, homixide)
