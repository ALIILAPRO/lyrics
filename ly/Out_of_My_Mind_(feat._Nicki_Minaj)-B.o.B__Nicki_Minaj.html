		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm
I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

I'm out of my fucking mind, gee, gee, golly, oh my
I was doing fine, once upon a time
Then my brain left and it didn't say bye
Don't look at me wrong, I'm out of my mind
Like Nostradamus and da Vinci combined
So paranoid of espionage
I'm watching my doors and checking my blinds
My brain is on vacation, they telling me
And I'm bi-polar to the severity
And I need medication, apparently
And some Electroconvulsive therapy
I am a rebel, but yes, I'm so militant
Still I'm illegible for disabilities
I am psychotic but there is no remedy
This is not figurative, this is literally
If these niggas go dumb, I go to the mental facility
See, man I'm so out there, I slap fives with ET
I don't need a feature
They don't want me to eat A La Carte when I'm on this beat
If you feel the same as me, then you got to agree
I'm out of my mind

Out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm
Out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

What's your name? B.o.B?
So, they calling you Bob?
Stop playing, nigga, you know that I'm known for the 'Bob
Couple hit songs, got you thinking you a hearthrob
Well, this thang so good, make a nigga wanna sob
You don't need a feature?
Nigga, I'm the feature
You gon' be the priest, and I'mma be the preacher
You can be the He-Man, I'mma be the She-Ra
You can be the Grim, I'mma be the Reaper
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night skies
Are like shooting stars?
Well, you gon' really need a wish right now
When my goons come through and start shooting stars
You know, I'm all about shoes and cars
I'm kinda drunk off booze, Bacardi
I told Baby when I get my new advance
I'mma blow that motherfucker on a blue Bugatti
You know, I graduated summa cum laude
That's why they thinking I'm Illuminati
And matter fact, let's kiss and make-up
I'll help you escape on my blue Ducati
Hallelujah!

I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

I'm out of it
I can't seem to come out of it
What's going on inside of my head?
It feels like I'm being John Malkovich
Ladies and gentlemen, please tone it down a bit
There's an announcement, I like to announce 
Wait, how am I suppose to pronounce this shit?

I don't need a sub, I don't a speaker
'Cause a nigga bring the noise like an onomatopoeia
Leave him in the dust, all he see is my Adidas
Na na na na boo boo, wouldn't want to be ya
Never turning back, how you think I got here?
And I'm never slowing down, fuck was that a deer?
If you got a problem, step to the office
Matter fact, never mind, talk to the kiosk, bi-atch
You have no idea
That's why they call me B dot, been a maniac ever since I was knee-high
Man, I swear to God, I'mma need help
Someone call Charter, maybe call FEMA
'Cause I got to be crazy or outta my mind to have this many stamps on my VISA

I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm, I'm out of my, out of my mind
Out of my fucking mind
I'm out of my-my-my
Out of my mind-mi'-mi'-mi'-mi'
I'm out of my fucking mind
Out of my fucking mind, mind

Wait, if I'm here and you're there?
And I'm here and you're there? (If I'm there and you're here?)
And I'm here and you're there? (If I'm there and you're here?)
If I'm here and you're there? (If I'm there and you're here?)
And I'm here and you're there?
