Then we sleep through day then we play all through the late night
Sleep through day then we play all through the late night
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, all through the late night
S'il vous plaît, don't you wait, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night

I'm soarin', how the hell did I get in this space?
Four in the mornin', how did I get in this place?
Oh it don't matter, got smoke, drink, and I'm runnin' this space
Done contemplatin', I'ma take it in and groove in this case
N,N-Dimethyltryptamine and Lysergic acid diethylamide
The vibes are effervescent, delicious, just how they should be
N,N-Dimethyltryptamine and Lysergic acid diethylamide
The vibes are effervescent, delicious, just how they should be
No sleep in my bed, no sleepin' in my bed
When we gon' play, gon' play, gon' play until the day
I said no sleep in my bed, no sleepin' in my bed
Yeah, we gon' play, gon' play, then we'll sleep all through the day
And do it again

Sleep through day then we play all through the late night
Sleep through day then we play all through the late night
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, all through the late night
S'il vous plaît, don't you wait, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night

Day and night, I toss and turn
I keep stressin' my mind, mind
I seek the peace, sometimes I can't restrain
To join a rage at night, come out and play, play
Balance, find your balance
God said it's my talent
Sprinkle a little season on the salad
Relieve my heart of malice, hit my palace
Stroke my cactus, ohh, don't wait
Don't play (Yea, yea)
Play no games like the NBA
Throwin' checks like the NBA
You a ring, you a ring
We shootin' shots like the NRA
Ahh, she jammin' Travis and Kid Cudi
The new Krayzie Bone and Slim Bun B
Yeah, shawty, on the scene, pull up on the scene
Sip my tea, lean no Hennessy
Ah, save all, take it right
Ah, take it all, never light
Ah, had a ball, had a night
Ah, after all, sleep good

Sleep through day then we play all through the late night
Sleep through day then we play all through the late night
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, all through the late night
S'il vous plaît , don't you wait, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
All through the late night, all through the late night
