		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

Wind in your hair, sun on your skin
You're looking good, girl, all over again
Hey there, Miss Brown
I want you to know I love you

Brown as the sand, you're soft as the shore
You're leaving me hungry, I'm crying for more
Oh, we, baby, girl, you're such a score
And I want you to know that, you know what, girl

I love you
I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Ooh, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
Ooh, hoo, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh.

Lips soft and tender, ready to speak
Her voice says, "I love you" (I love you)
And it's making me weak
Hey there, little girl, may I just say I love you
Tell 'em how you feel, Rick

Love is the brown skin girl in my eyes
Think it's time that I told you, don't you realize
YouÂ´re such a queen, woman, you're such a prize
And I want you to know that, you know what, girl

I love you
And I bet you didn't know that, girl
You didn't know that
I need you
Right now, baby, right now, baby
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I love you ebony eyes, oh, my
I need you, woman
I need you (Oh)
Oh, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

I really love you (Oh, oh), woman, I love you (Love you)
Ebony eyes (Ooh), oh, my
I want to say that I need you (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh), honey, I
Need you
And I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Ebony eyes (Woo, woo, ooh, woo, hoo)
Ebony eyes, oh, my (Hoo)
Ebony eyes (Hoo, hoo, hoo)
Girl, and I bet you didn't know that ebony eyes

Love you (Love you, love you)
Ebony eyes
