		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

c moment, a love
c dream, a laugh
c kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
c moment, a love
c dream, a laugh
c moment, a love
c dream, a laugh

Just stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
While our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

Songs of desperation
I played them for you

c moment, a love
c dream, a laugh
c kiss, a cry
Our rights, our wrongs
c moment, a love
c dream, a laugh
c moment, a love
c dream, a laugh

Stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
cnd while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
