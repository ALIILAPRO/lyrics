		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Thought of you as my mountaintop
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had, but couldn't keep
I've had, but couldn't keep

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said, "Money is like us in time
It lies, but can't stand up"
Down for you is up

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
