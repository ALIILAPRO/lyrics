		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This may be the last sunset I'll see
So I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last air that I'll breathe
I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in

I heard that pictures don't change
Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we've been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you fine 'cause I know that you not so don't even try
And what we gon' live for in this life full of pain 
'Til we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives
That's where we going
Do not pretend like you don't even notice
Funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how I feel so be lost in the moment

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut up its wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we breathing but we not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If only they knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Why don't you fix it? 'Cause I'm getting tired
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See, you find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic
You don't know what you doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost

Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Yeah, oh oh oh, yeah, oh lost
Oh, yeah, oh, no no
This may be the last sunset I'll see
I'll take it in, I'll take it in
This may be the last day that I'll breathe
I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in
