		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (uh), yeah, yeah (uh) (grr)
Don't get it twisted
This rap shit is mine, motherfucker
It's not a fucking game
Fuck what you heard
It's what you hearin' (it's what you hearin')
It's what you hearin' (listen)
It's what you hearin' (listen)
It's what you hearin' (listen)

X gon' give it to ya (what)
Fuck waiting for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (uh)
Knock knock, open up the door, it's real
With the non-stop, pop-pop of stainless steel
Go hard, getting busy wit it
But I got such a good heart
That I'll make the motherfucker wonder if he did it
Damn right, and I'll do it again (yeah)
'Cause I am right so I gots to win
Break bread with the enemy (what)
But no matter how many cats I break bread with I'll break who you sendin' me (yeah)
You motherfuckers never wanted nothing (uh, what)
But your life saved, bitch, and that's on a light day
I'm getting down, down like a nigga said, "Freeze" (uh)
But won't be the one ending up on his knees
Bitch please, if the only thing you cats did (come on)
Was came out to play, stay out my way, motherfucker

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go (what)
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya, he gon' give it to ya

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya

Ain't never gave nothing to me (yeah)
But every time I turn around
Cats got they hands out wanting something from me (uh-huh)
I ain't got it, so you can't get it (yeah)
Let's leave it at that 'cause I ain't with it (yeah)
Hit it with full strength (what)
I'm a jail nigga, so I face the world like it's Earl in the bullpen
You against me, me against you (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Whatever, whenever, nigga, fuck you gon' do?
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing (what)
Only nigga that you know who can chill
Come back and get the streets open
I've been doing this for nineteen years (what)
Niggas wanna fight me? Fight these tears (what)
I put in work, and it's all for the kids (uh)
But these cats done forgot what work is (uh-huh)
They don't know who we be
Looking, but they don't know who they see, nigga

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go 
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya (come on)

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go (come on)
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya

Ayy yo, where my niggas at? 
I know I got 'em down in the game, give 'em love and they give it back (woo)
Talk too much for too long (what)
Don't give up, you're too strong (what)
Love to the wild-wild honeys (yeah)
Shout out to niggas that done it (come on)
And it ain't even about the dough
It's about getting down for what you stand for, yo, for real (uh-uh, uh-uh)

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go (come on)
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya (come on)

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go (come on)
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya (come on)

First we gonna rock, then we gonna roll
Then we let it pop, go, let it go (come on)
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya
X gon' give it to ya (uh), he gon' give it to ya (come on)
