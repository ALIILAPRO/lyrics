		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you last week 
When you stopped comin' by?
(Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)

Like, damn, she in her mood (grrah)
Like, damn, she in her mood (mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (in her mood, she in her mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood)
She lit, get money too (like)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood, damn)

In the mirror, I'm doin' my dance (like)
And he packin', I know by his pants (grrah)
He a rapper, but don't got a chance
Stuck in my ways so I'm lovin' my bands
Like a million views in a day (like)
It's so many ways to get paid (grrah)
I tried dippin', he begged me to stay
Bae, I'm not stayin', I just wanna play (just wanna play)
In the party, he just wanna rump (rump)
Big boobs and the butt stay plump (stay plump)
She a baddie, she know she a ten (baddie, ten)
She a baddie with her baddie friend (damn, friend)
They like, "Ice, how you always stay hot?" (Hot)
Oh, they mad 'cause I keep makin' bops (bops)
Oh, she mad 'cause I'm takin' her spot
If I was bitches, I'd hate me a lot (grrah)

Like, damn, she in her mood (grrah)
Like, damn, she in her mood (mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (in her mood, she in her mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood)
She lit, get money too (like)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood, damn)

No friends, I don't fuck with the fakes (grrah)
Sayin' they love me, but wantin' my place (like)
Step in the party, I'm lookin' the baddest
So the paparazzi in my face (grrah)
Pretty bitch, but I came from the gutter
Said I'd be lit by the end of the summer (like)
And I'm proud that I'm still gettin' bigger (damn)
Goin' viral is gettin' 'em sicker
Like, what? Let's keep it a buck (huh)
Bitches too borin', got 'em stuck in a rut (damn)
Lamborghini roarin' when I hop out the truck (huh)
Pretty bitch like Lauren with a big ass butt, yup
Pretty face and the waist all gone (huh)
And I'm makin' them wait, hold on (hold on)
And I'm makin' them wait, hold on (hold on)
Wait, hold on (grrah, hold on)

Like, damn, she in her mood (grrah)
Like, damn, she in her mood (mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (in her mood, she in her mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood)
She lit, get money too (like)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood, damn)
Like, damn, she in her mood (grrah)
Like, damn, she in her mood (mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (in her mood, she in her mood)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood)
She lit, get money too (like)
Like, damn, she in her mood (she in her mood, damn)
