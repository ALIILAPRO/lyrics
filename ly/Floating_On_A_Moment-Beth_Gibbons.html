		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the path with my restless curiosity
Beyond life
Before me
A passenger on no ordinary journey
It's one of a kind
Won't get left behind

I'm floating on a moment
Don't know how long
No one knows
No one can stay
All going to nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
All going, make no mistake

Without control
I'm heading towards a boundary
That divides us, reminds us
Travelling on a voyage where the living
They have never been
Have never seen

I'm floating on a moment
Don't know how long
No one knows
No one can stay
All going to nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
All going, make no mistake

All trying but can't escape
All going to nowhere
Too afraid to be free

Not that I don't want to return
Not that I don't want to return
(All going to nowhere, nowhere)
Oh, honestly
It's not that I don't want to return
(All going to nowhere, nowhere) it just reminds us
Not that I don't want to return
It just reminds us that all we have
All we have is here and now
(All going to nowhere, nowhere)
But all we have is here and now
(All going to nowhere, nowhere)
All we have is here and now
(All going to nowhere)
It just reminds us
All we have is here (all going to nowhere)
