		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You slipped out of my hands
No point in chasing you down, down, down
Wanna get close to you, but I can't
Too far away to bring us back
My mind's deranged
I'm too attached
I should've known it'd never last
Know I'm still in denial
I still think that you're coming back to me
You loved me for a while
But I guess I wasn't what you needed
You tore me down to pieces
But I know damn well I'll never leave
Even though I'm out of energy
I'll still hold all our memories
Your voice is my remedy, oh
Now your silence is killing me, oh
Your voicemail's stuck on replay
I'm trapped in this mental state
Where I need you and I can't escape
I keep on holding on
I keep on holding on
To something you don't even want
No matter what you do to me
You're still my number one
I try to give you all of me
Even when I'm feeling numb
How was I not enough?
You slipped out of my hands
No point in chasing you down, down, down
Wanna get close to you, but I can't
Too far away to bring us back
My mind's deranged
I'm too attached
I should've known it'd never last
Because of you, I gotta watch my six
Because of you, I'm never turning back
The thought of you, it really makes me sick
I'm ashamed of my goddamn past
Put all my feelings in a balled-up fist
All our memories, it makes me mad
Thinking about everything we had
Our love burnt up into ash
You slipped out of my hands
You slipped out of my hands
We did this for nothing
