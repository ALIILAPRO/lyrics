		  (Murder)

It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not kill the groove
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
About your kind
And so and so and so and so and so and so and so
I'll have to play

If you think you're gettin' away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey

It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not kill the groove
Hey-hey, hey-hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There may be others
And so and so and so and so and so and so and so
You'll just have to pray

If you think you're gettin' away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Stay another song
I'll blow you all away
Hey

It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not kill the groove
Hey-hey, hey-hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna turn this house around somehow
Murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
But you better not kill the groove (murder)
Hey-hey, hey-hey
It's murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
But you better not steal the moves (murder)
DJ, gonna burn this god damn house right down

(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)
(Go, go, go, go)

Don't think you'll get away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey

It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not kill the groove (murder)
It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not steal the moves (murder)
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not kill the groove
Hey-hey, hey-hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
It's murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
But you better not kill the groove (murder)
Hey-hey, hey-hey
It's murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
But you better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down

Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know (murder)
I know, I know, I know (on the dancefloor)
But you better not kill the groove (murder)
Hey-hey, hey-hey
