		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're not living in a snow globe Hollywood
There's no rehearsal and our stage is an open book
It's a landslide we're never gonna ride again, again
So let go even when it kills you
Breakout from everything that built you
Wide awake, let your windows break

Set yourself free
And let the light through
Set yourself free
From what'll blind you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you
Set yourself free
From what'll rest you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you

Indecision is the heart's worst enemy
The tunnel vision to a true identity
It's a land mine that everyone's afraid to land
To land
So let go even when it kills you
Breakout from everything that built you
Wide awake, let your windows break

Set yourself free
And let the light through
Set yourself free
From what'll blind you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you
Set yourself free
From what'll rest you
Set yourself free
Let every breath you lose
Let every breath you lose
Uncover you
