		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got life on repeat (repeat)
Despite being deceased (deceased)
Not dead, I'm just asleep (asleep)
Wake up, life on repeat (repeat)

Forget about the bad times let go
Keep these effigy's around, memento
But I'm going it alone, get set go
Still stuck up in my ways same tempo

Price up on my head I got a bounty
Know the reaper comin' for me see him counting
But I'm coming for my throne betta crown me
Always breakin' down the walls, no boundaries

What I got inside my soul they'll never know
Time to show all my emotions that I've never shown
Keep on pushing through the pain never losing hope
Disappear into cosmos, goin' ghost

Life
On
Life
On
Life on repeat

We got life on repeat (repeat)
Despite being deceased (deceased)
Not dead, I'm just asleep (asleep)
Wake up, life on repeat (repeat)
