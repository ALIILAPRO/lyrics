		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're everything I thought you never were
And nothing like I thought you could've been
But still you live inside of me
So tell me, how is that?

You're the only one I wish I could forget
The only one I love to not forgive
And though you break my heart
You're the only one

And though there are times when I hate you 'cause I can't erase
The times that you hurt me and put tears on my face
And even now while I hate you, it pains me to say
I know I'll be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, babe
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
I'm no broken-hearted girl

There's something that I feel I need to say
But up 'til now I've always been afraid
That you would never come around
And still I wanna put this out

You say you got the most respect for me but
Sometimes I feel you're not deserving of me
And still you're in my heart
But you're the only one

And, yes, there are times when I hate you, but I don't complain
'Cause I've been afraid that you would walk away
Oh, but now I don't hate you, I'm happy to say
That I will be there at the end of the day

I don't wanna be without you, babe
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without you, baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
And I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl

Now I'm at a place I thought I'd never be, ooh
I'm living in a world that's all about you and me, yeah
Ain't got to be afraid, my broken heart is free
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh

I don't wanna be without my baby
I don't want a broken heart
Don't wanna take a breath without my baby
I don't want to play that part
I know that I love you, but let me just say
I don't wanna love you in no kind of way, no, no

I don't want a broken heart
I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Broken-hearted girl, no, no
No broken-hearted girl
No broken-hearted girl
