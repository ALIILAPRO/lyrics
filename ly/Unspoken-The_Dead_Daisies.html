		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the static gotta make your pledge
So dramatic and you're out on the ledge
Bones are breaking, hear the rattle and moan
Your body aching and you're out in the zone
Yeah, I can hear you breathe

Unspoken, you gotta let got
Unspoken, you're out in the glow
Unbroken, you let it all flow
In the oneness now you realize
Lost your compass and I sympathize
In the darkness now you fade to grey
In the stillness you will make your way
Oh, I can hear you breathe

Unspoken, you gotta let got
Unspoken, you're out in the glow
Unbroken, you let it all flow
Unspoken

I can hear you breathe
Unspoken, you gotta let got
Unspoken, you're out in the glow
Unbroken, you let it all flow
Unspoken, you gotta let got
Unspoken, you're out in the glow
Unbroken, you let it all flow
Unspoken, you gotta let, gotta let, gotta let go
Unspoken
Unspoken
Unspoken
