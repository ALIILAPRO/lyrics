		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a breath 
Rest your head 
Close your eyes 
You're all right

Just lay down 
To my side 
Do you feel my heat 
On your skin? 

Take off your clothes 
Blow out the fire 
Don't be so shy 
You're all right 
You're all right 
Take off my clothes 
Oh, bless me, Father 
Don't ask me why 
You're all right 
You're all right 

Hold my stare
I'm in command
Can you feel my hips 
In your hands? 
And I'm laying down 
By your side 
I taste the sweet 
Of your skin 

Take off your clothes 
Blow out the fire 
Don't be so shy 
You're all right 
You're all right 
Take off my clothes 
Oh, bless me, Father 
Don't ask me why 
You're all right 
You're all right 

(Don't be so shy, don't be so shy, don't be so shy, don't be so shy)

And my heart just raced so much faster
I drown myself in your holy water
And both my eyes just got so much brighter
And I saw God, oh, yeah so much closer

In the dark
I see your smile
Do you feel my heat
On my skin?

Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're all right
You're all right
Take off my clothes
Oh bless me father
Don't ask me why
You're all right
You're all right

Take off my clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're all right
You're all right
Take off my clothes
And bless me further
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why

(Don't be so shy, don't be so shy, don't be so shy, don't be so shy)
(Don't be so shy, don't be so shy, don't be so shy, don't be so shy)
