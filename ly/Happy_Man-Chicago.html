		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Merely by chance
Very unsuspecting
You caught my heart
Unprotecting me
Now I've fallen in love with you

Just when I thought
I was free and easy
You came along to me
Soft and breezy

Now I've fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
I've fallen in love with you

And for the first time in my life
I know what it's like to be a happy man
Happy man
And for the first time in my life
You've given me something I can't understand
Being a happy man

Be with me now
Love me forever
Leaving you lady
Is something that I'd never do
I've fallen in love with you

All of my life it seems I have waited
Now I can say all these words I have stated are true
I've fallen in love with you
Woo hoo
Fallen in love with you woo hoo
