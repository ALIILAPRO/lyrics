		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my cards laid out
I'm going all in right now
No more playing around
Time to do what we talkin' 'bout
No bluffs, no act
What they know 'bout a love like that?
We got it bad, that's a fact, that's a fact

All that fake shit you can't sell me
Nothing you can tell me
I've been waitin' so long, finally found it
Ain't no way, baby, we could live without it
All that bullshit just don't phase us
All the hate couldn't break us
'Cause when you know better, you do better
We get to have a do-over forever

This time around, we gon' do it right
We gon' do this shit for the rest of our life
This time around, we gon' make it real
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, do it how we like
We gon' have the best time of our lives
This time around, we gon' seal the deal
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around

Baby, if you can
Can you take the time?
To put me first?
To ease my mind?
To cherish this?
Cherish it for life?
Never take for granted (take for granted)
That I'm your wife

All that fake shit you can't sell me
Nothing you can tell me
I've been waitin' so long, finally found it
Ain't no way, baby, we could live without it
All that bullshit just don't phase us (don't phase us)
All the hate couldn't break us (we're stronger)
'Cause when you know better, you do better
We get to have a do-over forever

This time around, we gon' do it right
We gon' do this shit for the rest of our life
This time around, we gon' make it real
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, do it how we like (oh)
We gon' have the best time of our lives
This time around, we gon' seal the deal
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel (you know this time around)
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around (we can do it all, G)I-DLE))

What is wrong?
지긋한 rumor로 멍든 love-hate
암 가치도 없어 turn back (yeah)
다 웃어넘겨 gossip 속 heartbreak
난 너의 품 속 밤새도록
철없던 날 웃고 울던 bad love (bad love)
Yeah, you know, they're sort of doing it the wrong way
The wrong way, the wrong, wrong way
이제 우린 영원이라 할 사랑을 원해
Yo 어쨌거나 don't care (don't care)
모두를 만족시킬 사랑이 다 뭔데 (뭔데, 사랑이 다)
Uh 마지막 맹세로 전해 (전해)
마주 서서 세상에 보란 듯 건배 (건배, 세상에 보란)
Oh 감히 누구의 사랑도 쉽게 얘기할 순 없어 it's so rude, rude, aw
넌 그저 날 봐 (날 봐)
아무리 흔들어도 this time around

This time around, we gon' do it right
We gon' do this shit for the rest of our life
This time around, we gon' make it real
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel
This time around, do it how we like (they say about us, this time around)
We gon' have the best time of our lives (세상에 보란)
This time around, we gon' seal the deal
We don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel

This time around, this time around (this time around)
This time around, this time around (this time is gonna be different, baby, ooh)
This time around, this time around 
This time around, this time around (we got a family)
This time around, this time around (love came back to me, oh)
This time around (oh)
