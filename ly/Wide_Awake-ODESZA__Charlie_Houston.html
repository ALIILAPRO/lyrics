		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been wide awake, feeling
People seem to change their feelings in time
Did we make a mistake healing?
It's more than I can take, not feeling too fine
Something 'bout you
You
You

Waiting at the party for you
Your loving got me acting like a fool
Fool
Waiting at the party for you
Your loving got me acting like a fool
Fool

I hate the way it aches, breathing
Thought that I could put these feelings aside
Something in my system's fading
Making me feel sober while words on my mind
Something 'bout you
You
You

Waiting at the party for you
Your loving got me acting like a fool
Fool
Waiting at the party for you
Your loving got me acting like a fool
Fool
