		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me (yeah)
God took his time when he made me
I put my pride to the side, off safety
And look alive, look alive

Smoke one, ready to po' one
Tote one, scared of no one
You never know when your close ones is a pussy, 'til your nose run
Bickin' back bein' bool, trigger happy his goons
Bigger mansion and pool, I need a map for this room
Don't need a casket to view 'em
You can leave the rats in the sewers
I'm speedin' past in the newest, soft top like the Jewish
Thrasher Sweatshirt, Vans on
Aw daddy, the bitches hands on
Fucked your bitch for a Sam's card, a SIM card and an Android
Shots all in the airway, bullets make 'em do ballet
Pullin' triggers like hairspray, shoot 'em in the head bad hair day
In broad day light let's play, lil' kids playin' jump rope
Leave his body on the front porch, it's a cold world but the sun show
Where the paper and the drugs, though?
At your neighbor with the snub-nose
I be seen with the unseen, you be seen with the unknowns
All your bitches in the done zone, all my bitches in the fun zone
Swallowin' all my unborns, say it taste like a love song
In the cut like a cutworm, keep it cool, keep the cup warm
Rum bum bum bum bum if they come for 'em, I tell 'em

God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me

Sorry, boys, bar is closin', where we goin' for breakfast?
Put pressure on the precious, and put extra on the extras
Extra ready for my presence, extra sexy but she selfish
Just want me to see selfies of the pelvis, overwhelming
Talking money over salmon in Italian and Australian
Fuck it even have some salad, I'm just valuin' the value
Wake up and smell the azeleas
Sang her prayers like Mahalia
I just don't know what to tell ya, but, hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Devil lies jumpin' at ya, coming from what's coming at ya
I come from where they come at ya 
In a way you can't come back from
I attack from every crack, while you been chillin' I been active
I been still inside the action, you been actin' I been buildin'
You been blabbin', you been bickerin'
I been black and I been sippin' like the Dracula
I been feelin' like Galactus, got a million in the mattress, a gazillion in the pantry
If you don't know why I'm not answering you should kill who you been askin'

God took his time when he made me
Got my pride to the side, off safety
I'm on a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
On a diet, on a diet from the fake beef
'Cause in my eyes all that I see is dead meat

Momma said God took his time when he made me
God took his time when he made me
Pride to the side, off safety
Look alive, look alive
Look alive, look alive, yeah
Look alive, look alive

Momma said God took his time when he made me
Look alive, look alive
Carter Five, Carter Five, yeah, 
Carter Five, Carter Five, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
