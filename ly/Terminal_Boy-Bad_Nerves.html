		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  im burning my television
the news is good today
smoking in my bed out the window
sleep with a phone 
know you're not alone
the kid from the golden years
then i met this girl she had dreams like my own
got a car full of old cassette tapes 
im driving to meet you
meet you, meet you 
meet you, meet you yeah

i know i know
i gotta get off it somehow
cause i don't feel the same
i know i know
i've stayed up here until now
cause i don't know my way

i know your favourite records
you played me every one
spinning round a day never gets old
dreaming too big 
another good hit
the kid from the golden years
so i quit my job i've got dreams of my own
but im cold like my radiator
baby i need you
need you, need you
need you, need you yeah

i know i know
i gotta get off it somehow
cause i don't feel the same
i know i know
i've stayed up here until now
cause i don't know my way

its karma kid work it out
im trying harder now
oh no you're not
everybody thinks but they don't feel
its karma kid i can never let you go
i can see it all flash before my eyes

i know i know
i gotta get off it somehow
cause i don't feel the same
i know i know
i've stayed up here until now
cause i don't know my way
