		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya'll ready for this? 

Get down with the style 
House on the ground
Freeze when I squeeze 
Drop to your knees
Who wants to play?
I'm in here to stay 
Ready to take you around the way 
So get ready for this 
Mind your own biz 
'Cause I invented the microphone biz 
No need to sit, cause we're 2 Unlimited
Ready, ready, ready for this 

Feel the base, you just get closer 
Be impressed by the words I chose of 
Once again kickin' it live 
Doin' everything yo just to survive 
A wall to wall, I think I stand 
Being on stage with a mic in my hand 
Bustin' it live to the crowd
The age is 20, I'm from the south 

Be a part
Break my heart 
Get ready for this 
Mind your own biz 
People in the front 
Show me what you want 
And I won't give it in
Get ready for this 
We're 2 Unlimited 
So people won't you sit? 
Movin' up and down 
Dancin' on the ground
Feelin' kinda free, security 
House is the style that moves you from the ground

House on the ground, bass in your face 
Racin' the place, no time to waste 
Feelin' hypnotised 
I can see it in your eyes 
Feelin' kinda better 
Put on your sweater 
Feelin' like a white 
I think it doesn't matter
Super, dope, def, and even outrageous 
If I was an animal, they'd've kept me in cages 
So get ready for this 

Ya'll ready for this? 

Be a part
Break my heart 
Get ready for this 
Mind your own biz 
People in the front 
Show me what you want 
And I won't give it in
Get ready for this 
We're 2 Unlimited 
So people won't you sit? 
Movin' up and down 
Dancin' on the ground
Feelin' kinda free, security 
House is the style that moves you from the ground
