		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't tell me what to do my friend
You'll break more hearts than you can mend
I know myself like no one else
Nothing to defend

My life is full of good advice
And you don't have to tell me twice
Living here in paradise
No rules that I should bend

In my years my life has changed
I can't turn back the time
I can tell you just what made me change

All I know is who I am
I'll never let you down
The rest will give you trust until the end

There ain't no rules to follow
You can't predict tomorrow
I know just who my friends are
The rest can turn to stone

Your memories are yours alone
There yours until your dust and bones
I know the things I'm looking for
I know just what I want

In my life the times have changed
I'm still in a rush
I don't want to hear your fairytales

All I know is who I am
I'll never let you down
The rest will give you trust until the end

Until the end

In your life you'll be amazed
About all you long to lose
You can't never live that life again
But one thing you will never lose
Is the signing in your head
That will still be with you till the end
