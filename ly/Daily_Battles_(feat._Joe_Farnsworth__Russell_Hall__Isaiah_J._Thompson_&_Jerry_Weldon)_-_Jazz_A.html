		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I should have known it’s over
When you left me in the dark
And that it wouldn’t take much longer
Before you break my heart
Sometimes I think I see you sitting at that nice café
Sitting at that nice café
And sometimes I dial your number
But then I hang up anyway 
I hang up anyway

We used to call each other names
Didn’t care what others say
We watched cartoons cause it was fun
When we were still young
We used to go outside all day
Play hide and seek and run away
We were just kids having some fun
When we were still young
When we were still you-u-ung
We used to call each other names
Didn’t care what others say
We watched cartoons cause it was fun
When we were still young
We used to go outside all day
Play hide and seek and run away
We were just kids having some fun
When we were still young
When we were still young
When we were still young

I’ve known you since we went to play school
Kept the bracelets that we made
I even saved all of our pennies
We got by selling lemonade

We used to call each other names
Didn’t care what others say
We watched cartoons cause it was fun
When we were still young
We used to go outside all day
Play hide and seek and run away
We were just kids having some fun
When we were still young
When we were still young
When we were still young
We used to call each other names
Didn’t care what others say
We watched cartoons cause it was fun
When we were still young
We used to go outside all day
Play hide and seek and run away
We were just kids having some fun
When we were still young
When we were still young
