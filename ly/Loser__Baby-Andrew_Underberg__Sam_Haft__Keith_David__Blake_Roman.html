		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So things look bad, and your back's against the wall
Your whole existence seems fuckin' hopeless
You're feelin' filthy as a dive bar bathroom stall
Can't face the world sober and dopeless
You've lost your way, you think your life is wrecked
Well, let me just say you're correct

Wait, what?

You're a loser, baby
A loser, goddamn baby
You're a fucked up little whiny bitch

Hey!

You're a loser, just like me

Thanks, asshole

You're a screws-loose boozer
An only one-star reviews-er
You're a power bottom at rock bottom
But you got company

This supposed to make me feel better?

There was a time I thought that no one could relate
To the gruesome ways in which I'm damaged
But lettin' walls down, it can sometimes set you straight!
We're all livin' in the same shit sandwich

I sold my soul to a psychopathic freak

And you think that makes you unique?
Get outta here, man!

We're both losers, baby
We're losers, it's okay to be a

Coked-up, dick-suckin' ho?

Baby, that's fine by me

I'm a loser, honey
A schmoozer and a dummy
But at least I know I'm not alone

You're a loser
Just like me

I got an appetite for gamblin'

I got an appetite for samplin' every drug and sex toy I can find

Go ahead baby, sing that song, come on!

I got no holes left to deflower

I sold my soul to save my power
Now I'm on that demon's leash
I'm trapped and it gets worse with every hour

You're a loser, baby

A loser, but just maybe if we
Eat shit together, things will end up differently

It's time to lose your self-loathin'
Excuse yourself, let hope in, baby
Play your card, be who you are
A loser, just like me
