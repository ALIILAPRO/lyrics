		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the things that I once feared
All the whispers in my ear
All the friends I thought I knew
All the people I outgrew
All the nights I wasted tears
All the disappearing years
For a while was in denial
My mother's least favorite child

It's all these fucking voices in my head
Tell me I'm not good enough for them
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again
All these fucking voices in my head
Got me feeling insecure again
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again
All these fucking voices

Every thought that's in my head
Every stupid word I said
Every corner in my house
Every crease around my mouth
Every night I toss and turn
Am I ever gonna learn?
Everyone should quiet down
I just wanna tune you out

It's all these fucking voices in my head
Tell me I'm not good enough for them
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again
All these fucking voices in my head
Got me feeling insecure again
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again
All these fucking voices

I can't escape my thoughts, are they real or dreams?
Sirens in my head, paranoia screams
I don't feel alone, are they watching me?
Are you watching me?

I can't escape my thoughts, are they real or dreams?
Sirens in my head, paranoia screams
I don't feel alone, are they watching me?
Are they watching me? Are you watching me?
Are you watching me? Are you watching me?

I don't know if I can survive (are you watching me?)
Unless I can shut off my mind (are you watching me?)
Is it too late? Is it too late?

It's all these fucking voices in my head
Tell me I'm not good enough for them
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again

It's all these fucking voices in my head
Tell me I'm not good enough for them
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again
All these fucking voices in my head
Got me feeling insecure again
They just leave me paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid again, again

Are you watching me?
Are you watching me?
Are you watching? Are you watching me?
