		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get out
Keep runnin'
Keep runnin'
Keep runnin'
Give back
What's stolen
What's stolen
What's stolen

Time out
Stop tryin'
Stop tryin'
Stop tryin' to
Bend the truth
Stop lyin'
Stop lyin'
Stop lyin'

Get out
Keep runnin'
Keep runnin'
Keep runnin'
Give back
What's stolen
What's stolen
What's stolen

Time out
Stop tryin'
Stop tryin'
Stop tryin' to
Bend the truth
Stop lyin'
Stop lyin'
Stop lyin'

It's on you

I know you're a
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
I know you're a
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit

Pay up
Cash money
Cash money
Cash money
Pay up
Stolen time
Stolen time
Stolen time

Wash out
Dirty laundry
Dirty laundry
Dirty laundry
What's yours
Is now mine
Is now mine
Is now mine

It's on you

I know you're a
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
I know you're a
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit

'Cause you
Took me by surprise, but
I know you're a
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
I know you're a
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
Bandit, bandit, bandit, bandit
