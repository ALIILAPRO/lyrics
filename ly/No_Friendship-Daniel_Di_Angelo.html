		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stack it up like a sandcastle
All of that ass, I want them apples
Fuckin' like animal planet
Then she wine poppin' on Xanax, yeah
Just for one night, I might stay with you
Baby, I ain't trippin', I ain't playing with you
Something like this could do damage
I don't wanna fuck up our friendship, yeah yeah yeah

So we can't repeat the moment
I know we both enjoyed it
Don't wanna mess this up, there's too much on the line

Fallin' for you, I just can't do
'Cause I'm not the one, doesn't mean that I don't love you
Without you, there's no friendship
There's no friendship
There's no friendship

And I haven't even met the girl that I don't want just one time
I don't wanna have nobody tyin' up my phone lines
Our relationship was better when we never fucked, like
Well, just sometimes, yeah
And I got another girl in a duplex
And she runnin' up a bill on my Amex
And I never really fucked with the Xanax
Plus, we're best friends, so we can't do this

So we can't repeat the moment
I know we both enjoyed it
Don't wanna mess this up, there's too much on the line

Fallin' for you, I just can't do
'Cause I'm not the one, doesn't mean that I don't love you
Without you, there's no friendship
There's no friendship
Fallin' for you, I just can't do
'Cause I'm not the one, doesn't mean that I don't love you
Without you, there's no friendship
There's no friendship
There's no friendship
No friendship
