		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woe to me, battered man
Raise the monolith
Desensitize my spirit rise
Like days the world forgets
Down the drain, laid to lame
A fool-ass hearty bliss
Borderline suicide
Celebrate before my death

Your promised land divide
That's why the world lies

I give up
That's enough
I give up
I'm underneath my life

Dog in heat, beware the street
It's there you'll meet your end
Poverty is not for me
But I'll take her back again
To prove a point, to laugh it off
To cross you off my path
Grip the night, pull the cord
A much inspired wrath

Your promised land divide
That's where the world lies
Your promised land divide
That's where the world lies

I give up
That's enough
I give up
I'm underneath my life

Give up
That's enough
Give up
Give up

I give up
That's enough
I give up
I'm underneath my life

I give up
That's enough
Fucking give up
I'm underneath my life

I'm underneath my life
I'm underneath my life

Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
Carry me back from the war
