		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My, my
At Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh yeah
And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo 

My, my
I tried to hold you back but you were stronger
Oh yeah
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo

So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo, ooh
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo, finally facing my Waterloo, ooh
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
