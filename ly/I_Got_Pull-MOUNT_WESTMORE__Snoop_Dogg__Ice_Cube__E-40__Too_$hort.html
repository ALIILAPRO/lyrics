		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mount Westmore is in the house, baby (yeah, yeah)
And we want y'all to know that we got pull (ayo, 40)
I mean that real pull
You know the plug, the connect, baby

In and out, out and in
Get with the Dogg if you wanna win
Set the records while I set the trend
Show you how the boss ball
Dip it and bend around the corner with gangster shit
Drop it and hit the switch
Pull up to the homie house, smoke a little bit
Off to the city
Grind more times gettin' gritty
Got a lot of pull, nigga, get with me
Dark tint on the Bentley
Never no scent
But I'm simply the best nigga to leave a nigga empty
Now I got fifty, knockin' at your front door, jumpin'
You don't wanna start nothin', don't temp me
OG, the BG, you on the clock, don't sleep
Young homies owe you and they roll deep
I got the gold hammer pointed at your gold teeth
Two-eleven homicide, blame it on the police

I got pull
I got friends everywhere I go
I got pull
I don't wait, I walk right in the door
I got pull
Best seat in the house, how much that cost?
I got pull
If you don't know me, go ask your boss

Ice Cube ain't a savage
Boy, I'm a god, this black magic
You a fa√ßade, I'm back at it
You a mirage, I'm looking right at it
Blah-blah, blat it, opps get splatted
Musta didn't know that my life mattered
Rap addict, no, I ain't tatted
I don't advertise, I just mobilize
I help niggas realize who they really are
Make 'em feel high
I'm on my way to the Bay
With bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay, hey
Show Dogg is on a hog
And none of us really give a fuck about the law
We'd rather give it to you raw
And if you don't like it, we'll give it to your jaw

I got pull
I got friends everywhere I go
I got pull
I don't wait, I walk right in the door
I got pull
Best seat in the house, how much that cost?
I got pull
If you don't know me

Let the hustler through
(Talk your shit, man)
Wake up, man (wake up), wake up, man (wake up)
40 Water here with some brand new game
Like Excedrin, I'm all up in her brain (in her brain)
She think I'm a cloud, want me to make it rain (uh)
I'm extraordinary, not ordinary, your hearing is filled with elderberries
You want me to fucking get out, but I ain't gonna fuck off 
I got a girl, girl, leave me alone
Go get your mama, fuck your dad (fuck your dad)
I make here apologize every time I go bad (I'm sorry)
When I was 16 years old, straight dope game, I was told
Never get high off your supply (your supply, mm-hm)
Always look a human in the eye (in the eye, mm-hm)
Bitch, I'm the shit like a toilet bowl (uh)
The lady at the toll bridge pay my toll
I can light a blunt in a tornado (in a tornado)
Bitch, I got pull like a bungee cord (like a bungee cord)

I got pull
I got friends everywhere I go
I got pull
I don't wait, I walk right in the door
I got pull
Best seat in the house, how much that cost?
I got pull
If you don't know me, go ask your boss

That's my folks (folks)
We go way back
We was in these streets when you was still in the sack
In your daddy's nuts when your mama got fucked (yeah, I fucked here)
Now you tryna tell me what?
Shut up, don't say shit to me
I'm your OG's OG
The big homie, respect the game
Recognize me and don't forget my name

I got pull (bitch)
