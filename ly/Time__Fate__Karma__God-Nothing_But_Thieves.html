		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can call it what you want
It doesn't really matter
Had the sky under my control
The storm started to gather
The human condition
It's inevitable
I was on a roll
Then I heard you call
You've come for us all

Oh, is this what you want?
I've, I've been your plaything for so long
I'm on my knees, baby
So please
Do what you want with me
Just tell me when you're done

Am I supposed to play a fool?
Or are you trying to save me?
Oh no, now look what you made me do
You made me lose my baby
And don't give me room now
You're convenient when I fuck up again
But I was never sold
You come for us all

Oh, is this what you want?
I've, I've been your plaything for so long
I'm on my knees, baby
So please
Do what you want with me
Just tell me when you're done, yeah

Time, fate, karma, God, yeah
Death, sex, data, luck
Money, ego, fame
Time, fate, karma, God
Addict logic, nature, love
Death, sex, data, luck
Money, ego, fame
It comes for us all

Oh, is this what you want?
I've, I've been your plaything for so long
I'm on my knees, baby
So please
Do what you want with me
Just tell me when you're done
