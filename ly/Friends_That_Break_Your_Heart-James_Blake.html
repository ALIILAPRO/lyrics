		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've haunted many photographs
In the background, and the fore
And there's many loves that have crossed my path

In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
It was friends who broke my heart

What fair dues
Nobody prepares you
When nobody's prepared
Nobody's prepared
And they tell you, just you wait
It kills you when only love can break you
More, the more you care
And all and all in love is fair
But it's not fair

I've haunted many photographs
In the background, and in the fore
And there's many loves that have crossed my path

In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
It was friends who broke my heart

And I've pushed myself to be vulnerable
And then slept with one eye wide
All that pain and nothing gained in the end

In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
(In the end, in the end, in the end)
(In the end, in the end, in the end, in the end, in the end)

In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
In the end, it was friends
It was friends who broke my heart
