		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run boy run
Run
Run boy run
Run boy run
But you can't hife

Run boy run
But you can't hide
If I persist
There will be burning love you feel
So patiently
I plant my seed
And then you'll love my poison
Run boy run
But you can't hide
If I persist
There will be burning love you feel
So patiently
I plant my seed
And then you'll love my poison

Never have I ever
Felt this way before
Been touched so deep within
Have felt it in my core
Never have I ever
Met someone like you before
Just a tiny moment
Just a frequent look
But time and space collapsed
I know you felt it too
Time and space collapsed
I know you felt it too

Run boy run
But you can't hide
If I persist
There will be burning love you feel
So patiently
I plant my seed
And then you'll love my poison
Run boy run
But you can't hide
I will ignite a flame of burning love for me
I'll let you see
I'll make you see
How perfect you and me would be
