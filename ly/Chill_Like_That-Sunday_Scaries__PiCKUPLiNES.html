		  Like that
Like that
Like that
Like that

Let's dance
Didn't know you could move like that
Two step real smooth like that
All night get down like that
Turn around make it bounce like that

Didn't know you could hang like that
Sipping on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you would chill like that

Like that
Like that

Didn't know you could hang like that
Sipping on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you would chill like that

Like that
Like that

Didn't realize you were chill like that

Didn't know you could hang like that
Sipping on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you would chill like that

Like that
Like that
Like that 
Like that

Didn't know you could move like that
Two step real smooth like that
All night get down like that
Turn around make it bounce like that

Didn't know you could hang like that
Sipping on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you would chill like that

Like that (like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that)
Like that (like that, like that, like that, like that, like that, like that)
Like that

Didn't know you would chill like that

Like that
Like that

Didn't know you could hang like that
Sipping on champagne like that
Turn up get ill like that
Didn't know you would chill like that

Like that
Like that
Like that
Like that
