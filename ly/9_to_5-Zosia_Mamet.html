		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crimp, what are you doing?
Why are you always hovering?
Uh, I'm standing?
Well, be a good little assistant and go stand in the corner
Oh, yes, um
Oh, dear, I think this is kind of a corner?
Okay, I cannot with her
It's really too much

Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
And folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss don't seem to let me
Sometimes, I swear, I swear they're out to get me
