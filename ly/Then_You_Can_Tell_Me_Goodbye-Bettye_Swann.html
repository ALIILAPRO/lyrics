		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kiss me each morning for a million years
Hold me each evening by your side
Tell me you love me for a million, a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye

Sweeten my coffee with a morning kiss (du ru du du)
Soften my dreams with your sigh (sigh)
And after you've loved me for a million, a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me, tell me goodbye

If you must go, baby, I won't grieve
But just wait a lifetime
Before you leave, mmh, mmh

Then if you must go (du ru du du)
I won't tell you no, no, no (du ru du du)
But just so that we can say that we tried (tried)
Oh baby, tell me you love me for a million, a million years
Then if it don't work out
Then if it don't work out
Then you can tell me goodbye
Then you can tell me (then you can tell me)
You can tell me goodbye (du ru du du), mmh
(Du ru du du)
Tell me goodbye
