		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sky is high
And perfectly clear
The wind's blowing
Everything looks clearly
But my heart is in a mist
The world is full of wonder

There was something sad
It beat me up
It was so tough
that I could not get over it
I hated even the God
But,
To know the pain of others,
You must know it by yourself
Even this deep sadness
Is irreplaceable
Many kinds of feelings
Make your heart
Many kinds of people
The world goes around
Oh! I cannot stop wondering
That's all right
Red, orange, yellow and green
Purple, sky blue and blue
Those colors are becoming one
Shining light is born and
makes the field bright
Everything is needed
Everything has meanings
In this wonder land
Everybody can be a hero
Everybody
can be a brave of your story

Somebody talked about my back
Sometimes I felt lonely
And hurt my friends
But, don't worry,
Everybody feels uneasy
Everybody is different
Oh! I cannot stop wondering
That's all right
Black, gray, silver and gold
I have lots of color inside
But that's all right
So, that is why
human is beautiful so much,
Don't you think?
Red, orange, yellow and green
Purple, sky blue and blue
Those colors are becoming one
Shining light is born and
makes the field bright
Everything is needed
Everything has meanings
In this wonder land
Everybody can be a hero
Everybody
can be a brave of your story
Many kinds of people and
many kinds of feelings
Many kinds of colors
like a rainbow
Many kinds of people and
many kinds of feelings
This world is full of wonder
