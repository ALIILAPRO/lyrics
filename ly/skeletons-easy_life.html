		  Skeletons

I've been going out of my mind
'Cause you're giving me way too much adrenaline, hold the line
I heard a little bump in the night
Although it's good on paper, on occasion we collide, we collide
Skeletons

I'm finding it hard to pass the time without you (skeletons)
You spell it all out in black and white, I'm down

You've got something dark that I like
But I can't quite put my pinkie on it
Got a good appetite for a bad reputation

But I don't wanna be just another one of your (skeletons)
Six feet deep like (skeletons)
Could've been so sweet but (skeletons)
Fasten your seatbelts
Call the police when I start to believe it (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got (skeletons)
One at a time, they all appear

Your cards close to your chest (chest)
You tell me that it's all for the best (best)
Just rumors from losers
What I don't know can't hurt me, I guess
I feel the need to question your past
Like how many exes you've had
Our future's all kombucha
But we never trust the weather forecast

I'm finding it hard to pass the time without you (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You spell it all out in black and white, I'm down

You've got something dark that I like
But I can't quite put my pinkie on it
Got a good appetite for a bad reputation

But I don't wanna be just another one of your (skeletons)
Six feet deep like (skeletons)
Could've been so sweet but (skeletons)
Fasten your seatbelts
Call the police when I start to believe it (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got (skeletons)
One at a time, they all appear

But I don't wanna be just another one of your (skeletons)
You're six feet deep like (skeletons)
Could've been so sweet but (skeletons)
Better fasten your seatbelts
call the police when I start to believe it (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got (skeletons)
Everybody 'round here's got
Skeletons
