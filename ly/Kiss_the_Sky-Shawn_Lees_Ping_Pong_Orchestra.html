		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hold my head up just enough to see the sky
And when we go we won't go slow we'll put up such a fight
When they fade into the dust and into ash
But all children know this pain will surely pass
Strong and wise and you are love
And When the tide it come you will float above and
And you will be one day exactly what you are
Just keep your head up high kiss your fist and touch the sky

Too late to keep the world from dying this time
Too late to spread the love you have
One day when we are ready for crying
One day I know that we'll be there

Too Late

The sound we hear it is our hearts they are the time
They're marching clear and swift the beat forever in our mind
It gives us hope it gives us strength you know to carry on
Keep fighting till the end and past the end you will be strong

Too late to keep the world from dying this time
Too late to spread the love you shared
And one day, ooh, we'll all be there

Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Yes we will
