		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can you say to remind me
How to be loved by you?
Wave to the winding
River, it's a view of you

For the long grass growing in silence
There's an equal knowing inside us
Calmly showing for to guide us

Pray you can find me
I've been busy turning into
More transparent
I could look a lot like you

For the sharp glass cutting of the cold wind
The sharp glass losing of your best friend
The story bruising as it's written

Rain in your bedroom
This is how I love you back
To follow the red moon
Follow her and never look back

There's a star that's glowing on your eyelash
And the wet light moaning as we rehash
Oh my darling
What can you say to remind me
How to be loved by you?
