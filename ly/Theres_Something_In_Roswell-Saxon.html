		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fire in the sky over New Mexico
An alien crash, we'll never know
The farmer and the cops were first on the scene
Finding strange metal among the debris
A strange silver disc is what they described
Searching through the wreckage looking for life
Keep it under wraps and keep it out of sight

There's something in Roswell
We don't believe the lies
There's something in Roswell
It's fallen from the sky

They said it was a balloon
But no one took the bait
Photos of the wreckage they told another fate
Manipulate the evidence that's the way to be
But you can't suppress interest

There's got to be something in Roswell
We don't believe the lies
There's something in Roswell
That's fallen from the sky

Over the years the questions remained
Conspiracies fanning the flames
What to believe, someone must know
Just tell the truth, you gotta let go
Too many clues hidden in sight
We're never going to stop or give up the fight
What happened that night in New Mexico
On the farmers' ranch you know

There's something in Roswell
We don't believe the lies
There's something in Roswell
It's fallen from the sky

There's something in Roswell (Roswell, Roswell)
We won't give up the fight
There's something in Roswell (Roswell, Roswell)
That fell to Earth that night
Roswell (Roswell, Roswell)
There's something in Roswell (Roswell, Roswell)
Roswell
