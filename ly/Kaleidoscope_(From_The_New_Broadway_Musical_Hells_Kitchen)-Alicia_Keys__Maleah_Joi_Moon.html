		  Kaleido-leido-leido-leido-leidoscope
Tonight is shining bright, you know, oh yeah, oh no
So light it, light it, light it, light it, light it up
Put it in the air and let it go, oh yeah, oh no

Can you feel the love now?
I'm feelin' a buzz now
Never gonna come down
Piece it all together
Nights like this, they belong in the Guinness
Nights like this, never want them to finish

Don't wait for the end, let's start a beginning
Better to be alive than just to be living
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (woo)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (Ali)

Kaleido-leido-leido-leido-leidoscope
Everyone looking high and low, oh yeah, oh no
You're movin', movin', movin', movin' way too slow
I think I got that antidote, oh yeah, oh no, huh

Can you feel the love now?
I'm feelin' a buzz now
Never wanna come down
Piece it all together
Nights like this, they belong in the Guinness
Nights like this, never want them to finish

Don't wait for the end, let's start a beginning
Better to be alive than just to be living (c'mon)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (yeah, ooh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na (ooh)
Don't wait for the end, let's start a beginning

Ooh, ooh
Yeah

You just open up your eyes
Don't let the colors fool you, baby
It's been inside you all this time, mm
Feel so good when it's all out (all out)
Runnin' through the dark 'til the sun's out (sun's out)
Baby, I'm ready for the fallout (fallout)
I don't know what to say, ayy, ayy
It's a kaleidoscope
I see your colors, baby (no, oh)
Make a kaleidoscope
With all your colors (I don't know what to say)
It's a kaleidoscope (hey)
I see your colors, baby
Make a kaleidoscope (yeah, yeah, oh)
With all your colors (baby)
It's a kaleidoscope
I see your colors, baby (I see your colors, baby)
Make a kaleidoscope (baby)
With all your colors (baby, baby)
It's a kaleidoscope
I see your colors, baby
Make a kaleidoscope
With all your colors

Don't wait for the end, let's start a beginning
Better to be alive than just to be living
