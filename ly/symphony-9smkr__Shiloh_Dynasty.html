		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
She's a goddess a wish from the stars
In my heart, oh yeah

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you in my heart, oh yeah

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you a symphony
Won't you kiss me? Shut me up please
