		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's summertime
Ladies looking hot
Shaking up what they've got
Elephant Man and Kat, c'mon

Kat

Sense is telling me you're looking
I can feel it on my skin (Whoaa)
Boy I wonder what would happen
If I trip and let you in
Don't get shook by my aggression
I just might be the one
Let's skip this conversation
Just whine your body up

(Ha ha ha)
Don't wanna wait no more
(Ha ha ha)
You got what I'm searching for

I'm feeling your vibing
I'm riding high its exotic
And I want you, I want you here
Pull me closer and closer
and hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you, I wanna feel you near (whoo)

Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!

A ese nene lo tengo trikiao
Cuando lo bailo lo bailo de lao (oye)
Y lo empujo lo tengo tumbao
Con mis caderas lo tengo amansao wind!

Boy keep doing what you're doing, get me hot
Winding up your body you don't have to stop
My temperature is rising, want you more than before
It's an animal attraction, whine your body up

(Ha ha ha)
It's the magic on the floor
(Ha ha ha)
I don't wanna wait no more

'Cause I'm feeling your vibing
I'm riding high its exotic
And I want you (and I want you too)
I want you (and I want you too) here
Pull me closer and closer (closer and closer)
and hold me tight to your body
I wanna feel you (I wanna feel you too), I wanna feel you near (whoo)

Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!

My Dear, whine up your body bring it to me right here
She got the finest body I swear
Shake off your booty, shift it in high gear
She says ele run your fingers through my hair
All the blind man could see quite clear
The way she whines it gives me nightmares
Find har G-spot and touch har right there
Wah pop off di clothes she a wear

(Woah woah woah woah woah)
It's risin'
(Woah woah woah woah woah) Give me the whine now!

C'mon!

Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!
Whine up, whine up, whine up, oyea!

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
Loca e que ta, lo cuero
toca los cueros

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cueros

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cueros

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cuero

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cuero

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cuero

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cuero

Lo cuero, toca los cueros (whine up, whine up, whine up)
toca los cuero
