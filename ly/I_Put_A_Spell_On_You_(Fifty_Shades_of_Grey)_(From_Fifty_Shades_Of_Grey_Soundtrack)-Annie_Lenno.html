		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You better stop the things you do
I tell ya I ain't lyin'
I ain't lyin'

You know I can't stand it
You're runnin' around
You know better daddy
I can't stand it 'cause you put me down
Oh no

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You know I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you anyhow
And I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine

You know I can't stand it
Your running around
You know baby daddy
I can't stand it
'Cause you put me down

Ooh I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Because you're mine

Because you're mine
Oh yeah
