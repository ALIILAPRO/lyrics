		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Demon out the depths they betta not fuck with me
Reanimated deadly flesh is the only thing that's left of me
Knives up in my back and I never trustin' y'all with me
I'm bringin' up death with me this time and bitch you 'bout to see

I stay in my sarcophagus, this is my necropolis
I'm peepin' right through the oculus, not fuckin' 'round with the populous 
I think they might be conscienceless
And I don't have no time for this, I wish I anonymous, but I'm opposite
I'm Ghostface when it's dark again

All these bridges that been burned they 'bout to light the path
I heard you talkin' from the side just know I got yo ass
You talkin' hot right from the bench but I know I you keep it warm
And you never bust no gat never been to fuckin' war-ah

Yeah, leavin' mothafuckas with the maggots, automatic I'm attackin'
I ain't never been too passive with the words and
I don't really give a fuck about what you accomplish 
I been killin' shit for years lil bitch I know my worth
'Cause I always been around and I'm the Alpha, the Omega
The beginning and the end I'm finna make the world burn
And I'm dumpin' out the mag into yo back you feel the wrath 
I lay him flat up on the ground and he get no rebirth now what?

Poppin' a couple pills make 'em like me
Got her sugar daddy mad, he wanna fight me
Soundin' dead up on a track it don't excite me
Talkin' about how you the best but you ain't like me

Machine gun a flow I'm finna run that
Man, the myth, the legend but you know that
If shawty ass fat, I'm finna hold that
30 round mag I'm finna dump that what?

Yeah, 30 round dump that what?
30 round dump that, what?

Demon out the depths they betta not fuck with me
Reanimated deadly flesh is the only thing that's left of me
Knives up in my back and I never trustin' y'all with me
I'm bringin' up death with me this time and bitch you 'bout to see

I stay in my sarcophagus, this is my necropolis
I'm peepin' right through the oculus, not fuckin' 'round with the populous 
I think they might be conscienceless
And I don't have no time for this, I wish I anonymous, but I'm opposite
I'm Ghostface when it's dark again lil' bitch
