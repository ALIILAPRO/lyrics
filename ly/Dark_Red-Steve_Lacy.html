		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something bad is 'bout to happen to me 
I don't know what, but I feel it coming 
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running 
I just hope she don't wanna leave me 

Don't you give me up, please don't give up 
On me, I belong with you and only you, baby 
Only you, my girl, only you, babe 
Only you, darling, only you, babe 
Only you, my girl, only you, babe 
Only you, darling, only you

Something bad is 'bout to happen to me 
Why I feel this way, I don't know maybe 
I think of her so much, it drives me crazy 
I just don't want her to leave me 
Don't you give me up, please don't give up 
On me, I belong with you, and only you, baby 
Only you, my girl, only you, babe 
Only you, darling, only you, babe 
Only you, my girl, only you, babe 
Only you, darling, only you 

What if she's fine? 
It's my mind that's wrong 
And I just let bad thoughts 
Linger for far too long 
What if (if), she's fine? (Fine) 
It's my mind that's wrong 
And I just (just), let bad thoughts (thoughts) 
Linger for far too long 

Don't you give me up, please don't give up 
On me, I belong with you and only you, baby 
Only you, my girl, only you, babe 
Only you, darling, only you, babe 
Only you, my girl, only you, babe 
Only you, darling, only you
