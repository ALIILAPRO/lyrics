		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born as a rider
Left it all behind ya
Invisible freedom
An illusion
The road it took my life away
Took the light from the day
So queen of the highway
When are you coming to save me

This world of freedom
Invisible illusion
Oooh just how they use them
In this world of perfection
Oooh this world of freedom
Invisible illusion
Just how they use them
In this world world of perfection
So queen of the highway
When are you coming to save me
So queen of the highway
When are you coming to save me

To save me
To save me
To save me

Born as a rider
Left it all behind ya
Invisible freedom
An illusion

So queen of the highway
When are you coming to save me

The road it took my life away
Took the light from the day
I was a rolling stone for so long
Couldn't find my way home
I was lost in a track or two
Between time and you
So queen of the highway
When are you coming my way
One day...one day
