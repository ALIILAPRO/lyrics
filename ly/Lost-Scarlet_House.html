		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a drink
I don't wanna think at all
I'd rather drown
In smoke colored clouds

Just to fill the void
I would do
Anything at all
Just to never feel this lost
Don't wanna face the noise
I would do
Anything at all
So I never feel this lost

Give me some space
I don't wanna chase you off
Once again
Running towards the end
Just to start again
I gave up holding on

Just to fill the void
I would do
Anything at all
Just to never feel this lost
Don't wanna face the noise
I would do
Anything at all
So I never feel this lost
