		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop, love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it, or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop, love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Lost on me

Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full stop, love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lost on me, ooh
Graffiti on the overpass
