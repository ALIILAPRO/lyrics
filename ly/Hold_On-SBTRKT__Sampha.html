		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

How'd you mean?, What do you mean you're not coming by?
I called you later and you were outside
It always screams screams inside my head
Curtains closed you'd be beside my head
You were always down for it
Get in this getaway and we run from it
Yeah, you were always down for it
Get in this getaway and we run from it

You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the

You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the
Why don't we turn the leaf? Why don't we turn the

What you've done, what you've done you can't keep inside
By the end of the night I'll help you confide
'Cause I can see, see your sad self
'Cause I can see you're not being yourself
'Cause usually you're down for it
Can't hold back a smile when you try for it
Yeah, cause usually you're down for it
Can't hold back a smile when you try for it

You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me

You're giving me the coldest stare
Like you don't even know I'm here
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me
Why don't you let me sing? Why don't you let me

Whatever done, However bad, Hold on hold on hold on
Whatever done, However bad, Hold on hold on hold on
Whatever it is, However bad, Hold on hold on hold on
Hold on hold on hold on, hold on hold on hold on

Why don't
