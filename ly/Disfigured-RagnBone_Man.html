		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't give up the ghost
Or cut the rope
That tugs you down

If you're walking comatose
Obliged to cope
To follow the crowd

Well long live all those lies
You tell yourself
You'll be alright

But there's no kiss goodbye
And only the end
And only the night

I pictured it like you did
Selfishly, I thought you'd spare the time
The ones I loved the most
Disfigured it all
The beautiful life

Well long live all those lies
You tell yourself
That you'll be alright

But there's no kiss goodbye
And only the end
And only the night

It's a cold way to go
To the hollow below
It's a cold way to go
To the hollow below
It's a cold way to go
To the hollow below
It's a cold way to go
To the hollow below
It's a cold way to go
To the hollow below
It's a cold way to go
To the hollow below

Well long live all those lies
You tell yourself
That you'll be alright

And there's no kiss goodbye
And only the end
And only the night
