		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silk on your dress
Fingerprints on your neck
I'm a prince, I'm a king
I'm the fall, I'm the spring
I'm your
Favourite thing
(I'll be your favourite thing)
It's a
Dangerous thing
(I'll be your dangerous thing)

Dig deep baby, dig deep
I've been waiting for this shit all week
I've been waiting for this shit all year
And right now I seem to lack fear so
Ooh, she eyeing the bottle
I pour up a cup
She pushin' the throttle
She swear it's the molly
You look like a model
Belong in Bugatti
So are you my shawty?
Tell me girl are you my shawty
I swear that I boss up
I'm running up numbers
I swear that I got up, up out of my slumber
Up out of my sleep
Out of this sleep I been in
Up out of this sleep

Silk on your dress
Fingerprints on your neck
I'm a prince, I'm a king
I'm the fall, I'm the spring
I'm your
Favourite thing
(I'll be your favourite thing)
It's a
Dangerous thing
It's a
Dangerous thing
(Why you so dangerous?)
It's a
Dangerous thing
(Why you so dangerous?)
(Why you so dangerous?)

Baby tonight all the angels are blind
Locks on the door
And them clothes on the floor
Stars can align
As I pray for a sign
Peace of mind

Silk on your dress
Fingerprints on your neck
I'm a prince, I'm a king
I'm the fall, I'm the spring
Yeah
