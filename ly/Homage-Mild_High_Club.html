		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone wrote this song before
And I could tell you where it's from
The 4-7-3-6-2-5-1
To put my mind at ease

Please just have a laugh with me
'Cause you know I'm borrowing
By now these sounds
Have already crowned
Come on, it's a silly dream
Dreamin' of the imagery
Unfound, the view
Sits nice from that cloud

And if you want
A piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flippin'
Why don't you toss?

Sits nice from that cloud

And if you want
A piece of my thoughts
There's a coin worth flippin'
