		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I'm sure Fort Worth has seen it's share of heartached
But it's plain to see your heart's not broken now
You're in love with someone new and up on top of the world
You say you've seen the last of the lonely side of town

But if you're ever down in Dallas, darlin'
Wonderin' what to do
Just call on me, 'cause I've been there too
Maybe I could help
"Cause I know so well how it hurts to lose at love
If you're ever down in Dallas, look me up

Well, I gave up on our love and left you cryin'
But there's times we all make choices that we regret
So if you wind up lonely 'cause you've made the same mistake
I can take you all the places a fool goes to forget

But if you're ever down in Dallas, darlin'
Wonderin' what to do
Just call on me, 'cause I've been there too
Maybe I could help
"Cause I know so well how it hurts to lose at love
If you're ever down in Dallas, look me up
If you're ever down in Dallas, look me up
