		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This information is for everyone
I've never had my chance for much too long
I'm sick of buyin' lots of jewelry
No matter if it's Rome or Tennessee

Cause i want to get in touch
With the man i miss so much
An' you should guarantee day by day

Innocent love
You need my innocent love
My innocent love tonight
You can't get enough
You can stay by my side
An' give me everything
Innocent boy
You need me, innocent boy
My innocent boy tonight
You can't get enough
You can stay by my side
An' show me everything
This information's for the borin' man
He's not in love, he's playin' just a game
I won't give up myself in luxury
Don't want to let him drown my ecstasy

Cause i want to get in touch
With the man i miss so much
An' you should guarantee day by day

Innocent love
You need my innocent love
My innocent love tonight
You can't get enough
You can stay by my side
An' give me everything
Innocent boy
You need me, innocent boy
My innocent boy tonight
You can't get enough
You can stay by my side
An' show me everything
