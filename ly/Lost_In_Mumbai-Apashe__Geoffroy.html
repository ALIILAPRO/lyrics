		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try to tell myself the bet is on you (I)
After waiting under cover
I should know better
Thought I knew better
Too many
Too many times
Ever been the one to draw the line
Too many
Too many times
Ain't enough yet to change my mind (say)

I'm lost
I'm fallin'
I'm slippin' off
I'm caught in

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost

Hazy space, runnin' on addictions
Caught in daze, fading away
But it comes and goes
It's easier to cross
Than open doors
Though it takes its toll on you

Can't cover for it
To simplify
I'm letting on a-
A new light
Can't cover for it
Not sympathize
Done working on a
Camouflage

I'm lost
I'm fallin'
I'm slippin' off
I'm caught in

I'm lost
I'm lost
I'm lost
