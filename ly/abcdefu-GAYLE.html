		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you and your mom
And your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car
And that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all fuck off

I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends askin' questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anythin' for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you
But I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through
So let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car
And that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all fuck off

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E F you

You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say, you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you
But I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through
So let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your Craigslist couch
And the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all fuck off

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E F off
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
A-B-C-D-E F you

And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car
And that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends
That I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog
You can all fuck off
