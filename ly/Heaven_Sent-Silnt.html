		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way the light blends
When its touching your skin
Your body glistens
Like you were heaven-sent
You seen the vision
Of what's gon' happen next
Not artificial
I'm as real as it gets
And those issues
In the past
Baby, we could forget
I wanna feel how you felt... so immaculate!
And when I'm witchu
You make me wanna sin
You took me instead of him
You seen something in me
I'ma take you for the night baby
You don't worry bout the time baby
Get some drinks and see what happens
We can do what happened last time baby
Get some drank, we turning up
We could do whatever we really want
We about to go to go right now...
She wanna see the beast mode right now!
I just wanna create a story
Live to tell the tale and glory
Earn the finer things
That I know that I could reach
To be this perfect to me it seems, baby, it means that I adore you
Adore you!
The way the light blends
When its touching your skin
Your body glistens
Like you were heaven-sent
You seen the vision
Of what's gon' happen next
Not artificial
I'm as real as it gets
And those issues
In the past
Baby, we could forget
I wanna feel how you felt... so immaculate!
And when I'm witchu
You make me wanna sin
You took me instead of him
You seen something in me
