		  (La-di-da-di-da)
Yeah
(La-di-da-di-da) let's go and get it

Look, I say they sleep, ayy, don't sleep on me
I'm a whole beast, the whole scene in fear
This is my feast, I cooked 'em again
These rookies will swear, I don't know or care
What it feels like to be at the bottom
They must've forgotten
I broke out of all these broke problems
Just read through the columns
They taintin' the picture
But don't ask who shot 'em
I swerve all the gossip

Uh, uh, I know I'm wanted like the posters
Pull my cards out, ain't no jokers
They try to stop me but it's hopeless
There's no controllin'
You should've known, it's a

Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Elevate, elevate (shots, shots, shots)
Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Let it spray, let it spray
Watch me, I'ma run the game

Renegade's 'bout to get this started
Let 'em sing like the birds in the morning
Light a flame in the darkness
Renegade

Rebel nation, no patience, I'm an alien
This my spaceship, these routes that I'm takin'
Never basic, let haters stay hating
No debatin', I'm a fan favorite
Make 'em sizzle, baby, watch me fry
Watch the smoke rise up to the sky
Got more for sure, you dread it
Want war? Of course, I'm ready

Uh, uh, I know I'm wanted like the posters
Pull my cards out, ain't no jokers
They try to stop me but it's hopeless
There's no controllin'
You should've known, it's a

Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Elevate, elevate (shots, shots, shots)
Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Let it spray, let it spray
Watch me, I'ma run the game

Renegade's 'bout to get this started
Let 'em sing like the birds in the morning
Light a flame in the darkness
Renegade

Got my plateful
Light a small fire
Keep it playful
Don't trip, don't trip
Okay, throwin' shade
What you sayin', what you sayin'?
I don't mind
I see it in their face, I see in their eyes
They about to tell a lie

Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Elevate, elevate (shots, shots, shots)
Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Let it spray, let it spray
Watch me, I'ma run the game
Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Elevate, elevate (shots, shots, shots)
Renegade, renegade (but I'm tryna)
Let it spray, let it spray
Watch me, I'ma run the game

Renegade's 'bout to get this started
Let 'em sing like the birds in the morning
Light a flame in the darkness

Renegade
