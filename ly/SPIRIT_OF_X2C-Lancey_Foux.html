		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If there's anything that I know
If there's anything that I know, it's the spirit of ecstasy, ecstasy
If there's anything I know, I need you right here next to me, next to me
I need you right now, here in my arms
Spirit of ecstasy, ecstasy (ecstasy), oh-oh
Spirit of ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy (oh-oh)
And the spirit of love (oh-oh)
No more wishin' for love, oh-oh (oh-oh)

I know you've been wishin' on a star
Top boy, she give me michelin star
I know when you caught me in a glance
I know you put the molly in a glass, yeah
I know you wanna take some more
If you're riding then you're dying then you might as well
Take some more
I've decided, I've decided
I'ma ride for myself, stop tryna save the world
This is life in hell

If there's anything that I know
If there's anything that I know, it's the spirit of ecstasy, ecstasy
If there's anything I know
I need you right now, here in my arms (yeah, yeah)
Spirit of ecstasy (ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy)
(And the spirit of love, ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy)
And the spirit of love, love, love, love, love, love
No more wishin' for love, love, love, love, love (no more wishin' for love, yeah, no more wishin')
Spirit of ecstacy

No more wishin' for
No, no
No more wishin' for love, no more wishin' for love
Wishin' for love
