		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember this, girls
None of you can be first, but all of you can be next
Woo, woo

Ah, uh, yeah, uh
Wow, uh, yeah, uh
Wow, uh, yeah
It's like takin' candy from a baby
Wow, uh, yeah, uh
Ah, uh, ayy, uh
Yeah, uh, wow
It's like takin' candy from a (ride a, ride a)

Ride a coattail, this isn't my fourth meal
Dishes on my ass, still I'm thicker than some oatmeal
Glass houses, I don't really like to keep my stones there
Oh, well, I'll buy another property for four mill'
Doorman said that you gon' have to leave your phones there
On a boat, yeah (boat, yeah), it's really no fair (no fair)
The only problem that I have and I'll be so real
I hit the stage and lose the crystals on my toenails (yeah)
Make the ho kneel, she kill it like an O'Neil
Makin' mo' bills 'til I copped the mobile
Can't drive 'cause I really don't need to
Got some professionals, they're really nice people

Ah, uh, yeah
Uh, wow, uh, yeah
Uh, wow, uh, yeah
It's like takin' candy from a baby
Uh (mh), wow (yeah, huh), yeah (uh)
Uh, wow, uh, yeah
Uh, wow, uh (huh, said), wow
It's like takin' candy from a baby

So easy, so cheesy, so fresh
So queasy, so nauseous, so sick (blegh)
Is it coke? Is it crack? Is it meth? (Is it?)
What the fuck do she put in them hits?
I'm the shit, you a real piece of shit
I am needed, you a real needy bitch
I'm competing, you are incompetent
You are fleeting 'cause you can't copy this
Copy this (copy this), copy that (copy that)
Every bitch that is here copycat (rawr)
Copy the greats, that's my number one strategy
But beware that you can't copy stats

Ah, uh, yeah
Uh, wow, uh, yeah
Uh, wow, uh, yeah
It's like takin' candy from a baby
Uh, wow, uh, yeah
Uh, ha, uh, ayy
Uh, yeah, uh, wow
It's like takin' candy from a baby
