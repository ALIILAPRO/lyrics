		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jumped in a whip that you never seen (ARIZONATEARS)
It got bulletproof glass and a ceiling screen (ARIZONATEARS)
"Let me guess, it cost you like a hundred thousand?"
No, little bitch, it cost seven beans (vyoom)
I'm doin' what you do in your dreams
I fucked your bitch pussy, Vaseline (yeah)
These bitches always wan' capture me
Hatin' ass nigga turn me to meme (yeah)
Fucked all y'all bitches like ten of me
On the real it was just me and Mean (yeah)
We don't know how tall your girlfriend is
When we saw her, she was on her knees (yeah)
I cannot get tired of money
But this money, it will turn people right into greed (one, two, yeah)
I know he sick of my money (one, two, three)
'Cause every time he call you (let's go), he wish that he called for me (yeah)

Benjamins sittin' in my left, right pocket, watch this
These niggas broke boys, watch this, watch this (let's go)
These niggas broke boys, watch this, watch this (watch)
I can make the whole crowd mosh pit, watch this (woo)
I can make your bitch wanna stop and watch this (watch)
I can make your bitch wanna stop then pop it (pop)
I ain't even drop no songs, still poppin'
I stay with a whole lotta (woo)
Benjamins sittin' in my left, right pocket, watch this
These niggas broke boys, watch this, watch this (let's go)
These niggas broke boys, watch this, watch this (watch)
I can make the whole crowd mosh pit, watch this (let's go)
I can make your bitch wanna stop and watch this (watch)
I can make your bitch wanna stop then pop it (whoa)
I ain't even drop no songs, still poppin'
I stay with a whole lotta (baow)

Bustas, Lil Uzi stay on some mob shit, stop it
All these drugs keep fucking with my conscience
How you from my hood, but you still on some opp shit?
Time gon' tell, fuck niggas get popped quick
Grabbin' on Lil Uzi, yeah, that's a lose on lose (let's go)
I keep changing my clothes dependin' on my mood, yeah
I keep changing my hoes, same way I'm changin' my shows, yeah
I keep changing my poles, but I'm not changin' my shows
Niggas, they goin' outside like a hall, 'cause they not following rules (at all)
No matter in the world where I'm gon' go, I never tuck in my jewels (jewels, yeah)

Benjamins sittin' in my left, right pocket, watch this (let's go)
These niggas broke boys (let's go), watch this, watch this (yeah)
These niggas broke boys, watch this, watch this
I can make the whole crowd mosh pit, watch this (let's go)
I can make your bitch wanna stop and watch this
I can make your bitch wanna stop then pop it (whoa)
I ain't even drop no songs, still poppin'
I stay with a whole lotta (baow)
Benjamins sittin' in my left, right pocket, watch this
These niggas broke boys (let's go), watch this, watch this
These niggas broke boys, watch this, watch this
I can make the whole crowd mosh pit, watch this (woo)
I can make your bitch wanna stop and watch this (let's go)
I can make your bitch wanna stop then pop it (whoa)
I ain't even drop no songs, still poppin'
I stay with a whole lotta (Lil Uzi Vert)

Dead men on me, yeah, dead men on me, yeah (yeah)
She been feelin' me, 'cause I walked in with her rent on me (yeah)
In the sky, Percocet on me, yeah, you can feel on me, yeah
I'm not worried 'bout them, 'cause I got two big FN's on me (yeah)
Can you pop that thing 'til the mornin'?
When you pop that, smell no aroma
Don't want her like that, I don't own it
That's your little bitch, please don't disown her
I'ma keep throwing this money, bee
