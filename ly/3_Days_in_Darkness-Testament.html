		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a world polluted inside
Let's pretend the nightmare is done
From the earth the magma will rise
From the sea comes cancerous tides
From the meaning of life ends in prophecy
Premonitions bring tragedy
Is the hope for humanity

Molten fire flies through the sky
Burnin' high eclipse of the sun
Blackened skies rites of the night
The days in darkness in two thousand twelve

Mother Earth's been withered in time
Already dead and we didn't even know it
Watch the stars to give us a sign
From above all the angels descend
The meanin' of life ends in agony
Raped by impurities
Not a chance for humanity

Molten fire flies through the sky
Burnin' high eclipse of the sun
Blackened skies rites of the night
The days in darkness in two thousand twelve

Magma splits the earth and shifts below
Molten lava bursts and overflow
Rise as we wait, annihilate
Burnin' earth pulls to the sun
Rise as we wait, obliterate
Burnin' earth pulls to the sun
Three days of darkness in two thousand twelve

Mega cities still blaze in the night
Burnin' the ashes they choke
From the earth the magma will rise
Enveloped in poisonous smoke
So the meanin' of life ends in prophecy
Premonitions of tragedy
Still no hope for humanity

Molten fire flies through the sky
Burnin' high eclipse of the sun
Blackened skies rites of the night
The days in darkness in two thousand twelve
