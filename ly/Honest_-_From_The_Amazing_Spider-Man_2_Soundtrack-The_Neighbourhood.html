		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patience, test my patience.
If I made it too hard for you maybe you should've changed it.

Say it, you should say it,
'Cause I'd say I was wrong just to make it fill all the spaces.

Waiting, always waiting.
If I gave you control would you say that (We could've saved it?)

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday,
In weakness or in strength,
Change can be amazing.
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you.

I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me, with me
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me, with me

Chasing, always chasing dreams.
Why'd you stick around, why'd you stay with me?
Why'd you fake it?

Hesitation is killing me too.
But I couldn't save it, I couldn't save it.

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday,
In weakness or in strength,
Change can be amazing.
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you.

I hope you find a way to be yourself someday,
In weakness or in strength,
Change can be amazing.
So I pray for the best, I pray for the best for you.

I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me, with me
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me, with me
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest with me, with me
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest
I wish you could be honest, I wish you could be honest
