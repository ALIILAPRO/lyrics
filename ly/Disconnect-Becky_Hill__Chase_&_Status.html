		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't gonna lie to you
Life's been fuckin life-ing
And I need a night or two
To get me unwinding

I feel like I'm stuck cycles everyday
Come and get me out this loop
So just switch it up for me
It's time to get loose

If we disconnect
We ain't gotta be aligned
We can redirect
Everything that's on our minds, let it go
Change up your frequency and 
You'll see how easily you'll disconnect
From everything that's on your mind

Disconnect
From everything that's on your mind

Where's my fuckin' lighter crew?
Put 'em up high then
Now's the time to raise the roof
We don't need the fighting

When we're getting stuck in cycles everyday
We know how to make it through
So just switch it up for me
It's time to get loose

If we disconnect
We ain't gotta be aligned
We can redirect
Everything that's on our minds, let it go
Change up your frequency and 
You'll see how easily you'll disconnect
From everything that's on your mind

Oh-oh-oh, let it go
Oh-oh-oh, just let it go
Oh-oh-oh, let it go
Oh-oh-oh, just let it go
Oh-oh-oh, let it go
Oh-oh-oh, just let it go
Oh-oh-oh, let it go
Oh-oh-oh, just let it go
Change up your frequency and 
You'll see how easily you'll disconnect
From everything that's on your mind
