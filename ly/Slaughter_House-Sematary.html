		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haugh

I'll take you down to my slaughter house
Fuck the law, death to the cops
Fuck the world,  I'ma stay gone
I'll lay you down next to your dog
I'll take you down to my slaughter house
Fuck the law, death to the cops
Better start praying to God
Leave you on the hill by the cross

I got these cutters in a box
See me walking, I been lurking in the woods
In the dark
Off the RedBull and Bang, Super Creatine Mob
I'm from the house 'cross the bridge
On the hill with the cross
It follows 'til the end
Black Nazgûl in your yard
See the all white crosses
Watch 'em pass in the car
I put on my skin mask, run
You see me in the dark
I stay in my slaughter house
I stay in my toy barn
When you're driving in the night
Best not stop on my road
I keep a shiny gold knife
And I'm in Trevor mode
We stay in the old fields
Dark night of the scarecrow
I can never fuck with lames
You don't want me in your home
New girl in my slaughter house
You know how it's 'bout to go
She stay in the light, I
Walk among the tombstones, yeah
I am Sematary, take you where you need to go
I'll take you 'cross the Rainbow Bridge
Way down to the white shores (Ahh)

I'll take you down to my slaughter house
Fuck the law, death to the cops
Fuck the world, I'ma stay gone
I'll lay you down next to your dog
I'll take you down to my slaughter house
Fuck the law, death to the cops
Better start praying to God
Leave you on the hill by the cross (Ahhhh)

Sematary on the Rainbow Bridge
Ahhhh leave you on the hill by the cross
