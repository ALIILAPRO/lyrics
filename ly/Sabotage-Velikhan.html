		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White noise, sunrise, those eyes
Are trying to accept the daylight
Show Time
Secret skill just press and he'll be revealed
Don't you know
On a road to the freedom through the skulls
 
Blaow !!!
It's a sabotage
Heads up! take a move apart
 
That ride with the fugitive
All is bad in this captious deal
 
Trice a week run away the jail
Daily news lit red headlines about it
 
Crime
She had enough time
To Push me to the unforgivable
Crime
They had a great plan
To remove me later
But I still stand
 
Pow! Pow!
Take Shot!
 
That's fucked up shot
This is the fate of a nimble rat
Trice a week run away the jail
Daily news lit red headlines about it
 
White noise, sunrise, those eyes
Are trying to accept the daylight
Show Time
Secret skill just press and he'll be revealed
Don't you know
On a road to the freedom through the skulls
 
That ride with the fugitive
All is bad in this captious deal
That ride with the fugitive
All is bad in this captious deal

Change the name and brand of  a crime star
Forgetting who you made me after all
A Chance for new life the biggest desire
When I cash out my dead ex-friend's account
 
Forgetting who you made me after all
When I cash out my dead ex-friend's account 

That ride with the fugitive
All is bad in this captious deal
That ride with the fugitive
All is bad in this captious deal
