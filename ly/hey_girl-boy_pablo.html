		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girl, it's the first time
I've looked at somebody like this
And hey girl, I'm so nervous
You look so fine, you make me shiver like crazy

Say you want me now
I am scared as hell
Yeah, I don't even know if you are nervous, I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before, I don't know what to do

Hey girl, do you like me?
I guess that's a stupid-ass question
I'm asking 'cause I'm nervous
You look so fine, you make me shiver, oh

Say you want me now
'Cause I am scared as hell
Yeah, I don't even know if you are nervous, I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before I don't know what to do

Say you want me now
'Cause I am scared as hell
Yeah, I don't even know if you are nervous, I can't tell
Say you love me now
Please, I'm scared as hell
I've never been in love before I don't know what to do
