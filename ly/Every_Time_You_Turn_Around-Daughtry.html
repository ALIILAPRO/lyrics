		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ten miles from town
And I just broke down
Spitting out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone
Just trying to get home
To tell you I was wrong, but you already know
Believe me, I won't stop at nothing to see you
So I've started running

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
And I think that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked
The night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back
Of my mind
I must have been high
To say you and I weren't meant to be
And just wasting my time
Oh why did I ever doubt you
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
And I think that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong
There's no other one
After this time spent alone
It's hard to believe
That a man with sight could be so blind
Thinking about the better times
Must've been out of my mind
So I'm running back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you

And I think that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
I know there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you
No there's no life after you ya
