		  I want you right away
Two hands tied up, I make you work for me (I make you work for me)
Won't give you time of day, it can't be all on me (it can't be, it can't be, yeah, yeah)

I don't wanna wait, show me what you're made of
I don't wanna wait for you (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna wait, show me what you're made of (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna wait for you

Baby, I've been eyein' you way from a far (no uh, no uh, no way, yeah)
Baby, I've been eyein' you way from a far (no uh, uh, no way)
Baby, I've been eyein' you way from a far (no uh, uh, no way, uh)
Thanks for the props but to me you the star (no uh, uh, no way)

Front on me, yeah, ain't about it, baby
You ain't givin' nothin' I need
(Talk to me, girl)
I don't believe you when you say that you're a wild one
'Cause you ain't never make my love come down, baby
Yeah, you know that it's real when I say that I'm a wild one
'Cause you won't leave the same when I get done, baby (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I don't wanna wait, show me what you're made of
I don't wanna wait for you (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Baby, I've been eyein' you way from a far (no uh, no uh, no way, yeah)
Baby, I've been eyein' you way from a far (no uh, uh, no way)
Baby, I've been eyein' you way from a far (no uh, uh, no way, uh)
Thanks for the props but to me you the star (no uh, uh, no way)

I don't wanna wait, show me what you're made of
I don't wanna wait for you (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't wanna wait, if it, wait, if it, for you, want you, want you
I don't wanna wait, if it, wait, if it, for you, want you, want you
I don't wanna wait, if it, wait, if it, for you
I don't wanna wait, if it, wait, if it, want you, want you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
