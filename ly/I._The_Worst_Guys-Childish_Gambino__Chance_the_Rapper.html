		  All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some

At a Clippers' game on the court-side (side)
Watch a nigga shoot like a .45 (5)
They mad at me, too, I got more fire
Why these bitches see you? "Go home, Roger" (Go home, Roger)
Tia and Tamara in my bed, I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid (nah)
Hits on my list, check my archive
I'm something so immaculate
Instead of asking what's happenin' and rather blastin'
Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura, acting blacker
Than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playin' Playstation
Why you standin' there, say som'? Girl say som'
No, this ain't a vacation, this is my house, my house

All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some

All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some

Bought a new bath (bath), 8K, nigga (yuh)
Wanna take shots (shots)? Ak, nigga (yeah)
When I ball, I'ma ball King James, nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand, make change, nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang, nigga
That's a space bar, man, I hate y'all
You only come around when you want to play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage (yeah)
I had a m√©nage (yeah), I murdered the vag'
But afterwards, it was awkward as fuck (yeah)
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I-i-i-i-i need a minute, cold water to the face
I-i-i couldn't finish, got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor (yeah), hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors

All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some
All she needed was some

Oh God, oh my God, oh my God
Know tonight, our neighbors
They all alone, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no
All she needed was some
