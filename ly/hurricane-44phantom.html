		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I don't need a come down, it's all good
She only hits me up to fuck, now she's misunderstood
I even took her on a nice date, thought I should
It isn't perfect but we cool, 'cause she rolls my woods
And you know it's fine by me, if you lie to me
Got a lump in my chest, and a heart you can wreck
Come waste your time with me, getting high with me
So I can tell my fuckin' therapist I'm ripping out my hair again

I got a hurricane, it's inside of my head
And I can't feel a thing, but it's better than dead
I need a cigarette, just to take off the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, yeah
It doesn't take much, to feel this numb
To feel this bad, when you're this fucked up from
Another hurricane, going off in my head
My head, my head, my head, yeah

Give a fuck about nothing, babe
Only way that I'm not insane
I don't need you to understand
Recognize that we're not the same
I don't need you to hold me down
I don't need you to help me out
'Cause every time that I said that shit
You pretend like it's fine right now
When I was falling down, around your house
You thought it was an act, haven't seen me that bad
I was drunk and mad, it made you laugh
You finally found me and, baby, I'm drowning

I got a hurricane, it's inside of my head
And I can't feel a thing, but it's better than dead
I need a cigarette, just to take off the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, yeah
It doesn't take much, to feel this numb
To feel this bad, when you're this fucked up from
Another hurricane, going off in my head
My head, my head, my head, yeah

Girl, I'm done being scarred, didn't try too hard
And I think I need some space
'Cause it hurts I know, tryna let this go
But I don't want you to see me this way
Girl, I'm done being scarred, didn't try too hard
And I think I need some space
'Cause it hurts I know, tryna let this go
But I don't want you to see me this way, yeah

I got a hurricane, it's inside of my head
And I can't feel a thing, but it's better than dead
I need a cigarette, just to take off the edge
The edge, the edge, the edge, yeah
It doesn't take much (no), to feel this numb (no)
To feel this bad, when you're this fucked up from
Another hurricane, going off in my head
My head, my head, my head, yeah
