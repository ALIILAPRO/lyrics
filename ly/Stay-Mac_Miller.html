		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Yeah, wait up, hold on a motherfuckin' second
I know you stressin', you don't gotta keep me guessin'
I'm full of questions, in return I get the silence treatment
I don't know when I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say it's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'
Why you got me stressin'?
I could have a whole collection
Just be faded in my own dimension
You so complicated
I swear that pussy Grammy nominated
Let's make some music, fuck all of the bullshit

Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while

Okay now, baby, don't you leave my side, don't even try
I'mma go crazy, girl, you saved me, man, take me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines
Binge watched Sopranos, made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I, she had to come, see her freaky side
Leavin' me behind

Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Just a little while, just a little while, babe

The where you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gone go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh
All I think about is what I wanna do to you
I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gone go, girl?

Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a little while
Will you stay just a little while, babe?
Just a little while, just a little while, just a, just a little while
