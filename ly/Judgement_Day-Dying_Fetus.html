		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Worlds caving in around you
Thought you had it easy 'til they found you
What can I say, it's in your face
You were the one who did the crime
You'll be the one to pay
Your backs against the wall
Will you stand or will you fall
Judgement day
Judgement day
Judgement day
Worlds caving in around you
Thought you had it easy 'til they found you
What can I say, it's in your face
You were the one who did the crime
You'll be the one to pay
