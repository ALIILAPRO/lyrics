		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  featuring Yellaklaw 



"Watch out now!" 



Yea, yea.. uh-uh! 

Mm-mmm! 

Get money, get money! 

(Get, get money, get money) 

(Get, get money, get money) Uh-uh! 

(Get) GET MONEY, GET MONEY (get that money) 

(Get) GET MONEY, GET MONEY 

Yeah, GET MONEY, GET MONEY .. "Listen to the first verse" 



"Watch out now!" 



[Psycho Les] 

Aiyyo my song's on, I gotta get my grub on some to-to 

(I love dough-oh) Order three buckets of Mo'-Mo' 

We gettin more dough, off the books (you gettin gelly) 

Pullin more hoes off the looks (you gettin gelly) 

You wan' hate me? Cause your wifey, wants a autograph? 

From the look in her eyes, I can see she wants more than that 

When I see fat asses I make fat passes like quarterback 

Beatnuts is ALLA THAT, your shit, ALL THE WACK 

Open can-dela, if you foolin wit mah cheddah 

Hardrock, ever since, junior high suela 

Fly fella, takin my beats, to make your crowd get up 

I'm fed up, niggaz want to bring it -- WHATEVER! 

I'ma storm your pa-rade (pa-rade) blow your legs off 

with a gre-nade, now you flappin, like a mermaid 

Yappin off, bitch you cough at the lips 

while I'm at the bar, baggin, the bartender tips 

Then I bag this chick, with a, "Hi," and the eye 

She did the butterfly, rubbin her ass, against my buttonfly 

I could ALREADY imagine my shit stuck inside 

Everytime I strike, haters be like, "Dat fucking guy!" 



Chorus: Beatnuts + Yellaklaw 



How's that yo? It's hard for you to swallow 

It don't take much for us to let the metal holla 

Lead's bustin out of a old black Impala 

Thug nigga only fuck wit, muchacha malla 

Big Ju, dime lo conllo, how we do?, how we do? (How we do) 

(How the girl don't only love me, they love you!) 

Whatchu gonna do? (What, what, what?) 

Nigga whatchu gonna do? (What, yo) 



[JuJu] 

Here's to my pollyin niggaz who campaign 

To the killers who be lovin the chicas and champagne 

Thugs who get wild in the club and snatch chains 

Players who be pimpin the hoes with no brains 

Front watch a nigga get shot from close range 

The most range, crazy motherfucker won't change 

Beatnuts, forever diehard, you want pain? 

Cause you walkin outta here breathin is insane 

Flip a beat fast, you leave the club with a heat rash 

You got a weak stash, came in the club with a free pass 

I ain't even know they made a Roley for your cheap ass 

Makin me laugh, you was in jail wearin kneepads 

Now the beef has, gotten over your head 

It's over you dead, Ranger Rover, both of your legs 

til both of us said, platinum gettin took this year 

Cause for real, there ain't nothin but crooks in here, nigga 



Chorus -> Beatnuts last line "Whatcha gon' do when Beatnuts come through baby!" 



[Beatnuts] 

(Get money, get money) Psycho Les 

(Get money, get money) Big Ju 

(Get money, get money) Beatnuts 

(Get money, get money) 

(Get money, get money) 

(Get money, get money) Throw your hands up, throw your hands up 

(Get money, get money) Throw your hands up, throw your hands up..
