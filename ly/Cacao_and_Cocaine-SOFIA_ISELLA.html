		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Would you like everyone around you to start screaming? 
The butcher, the baker, and the pedestrians screeching 
At the top of their lungs, drop their babies and groceries 
Would you like everyone to scream like they've broken their ovaries? 

Would you prefer a brutal electrical shock
To sitting in a living room next to your thoughts?
Would you like your heart to get attacked?
Would that feel better than boredom in another beige and bland culdesac? 

The clouds are raining cacao and cocaine
Hand me peace on a plate, I send it back, I prefer pain
Would you applaud the simulation, applaud the maker
If you were constantly in the safety of danger 

I'm flirting with a boy that I think wants to murder me
I giggle, touch his hair, and wrap my fingers around my keys
I got over him in a few days, but I'm missing the thrill
I put him in a case and take him like a happy pill

If Santa Claus went down your chimney with a machete
And told you to go get your will and casket ready,
Would you go home at night, thinking, ""what a day!""
Would you finally be entertained?

The clouds are raining cacao and cocaine
Hand me peace on a plate, I send it back, I prefer pain
Would you applaud the simulation, applaud the maker
If you were constantly in the safety of danger 

Danger crushes, pushes my buttons, forces me to agree
Danger's a slut, it's in my gut, at night it whispers to me
""You fucking liar, your desire, baby bunny, come clean""
""You want me bad, you want me back, but you don't know what that means""

""You don't know what that means""
