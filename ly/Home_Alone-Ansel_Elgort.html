		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time told all
I was stranded in my head
From moments it was done but
Then I'd lie in bed
And miss your smile
And miss your laugh
And miss the memories from our past
And miss your smile
And miss your laugh
I miss the memories from our past

I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
At the end of the night
When I turn off the light
And the bullshit fades away
I don't wanna go home
Alone!

So open up that door and
Let's find a solution
'Cause baby you're the world
I won't be your pollution
And if you cry I'll dry your eyes
I stand beside you I'll give you time
We both know I've got room to grow
Just hold my hand baby I'm never letting go

I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
I don't wanna go home (home)
Alone (alone)
At the end of the night
When I turn off the light
And the bullshit fades away
I don't wanna go home
Alone

At the end of the night
When I turn off the light
And the bullshit fades away
And the bullshit fades away
You've got nothing to hide
I can see it in your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes

I don't wanna go home
Alone
I don't wanna go home
Alone
I don't wanna go home
Alone
I don't wanna go home

Alone
