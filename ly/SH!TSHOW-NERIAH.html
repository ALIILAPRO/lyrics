		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, mm-mm

5 o' clock on the dot
You said you're on your way
But I know you're not i know you're not
You're probably just on the couch
Not even thinking about me
I'm getting worried

Yeah, you keep canceling our plans
I keep tryna understand
'Cause it happens so much it feels normal
Don't know who you think I am
Wasting time with half a man
Guess it happened so much it felt normal

Baby, you're a shit show
And I'm in the front row
Watching you burn bridges
Acting like you didn't
I pretend I don't know but everybody said so
Blaming turns to kisses
I'm not one of your bitches

It's getting late, means time to hang
No more work, it's time to play
And you know that I know just how you like it
Promises, a dinner date
Likе it makes up for all this pain
You left me down and you didn't еven notice

Yeah, you keep canceling our plans
I keep tryna understand
'Cause it happens so much it feels normal
Don't know who you think I am
Wasting time with half a man
Guess it happened so much it felt normal

Baby, you're a shit show
And I'm in the front row
Watching you burn bridges
Acting like you didn't
I pretend I don't know but everybody said so
Blaming turns to kisses
I'm not one of your bitches

Not one of your, not one of your (Bitches)
Not one of your, not one of your

Told you there's only so far I'll go
God, we got so close but now
I hate you the most
You're not even hitting up my phone
Trying to apologize but baby, you should know

I'm leaving your shit show
No longer sitting front row
I bet now you're wishing
You treated me different
I didn't but now I know
I'm the one saying so
You thought I was kidding
So cheers to your good riddance
