Remix, Nicole
De los Pussycat Dolls, ¿cómo?
Mami, tú estás como el bistec a la plancha
Tú sabes cómo, pshh

Ooh what you got me doing, baby?

(Meet me at the hotel room)
I'ma bring my girlfriends
Meet me at the hotel room
I'ma bring my girlfriends
(Meet me at the hotel room)
I'ma bring my girlfriends
Meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room

I'ma bring my girlfriends
So meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel

We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

Penthouse, top floor, Suite Presidential
Overlook the whole city, standing from my window
Real pink Rosé, pop 'em by the case load
Bed shaking, body rocking, I keep you want' more

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room

I'ma bring my girlfriends
So meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel

We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn

Baby you really, really, really
Really wanna open Pandora's box (yeah)
I can tell by the look in your eye
That you know, that you know how to make it hot
I'm in room 305, Hotel Dade County
That's where you can find me
I'm a Miami boy, I don't talk about it, I be about it
Baby, don't doubt me
I got the room with the mirrors in the ceiling
So you look at yourself and see how you're feeling
You tell me what you want, I'ma give what you need
You can bet on that, you can bet on me, see
Now five and five, we both got live
In the bedroom all day and all of the night
Let's ride

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room

I'ma bring my girlfriends
So meet me at the hotel room

Forget about your boyfriend
And meet me at the hotel room
You can bring your girlfriends
And meet me at the hotel

We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
We're at the hotel, motel, Holiday Inn
