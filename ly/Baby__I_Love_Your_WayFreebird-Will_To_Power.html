		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly, the day turns into night
Far away from the city

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love, your love won't wait, oh, no, no

(Ooh) Oh, baby, I love your way every day
(Ooh) Wanna tell you I love your way every day
(Ooh) Wanna be with you night and day, hey, yeah
I love your way

If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me
For I must be traveling on now
There's so many places I gotta see

But if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just wouldn't be the same
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird will never change
And this bird will never change

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
With the help of some fireflies
I wonder how they have the power to shine
I can see them under the pines

But don't hesitate
'Cause your love, your love won't wait

Ooh, baby, I love your way (every day)
(Ooh) Wanna tell you I love your way (night and day)
(Ooh) Oh, baby, I love your way (every day)
Every day now
(Ooh) I wanna tell you I love your way (night and day, night and day)
I love your way
(Ooh) Oh, baby, I love your way ('cause I'm as free as a bird now)
Give me your way, wanna tell you I love your way (as free as a bird now)
Oh, baby, I love your ways

(Ooh) Oh, baby, I love your way (every day)
(Ooh) Wanna tell you I love your way (night and day)
(Ooh) Oh, baby, I love your way (every day, every day)
(Ooh) wanna tell you I love your way (night and day, night and day, oh-oh)
(Ooh) Oh, baby, I love your way
