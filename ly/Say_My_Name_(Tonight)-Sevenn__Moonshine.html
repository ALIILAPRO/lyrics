		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run to me
Let my body be the air you breathe
We get lost under the chemistry
The ecstasy
Of you and me, of you and me

Running and running
I’m running in circles

Pulling me close
and my body is burning

Whatever you’re doing
well baby it’s working

Just run to me

I wanna hear you say my name tonight
Like you heard in another life
So let’s not fight with fate tonight
Its do or die
One step from paradise
I wanna hear you say my name
I wanna hear you say my name
I wanna hear you say my name

Run to me
I will let you take your time with me
I swear you’re just like therapy
It’s healing me
Its all I need, it’s all I need yeah

Running and running
I’m running in circles

Pulling me close
and my body is burning

Whatever you’re doing
well baby it’s working

Just run to me

I wanna hear you say my name tonight
Like you heard in another life
So let’s not fight with fate tonight
Its do or die
One step from paradise

I wanna hear you say my name tonight
Like you heard in another life
So let’s not fight with fate tonight
Its do or die
One step from paradise
I wanna hear you say my name

I wanna hear you say my name

I wanna hear you say my name tonight
Like you heard in another life
So let’s not fight with fate tonight
Its do or die
One step from paradise
I wanna hear you say my name
