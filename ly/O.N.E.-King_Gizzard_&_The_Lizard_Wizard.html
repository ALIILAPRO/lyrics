		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One night everywhere
One night everywhere
One night everywhere
One night everywhere

Dawn has reared its welcome head
I lay in bed bravely
Waiting for the day to begin, woo

Hours pass reading the news of the day
That begins in such a state
I bravely await fate

Am I going insane?
Am I able to wake from the nightmare?
Can I keep it contained?
One night everywhere turned to nowhere

Human race deserves its steaming fate on a plate
We did exploit the fish of the sea
And the birds of the heavens
And even the bugs in the ground
And every creeping thing that creeps on Earth

Am I going insane?
Am I able to wake from the nightmare?
Can I keep it contained?
One night everywhere turned to nowhere, woo
