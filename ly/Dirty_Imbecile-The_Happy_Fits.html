		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Starin' at the ground, gonna get much better,
But you're thinkin' to yourself bout it every day.
Starin' in the clouds, there's a big bright future
But you're never gonna get it if you're never get to say:

I got that love, little love that you leave me, while you fade away.
Inside my heart is a drum and it's beating for you every single day

Bendin' over backwards, nobody want no bruises
But she knows just how to see right through it.
You'll change but it's not enough, you changed but you'll never know, what
She wants, what you want, what she needs, what you need, (you'll never know )
She wants, what you want, what she needs, what you need, (you'll never know)
She wants, what you need, and you need

I got that love, little love that you leave me, while you fade away.
Inside my heart is a drum and it's beating for you every single day

Rollin', rollin' through all of the noises
You make inside of your mind.
Forget all the visible lust, metaphysical trust what you trying find?
Always the hardest, and always the rightest they all gotta stand for the same damn thing!

I got that love, little love that you leave me, while you fade away.
Inside my heart is a drum and it's beating for you every single day.
I got that love, little love that you leave me, while you fade away.
Inside my heart is a drum and it's beating for you every single day.

You wanted that fever, oh now boy you got it.
So taste it, don't waste it, all you thought wanted. 

For your love I'm down on my knees
I've got chains at your door and need a release.

I got that love, little love that you leave me, while you fade away.
Inside my heart is a drum and it's beating for you every single day.
I got that love, little love that you leave me, while you fade away.
Inside my heart is a drum and it's beating for you every single day.
