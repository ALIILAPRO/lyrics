		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a little red bow
And I bought it for you
'Cause I know you're not fair
I don't get it, oh well
And you color my skin
And the colors don't blend

'Cause I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
'Cause I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

Like home
I've, got a southern belle too
And ruby red shoes
With a body of straw
Are you sick of it all?
There's a man made of tin
With an oil can grin

And I'm gonna get you
And your little dog too
There's a yellow brick road
That we follow back home
And I know you can't wait
Your belligerent hate
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A techni-colorful life
Can I stand by your side?
We can make it alright

Like home
'Cause I'm home
There's a little white porch
And you wanted it so
Can you let me go down
To the end of the road
In the black and the white
A Technicolorful life

Then another arrived
It's a cowardly lion
What I want from this world
What I wanna resolve
When I want you to stay
So I want you to wait

I don't wanna be bold
I don't wanna be cold
I don't wanna grow old
I don't wanna go home
