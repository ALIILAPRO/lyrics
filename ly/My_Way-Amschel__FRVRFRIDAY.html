		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wanna spend time with a nigga
She would do time for her nigga
Little baby got the swag and the figures
It's two am and we gone of the liquor
Yeah baby you know I
I ain't even gonna lie
I love your style, love you vibe
I promise with you I would try
Call out of work on a Friday, baby
Girl I know you had a bad day, baby
Two hundred on the highway baby
You wanna do it, do it my way baby
I don't trust no girl like I trust you
I won't put anyone above you
I've been having chills when I touch you
You ain't even gotta ask, you can come through
Are you down to do it my way
You wanna do it, do it my way
She wanna do it, do it my way
Get high Imma take you on the skyway
Take you on the skyway
High key I'm so inspired
That other mistress retired
We talk and we fight, and don't talk all night
I can't tell if it's alright
Girl I need assistance
After work hours get to business
Tell that other nigga adios and you don't wanna fix shit
Girl I need that quick fix
Nonstop girl I've been having visions
You know I'm experienced
So it's only right if you listen and look
You like my boy I's Mercedes, that's no key
Know the right buttons to push and we low key
We ain't gotta tell em all stories of what we do
It's real when there's no snap story for the proof
Damn, left field with the right hand
Meaning our relationship here isn't planned
But its cool, it's all good, OT
Still outta town putting over time for the season
When you feel it's going south don't put up Paul Wall's
Sitting sideways you knew i'd be on call
Driving down the Hamilton skyway
It's to show you how we do it when we do it my way
Are you down to do it my way
You wanna do it, do it my way
She wanna do it, do it my way
Get high Imma take you on the skyway
Take you on the skyway
