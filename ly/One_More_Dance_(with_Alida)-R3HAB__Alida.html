		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been feeling low
I know I should let you go, oh, oh, oh
Got me on my tippy toes
See you wherever I go, oh, oh, oh

You're in my head
You're in my head
You're in my head
I can't forget
I can't forget
Just can't forget
Want your romance
Want your romance
Want your romance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance

You're in my head
You're in my head
You're in my head
I can't forget
I can't forget
Just can't forget
Want your romance
Want your romance
Want your romance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance

(You're in my head)
(You're in my head)
(You're in my head)
(I can't forget)
(I can't forget)
(Just can't forget)
(Want your romance)
(Want your romance)
(Want your romance)
(Just one more dance)
(Just one more dance)
(Just one more dance)

Can't believe that it's over (na, na, na, na)
I'm not ready for closure, (no, no, no)
Feels like I'm missing out
When you're not around
I really miss you now

You're in my head
You're in my head
You're in my head
I can't forget
I can't forget
Just can't forget
Want your romance
Want your romance
Want your romance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance

(You're in my head)
(You're in my head)
(You're in my head)
(I can't forget)
(I can't forget)
(Just can't forget)
(Want your romance)
(Want your romance)
(Want your romance)
(Just one more dance)
(Just one more dance)
(Just one more dance)

You're in my head
You're in my head
You're in my head
I can't forget
I can't forget
Just can't forget
Want your romance
Want your romance
Want your romance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance
Just one more dance

(You're in my head)
(You're in my head)
(You're in my head)
(I can't forget)
(I can't forget)
(Just can't forget)
(Want your romance)
(Want your romance)
(Want your romance)
(Just one more dance)
(Just one more dance)
(Just one more dance)
