		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the gate, come inside, I know that it's late
But I'm here, 'cause you're body my motivation
Let's skip the talk
What if we found a way to get lost without fear?
Keep it all behind, we're escaping

If you told me that my fate was on your fingertips
Then I wouldn't believe it 
I wouldn't believe it
Every kiss with you, it's like a prayer falls from my lips
Now I'm a believer
Yeah, I'm a believer

This is Heaven
And I don't know how this could get much better
Than you and me, here right now
This is Heaven
And every time I touch you, it gets better
I'm on my knees, I can't stop now
This is Heaven (this is Heaven, yeah, this is Heaven)
This is Heaven (this is Heaven, oh, this is Heaven)
This is

Sunrise, another long night lost in your eyes
So don't blink
You're the center of my attention, yeah
I know, nothing is perfect, but this is close
So don't go, keep it coming in my direction

If you told me that my fate was on your fingertips
Then, I wouldn't believe it (I wouldn't believe it)
I wouldn't believe it (I wouldn't believe it)
Every kiss with you, it's like a prayer falls from my lips
Now I'm a believer (I'm a believer)
Yeah, I'm a believer (oh)

This is Heaven
And I don't know how this could get much better (yeah)
Than you and me, here right now
This is Heaven
And every time I touch you, it gets better (keeps getting better)
I'm on my knees, I can't stop now
This is Heaven (this is Heaven, yeah, this is Heaven)
This is Heaven (this is Heaven, oh, this is Heaven)
I'm on my knees, I can't stop now
This is Heaven

Oh-oh

I'm a believer, oh

This is Heaven
And I don't know how this could get much better (yeah)
Than you and me, here right now
This is Heaven
And every time I touch you, it gets better (keeps getting better)
I'm on my knees, I can't stop now
This is Heaven (this is Heaven, yeah, this is Heaven)
This is Heaven (this is Heaven, oh, this is Heaven)
I'm on my knees, I can't stop now

This is Heaven (this is Heaven, this is Heaven)
Heaven
(This is Heaven, this is Heaven)
This is Heaven
