		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wrapped in the black cloth
I found by the bed
You're turning the lights off
And I am covering my face
You should do what you want

I can't stop you now and I won't try

Breathing slower now you turn the TV back on
You should do what you want with him
But I don't want to see you with him
I can't stop you now and I won't try

I've been searching for a way
To stay in dreams
Waking up and feeling sick and feeling dizzy
We're always ending, always ending
Always ending
It's always ending, always ending
Always ending
