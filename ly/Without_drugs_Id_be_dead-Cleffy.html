		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh im wasted all the time
But i need drugs inside my veins to stay alive 
cbuse myself in hopes that i can tame in my mind 
I lay my head down will i make it past tonight 

Hold on wait 
Im a fake 
Looking in the mirror i can barely see my face
Regreting all the times i asked somebody for some space 
Cause all i need right now is someone to friend, I need a friend 

Man im faded
Im wasted 
Complaining that i cant take it
But not changing 
cmazing 
Now will i ever face me


Hide behind the drugs inside my brain 
Its a cycle stuck in maze 
Crave euphoria i cant change 
Palpitations i cant tame 

csk my mumma check my vitals even though i know im a nurse 
She has no idea her son barely made out last year 
If i died right now then would i go and finally heal all of the pain 
But im afraid that if die then god will never ever save me 

When i look into my mirror 
cll i sees a boy turned to a creature 
So much pain inside cant see his future 
So he sheds more tears these days its like a river 

Hide behind the drugs inside my brain 
Its a cycle stuck in maze 
Crave euphoria i cant change 
Palptations i cant tame 

csk my mumma check my vitals even i know im a nurse 
She has no idea her son barely made out last year 

Oh im wasted all the time
But i need drugs inside my veins to stay alive 
cbuse myself in hopes that i can tame in my mind 
I lay my head down will i make it past tonight
