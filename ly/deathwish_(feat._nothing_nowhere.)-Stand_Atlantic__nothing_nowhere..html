		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make my head spin
God knows I can't win
I don't know what I'm doing
I think I got a fucking deathwish
It's got me headsick
If I can't win I'm losing
To a fucking deathwish

I don't wanna suffer on the stupid things that you said
Why don't you dig the grave big enough for us? Yeah, yeah
Think I'm losing something that I didn't know I could have
I'll be drinking your sweat 'til we're fucking dead, yeah

Kissing the knife
A cynical and miserable high
Can see the end of this in your eyes
If you're staying, could you quit saying bye, bye

You make my head spin
God knows I can't win
I don't know what I'm doing
I think I got a fucking deathwish
It's got me headsick
If I can't win I'm losing
To a fucking deathwish

Yo, if it's real, we say it out loud
I wanna tell you, but I don't know how
Every single night, every single fight
Now I feel like I was right when I left
But it's too late now
Yeah, yeah, ayy
I know this won't last, yeah
Your knife in my back, yeah
(We're not fucking dead yet)

Kissing the knife
A cynical and miserable high
Can see the end of this in your eyes
If you're staying, could you quit saying bye, quit saying bye

You make my head spin
God knows I can't win
I don't know what I'm doing
I think I got a fucking deathwish
It's got me headsick
If I can't win I'm losing
Watch my fucking head spin
God knows I can't win
I don't know what I'm doing
I think I got a fucking deathwish
It's got me headsick
If I can't win I'm losing
To a fucking deathwish

Said I'll drink your sweat, 'til we're dead, yeah, yeah
