		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been thirty-seven hours, seven minutes, thirty seconds
And you still haven't responded to me
Got me on the edge of crazy but I'm not one for complainin'
I just wonder where the hell you could be
Tell me who you think you are
Don't be playin' with my heart
Say what, what's it gonna be?

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in or you out?
'Cause I really need you here
If you don't want me around
Then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

It's been forty-seven hours, seven minutes, thirty seconds
And now you're just responding to me
Boy, you must be suicidal
Is that bitch right there beside you?
'Cause I know, hell, it couldn't be me
Tell me who you think you are
I'm a motherfuckin' star
Say what, what's it gonna be?

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in or you out?
'Cause I really need you here
If you don't want me around
Then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

If you ain't feelin' this
Just let me know
I promise on everything
I'll let you go

'Cause I'm in love with you now
Are you in or you out?
'Cause I really need you here
If you don't want me around
Then don't come around
And cloud up my atmosphere
Fuck outta here

Fuck outta here
