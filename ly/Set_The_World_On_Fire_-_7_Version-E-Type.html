		<p>
		  Ooohh

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah x4

So I am what I am and what I feel can not be wrong
This is the way that I feel and I'm coming on strong
We're talking hundreds and thousands,
with potential to stay,
but only one with quality,
can turn the loneliness away, com folla mi

One is a wonder,
one is a wonder,
but only one is a wonder,
one is a wonder

Set the world on fire
I'll do anything, to get what I want
Aim even higher
I'll do anything, to be the one

So I'm cruising round the continent,
to see what I can find
A lot of fangs, but I refuse to be a slave to the ground
We're talking gadda-da-vida,
honey now the deed is done
And if you're in you've got to show me,
that you really are the one,
com folla mi

One is a wonder,
one is a wonder, 
but only one is a wonder,
one is a wonder

Set the world on fire
I'll do anything, to get what I want
(I'm gonna) aim even higher
I'll do anything, to be the one

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah x2

Set the world on fire
I'll do anything, to get what I want
Aim even higher
I'll do anything, to be the one

(I'm gonna) set the world on fire
I'll do anything, to get what I want
(I'm gonna) aim even higher
I'll do anything, to be the one

Set the world on fire
Aim even higher

Yeah, ohh...
