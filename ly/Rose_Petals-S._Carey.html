		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up in this wallowing
I run from it every day
I started making sense of it
At least that's what I say

Hiding in the rose petals
Holding on to what you know
Hanging from the pedestal
Hinging on whether you should go

Ooh

We're back to where we started
Our backs against the wall
And you're tracing your steps 
Like you said you wouldn't do

Hiding in the rose petals
Holding on to what you know
Hanging from the pedestal
Hinging on whether you should go

Hiding in the rose petals
Holding on to what you know
Hanging from the pedestal
Hinging on whether you should go
