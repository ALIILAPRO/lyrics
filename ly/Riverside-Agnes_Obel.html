		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down by the river by the boats
Where everybody goes to be alone
Where you won't see any rising sun
Down to the river we will run

When by the water we drinks to the dregs
Look at the stones on the riverbed
I can tell from your eyes
You've never been by the riverside

Down by the water the riverbed
Somebody calls you somebody says
Swim with the current and float away
Down by the river every day

Oh my god I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

When that old river runs past your eyes
To wash off the dirt on the riverside
Go to the water so every near
The river will be your eyes and ears

I walk to the borders on my own
Fall in the water just like a stone
Chilled to the marrow in them bones
Why do I go here alone

Oh my god I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

Oh my god I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

Oh oh
Ah ah ah
Oh oh
Ah ah ah

Oh oh
Ah ah ah

Down by the riverside

Down by the riverside
