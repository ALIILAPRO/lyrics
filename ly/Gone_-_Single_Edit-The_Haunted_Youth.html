		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting on the corner
It's been a little while since i got high
Itching for another
I'm breaking all the rules of my mother and father
Hatin' on one another
Fire burns my insides and i don't bother
Misty forest loner
Save me your advice cause i wanna tranquillize

The doves keep crying and the weather pours violence
I dove deep trying and the rebel was dying out, yea
The doves keep crying and the weather pours violence
They both keep trying with the devil inside

But i don't care
Cause i just wanna be gone, gone away
cnd I don't care
Cause i just wanna be gone, gone away
I just wanna be gone
