		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They getting mad I'm not finna stop
I had to carry the word I see I don't have to carry a glock
Im still finna pop
Making a point connecting the dots
We blowing the spot
I had to check my circle check some folk
Cause Jesus he still had a opp

I went and cut off the block I went cut off some friends had to cut of the op
Blind can't lead the blind
So why would I listen to yal
Follow my purpose 1'm back on the clock
See how I'm shooting my shot feeling like Ja
Im building my house on a rock

They getting mad I'm not finna stop
I had to carry the word I see I don't have to carry a glock
Im still finna pop
Making a point connecting the dots
We blowing the spot
I had to check my circle check some folk
Cause Jesus he still had a opp

Why would I stress bout a lame
God he been giving me game
I can not chase the fame
Do it for you I won't do it in vain
Folk they love religion
Why they be scared of a chain
Why they be scared of the bank
They should be seeking your name
When I be reading your word I be seeing the reason the devil afraid
Go you know its hard sometimes but I be enduring the pain
God we hear for your kingdom this thing different
More than you think
We more like your children
They is not moving the same

They getting mad I'm not finna stop
I had to carry the word I see I don't have to carry a glock
Im still finna pop
Making a point connecting the dots
We blowing the spot
I had to check my circle check some folk
Cause Jesus he still had a opp
