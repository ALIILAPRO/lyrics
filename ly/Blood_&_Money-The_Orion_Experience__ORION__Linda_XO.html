		  Blood & Money

Welcome to the dawning of a dark, dark age,
where deception and dishonesty are all the rage.
The Man controls the media, your eyes and your ears,
with music made by mother fuckin' mouseketeers!

Now once upon a time you had a beautiful dream,
well wake up you're  just a product of the war-machine.
You call yourself a pacifist? You're just another punk.
The rich are getting richer, so let's all get drunk and

sing with the masses, sing with the masses.

Come on, come on and give us blood & money.
Color T.V.s with super-sonic sound.
Bow down before the land of milk and honey,
Or we'll burn your people, burn your people to the ground.

Come and watch the death of the cmerican dream.
Now the red, white, and blue is the red, gold, and green.
The man controls the money, and he starts a war,
but fight it? No, that's what the working-class is for.

So he hides behind a bible, and he hides behind a flag,
cnd he hides behind your brother in a body-bag.
He hides behind the covers, yeah cause while he sleeps,
He's counting up the bodies like he's counting sheep! He goes...

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-thousand more!
( Who's keepin' score? )

Come on, come on and give us blood & money.
Color T.V.s with super-sonic sound.
Bow down before the land of milk and honey,
While we burn our bridges, burn our bridges to the ground.

Blood & Money, Blood & Money, Blood & Money make the world go round.
