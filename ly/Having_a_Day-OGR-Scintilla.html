		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm having a day just get out my way
I'm having a day that's all I'mma say

First of all Let me get started
By saying this shit is ridiculous
Kevin Malone I'm grown and
Know I don't got no patience for ignorance
Probably think that you now but trust me you
Haven't been living it
If you insist on starting some shit just
Know imma finish it
And I  really really don't need to hear from you bitch not
Not now imma go ahead and stop you
If you really really wanna go down this road just
Hope the cops pull me ff you
If I hear another word out ya plain ass mouth on
God no telling what I might do
This is why Nobody likes you

I'm having a day just get out my way
I'm having a day just get out my face
I'm having a day just get out my way
I'm having a day that's all I'mma say

Oh there was one other thing I forgot that I wanted to
Mention, you a bitch ass hoe
In a  bitch hat and some bitch ass pants from ya
Bitch ass top to ya bitch ass toes
You ain't got no money
Bitch ya Broke
Throwing your smoke bruh you a
Joke and I just thought you should know
I ain't got no time for you lame ass
Let me just  swerve that switch lanes fast
If I was in a room with you hitler
Stalin Mao And had to choose on who to shoot
Only had two bulletsI would Shoot you twice

I'm having a day just get out my way
I'm having a day just get out my face
I'm having a day just get out my way
I'm having a day that's all I'mma say
