		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He had hard work caked on his overalls
Sweat on his neck, chaw in his jaw
When a stranger pulled up and met him outside his barn
Said, "Sir, I don't know if you ever would
But I build houses and neighborhoods
And I was wondering if you'd ever want to sell your farm"
With his old dog barking and running around
He paused for a second, spit on the ground
Then kicked a little gravel, looked down and said

This is my dirt, these are my fields, where I harvest what I plant
That little pond, I catch bluegill, I built that barn with my two hands
Where I raise my babies, a piece of me, nah, this ain't just a piece of land
The money'd be great, but I can't part ways with a life that works
You can't put a green bag dollar on what it's worth
This is my dirt

Great granddaddy bought it for a hundred an acre
He'd just got married when he signed the papers
Him and his brothers framed that old farmhouse
Every fence post here we put in the ground
Ran the barbed wire and pulled the plow
Every last hay bale, we baled it
Yeah, I'd hate to be the first to sell it

This is my dirt, these are my fields, where I harvest what I plant
That little pond, I catch bluegill, I built that barn with my two hands
Where I raise my babies, a piece of me, nah, this ain't just a piece of land
The money'd be great, but I can't part ways with a life that works
You can't put a green bag dollar on what it's worth
This is my dirt

This is where five generations have prayed for rain
They'll cover me in it when the good Lord calls my name

This is my dirt, these are my fields, where I harvest what I plant
That little pond, I catch bluegill, I built that barn with my two hands
Where I raise my babies, a piece of me, nah, this ain't just a piece of land
The money'd be great, but I can't part ways with a life that works
You can't put a green bag dollar on what it's worth
This is my dirt

Yeah, this is my dirt
Yeah, this is my dirt
Where I harvest what I plant, this is my dirt
Where I raise my babies, this is my dirt
