		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He always runs while others walk
He acts while other men just talk
He looks at this world, and wants it all
So he strikes, like thunderball

He knows the meaning of success
His needs are more, so he gives less
They call him the winner who takes all
And he strikes, like thunderball

Any woman he wants, he'll get
He will break any heart without regret

His days of asking are all gone
His fight goes on and on and on
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all
So he strikes like thunderball
