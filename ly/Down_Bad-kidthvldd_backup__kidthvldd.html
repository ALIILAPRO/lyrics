		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, I was down bad but now I see the light
Yeah, Eliantte diamonds, watch the way they shine (Flooded)
Yeah, bitch on my team, yeah bitch on my side
Kills on my team, yeah and they get your ass fried
Yeah, I was down bad, but it just took a while
Yeah, tell me what you have, yeah would you pull it out? (Yeah, yeah)
I nut in my bae, I don't feel like pullin' out (Yeah, yeah)
I'm on the Percs every day, I guess I'm a junkie now (Yeah)
I was down bad on my ass, I guess I just figured it out (Ooh)
Yeah, I don't even love this bitch, yеah, but I hate it now (Yeah)
Yeah, I donе went and brought the Tonka so they ain't see me
My brother on the run, bitch, we on the TV (Catch him)
I scored a pint, scored up PT (Ah)
My bitch down bad and she freaky
Yeah, bitch I stay lit like a tiki (Island)
Bitch, I been shipping out QBs
I made the money so easy (Yeah, yeah)
I had started, get my pockets up (Ah)
Bitch, I went and hit Balenci (Go, go)
Mmm, I was down bad but now I see the light
Yeah, Eliantte diamonds, watch the way they shine (Flooded)
Yeah, bitch on my team, yeah bitch on my side
Kills on my team, yeah and they get your ass fried
Yeah, I was down bad, but it just took a while
Yeah, tell me what you have, yeah would you pull it out? (Yeah, yeah)
I nut in my bae, I don't feel like pullin' out (Yeah, yeah)
I'm on the Percs every day, I guess I'm a junkie now (Yeah)
I was down bad, but now I see the light
I was down bad, but now I feel alright
Now I can be real and don't cry
I was down bad but now you...
You left me alone, yeah, under the rain
And now I'm not good enough, I feel the pain
Nothing really matters, nothing still the same
You looking for love and I look for my brain
Man I carry on and don't die
You left me alone I'm on novacane, I don't feel, I don't try
You on my back
I'm on, on my vibe
How should I act if my soul just say bye?
How should I act if I wanna touch the sky?
Mmm, I was down bad but now I see the light
Yeah, Eliantte diamonds, watch the way they shine (Flooded)
Yeah, bitch on my team, yeah bitch on my side
Kills on my team, yeah and they get your ass fried
Yeah, I was down bad, but it just took a while
Yeah, tell me what you have, yeah would you pull it out? (Yeah, yeah)
I nut in my bae, I don't feel like pullin' out (Yeah, yeah)
I'm on the Percs every day, I guess I'm a junkie now (Yeah)
