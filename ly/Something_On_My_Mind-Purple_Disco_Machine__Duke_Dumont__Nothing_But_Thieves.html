		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not interested in love in a soundbite
Or skipping midway through the night, ayy
Don't wanna cut down to the obvious highlights
You've gone too long unsatisfied

How does it feel when you lie awake?
Ignore the ache just to get through
How does it feel when you lie awake?

Well, are you dreaming of me?
'Cause there's something on my mind
Yeah, my heart tried to warn me
But there's something on my mind

But there's something on my mind

I wanna say that thing that pulls you in closer
That makes you hold on to a life
I tried to write something that moves the future
But that's not what you want tonight

How does it feel when you lie awake?
Ignore the ache just to get through
How does it feel when you lie awake?

Well, are you dreaming of me?
'Cause there's something on my mind
Yeah, my heart tried to warn me
But there's something on my mind

But there's something on my mind
But there's something on my mind

How does it feel when you lie awake?
How does it feel when you lie awake? (Well, are you dreaming of me?)
How does it feel when you lie awake?
How does it feel when you lie awake? ('Cause there's something on my mind)
How does it feel when you lie awake?
How does it feel when you lie awake? ('Cause there's something on my mind)

Well, are you dreaming of me?
'Cause there's something on my mind
Yeah, my heart tried to warn me
But there's something on my mind

How does it feel when you lie awake?
Ignore the ache just to get through
How does it feel when you lie awake?
When you lie awake?

But there's something on my mind
But there's something on my mind
