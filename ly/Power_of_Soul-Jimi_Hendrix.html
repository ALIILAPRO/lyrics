		  Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Ooo yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, ooo
Ooo yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

One tropic summer those high flyin' mans you've been thinkin'
You know the ones that have been flyin' too low, oh
Look up at some of those airplanes risin' and takin' 
To see the ones that are flyin' too low yeah
Come on back up to Earth, my friend
Come on back up with me

We've all been up through the night time baby 
Now let's read the rays of reality 
 
With the power of soul yeah
Talk about 
With the power of soul 
Anything is possible 
With the power of you
Anything you want to do

Flyin' through the air on a kite every day and every night
Just up there her wrist
Sometimes the wind ain't right
Yeah, I'm playin' too much with one toy baby
Just up there, escape to the crippled night
Oh yeah
And you look around and see all the jellyfish
You sayin' flotation's groovy baby
And even he'll tell you that

Yeah, gettin' high every day is easy
And the floatin' around even if jellyfish will agree to that
Lord, but you'll look around see him floatin' around so long
And easy and so slack
He don't have a bone in his jelly back
Is that the way you wanna be brother?
Check it out
Yeah, I'm singin' with a power
Aren't you?

Hhmm

With the power of you
Anything, anything you want to do

With the power of soul
Anything is possible 
With the power of you
Anything you want to do

With the power of soul
Anything is possible 
With the power of you (with the power of love, baby)
Anything you want to do
Oh yeah
