		  INTRO 
Me is a man who can't tek 
the botheration yuh know 
So, so, so let the door hit yuh 
Whey di good Lord split yuh 
Brand new musical disc ay 

You say you love and yuh care 
But yet yuh never deh near 
You are always on the run 
Now tell me this 


Why we can't spend no quality time, 
Kick back, undress and unwind 
You always have something fi do 
That simply means that love deh nuh true 
Cause only when yuh want a f--- 
Me hear you shout I love you 
Tell me where all the passion gone 
All of the warmth 
Now tell me where is all the tenderness 
And there is something else 
That's been bugging me for so long 
Tell me this 


CHORUS 
Tell me if love so nice 
Tell me why it hurt so bad (badang) 
If love, love, so nice, 
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad 
Me sing again 
(Repeat) 



Why if yuh nails fi do a mi 
Bill fi pay a mi, hair fi do a mi 
And yuh making fun a me 
And I'm the only one with the J.O.B. 
So baby why don't yuh give me some TLC 
And there is rumors going around 
Say that when I'm outta town 
There is a man where I'm supposed to be 
Too late to be begging on your knees 
Hand me my keys and leggo off mi shirt sleeve 
You can go do as you please 
You can go talk to John, Peter or Steve 



CHORUS 
Tell me if love so nice 
Tell me why it hurt so bad (badang) 
If love, love, so nice, 
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad 
Me sing again 
(Repeat) 



No man nuh want fi live a lonely life 
Of that I'm sure 
But mi nah go settle fi less 
When I know I deserve more 
Everyday from mi vessel, 
When mi love yuh come a pour 
You come a pour it out 
And when me ready fi some of yours 
You lock me out change the route 
And then you run your mouth 
But you nuh know what love is about 
Well I'm sick an I'm tired 
I'm tired and I'm sick 
And I don't want no more of this 



CHORUS 
Tell me if love so nice 
Tell me why it hurt so bad (badang) 
If love, love, so nice, 
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad 
Me sing again 
(Repeat)
