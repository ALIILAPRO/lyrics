		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The wayward wind is a restless wind 
A restless wind that yearns to wander 
And he was born the next of kin 
The next of kin to the wayward wind 

In a lonely shack by a railroad track 
He spent his younger days 
And I guess the sound of the outward-bound 
Made him a slave to his wanderin' ways 

And the wayward wind is a restless wind 
A restless wind that yearns to wander 
And he was born the next of kin 
The next of kin to the wayward wind 

Oh, I met him there in a border town 
He vowed we'd never part 
Though he tried his best to settle down 
I'm now alone with a broken heart 

And the wayward wind is a restless wind 
A restless wind that yearns to wander 
And he was born the next of kin 
The next of kin to the wayward wind 

The next of kin to the wayward wind
