		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, I've got a lot to get through and not a lot of time
And I feel like you weren't hearing me before
So here it goes

I know Hell's population is out of control
It's a bad situation
It's taking a toll
If we rehab these Sinners
And cleanse all their souls
At my Hazbin Hotel

Wait, I'm getting ahead of myself!
Right! Extermination!

I know you guys fly down
Just to kill once a year
And it must be annoying
To schlep all the way here
If they join you in Heaven
That trip disappears!
You can wave that chore farewell
It'll be a happy day in he-

Let me stop you right there

Oh

Save us all precious time

Okay

If what you're suggesting
Is letting them climb
Up the ladder
Oh, they'd rather cross the Pearly Gates?

Well, uh

Sorry, sweetie
But there's no defyin' their fates!

'Cause Hell is forever
Whether you like it or not
Had their chance to behave better
Now they boil in the pot

'Cause the rules are black and white
There's no use in tryin' to fight it
They're burnin' for their lives
Until we kill 'em again!

Okay, but

Just try to chillax, babe
You're wasting your breath

Did I hear you imply
That they don't deserve death?
Are they Winners?
Are they Sinners?
'Cause it's cut and dry

Well, actually, if you take a look

Fair is fair, an eye for an eye!
And when all's said and done (said and done)
There's the question of fun (fun)
And for those of us with Divine Ordainment
Extermination is entertainment!
Bow-now-now-nownow
Guitar solo, fuck yeah!
Oh, da-ah-ah now-now-n-now-n-now-n-now-n-nownownow

Ugh

Hell is forever
Whether you like it or not
Had their chance to behave better (where the Hell did you people come from?)
Now they boil in the pot
'Cause the rules are black and white
There's no use in tryin' to fight it
They're burnin' for their lives
Until we kill 'em again!

Fuckin' Hell's forever
And it's meant to suck a lot
So give up your dumb endeavor
'Cause you don't have a shot!

Long as I've got your attention
I guess I should probably mention
That we made the determination
To move up the next Extermination!

What?

Can't wait a whole year
To slaughter those little cunts
I know it's just been a week
But we'll be back in six months!

Um, wait, didn't you
Ugh, shit!
