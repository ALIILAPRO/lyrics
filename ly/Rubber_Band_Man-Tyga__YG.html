		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Larry, they gettin' out of here

Put your ass in my hands
I'm the rubber band man
I'm the rubber band
I'm the rubber band
Put your ass in my hands
I'm the rubber band man
I'm the rubber band
I'm the rubber band

She gon' shake 'em for a couple dollars, hoochie, holler
I'm her only fan, she a Insta model
She a whole freak bitch, Sukihana
Tell her, "Throw it back like my '96 Impala"
Four hundred for a show, I'm gettin' dough
I'm tryna put a bitch on payroll
I got bank, nigga, bankroll
She gon' do what a nigga say so
Buss it open with your friends, bitch, your friends, bitch
Keep goin', I'ma spend, bitch, spend, bitch
Every city, I got M's, bitch, M's, bitch
I write her breakin' off as an expense, bitch
She like her face in the pillow
And the thong-th-thong like Sisq√≥
If Lil' Jon said get low
Well, bitch, get low

Put your ass in my hands
I'm the rubber band man
I'm the rubber band
I'm the rubber band
Put your ass in my hands
I'm the rubber band man
I'm the rubber band
I'm the rubber band (yeah, ha)

Must be your ass 'cause it ain't your face
You a tip drill, I spent three mill (milli)
On a brand new whip, bought my bitch new tits
I wanna tittyfuck, I'm on a sex pill (ha)
Got a condom in my wallet, finna fuck on the bop
Squeeze it too hard, ass shots might pop
Got her head lock, leg lock
Old Young Money make her bed rock
I slide the pussy like a waterpark (splash)
Young heartthrob, I break a bitch heart (break it)
All your new hoes, I done had 'em from the start
Light-skin nigga, but I fuck her in the dark (in the dark, in the dark)
In the dark, in the dark, make a baby (make a baby)
I'ma fuck that bitch like she paid me (baby, pay me)
She said, "Why you don't treat me like a lady?"
'Cause, bitch, you ain't a lady (ha)

Put your ass in my hands (bitch)
I'm the rubber band man
I'm the rubber band
I'm the rubber band
Put your ass in my hands
I'm the rubber band man
I'm the rubber band
I'm the rubber band
