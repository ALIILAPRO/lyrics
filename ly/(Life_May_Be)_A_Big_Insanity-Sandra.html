		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun came up this morning
Broke into my room
I turned the TV on
The sun was red
I heard about the news
That turned me upside down

It's hard when you see it
There's torture and pain
I still have this feeling
There's something left to say

Life may be a big insanity
But love will conquer hate to all eternity
Don't you know
We are strong
Life may be a big insanity
But there is more to life than reality
Cause our hearts
Make us strong

Picking up the phone
The pictures always change
Children playin' in the streets
Talking to somebody
I can only watch
Til i get on my feet

Dark times and mean crimes
They can't beat my dreams
The eyes of a child tell me
Something's left to say

Life may be a big insanity
But love will conquer hate to all eternity
Don't you know
We are strong
Life may be a big insanity
But there is more to life than reality
Cause our hearts make us strong
