		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got the devil in your eyes
You went and took me by surprise
Say what you wanna say I won't go back
If you wanna hit the road then let's go then
Let's just go and see the world and just show them
What it really means to live life golden

Yeah we're golden, baby girl we're golden
They about to see us shine 'cause we're golden
They can never break us down 'cause we're golden
They about to see us glow 'cause we're golden

Yeah we're golden, baby girl we're golden
They about to see us shine 'cause we're golden
They can never break us down 'cause we're golden
They about to see us glow 'cause we're golden

You've got the devil in your eyes
You went and took me by surprise
Say what you wanna say I won't go back
If you wanna hit the road then let's go then
Let's just go and see the world and just show them
What it really means to live life golden

Yeah we're golden, baby girl we're golden
They about to see us shine 'cause we're golden
They can never break us down 'cause we're golden
They about to see us glow 'cause we're golden

Yeah we're golden, baby girl we're golden
They about to see us shine 'cause we're golden
They can never break us down 'cause we're golden
They about to see us glow 'cause we're golden
