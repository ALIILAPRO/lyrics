		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving slow
Know that I have been down this road
Déjà vu I'm emotional
I'm drifting
I try control
Steer to places that I should know
Thought that I had been here before
I'm drifting
I'm losing all the patience
I'm going crazy
Oh drinking bottles full of tears and fears I cannot cope with this mess
Maybe I'm psycho
But aren't we all mental
Without rules and order
I'm a danger
To myself
We always play victim
It's just an addiction
Dying to masquerade
Our flaws while they still chase us
Animals
Say we're not
But we acting so
All reactive
Take nothing slow
Better watch coz I'm comin I'm runnin
It's pitiful
Everything's outta my control
Hate and love they all come and go
I'm crashing
I'm losing all the patience
I'm going crazy
Oh drinking bottles full of tears and fears I cannot cope with this mess
Maybe I'm psycho
But aren't we all mental
Without rules and order
I'm a danger
To myself
We always play victim
It's just an addiction
Dying to masquerade
Our flaws while they still chase us
Feel my aftermath
Baby cause I'm a psychopath
It's the most fun I've ever had
Some say I've gone mad
Maybe I am and I'll be damned
But it's the most fun I've ever had
Maybe I'm psycho
But aren't we all mental
Without rules and order
I'm a danger
To myself
We always play victim
It's just an addiction
Dying to masquerade
Our flaws while they still chase us
