		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the corner 
Beside my window
Hangs a lonely photograph
There is a reason 
I never notice it
Memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place

Gone through days 
Without talking 
There is a comfort in silence 
So used to losing 
All ambition 
And struggling to maintain what's left

There is a wound that's always bleeding 
There is a road I'm always walking 
And I know you'll never return to this place 

Once undone
There's only smoke 
Burning in my eyes to blind 
To cover up 
What really happened 
And force the darkness onto me

There is a wound that's always bleeding 
There is a road I'm always walking 
And I know you'll never return to this place
