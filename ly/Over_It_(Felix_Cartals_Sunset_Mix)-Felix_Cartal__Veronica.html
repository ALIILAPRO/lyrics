		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought you were worth it, worth it
I thought we'd be perfect, perfect
But I wasn't ready yet
Maybe I wasn't ready yet
I thought things were different, different
I thought we'd be different, different
But I wasn't ready yet
Maybe I wasn't ready yet

Can I fall into a dream
Let it go, I'm done trying
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now

I'm over it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm over it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

If we'd only try that, try that
Could we make us better, better
If I was ready
Maybe if I was ready
If overthinking is this
Maybe ignorance is bliss?
If I was ready
Maybe if I was ready, ooh

Can I fall into a dream
Let it go, I'm done trying
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
Can I fall into a dream
Let it go, I'm done trying
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now
I wanna be higher now

I'm over it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm over it
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

(Ooh) I'm over it
(Ooh) I'm over it
(Ooh) I'm over it
I'm over it
