		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by

The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man

You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
Tell me who am I to blame?

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part

Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

Now the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause say we've got to part

Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong
