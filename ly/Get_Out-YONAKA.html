		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody thinks that we're insane
Just because we do not think the same
They wanna see us go our separate ways, no way
I am happy just to hear you breathe
The only medicine I'll ever need
And you don't pour out fucking sympathy, no fakery

All I wanna do is get out
I wanna do is get out
All I wanna do is get out of here
All I wanna do is get out, get out of here, ooh get out

You're so evil yet so beautiful (so beautiful)
You pick me up so you can watch me fall (watch me fall)
But you're the only one to make me feel anything at all

'Cause you, you make my heart beat faster
'Til I cannot breathe, think I need a doctor
We're alive in here but will we survive out there, out there

All I wanna do is get out
I wanna do is get out
All I wanna do is get out of here
All I wanna do is get out, get out of here, ooh get out

Ooh, get out
Ooh, get out
Ooh, get out

Ooh, get out
Ooh, get out
Ooh, get out

'Cause you, you make my heart beat faster
'Til I cannot breathe, think I need a doctor
We're alive in here, but will we survive out there, out there?

All I wanna do is get out
I wanna do is get out
All I wanna do is get out of here
All I wanna do is get out, get out of here, ooh get out
All I wanna do is get out
I wanna do is get out
All I wanna do is get out of here
All I wanna do is get out
I wanna do is get out
All I wanna do is get out
