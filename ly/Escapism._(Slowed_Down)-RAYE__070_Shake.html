		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or somethin'
I ordered two more wines, 'cause tonight I want him

A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in this shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
Fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and that shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch
High heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sipping champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffing cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was looking for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor
I don't wanna feel

Toke this joint how I'm blowing this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not 24 hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state
I'm as high as your hopes that you'll make it to my bed
Get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick
Know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in

Just a heart broke bitch
High heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sipping champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffing cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was looking for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor
I don't wanna feel (what?)

'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch, too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what, street small but it go both ways
So, you'll run, bitch, you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're asking me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're asking me my symptoms, doctor
I don't wanna feel

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Hiding, hiding, how I feel last night

(Go)

Lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am
Or who's driving the fucking car
Speeding down the highway sippin'
Mixing pills with the liquor
'Cause fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (uh-uh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (uh-uh)
I remember nothing so there's nothing to regret (uh-uh)
Other than this 4/4 kick drum poundin' in my head (hm)
