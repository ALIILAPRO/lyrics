		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born of the darkness
From granted eyes beyond
Dreams of the deep mist
They hide a scratching song
There's a primal fear that death is near
Writhing now in wait am I past the veil
Consciousness failing i hear a wicked fate

Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
The tolls of madness ringing do you fear it?
Do you fear it? An ancient choir is singing
All consuming calling to me
In a dream, it's a thorn I can't dig out
Can't you hear it too?
If you listen close now

Lulled to the madness
I have seen what I can't know
Glimpsed at a nightmare
To fester and to grow in this empty home
Of flesh and bone a presence left unseen
Lying awake in bed my hollowed head will
Call back through the dream

Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
The tolls of madness ringing do you fear it?
Do you fear it? An ancient choir is singing
All consuming calling to me
In a dream, it's a thorn I can't dig out
Can't you hear it too?
If you listen close now

I feel it humming deep inside the walls
The dark vibrations
Whispered acts unspeakable
Horrible, reachable, audible
I'm pressured to awaken my own sight
To generations ancient ones malevolent
Reckoning, pestilent, beckoning

Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
The tolls of madness ringing do you fear it?
Do you fear it? An ancient choir is singing
All consuming calling to me
In a dream, it's a thorn I can't dig out
Can't you hear it too?

Can you hear them calling out?

Can you hear it? Can you hear it?
Do you fear it? Do you fear it?
