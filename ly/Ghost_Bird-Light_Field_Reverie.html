		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe in the lustre
The seeds that sow
Dreadful splendour
Deeper down the spiral
A living sermon
Withered and destroyed the keeper of light
We shouldn’t have come here
Re-aligned by our afflictions
A twisted luminescence blooms inside
We'll soon be gone
Taken over by the glow
Incandescence multiplied in our cells
Through the cosmic door
I have travelled far beyond
I rise from the water
A ghost imbued
With shining aether
I reach for my reflection
A mirror-image
Shattered by the beast I became myself
We shouldn’t have come here
Re-aligned by our afflictions
A twisted luminescence blooms inside
We'll soon be gone
Taken over by the glow
Incandescence multiplied in our cells
Wilderness of aberration
Re-defining the ions in me
Shades of spectres that never sleep
In this garden of anomalies
Reincarnate the secrets I keep
In this ardent unearthly skin
Dissolved into radiant dreams
In this garden of anomalies
Devoured by all that I've seen
In this ardent unearthly skin
