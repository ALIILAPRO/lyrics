		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh-huh
I don't even know
How we get here
Yup
The big two
And the big heart

I'm rollin' something, so I know what the feeling's 'bout
I know you got dreams, so it's time you live it out
We was outside, they was in the house
Got so much game that I wanna give it out
My ten year old at home the only thing I'll spend about
And you ain't gotta make a choice right now, just feel it out
Make your worst your best day, rollin' papers essay
Get this money, let's save

See a hater, let's wave (let's wave, let's wave, let's wave)
Let's wave (let's wave, let's wave)
See a hater, let's wave (let's wave, let's wave, let's wave)
Let's wave (let's wave)
I can't help but give this love away

We arrived here and we don't know how
On the way, hope I don't let you down
Lotta favors done, but who's keeping count?
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)

And I ain't tryna turn it down
What's with it? Don't get nervous now
Know your purpose, you been here for days
Ain't goin' nowhere

See a hater, let's wave (let's wave, let's wave, let's wave)
Let's wave (let's wave, let's wave)
See a hater, let's wave (let's wave, let's wave, let's wave)
Let's wave (let's wave)
I can't help but give this love away

We arrived here and we don't know how
On the way, hope I don't let you down
Lotta favors done, but who's keeping count?
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)

Falling from the clouds
Finding no one's there
That's exactly when you need me
Now we're in the air

We arrived here and we don't know how
On the way, hope I don't let you down
Lotta favors done, but who's keeping count?
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)

Y'all know nothin' about that
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
But I'ma show you about that, real quick
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
It's a Taylor thing
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
Yeah, yup
What's wrong with peace and love right now? (Right now)
Uh
