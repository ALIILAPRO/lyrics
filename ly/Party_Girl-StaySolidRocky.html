		<p>
		  Girls just wanna have fun 
So they party, so they party
(Ayo Nashi, you go crazy)

Lil' mama a party girl 
She just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care, I want you (whoa, whoa)
She like to do drugs too 
She in love with guns too (whoa, whoa)
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)

Lil' mama a party girl 
She just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care, I want you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
She like to do drugs too 
She in love with guns too (whoa, whoa)
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you

She don't want nobody
She don't need somebody
I'm tryna be with you so you don't be without me
She tote 'em just like me, no we can't leave without it
She boo'd up off the meds like she can't breathe without it
She drinkin' Four Lokos, I can't get with those
She wan' gimme throat throat, I tell her come close
She say, "You say you love me, but I don't know what love means"
I ask her who got her heart 'cause damn that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me (whoa, whoa)
She just wanna party, and nothing's wrong with that (whoa, whoa)
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back (oh yeah)
I told her call me Rocky, she say she not gon' call me that (whoa, whoa)
You say you come with a lot, well baby I want all of that

Lil' mama a party girl 
She just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care, I want you (whoa, whoa)
She like to do drugs too 
She in love with guns too (whoa, whoa)
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)

Lil' mama a party girl 
She just wan' have fun too
They say you ain't wifey type but I don't care, I want you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
She like to do drugs too 
She in love with guns too (whoa, whoa)
They say you too piped up but I think that I love you

(Whoa, whoa)
Don't be scared to party, don't be scared to party
(Whoa, whoa)
Don't be scared to party
(Whoa, whoa)
