		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
(Oh, is that Kaniel again?)
Oh
(Ayy, bring it, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back)
Oh, yeah

Laid up, got me thinkin', babe
Tell me if you with it 'cause I'm with it, babe
I haven't heard from you in a minute, babe
Just tell me what to do when I get it, babe
Gucci and Prada

Trips to your crib in the middle of the night
I know that you miss me 'cause I put it down right
Damn, babe, I can put you on a flight
You know that a nigga like me can change your life

Oh, baby, everythin' you do is amazin'
Ain't nobody watchin', go crazy
I got what you need
Everybody think you shy but I know you a freak
Lil' baby (oh), everythin' you do is amazin' (yeah)
Ain't nobody watchin', go crazy (yeah)
I got what you need (yeah)
Everybody think you shy but I know you a freak
Lil' baby (yeah)

I been overseas goin' crazy (yeah)
I can tell you love it when we made up (ayy)
Black and gray diamonds like a Raider (Raider)
Orange peel, your love is real (yeah)
Lovin' skills, I need some lovin' skills (yeah)
Left my dirty drawers and you love me still (yeah)
Eyes come lazy, but she is real (yeah)
Dressed to kill (yeah, yeah, yeah)
We can bum-bum 'til you're tired (oh)
I can put a stone by your eye (oh)
I can say you never switchin' sides
You never tell me lies
Not rushin', tyin' ties (yeah)

Trips to your crib in the middle of the night
I know that you miss me 'cause I put it down right
Damn, babe, I can put you on a flight
You know that a nigga like me can change your life

Oh, baby, everythin' you do is amazin'
Ain't nobody watchin', go crazy
(I got what you need) I got what you need
Everybody think you shy but I know you a freak
Lil' baby 

Yeah, get me lit
Hoes on my phone when they find out that I'm rich
Then they switch, when they see I'm choosin' on my bitch
Top down, got her doin' donuts on the dick, yeah
Pose for the flick
Damn it, bust it, baby, watch you do it on a split
She don't need no hands or no pants, do your dance
Poppin' rubber bands, hit the dash, make it fast (oh)
(Ayy, bring it, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back)
Yeah, waitin' by me phone, just to dick you down, down
Let me put it down, down
Now put it down, down
Watch me put it down, down
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back)
Put it down, down

Trips to your crib in the middle of the night
I know that you miss me 'cause I put it down right
Damn, babe, I can put you on a flight
You know that a nigga like me can change your life

Oh, baby, everythin' you do is amazin'
Ain't nobody watchin', go crazy
I got what you need
Everybody think you shy but I know you a freak
Lil' baby (oh), everythin' you do is amazin' 
Ain't nobody watchin', go crazy 
I got what you need 
Everybody think you shy but I know you a freak
Lil' baby
