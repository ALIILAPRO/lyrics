		  (La-da-da-dum)
(La-da-da-dum)

Oh, the zombies on the streets
Yeah, they're looking for a feast
Screaming "Man down, yeah
That's another one deceased"
And they're plotting and scheming
And committing treason
Like it's hunting season
You better believe there

Ain't no rest for the wicked
New blood, better go get vicious
You better, you better sharpen up your

Knives
If you wanna make it through the
Night
You better remember that you
Can never trust nobody
Take the gloves off, things get ugly
Knives
Sharpen your knives (um, okay, like)

Knife to a gunfight, shit is getting sticky
Kill you with a smile, now you're bleeding out your feelings
It get wicked, wicked, wicked, when I'm coming to your city
Leave you H-A-U-N-T-E-D, rest in pieces, bitch
Moon shaped blade in the cut, black cat whip for the luck
Hellhounds, hellhounds, all my dogs really out for your blood
Gunblade, bitch, I'm versatile
I love knives, it's personal
Put a motherfucker in my grave right quick
Like get some sleep, you work tomorrow, bitch

Ain't no rest for the wicked
New blood, better go get vicious
You better, you better (sharpen up your)

Knives
If you wanna make it through the
Night
You better remember that you
Can never trust nobody
Take the gloves off, things get ugly
Knives
Sharpen your knives

Ain't no rest for the wicked
New blood, better go get vicious
Bleed with me, rock with me
Cutter gonna talk for me
No heroes, no villains
No sympathy, just venom
Moon shaped blade
Send 'em to the grave
Ain't no rest for the wicked
New blood, better go get vicious
Bleed with me, rock with me
Cutter gonna talk for me
No heroes, no villains
Just do it for the thrill and
Sharpen up your

Knives
If you wanna make it through the
Night
You better remember that you
Can never trust nobody
Take the gloves off, things get ugly
Knives
Sharpen your knives
