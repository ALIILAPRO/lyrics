		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, woo
Yeah
Oh
Yeah, yeah
I said, I feel invincible
They like, "Papi what you get into?"
I pop a Perc, go retarded, wait
Haha, hahaha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, woo, yeah 
Grrr, yeah, yeah

I said I feel invincible
It's a hunnid niggas in the spot
I'm walkin' through 'em (I'm walkin' thorugh 'em)
It's eighty-five just to walk through
I don't talk to these niggas (nah)
'Cause a lot of these niggas be corny (corny)
I'm feelin' horny (I'm feelin' horny)
And I shoot like Robert Horry
I'm off this percolater shit
I got a percolated bitch
I give her this percolated dick
I show her this percolated tricks
Pop Smoke, they know who in the city
Pop Smoke, nigga you could ask Diddy
Pop Smoke, bust up a citi or TD
Pop Smoke, goin' fifty for fifty

I pop a Perc, go retarded then shoot up the party
Then change the artillery 
Energy, I'm givin' nothin' but energy
I give her Perky and Hennessy
I give two shots to the enemy, hope he remember me
What the fuck a nigga tellin' me?
I spent two-hunnid-fifty on my fist 
I spent two-hunnid-fifty on my bitch, double G
Niggas know I'm a threat
Walk in the spot and turn everybody Crip
DJ Clue, my nigga fuck with the Woos
Tell Spinking to play it back
While the Woos throw the bag
You know I'm shootin' for the stars
Aimin' for the moon
I shoot at any opp (opp)
'Cause niggas know I'm Woo
Send a nigga to the medic
Everything raw, no edit
Pop Smoke, did it

I said I feel invincible
It's a hunnid niggas in the spot
I'm walkin' through 'em (I'm walkin' thorugh 'em)
It's eighty-five just to walk through
I don't talk to these niggas (nah)
'Cause a lot of these niggas be corny (corny)
I'm feelin' horny (I'm feelin' horny)
And I shoot like Robert Horry
I'm off this percolater shit
I got a percolated bitch
I give her this percolated dick
I show her this percolated tricks
Pop Smoke, they know who in the city
Pop Smoke, nigga you could ask Diddy
Pop Smoke, bust up a citi or TD
Pop Smoke, goin' fifty for fifty
