		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world spit me out and I was spinning around
Lost in a free fall
Forever going down, and breakin' through the ground
When I thought I reached the end, I start to fall again

But I was taught
To never surrender
When it's hard to get up
Gonna fight till I can stand and say

Oh, you can turn me down, you can throw me now
The harder out, the harder I come back around
You can break my heart but you can't scratch my name
I can take the hit 'cause I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang

Now I'm 10 feet tall, all my problems feel so small
Nothing in my way to make me change
No ceiling to my sky, just open space to fly
Every time I'm feeling down, I turn it back around

But I was taught
To never surrender
When it's hard to get up
Gonna fight till I can stand and say

Oh, you can turn me down, you can throw me now
The harder out, the harder I come back around
You can break my heart but you can't scratch my name
I can take the hit 'cause I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang

Even though I'm flying high
The sky can change one day
I can hit some turbulence, but who I am is never gonna change
'Cause I'm a boomerang
'Cause I'm a boomerang
'Cause I'm a boomerang

Oh, you can turn me down, you can throw me now
The harder out, the harder I come back around
You can break my heart but you can't scratch my name
I can take the hit 'cause I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang
Oh, whoa, oh whoa, oh whoa I'm a boomerang (boomerang)
