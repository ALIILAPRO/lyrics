		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think the sadness has come again
Green velvet in a passing den
No bloodiness, her gold earring
Right aside for you
Nothing will be bad for me then too
I just wanna put my arms 'round you
And whisper
I'm on one percent but I'm there with you

I know I fantasize
Although I don't even mind
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need in my life

Through polymer dunes I dance tonight
With you frozen under mirrored lights
No ways out, only ways into my heart
As the calling seems to grow again
It's a problem that I can't repair
Always with you
Always

I know I fantasize
Although I don't even mind
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need in my life

Time's run out (in my life)
Nowhere real (in my life)
In the hills (in my life)
What I feel (on my own, on my own, on my own)
On my own
(Even) time run out
I need you

Ways into my heart
Need you, I need you, I need you, I need you

If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need in my life

I know I fantasize
Although I don't even mind
If you're good for me
Then I'm good for you
And that's all I need in my life

Time's run out (in my life) (need you)
Nowhere real (in my life)
In the hills (in my life)
Is what I feel (in my life, in my life, in my life, in my life)
(Need you, I need you, I need you, I need you)
On my own
Time run out (if you're good for me, then I'm good for you)
I need you (and that's all I need in my life)
