		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can sense it I've convinced myself that the world I love is gone
The blood is on the walls, the damage has been done
We carry the weight of selfless scars (scars)
We silently crave, upon a pedestal (we place our pain)

One quandary for the counsel, too humble to brag
Cut the venom out, but the snake still buries its fangs
So when you take a look deep inside yourself
It swells and it stings (stings)
Like a chemical reaction (burning your brain)
In lies the weight of our regrets
Sharpen the knives that cut through our deepest strings of hate
Show me the love you've always wanted

All the love is gone, driven apart by what we all have seen
We're falling over ourselves
How do we mourn what's lost, what never will be?
Remember me, remember me as you loved me

Carry the weight of selfless scars we silently crave
Show me your hands and touch the stars with me
We're never just on one path, one road to travel it seems
Our story's infinite and we've just been pulling at the strings
And now there never will be

We have exercised the will of parasites
Witness the birth of innocence (our call to grow)

All the love is gone, driven apart by what we all have seen
We're falling over ourselves
How do we mourn what's lost, what never will be?
Remember me, remember me as you loved me

Carry the weight of selfless scars, we silently crave
Show me your hands and touch the stars with me
(Falling walls like mountains form where I stand)
You are my family, and I will not let hate be my last sin
