		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you gotta lie, boy?
You know how it drives me mad
But every time you cry, boy
I give chances I don't have

These images flash, making me go blind
You're looking in my eyes, but I'm lost inside my mind
Your hands around her waist
Your lips go in to taste, and now I can't erase

I went to war with my mind for you
Every day all alone in my room
Wonder what you're doing now, who you're with, full of doubt
Every day I feel the same it feels like I'm drowning
I went to war with my mind for you
Every day all alone in my room
Wonder what I'm doing here, second chance, full of fear
Every day I feel the same, can someone just hold me?

Maybe I'm crazy
Just call me psycho
This isn't love, it's insanity
Everything's hazy
Memories hate me
This isn't love, it's anxiety
Imma burn down this house just so I'll forget
So I'll stop falling down when you kiss me next

These images flash, making me go blind
You're looking in my eyes, but I'm lost inside my mind
Your hands around her waist
Your lips go in to taste, and now I can't erase

I went to war with my mind for you
Every day all alone in my room
Wonder what you're doing now, who you're with, full of doubt
Every day I feel the same it feels like I'm drowning
I went to war with my mind for you
Every day all alone in my room
Wonder what I'm doing here, second chance, full of fear
Every day I feel the same, can someone just hold me?

A fight with a bleeding heart tears me apart
The love that it spills is toxic it kills
A fight with my bleeding heart, I've got the scars
You're bad for my health, so I tell myself (so I tell myself)
This isn't love, it's insanity
This isn't love, it's anxiety 
This isn't love, it's insanity 
This isn't love, it's anxiety (so I tell myself)
This isn't love, it's insanity
This isn't love, it's anxiety
This isn't love, it's insanity 
This isn't love, it's anxiety (so I tell myself!)

I went to war with my mind for you
Every day all alone in my room
Wonder what you're doing now, who you're with, full of doubt
Every day I feel the same it feels like I'm drowning
I went to war with my mind for you
Every day all alone in my room
Wonder what I'm doing here, second chance, full of fear
Every day I feel the same, can someone just hold me?
