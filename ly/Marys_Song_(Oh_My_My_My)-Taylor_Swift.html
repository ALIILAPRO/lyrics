		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I

Daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM, ridin' in your truck
And all I need 
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight
You stayed outside 
Oh, my, my, my, my

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, "I do," 
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time
