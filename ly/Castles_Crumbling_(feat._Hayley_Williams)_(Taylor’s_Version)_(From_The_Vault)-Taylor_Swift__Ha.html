		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me

My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (just let you down)
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now, now
