		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I stop my heart from beating for you
when you stopped all of my wounds from bleeding 
it’s true 

Whenever I am feeling you close 
I don’t know how I could let you go 
Whenever your hand touches mine 
I’d let you ruin the rest of my life 

How do i stop myself from falling for you 
when you keep pushing myself off the edge and you know that you do 

Now Whenever I am feeling you close 
I don’t know how I could let you go
Whenever your hand touches mine
I’d let you ruin the rest of my life 

Ever since you said out my name
I haven’t heard it sound the same
Ever since you stepped into the light 
I’d let you ruin the rest of my life 

Ever since you said out my name
I haven’t heard it sound the same
Ever since you stepped into the light 
I’d let you ruin the rest of my life 

How do I stop my heart from beating for you?
