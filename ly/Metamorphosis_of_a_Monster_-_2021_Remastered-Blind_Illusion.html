		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inspired by insanity
No cure for the mind's disease
No drug to ease the pain
No undoing what's been done

No loss is a gain
You've tortured mother earth
Soon you all will burn

Nothing's sacred
No one is pure
What we've been taught
Has changed through the years

What truth are lies?
What lies are truth?
Madness as my disguise
I do what I do

This world created holy
Is tortured and haunted
Metamorphosis of a monster

Just goes to show
Not all are Satan's slaves
Supposed holy doing his dirty work
They're digging the earth's own grave
One grave...

The bowels of the earth
Are ready to give birth
The death noise will crack the sky

A moments reflection
Mirrored imperfection
Then all madness will subside

One day the whales will walk the earth
The hunter will become the hunted
Mammoth will unearth itself from the tomb of hibernation
He will sprout wings and fly

Man will be consumed by fire then condemned to the sea
Burning eternally with salty water in the lung
Reborn, Reformed, The humble will adorn a new way
Without treachery or scorn
