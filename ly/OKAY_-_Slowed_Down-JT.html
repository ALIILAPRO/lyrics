		<p>
		  Where my bad bitches at?

I'm pretty than a motherfucker, hoes be lookin' okay (yeah)
She think that she fuckin' with me, is this bitch okay?
He said he ain't fuckin' 'round, I look at him like, "Okay"
I used to be down bad, but now a bitch okay
I'm pretty than a motherfucker, hoes be lookin' okay
She think that she fuckin' with me, is this bitch okay?
He said he ain't fuckin' 'round, I look at him like, "Okay"
I used to be down bad, but now a bitch okay

Down South bad bitch, this skreet shit so ratchet
Call me JT, a.k.a. The Soul Snatcher (okay)
I'm with a booster, a scammer and a pole dancer
Pussy nigga call my phone, he won't get no answer (nah)
Fuck these niggas (fuck 'em), and fuck these hoes too
You can't fuck with me, fuck what a bitch told you (okay)
Sexy black motherfucker (yeah)
Heat game on the wood, I'm watchin' Jimmy Butler (swish)
Since I came home, I've been killing every summer (facts)
Real boss bitch and I started as a runner (swipe)
Titties sittin' pretty and I'm lookin' like a snack
Forty-inch bust down and you know that bitch black

I'm pretty than a motherfucker, hoes be lookin' okay
She think that she fuckin' with me, is this bitch okay?
He said he ain't fuckin' 'round, I look at him like, "Okay"
I used to be down bad, but now a bitch okay
I'm pretty than a motherfucker, hoes be lookin' okay
She think that she fuckin' with me, is this bitch okay?
He said he ain't fuckin' 'round, I look at him like, "Okay"
I used to be down bad, but now a bitch okay

Do not disturb, bitch, I'm with my nigga (okay)
Iced out nameplate and it's from my nigga (ice)
Bitch say she pregnant, it ain't from my nigga (nah)
I don't pay for shit, it's all on my nigga (bitch)
Maserati mami and the roof missin' (skrrt)
She ate crab legs, now her whole tooth missin'
Cheap-ass veneers, you stay talkin' shit
Put a marker to this bitch, she's so counterfeit
I'm the baddie and the CEO (bad)
Got the bitches shakin' ass in videos (bad)
In the cut, gettin' high wit' a emo ho
We in runway, you bitches in dark shadow
Whoa

I'm pretty than a motherfucker, hoes be lookin' okay
She think that she fuckin' with me, is this bitch okay?
He said he ain't fuckin' 'round, I look at him like, "Okay"
I used to be down bad, but now a bitch okay
I'm pretty than a motherfucker, hoes be lookin' okay
She think that she fuckin' with me, is this bitch okay?
He said he ain't fuckin' 'round, I look at him like, "Okay"
I used to be down bad, but now a bitch okay
