		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember 
Before the rain came down 
You were so full of life 
So bring that right back round 

It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 

Billy was a youth on the way to school 
Hum an him bredin 
Deh ina everything togeda 
Gyal dem catchin' 
Go ina di club a night time 
Bubblin' pan di rydim 
After the school year 
Done Billy did loose sight of him 
Many many time pas by 
An him hear 
Him friend hustin' 
Drop ina di trap fi di double 
An him receive bullit 
Billy feel bad bredin dead an bury 
It's a rainy da 
Yeah the sun will shine 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 
It will turn out right 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
Yeah 

What a very terable thing 
When the family dem strugglin' 
Billy is another example 
Of what rainy day bring 
Better uno cool an calm 
Over di sufferin' 

Live up 
Di life cah lafe worth di livin 

It's a rainy day 
Yeah the sun will shine 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 
It will turn out right 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
Yeah 

Yes da bad times in life is like a telephone 
You never know when it ago ring 
But when it ring 
Just pick it up an receive 
When you finish 
Put down the receiver and carry on 
'Cause the sun will always shine 

It's a rainy day 
Yeah the sun will shine 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 
Yeah the shine will shine 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
It's a rainy day 
It will turn out right 
It's a rainy day 

It's a rainy day 
Yeah
