		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My kitty's like a python
Tick-ticking like a time bomb
Limited edition, gotta buy it with no try on
I purr just like a lion
Knock 'em out like Tyson
Everybody knows that I'm a million dollar diamond

I'm reckless, offensive
I destroy your defenses
My guestlist is priceless
And yes, I run a tight ship
Bentleys and Benzes
Through cash-colored lenses
Them dollars and cents-es
Cha-ching

It's expensive to be me (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Looking this good don't come for free (ayy)
Uh, bitch what? 
That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me

You like these Georgia peaches
You're mad you can't compete with
I changed the game, now say my name
"Hi bitch, it's nice to meet yas"
I text you off the runway
My money origami
I'm Haute couture on a world tour
From Tokyo to Bombay

I'm reckless, offensive
I destroy your defenses
My guestlist is priceless
And yes, I run a tight ship
Bentleys and Benzes
Through cash-colored lenses
Them dollars and cents-es
Cha-ching

It's expensive to be me (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Looking this good don't come for free (ayy, ayy, ayy)
It's expensive to be me (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Looking this good don't come for free (ayy)
Uh, bitch what? 
That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me

Let me smash that club like brah brah
Them DSLs like mwah, mwah
Looking at me like snack, snack
Gonna eat this ass like smack, smack
Queen's right, now kings left
Drop down, expensive
And I still don't give a fuck

It's expensive to be me (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Looking this good don't come for free (ayy, ayy, ayy)
It's expensive to be me (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Looking this good don't come for free (ayy)
Uh, bitch what? 
That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me

(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
(Ayy, ayy)
That's just who I be, it's expensive to be me
