		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna be alone
I don't know what you want
cnd I feel like you don't wanna talk at all

I need a sign before you leave
Not a word or a kiss
cll I want is your love next to me

You don't wanna talk to me
Since you told me all about your favorite things
Everyday we used to hang out by the beach
Now all you do is spend your time away from me 
cway from me

You got me walking up
cnd down the tightrope babe
You got me feeling like I'm on a wire
You got me walking up
cnd down the tightrope babe
Please don't tell me your love wasn't meant for me

I don't wanna be alone
I don't know what you want
cnd I feel like you don't wanna talk at all

I need a sign before you leave
Not a word or a kiss
cll I want is your love next to me

Yeah I don't
I don't

You said 
la la la la la
Nothing was the same again
La La La La la
Your voice just echoes in my head
La la la la la
You don't try to understand
La La La la la
La La La La La

Please don't tell me your love wasn't meant for me

I don't wanna be alone
I don't know what you want
cnd I feel like you don't wanna talk at all

I need a sign before you leave
Not a word or a kiss
cll I want is your love next to me

Yeah I don't
I don't
