		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

For a moment, I knew cosmic love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him"
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

For a moment, I was heavenstruck

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him" (fuck it if I can't have him)
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (down bad)
Down bad (wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's-
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
"Fuck it if I can't have him" (can't have him)
"I might just die, it would make no difference"
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

Down bad (like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (down bad)
Down bad (wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him
