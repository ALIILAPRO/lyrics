		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you go to bed then when will I see you
If I'm not enough then how can I be with you, anymore

Cause i'm not your savior
I'm just a man with a thousand endings
No, just a boy
Whose favor
Lacks the heart to last
I'm just a boy, a boy with a thousand endings

Feels like ten thousand nights, since I will have seen you (seen you)
I'd say I've moved on, but I still think of you, (think of you)
Even more

Even more
Cus I'm not one to dwell on you
Cut you off for my own good

Cause I'm not your savior
I'm just a man with a thousand endings
No, just a boy
Whose favor
Lacks the heart to last
I'm just a boy, a boy with a thousand endings
And you're just a girl, a girl who will just forget me
