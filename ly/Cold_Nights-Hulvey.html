		<p>
		  Woah

I know I seen cold nights
I don't wanna go back, I just wanna be better
Cold nights, and I'm prayin' that it don't last forever
I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I said I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I said I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I know I got a purpose, a purpose

Yeah, tryna survive through them cold nights, uh
Heard you packing up your pleasures but you not alright, uh, yeah
You hold it in, they say, don't cry
But I could see the pain deep in both eyes

But you can't hide
Tryna stay in the lines
I know they think we thriving but we barely alive
I know they think they feeling what I'm feeling inside
Been thirsty for this healing, life been leaving me dry, ooh-woah
I just hope they listen
Will they go the distance?
I know something's missing
Tryna change but I can't get away

I know I seen cold nights
I don't wanna go back, I just wanna be better
Cold nights, and I'm prayin' that it don't last forever

I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I said I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I said I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I know I got a purpose, a purpose

Back, forth, forth and back
Your heart can't heal when you're chained to the past
Try to cover up, but the lies won't last
Three in the morning but the drink can't fill the cracks

Ayy, send me a new day
Trapped up in my mind, I need a whole runway
Take this weight up off of me before it's too late
I done did so many things that I can't change, yeah

In these cold, cold nights
I'm tired of tryna fight
Can you save a man as I?
Can you save a man as I?

I know I seen cold nights
I don't wanna go back, I just wanna be better
Cold nights, and I'm prayin' that it don't last forever

I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I said I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I said I know I got a purpose, a purpose
I know I got a purpose, a purpose, yeah
