		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived till now
I tell them I don't know

I guess they understand 
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand

And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me 'n' the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me

And you love me, too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do

The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but life is dead
That is my belief

And yes, I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
