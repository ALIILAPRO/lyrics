		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the nights I'm feelin' anxious
Overthinkin' everything
Darling, I just wanna thank you
For the way you comfort me
Only you could stop the madness
Only you could still the air
Only you could show compassion
When the world has none to spare

I won't ask you to fix it or make it right
Don't need you to know all the reasons why
Don't have to sing me a lullaby, turn down the lights

And hold me, hold me
Come and lay your head down beside me
Let me listen to the sound of your heartbeat
Baby, just hold me
I need you to hold me
When nothin' else could make me feel worthy
Wrap me in your love, tower over me
Just hold me

You've always been my sanctuary
You make me feel just like a child
You take away the weight I carry
For just a little while

Won't you hold me (hold me, hold me)
Hold me
Come and lay your head down beside me (beside me)
Let me listen to the sound of your heartbeat
Baby, just hold me
I need you to hold me (hold me, yeah)
When nothin' else could make me feel worthy (worthy)
Wrap me in your love, tower over me
Just hold me

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, woah
Hold me, hold me, yeah, yeah

Hold me, hold me
Come and lay your head down beside me
Let me listen to the sound of your heartbeat
Baby, just hold me
I need you to hold me (hold me, hold me, hold me)
When nothin' else could make me feel worthy (worthy)
Wrap me in your love, tower over me, yeah
Just hold me
