		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This ain't no game, nigga
How in the fuck you figure?
You try punkin' us
You'll feel the blast of my trigger
Straight from the honeycomb
Smokin' on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back
Then the bodies stack
This ain't no game, nigga
How in the fuck you figure?
You try punkin' us
You'll feel the blast of my trigger
Straight from the honeycomb
Smokin' on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back
Then the bodies stack
This ain't no game, nigga
How in the fuck you figure?
You try punkin' us
You'll feel the blast of my trigger
Straight from the honeycomb
Smokin' on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back
Then the bodies stack

Fill up my cup to the tip, it's a must
I'ma pour above the rim, 2Pac with the tuss
I could mix a combination, lil' 'Tech
Lil' Act'
Show up deep like conversation, let me live
Let me act real talk, vision vivid
I done seen body bags
Toe-for-toe with any victim
I done shook killers' hands
Talking money over grams
Wrapping bricks up with saran
Couple homies off the tan, air you out
You a fan hmm, well I'll be God damned
But God don't exist so I guess it's just damn
From a whole 'nother planet
Hoppin' out the Trans-Am, Smokey the Bandit
Swerv-swervin' in my spaceship
Dipping in my stash shit
They cannot relate shit
Never on no fake shit, lames wanna jump shift
Stack 'em up like 'roids, bitch, bye

This ain't no game, nigga
How in the fuck you figure?
You try punkin' us
You'll feel the blast of my trigger
Straight from the honeycomb
Smokin' on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back
Then the bodies stack

Swervin' in that 'burban
Couple murders make the bodies stack
Got a problem, then kill me
Fuckboy, you know it's as simple as that
Backpack with that black gat, black mask
Blow gas now I'm in the fucking black trans
Fuck a cop, save the life of a black man
Fuck a opp, tip 'em up in a black van
Who am I? Boy, Lucifer in the flesh
Who are you? Just another closer 'to death
Straight out the 7th Ward
Me and $now Leopard trappin'
All the limbs we hackin'
From the fucking bodies stackin'
The fucking crazy manic
When I'm in the cut, don't panic

This ain't no game, nigga
How in the fuck you figure?
You try punkin' us
You'll feel the blast of my trigger
Straight from the honeycomb
Smokin' on the sack
I got my rep and cock it back
Then the bodies stack

Bitch, I be that ice-cold
Young white polar bear
Snatch your life so quick
Try and hide, bitch, i know you there
Focus on the glare
Hoes know that I don't care
But they don't know I don't give a fuck
Two bucks with the ducks, I'ma snort it up
Try and test my luck, I can never get enough
Out of fuckin' drugs
Now I'm 'bout to snatch blood
Leave you full of bugs
Leave you full of fuckin' slugs
See you on the carton when
I'm fillin' up my mug
Gun tucked, man, you had to get plucked
Re-up, now I'm stuck fucking ducking out
Truck stay parked in the yard
I ain't going now
You a sitting duck because whenever I
Run out of drugs again
I'ma find you and put you in the trunk
Now your ho getting fucked from the back
While I'm crumbling this weed tryna
Roll a fucking blunt

This ain't no game, nigga
