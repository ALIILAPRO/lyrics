		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm havin' my way, always
I'm havin' my way, always 
Still have my way
(Yeah)

I'ma go flex on a bitch, go stunt on a bitch
I'm sorry, I'm havin' my way
You ain't even with my team, you ain't with my gang
Lil' nigga, get the fuck out my face
I brought a Glock in the party, I shoot at the opps
They dancin' like B2K
Nigga want smoke, I'm like, "OK"
We gon' pull up, take his ass out in broad day
I'ma go flex on a bitch, go stunt on a bitch
I'm sorry, I'm havin' my way
You ain't even with my team, you ain't with my gang
Lil' nigga, get the fuck out my face
I brought a Glock in the party, I shoot at the opps
They dancin' like B2K
Nigga want smoke, I'm like, "OK"
We gon' pull up, take his ass out in broad day

It's more money out here to be made, oh
None of these bitches get saved
I take this drip to my grave, bro
Dash on these bitches, I'm great
She on my neck like a groupie ho
Had her before I was paid
These niggas lame how they catch the boat
Tryna keep up with my waves

I keep them racks on my nightstand
I don't put my trust in no one
I had to go with the right plan
Separate me from the fake ones
I'm poppin' off like a handgun
Cops askin' questions, we don't say nothin'
Designer on my fuckin' body
Shorty, why your boyfriend dressin' like a pilgrim?
To be honest, I don't feel him
I live what I rap, that's a real life
Lil' shorty got hit with a real pipe
Now she don't want you, it don't feel right
I'm thanking God, 'cause I'm double blessed
I'm in the sky, somewhere outta sight
True stoner high, e'ry night
Livin' this high, you gotta pay the price

I'ma go flex on a bitch, go stunt on a bitch
I'm sorry, I'm havin' my way
You ain't even with my team, you ain't with my gang
Lil' nigga, get the fuck out my face
I brought a Glock in the party, I shoot at the opps
They dancin' like B2K
Nigga want smoke, I'm like, "OK"
We gon' pull up, take his ass out in broad day
I'ma go flex on a bitch, go stunt on a bitch
I'm sorry, I'm havin' my way
You ain't even with my team, you ain't with my gang
Lil' nigga, get the fuck out my face
I brought a Glock in the party, I shoot at the opps
They dancin' like B2K
Nigga want smoke, I'm like, "OK"
We gon' pull up, take his ass out in broad day

Drip too hard, don't stand too close
Fuck around, get hit up with this K
Don't say you love me, better get out my face
Can't get a job with a tat on my face
Niggas ain't real and I can't relate
I bring my gun when I go on dates
Order my money when I get it from Chase
Hit up Virgil, Louis my shades
Niggas say I'm fake, don't know what you think
I done fucked a model bitch over the sink
Coco Chanel, I ain't put it in pink
Animal cruelty, I put on this mink
AP too little had to add me a link
Mike Amiri denim, gotta hunnid on my jeans
I'ma do whatever, gotta feed my team
I married my bitch, gotta baguette the ring
Apparently, the clarity, ay, ay, ay
Chicago streets to Beverly, ay, ay, ay
All-white 1's, like KKK
Skies goin' broke? Pshh, ain't no way
Let a bitch come try to steal my chain, spit on her face

I'ma go flex on a bitch, go stunt on a bitch
I'm sorry, I'm havin' my way
You ain't even with my team, you ain't with my gang
Lil' nigga, get the fuck out my face
I brought a Glock in the party, I shoot at the opps
They dancin' like B2K
Nigga want smoke, I'm like, "OK"
We gon' pull up, take his ass out in broad day
I'ma go flex on a bitch, go stunt on a bitch
I'm sorry, I'm havin' my way
You ain't even with my team, you ain't with my gang
Lil' nigga, get the fuck out my face
I brought a Glock in the party, I shoot at the opps
They dancin' like B2K
Nigga want smoke, I'm like, "OK"
We gon' pull up, take his ass out in broad day

(Like B2K)
