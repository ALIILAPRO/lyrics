		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I need therapy
(Therapy, therapy, therapy)

Fallin', down rabbit holes again
I'm walled in
But my thoughts won't leave my bed
Who's callin'? I hear ringing in my head

I'm fallin', runnin' out of options

I think I need therapy the pharmacy
The little orange bottles 'til
They're all empty therapy
Need dopamine
Or maybe just somebody that will let me speak

Wait, who are you? (Who are you?)
And who would let you in my head?
I'm pacing circles around my room
Wearin' holes in my carpet
It's past two (Past two)
Re-watching old movies again

I'm fallin', runnin' out of options

I think I need therapy the pharmacy
The little orange bottles 'til
They're all empty therapy
Need dopamine
Or maybe just somebody that will let me speak

Therapy, the therapy
Or maybe just somebody that will
Therapy, do do dopamine
Or maybe just somebody that will

And now it's the second time in three
Days that I haven't left my room
The medicine cabinet's empty
Think I need a re-fill soon
My parents started yelling at me 'cause I'm
Gettin' out of bed at noon
I'm sorry mom, the truth

I think I need therapy the pharmacy
The little orange bottles 'til
They're all empty therapy
Need dopamine
Or maybe just somebody that will let me speak

Therapy, the therapy
Or maybe just somebody that will
Therapy, do do dopamine
Or maybe just somebody that will
