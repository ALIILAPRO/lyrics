		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick up, pick up, daddy's in the pickup
Got so much bounce the kick drum give me the hiccups
You don't want it with me, sucker, just look up
Beer flyin' in this mothafucka like bird shit
Ran these Mickey Thompsons up on the curb, bitch
Crook as a picture on Sunday
My maniac Slumerican squad mount up around your Hyundai
Chevy's up, we got low lives and bow ties
Up shit's creek, I'll take you for a boat ride
Stick his head in the water, now let him flap his lips
Motormouth, make a wave, yeah, Roll Tide
You're playin' golf in lightning? So am I
Dressed in a tin man suit
Drinkin' a tin can too, that is 110 proof
Man if I only had a heart for you bitches
I'd get down on my knees and help you dig them ditches
But mama only raised Hell
So when you're done diggin' that ditch, bitch, bury yourself
Pass me that Colt 45
I'm partyin' 'til my fuckin' throat sore and dry

I'm goin' down
Aww man you gotta love it
I'm on my way
Hey mama, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"
I'm country rich, no budget
Got to get paid
Hey daddy, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"

You drivin' drunk, better lift your seat up
'Cause cops pull us over just to fuckin' meet us
'Cause Marshall's a Rap God, damn right
Well, then I guess that makes me Jesus
So turn this water to whiskey
Watch the dirty south go from dirty to filthy
High class only means stoned in school
Joints rolled up bigger than pony stool
Smoke, stains on the roof of the old Regal's brown
So what I got spokes on this bitch, and?
The lift kicks like climbin' into a spaceship
UFO's, unidentified flyin' Oldsmobiles
And mobile homes, amen
I can still smell the kerosene leakin'
I should've seen the signs, I was blowin' up
Either in a trailer home or a pickup
Hey, Bubba, your baby boy is in big trouble
I fuckin' ran through a briar patch and got cut up
Now I'm wide open in front of the whole town
I bled for the game, I guess it's obvious now
I'm goin' down now, he told me wear it with pride
You wanna take the hard road you gotta cherish the ride
Most mothafuckers won't jump to embarrass the fly
Can't build a legacy up, then let it perish and die

I'm goin' down
Aww man you gotta love it
I'm on my way
Hey mama, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"
I'm country rich, no budget
Got to get paid
Hey daddy, all around the town they're sayin'
"He's goin' down, Lord have mercy"
