		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this a place you called home
Is she the one that you adored
Or you just tired of being alone
Or you just hate it when youre on your own
Now im singin a stupid sad song
And i hope you can yeah sing along
Live in this beautiful moment
Living for the truth if it's real there

I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
Tonight

Is this a place you called home
Is she the one that you adored
Or you just tired of being alone
Or you just hate it when youre on your own
Now im singin a stupid sad song
And i hope you can yeah sing along
Live in this beautiful moment
Living for the truth if it's real there

I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
Tonight

Is this a place you called home
Is she the one that you adored
Or you just tired of being alone
Or you just hate it when youre on your own
Now im singin a stupid sad song
And i hope you can yeah sing along
Living in this beautiful moment
Living for the truth if it's real there

I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
Tonight

I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
I hope you wear your best dress
Tonight
