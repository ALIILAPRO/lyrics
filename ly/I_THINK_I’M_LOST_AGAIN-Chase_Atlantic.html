		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah)
uh, yea (yeah, yeah)
Too dangerous
Keep a Smith and Wesson, now she staying less
It says a lot about the person I'm becoming now or only that I don't trust strangers (yeah)
I've never felt this tired
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? (Man cry?)
I'm anxious as fuck and my brain is a puddle of open narcotics combined

I'm so sick and tired
Of feeling sick and tired 
It's not easy
Yeah, yeah, said I'm so sick and tired
Of feeling sick and tired
Yeah, yeah

'Cause I think I'm lost again 
Promise to keep my oxygen now 
This world is big, it'll kill me if I don't figure shit out 
I think I'm lost again
God's in charge of my oxygen now 
This world is big, it'll kill me if I don't figure it 

I'm so sick and tired 
Of feeling sick and tired
It's not easy, yeah 
Said, I'm so sick and tired 
Of feeling sick and tired
It's not easy

Too famous
Working in a van for a payment
Yeah, I'm jaded
Stressed out, drinking while I'm driving 'cause I'm brainless
I think I'm lost again
God has taken my oxygen
It's not easy, yeah

'Cause I think I'm lost again 
Promise to keep my oxygen now 
This world is big, it'll kill me if I don't figure shit out 
I think I'm lost again
God's in charge of my oxygen now 
This world is big, it'll kill me if I don't figure it

I'm so sick and tired 
Of feeling sick and tired
It's not easy, yeah 
Said I'm so sick and tired 
Of feeling sick and tired
It's not easy, yeah 

I think I'm lost again
I think I'm lost again
God has taken my oxygen
