		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

Independent like a motherfucker, tryna own it all
Build another twenty schools, let's show 'em how we ball
I ride for my city, I ride for my dawgs
Like the mayor at the show, New Year's Eve, boy, it's on
I'm in the zone, in the vibe, it's the 3-0-5
Mr. Took Over the World, Mr. Stay On Fire
Mr. Fuckboy Free, Mr. Fuckboy, please
Mr. Got the Whole Game On Its Knees, that's right

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

Baby, I got A-D-D, a delicious dick
And I'm ready, act a fool in this bitch
This chico stay slick, this chico stay lit
I'ma change my name to Mr. Stay Rich
Been gettin' loose, been gettin' paid
3-0-5 representer, been reppin' Dade
I'm a chico in the game that spit that flame
That spit that fire, now let's get off the chain, let's ride

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

Go, DJ, go, DJ, the DJ's on fire
No pare, sigue, sigue, no pare, sigue, sigue
Go, DJ, go, DJ, the DJ's on fire
No pare, sigue, sigue, no pare, sigue, sigue

The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn
The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire
We don't need no water, let that motherfucker burn

Burn, motherfucker, burn
