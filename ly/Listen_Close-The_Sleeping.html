		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aching, she's feeling so confused, confused.
She can't breathe or believe she's useless
Right off the edge she'll walk
Just listen close you'll hear her screaming

Take me (take me), take me.
Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Our hardest times, hold on.

Alone, he knows she's so confused, confused.
He just wants to believe she needs him,
And cuts deep you'll never know (know), know (know), no way out
Just listen close you'll hear her screaming

Take me (take me), take me.
Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Our hardest times, hold on.
Take me (take me), take me.
Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Our hardest times, hold on.

So tired so we yawn, so tired so we yawn,
Our hardest times, hold on.
Keep holding on.

Take me (take me), take me (take me).
Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Our hardest times, hold on.
Take me (take me), take me.
Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Our hardest times, hold on.
Take me (take me), take me (take me).
Who's gonna miss me when I'm gone?
Our hardest times, hold on.
