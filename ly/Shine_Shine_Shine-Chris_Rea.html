		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And now the day is over
And the shadows start to grow
The sun has done us well today
In flaming crimson he explodes
And bursts of million colours
That spill across the sky
I turn and look at you love
And i know the reason why
Such a long time
Like good wine
Getting better every day
Now you know, i'll never go
So you'll always stay

And our love will keep on shining
Through the wind and the rain
And when the day is over
Our love will shine again
And as the years fly over
I'm feeling younger every day
The love that you have given me
Is more than i can say

Shine, shine, shine
