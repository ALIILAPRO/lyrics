		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So you've been to school 
For a year or two
And you know you've seen it all
In Daddy's car
Thinking you'll go far
Back east your type don't crawl

Playing ethnicky jazz
To parade your snazz
On your five grand stereo
Braggin' that you know 
How the niggers feel cold
And the slum's got so much soul

It's time to taste what you most fear
Right Guard will not help you here
Brace yourself, my dear
Brace yourself, my dear

For a Holiday in Cambodia
It's tough, kid, but it's life
It's a Holiday in Cambodia 
Don't forget to pack a wife

You're a star-belly sneech
You suck like a leech
You want everyone to act like you
Kiss ass while you bitch
So you can get rich
While your boss gets richer off you

Well, you'll work harder
With a gun in your back
For a bowl of rice a day
Slave for soldiers 
'Til you starve
Then your head is skewered on a stake

Now you can go, where the people are one
Now you can go where they get things done
What you need, my son
What you need, my son

Is a Holiday in Cambodia
Where people are dressed in black
A Holiday in Cambodia
Where you'll kiss ass or crack

(Chanting)
Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot, etc

It's a Holiday in Cambodia
Where you'll do what you're told
It's a Holiday in Cambodia
Where the slums got so much soul
Pol Pot
