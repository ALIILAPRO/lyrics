		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gave me a shoulder when I needed it
You showed me love when I wasn't feeling it
You helped me fight when I was giving in
And you made me laugh when I was losing it

'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water

And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you

'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water

And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you

'Cause you are, you are
Oh, you are
Oh, you are
You are

'Cause you are, you are
The reason why I'm still hanging on
'Cause you are, you are
The reason why my head is still above water

And if I could, I'd get you the moon
And give it to you
And if death was coming for you
I'd give my life for you
