		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The old master painter from the faraway hills
Painted the violets and the daffodils
He put the purple in the twilight haze
Then did a rainbow for the rainy days
Dreamed up the murals on the blue summer skies
Painted the devil in my darling's eyes
Captured the dreamer with a thousand thrills
The old master painter from the faraway hills
Then came his masterpiece and when he was through
He smiled down from heaven and he gave me you
What a beautiful job on that wonderful day
The old master painter from the hills faraway
 
The old master painter from the faraway hills
Painted the violets and the daffodils
He put the purple in the twilight haze
Then did a rainbow for the rainy days
Dreamed up the murals on the blue summer skies
Painted the devil in my darling's eyes
Captured the dreamer with a thousand thrills
The old master painter from the faraway hills
Then came his masterpiece and when he was through
He smiled down from heaven and he gave me you
What a beautiful job on that wonderful day
The old master painter from the hills faraway
Faraway, faraway
