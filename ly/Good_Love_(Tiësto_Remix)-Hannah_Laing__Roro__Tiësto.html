		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head
Baby, the things I could do
Yeah, you will learn something new
If only I could be who I am
And if you want it could be so easy
Just let me be who I am
I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head

I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head
Baby, the things I could do
Yeah, you will learn something new
If only I could be who I am
I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head
Baby, the things I could do
Yeah, you will learn something new
If only I could be who I am
And if you want it could be so easy
Just let me be who I am
I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head

My head, my head, my head, my head
My head, my head, my head, my head, my head

Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving, baby
Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving, baby
Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving, baby
Good, good loving
Good, good loving
Good, good loving

I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head
Baby, the things I could do
Yeah, you will learn something new
If only I could be who I am
I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head
Baby, the things I could do
Yeah, you will learn something new
If only I could be who I am
And if you want it could be so easy
Just let me be who I am
I've got good loving for you
And I've got nothing to prove
Give me permission to lose my head
My head, my head

My good loving
My good loving
My good loving
My good loving, baby
My good loving
My good loving
My good loving
My good loving, baby
