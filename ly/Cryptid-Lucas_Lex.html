		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear I don't think the same, the same
Serotonin out my brain, my brain
My soul sleeps six feet underground, underground
Every noise and every sound
Takes me back to when you were around
Sick to my stomach
I can't stand the thought
Of you seeing me
For who I truly am
I swear I don't think the same, the same
Serotonin out my brain, my brain
My soul sleeps six feet underground, underground
Every noise and every sound
Takes me back to when you were around
Take my soul and crush it up
And throw it all away
Make me new, make me new,
Make me new, make me new
Take my soul and crush it up
And throw it all away
Make me new, make me new,
Make me new, make me new
