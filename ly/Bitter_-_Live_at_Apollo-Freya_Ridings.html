		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been driving, driving with the wind in my hair
I've been dancing just like nobody cares
I've been dying for this feeling again
And I've been thinking, thinking what if we never met
I've been drinking, drinking just to forget
I've been bitter but life is sweeter than that

Yeah, I lost myself and I lost some friends
And I swore I'd never smile again
And I know that there's a different feeling
I'm believing

I just want the freedom to lose that part of you
They forgot the weight of my heart, you know it's bruised
I know that it's still killing me, not killing you
Don't wanna be bitter
Don't wanna be bitter 'bout you

You've been calling, calling me to come back
Saying you've changed, I know better than that
You wanted freedom and now you've got it
And I'm grateful for you showing me
That I'm worth much more than you believe
It's sickly, but somehow it's so sweet to believe

I just want the freedom to lose that part of you
They forgot the weight of my heart, you know it's bruised
I know that it's still killing me, not killing you
Don't wanna be bitter
Don't wanna be bitter
I can feel the heat on the sheets you had to leave
That has left a taste in my mouth, so bittersweet
I don't wanna live having you as my enemy
Don't wanna be bitter
Don't wanna be bitter 'bout you

(Bitter, bitter about you)
(Bitter, bitter about you)
(I'm bitter, bitter about you, babe)

I just want the freedom to lose that part of you
They forgot the weight of my heart, you know it's bruised
I know that it's still killing me, not killing you
Don't wanna be bitter
Don't wanna be bitter
I can feel the heat on the sheets you had to leave
That has left a taste in my mouth, so bittersweet
I don't wanna live having you as my enemy
Don't wanna be bitter
Don't wanna be bitter 'bout you

(Bitter, bitter about you)
I'm bitter (bitter, bitter about you)
I'm bitter (I'm bitter, bitter about you, babe)
