		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do, do, do do do
Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Do do oo
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do
Back out the stu
The biddies pull through In comin out
It's a party zoo
Pick my cup
It's enough for two
Sip on the juice
All I wanna do
Do do do do do
Do do
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do
Four on the floor
All I wanna
Four on the floor
All I wanna
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna do
Black out the room
Make the bass go boom
In put it down
Make ya heart go zoom
Kick my drum
Make it bang for you
Four on the floor
All I wanna
Do
