		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay by the fire
You're giving looks like you're telling me I'm faded
It's cold outside
But spring's in the corner and I'm waiting
On the way to work she saw the flowers blooming up
Telling me how winter sucks for you
What more that I can do?
You know we met his year last season
That's why it's so memorable for me
We've worked so hard to where we be
And that's enough for me right now

What you've been dying to see
But you be that flower for me
I prefer marigold
But it's the lily from the valley that you want
What you've been dying to see
But you be that flower for me
I prefer marigold
But it's the lily from the valley that you want
But I'd be so glad if I'm having you (yeah-yeah)
For this moment, yeah
For this moment, yeah, yeah

Girl, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, that's it
Don't let it hurt, let it hurt, let it hurt
Nothing left to feel
Winter or spring it don't matter to me
As long as you're here, yeah
I can keep you warm 'til spring comes, yeah

Jasmine, marigold, winter sol, yeah
Whichever blooms first I might call you by that
Whatever you'd like
Daffodil or tulips 'cause I really don't mind
If that makes you happy then I'll be happy too

Jasmine, marigold, winter sol, yeah
Whichever blooms first I might call you by that
Whatever you'd like
Daffodil or tulips 'cause I really don't mind

Girl, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, that's it
Don't let it hurt, let it hurt, let it hurt
Nothing left to feel
Winter or spring it don't matter to me
As long as you're here, yeah
I can keep you warm 'til spring comes

Girl, give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up, that's it
Don't let it hurt, let it hurt, let it hurt
Nothing left to feel
Winter or spring it don't matter to me
As long as you're here, yeah
I can keep you warm 'til spring comes, yeah
