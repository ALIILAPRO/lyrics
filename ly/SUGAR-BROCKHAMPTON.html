		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for
Tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

I move mountains on my own
Don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life
Better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God
So we never see it in ourselves
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime on the graveyard
Got a nigga feelin' brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copywritten in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Tear my temple down into a prison

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for
Tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
You slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Could you pick me up around noon-ish?
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you
I want you

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for
Tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard, but we need each other
Know it's hard, but we need each other

Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa- passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa- passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa- passport

So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
