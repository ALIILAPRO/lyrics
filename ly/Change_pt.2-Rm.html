		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things change, people change
Everything change, yeah
Things change, people change
Everything change, hmm
Love change, friends change
Everyone change, yeah
It is not strange, hmm
That's the world's shape
Yeah

I can't believe I loved you once
Fool me once, then fool me twice
Shame on you, yeah, shame on me
Think I lost my sanity
Chemistry we had for sure
Gradually we wanted more
They say you can't fix someone
Seems you got one fit you right

Fuck my interviews from years ago
I'm whole different, not that anymore
Fuck that wiki, fuck all those infos
What a stranger, I don't know this fool

Things change, people change
Everything change, hmm
Things change, people change
Everything change, yeah
Love change, friends change
Everyone change, no
It is not strange, hmm
That's the world's shape
Yeah

You gotta admit it
Don't you get it still?
Someday a great grief will do come for you
Hmm, yeah
And then you'll know it too
You can't love someone like I do
That's all I can say to you
