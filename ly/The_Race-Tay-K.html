		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast cracking 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face
Eli blast cracking 4s like a vase
Pop a nigga then I go out my way
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face
Pimp gone be eating good noodles every day
Bitch I'm drawing doodles, Tay-K paint the way
Choppa turn your dudies into fish fillet
I woke up too moody, who gon' die today?
Shoot a fuckboy in his motherfucking face
We cooking up boy, you don't wanna go dat way
Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your rackades
Gotta go dat way, boy you not gon' be happy
I tote 50s, I'm a shooter like Young Pappy
Bitch try to rob, we make her dance, Michael Jackson
We was plottin', y'all was tryna get the pack in
Get the pack in, you get robbed for a fraction
I'm Lil Tay-K, I don't think you want no action
You want action, you get turned into past tense
Your boys deep? Well let's get to subtractin'
Smith & Wesson made my .9 with some compassion

Fuck a beat I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
I'm gon' shoot bitch, without a debate
I'm gon' shoot, you can see it in my face
Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race
(See it in my mothafuckin' face)
