		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My, ooh

I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed

My, ooh
My, ooh

Uh, every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but

I sacrificed (sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (of the night)
I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
Can't tie me down (down)

I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time

My, ooh
My, ooh

I hold you through the toughest parts
When you feel like it's the end
'Cause life is still worth living
Yeah, this life is still worth living
I can break you down and pick you up
And fuck like we are friends (oh)
But don't be catchin' feelings
Don't be out here catchin' feelings 'cause

I sacrificed (sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (of the night)
I try to put up a fight (up a fight)
Can't tie me down (down)

I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time

My, ooh
My, ooh
My, ooh
My, ooh
My, ooh
My, ooh
My, ooh

(My, ooh) oh, baby
I hope you know that I, I tried
Oh, baby (baby)
I hope you know I love my time (hey)
