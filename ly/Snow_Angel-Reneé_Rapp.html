		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First to arrive, last to leave
What's misery without company?
It's hard to laugh when it's hard to breathe
It's white outside but red underneath

Feel the tip of my nose
It's burning but it's ice cold

I'll make it through the winter if it kills me
I can make it faster if I hurry
I'll angel in the snow until I'm worthy
But if it kills me I tried
If it kills me

Smiles hide what secrets keep
Can't tell a lie if you never speak
Look in the mirror, she looks like me
But half alive and twice as weak

Feel the tip of my nose
It's burning but it's ice cold

I'll make it through the winter if it kills me
I can make it faster if I hurry
I'll angel in the snow until I'm worthy
But if it kills me I tried
If it kills me

I tried so hard
I came so far
I met a boy
He broke my heart
I blame him 'cause
It's easier
But I still look
For him in her
The seasons change
Addiction's strange
I loved back then
What I hate today

I wish I went
A different way
But if I went back
I would do the same

I'll make it through the winter if it
But why does it go slower when I?
I'll angel in the snow until I'm worthy
If it kills me I tried
If it kills me I
