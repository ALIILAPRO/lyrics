		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blood is always dripping down her throat
It's hard to wipe that smile off her face
Sodium runs deep inside her nose
She filled her void with fashion and cocaine, yeah
This is how to copy, I see ya, yeah
Chase that shot of Henny with tears
Don't base the emotion off fear
She'll take my attention, nothing less

She said, ooh
Listen to me one more time, boy
And tell me that I'll make it through, yeah
Just tell me I'll be alright, boy
Tell me what's the point in living? Tell me

Ooh, it's alright
I'll make sure to make it by for one night, yeah
But don't let me die
Ooh, it's alright, babe
The diamonds will save your life
But don't cry, uh
There's beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, oh, no, no
Said, I find beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, no, oh, no, no, no
Yeah, Yeah

Seven girls buried in an ashtray
When she see you on a bad day
Gives two fucks what her mother or her dad say
Tell me what's up with the sad face
Baby gets high when she wanna
Fights in the come up
Closet full of Louis V, Giuseppe and Prada
Hardcore in Dior, strong marijuana
She filled up her lungs and screamed

"Oh, I don't wanna end up on the news"
Your self-afflictions tend to cut me loose
The lights they lead me home they lead my loneliness
She said, "What's the point in living? Tell me"

Ooh, it's alright
I'll make sure to make it by for one night, yeah
But don't let me die
Ooh, it's alright, babe
The diamonds will save your life
But don't cry, uh
There's beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, oh, no, no
Said, I find beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, no, oh, no, no, no
Yeah-eah

Oh
Beauty in death sometime
You know we're gonna die
Yeah you know that it's alright
That it's alright
Let it fly
Let it
The rest will be completely lonely
How long will she say
How long will she say, yeah
Beauty it is inside

Ooh, it's alright, yeah, uh
I'll make sure to make it by for one night, yeah, uh
But don't let me die
Ooh, it's alright babe, yeah
The diamonds will take your life
But don't cry, yeah
'Cause I find beauty in death sometimes
Yeah, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Ooh and God
The diamonds will take your life
But don't cry, yeah
'Cause I'll find beauty in death sometimes

Yeah, I find beauty in death sometime
It's like those angels in the sky
Yeah, I find beauty in death
