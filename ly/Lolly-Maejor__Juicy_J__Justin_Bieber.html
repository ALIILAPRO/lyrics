		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly

She say she love to party, girl, I love your body
Why you on the table? Cause you know I'm watching
She say she love my molly, so we can leave this party
And go back to my hotel, and don't stop for Hibachi
Don't stop in the lobby, I hope you massage me
I hope you can take it when I make you call me papi
Club about to close, come up out them clothes
I'm about to give you what you asking for

Order what you want girl, it ain't no problem
I'mma tell the waitress that my baby need a bottle
Order what you want, said it ain't no problem
Got a piece of candy and it's all for you

She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly

(Girl I love them heels, and yeah I love that dress
I wanna take you home, show you I'm the best)

She say she love my lolly, she love my lollipop
She says she loves my lolly, she says she loves my lolly

Throwing up a G note, like I'm at a casino
I'm all fancy, yeah I'm popping Pellegrino
I'm in the El Camino when I pull up on the scene though
You know I'm a real OG and baby I ain't from the T.O
I'm messing with the clique though, meet me on the sixth floor
Know you ain't a model, you should let me take some pics though
Windows down, speakers loud, look down at my sneakers now
Got so many features, tell the creatures just to beat it now
Fifty for the necklace, look down at my set list
Got your girlfriend at my crib watching Netflix
Let's just admit that I'm the bestest
Guess this, you ain't never ever on the guest list

Order what you want girl, it ain't no problem
I'mma tell the waitress that my baby need a bottle
Order what you want, said it ain't no problem
Got a piece of candy and it's all for you

She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly

(Girl I love them heels, and yeah I love that dress
I wanna take you home, show you I'm the best)

She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my

Yessir
Ass everywhere, throw them dollars in the air (mhmm)
Bring your swimming gear, Juicy J the millionaire (mhmm)
She pop that pussy on me, I fell back in the chair
Bands a make her dance, molly make her lose them underwear
Booty cheeks, I'm geeked, (you know it) all her friends are freaks (you know it)
And I think she love me, I've been hitting it for a week (swish)
I drill it, slap it silly, need a super freak like Ricky
I'm Rick James bitch, I slip myself a mickey
Got so much money in my pocket
With a real bad chick from the tropics
With silicone racks with a real big ass
Make her bounce it like hydraulics
Kevin Hart, I got purple on the plane (we smoking)
Let's call a bull (let's go), let's run a train (trippy)

She say she love my lolly
She wanna make it pop
She say she love my lolly
She wanna kiss the top
She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly

(Girl I love them heels, and yeah I love that dress
I wanna take you home, show you I'm the best)

She say she love my lolly
She love my lollipop
She say she love my lolly
She say she love my lolly
