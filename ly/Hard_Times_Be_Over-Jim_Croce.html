		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mr baker used to be a big executive
Now he's selling apples on the corner
Paper says that things are getting
Better maybe pretty soon hard times be over
Used to be a time when
There was a dividing line
Between the pigs in mud and those in clover
Paper says thatthings are getting
Better maybe pretty soon hard times be over

I just got a lеtter from a
Fellow that I used to know
Clеaned up in the market but
The crash hit him hard
Now he’s selling papers on
A small town avenue
Had to sell his house and
Wife and even his dog
Picket lines and bread lines and "Buddy
Do you have a dime"
Even corner drunks are getting sober
Paper says the things are getting
Better maybe pretty soon hard times be over

I just got a letter from a
Fellow that I used to know
Cleaned up in the market but
The crash hit him hard
Now he's selling papers on
A small town avenue
Had to sell his house and
Wife and even his dog
Picket lines and bread lines and "Buddy
Do you have a dime"
Even corner drunks are getting sober
Paper says that things are getting
Better maybe pretty soon hard times be over
Paper says the things are getting
Better maybe pretty soon hard times be over
