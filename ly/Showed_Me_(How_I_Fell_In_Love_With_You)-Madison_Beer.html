		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you
How I wanna be like you
Ohh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you

Everybody laughs
At all the things you say
It makes me wanna cry
Whenever you're away
The way you drive a car
With all the windows down
They always say your name
Even when you're not around

Seasons only change (ohh)
It's always been the same

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you
How I wanna be like you
Ohh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you

I will be your fool
I come back every time
You always tell the truth
Even when you lie
I watch you from afar
You show me what to do
And all the games you play
Now I play all of them too

Seasons only change (ohh)
It's always been the same

You showed me how to do
Exactly what you do
How I fell in love with you
You walk into a room
And people fall for you
How I wanna be like you
Ohh, it's true
I'm gonna be like you
