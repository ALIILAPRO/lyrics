		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See a lotta of these niggas be actin' like they
Real steppers outchea but you not that fourth quarter pressure
Ya heard me?

Big bag, couldn't have said it no better
He pressure or he federal pressure?
If it's up then it's really whatever
I'm yeah, ain't no regular metal
Too much ice they keep sayin' be careful
Watch out, we ain't gotta be careful
Let it go or let me know if it's pressure
Load in, tryna order up extra
Breakfast

I'll put your hood on CNN
But lets keep it outta the media
I'm catchin' the shit that you niggas did
But I don't really be readin' it
I-I got your lil' bitch on the camera
But lets keep it outta the media
All of my jewelry be dancin'
Hard to be movin' strategically

Yeah, fuck that shit
I'ma put it in their face every chance I get
Pressure busts pipes, what you think it'll do to a niggas body?

Hey!
From the slums, I'm located in Cali
Me and Gates smokin' fat Calabasas (Woo)
Incognito some I'm Gucci ski maskin'
My bitch fancy (Ooo) Kendall Kardashian
I'm like 6'3, in a Mclaren it feel like I'm caved in (Cave me)
Fuck it, got foreigns to play in
We the ones brought the ice out the house
Y'all should've stayed in (fuck it)
I done took off in like 22 seconds, I move rapid (I'm on go, so I'm at it!)
Lil' Lola Bunny wanna eat on my Cuban, she love carrots (Ugh)
Wantin' action, I was nonchalant, I was so arrogant actin'(I'm good)
I don't like to show that I'm still active (Why not?)
'Cause my words come with deadly reactions (On Capo)

Big bag, couldn't have said it no better
He pressure or he federal pressure?
If it's up then it's really whatever
I'm yeah, ain't no regular metal
Too much ice they keep sayin' be careful
Watch out, we ain't gotta be careful
Let it go or let me know if it's pressure
Load in, tryna order up extra
Breakfast

I'll put your hood on CNN
But lets keep it outta the media
I'm catchin' the shit that you niggas did
But I don't really be readin' it
I-I got your lil' bitch on the camera
But lets keep it outta the media
All of my jewelry be dancin'
Hard to be movin' strategically

All of a sudden all these old pussy ass niggas
Got my name in their dick-sucker
But all of my buttons work
I got power like 50

Under heavy fire comin' from friends
Takin' shots, I ain't never been hit (Pew)
Raised in the heart, count up the scale
'Ford tough' nigga, know how I'm built
In the restaurant orderin' shrimp
Big body, valet wit' a clip
My cheque done got heavy, I know what it is
My diamonds reflect on my neck and my ears
I jump in the whip and crack open a seal
Forgot about that in like 22 seconds
Blondie, bowlegged, pull up in a second
Won't mention no names, I ain't wanna be messy
Sometimes I get careless when I'm recompressin'
My driver gon' traffic the yay in a Tesla
Breakfast
Servin' the city, no effort
I just delivered a bale of the pressure, special

Big bag, couldn't have said it no better
He pressure or he federal pressure?
If it's up then it's really whatever
I'm yeah, ain't no regular metal
Too much ice they keep sayin' be careful
Watch out, we ain't gotta be careful
Let it go or let me know if it's pressure
Load in, tryna order up extra
Breakfast

I'll put your hood on CNN
But lets keep it outta the media
I'm catchin' the shit that you niggas did
But I don't really be readin' it
I-I got your lil' bitch on the camera
But lets keep it outta the media
All of my jewelry be dancin'
Hard to be movin' strategically
