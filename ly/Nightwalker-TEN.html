		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, nearing the hour
So I been waiting so long
Hiding my power
After the calm lies the storm
Been walking the wire
Don't even know just how close
I've come to the fire
Should better watch it, oh

Come, come, come
Like waves in the ocean and
Wrong, wrong, wrong
Sway the emotions, too late (slowly)
Already got me down low, low, low
No way to fight it
But you won't let me go

Holy story
Rising from the shallow
Gonna face against the devil
Higher fire
Look into the cold blue eyes

When the midnight comes
Pullin' the strings, beautiful monster
Royalty energy, I am yours
Playin' my heart, ain't no way I'm pure
Bow down and pray to ya
Nightwalker
Pullin' the strings, beautiful monster
Royalty energy, I am yours
Playin' my heart, ain't no way I'm pure
Bow down and pray

Next on the hitlist, that's my name
Oh, that's the hunter, I'm the prey
You make me lose it, go insane
And I need prescription for the pain

Come, come, come
Like waves in the ocean and
Done, done, done
Yeah, I just let it flow, no time to relieve

Holy story
Rising from the shallow
Gonna face against the devil
Higher fire
Rising from the ashes now

When the midnight comes
Pullin' the strings, beautiful monster
Royalty energy, I am yours
Playin' my heart, ain't no way I'm pure
Bow down and pray to ya

It's a nightmare, so persuasive
You shouldn't chase it, but I want it
I feel my heartbeat get distorted
It's a nightmare, I created
Like a disease haunting your dreams

Ooh, ooh
Bow down and pray to ya
Ooh, ooh
Get down on my knees
And then the midnight falls
Nightwalker
Beautiful monster
