		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else

I get overwhelmed

In my mind
Late at night
Overthinking everything in my life
Just wondering if I'm doing anything right
All these demons inside 
Start to really come a live, oh my
I get anxious and I don't know why
I can hear my dreams calling me
But all these doubts are haunting me 
Oh, why's it always right before I fall asleep that

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else

I get over

Well, well, well
Would you look at that
Another person telling me that I should just relax
"Calm down and take it easy everything will be okay"
Yeah sure, 'cause that's what they all say
But, oh, my mind
Isn't really my friend sometimes
I can hear my dreams calling me
But all these doubts are haunting me 
Oh, why's it always right before I fall asleep that

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else

I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else

I get overwhelmed
