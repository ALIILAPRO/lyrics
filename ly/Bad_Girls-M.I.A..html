		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm banging on the radio

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screamin' if I blow you with a bang

Suki suki
I'm comin' in the Cherokee
Gasoline
There's steam on the window screen
Take it, take it
World's bouncin' like a trampoline
When I get to where I'm goin', gonna have you tremblin'

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the radio

Yeah, back it, back it
Yeah, pull up to the bumper game
Read the signal
Cover me, 'cause I'm changin' lanes

Had a handle on it
My life, I-I broke it
When I get to where I'm goin', gonna have you sayin' it

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the radio
Chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin'

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screamin' if I blow you with a bang

Goin' nought to bitch, I'll see four million
Accelerating fast I can do this in a second
Lookin' in the rearview, swaggin' goin' swell
Leavin' boys behind 'cause it's legal just to kill
Shift gear, automatic, damned if I do
Who's gonna stop me when I'm comin' through?
What we got left is just me and you
But if I go to bed, baby, can I take you?

Get back, get down
Pull me closer if you think you can hang
Hands up, hands tied
Don't go screamin' if I blow you with a bang

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well
Live fast, die young
Bad girls do it well

Chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the radio

Chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin' on the dashboard
My chain hits my chest
When I'm bangin'
