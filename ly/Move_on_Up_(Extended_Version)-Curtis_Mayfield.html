		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hush now, child, and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you, by and by
Move on up, toward your destination
You may find from time to time
Complication

Bite your lip, and take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip
So move on up for peace will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind

So hush now, child, and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you, by and by
Move on up, and keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushing

Take nothing less, than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
'Cause you can pass the test
Just move on up, to a greater day
With just a little faith
If you put your mind to it you can surely do it

Just move on up
Move on up
But move on up
Oh, child, but just move on up
But move on up
Move on up
