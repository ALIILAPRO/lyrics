		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you heard me right (huh)
Uh, he ain't pickin' no fight, he ain't pickin' no fight (huh)
Yeah, got a blick on my side, got a blick on my side (oh, huh)
I got big money, big money ties, and big mob ties (huh, ooh, huh, yeah-yeah)
Slice, hmm, used to buy bread, chop off that loaf, slice (oh, huh)
Yeah, hmm, whole lotta bread, double my money, twice (oh, huh)
Hold on, yeah, put you on read, put you on fled, thrice (oh, huh)
Drivin', yeah, runnin' it up, I'm talkin' 'bout big price (oh, huh)
Artist, yeah, I'm the biggest bad of them all
Artist, yeah, I'm the number one, watch 'em fall (fall, fall)
I was sellin' them drugs, now I'm rich (yeah, yeah)
I was yellin' with thugs, we was movin' bricks (yeah, yeah)

I was pullin' up with thugs (grrah), I was pullin' up with guns
I've been pullin' up in big whips, yeah, y'all still smokin' Runtz (skrrt)
I got a whole lotta money, lil' bitch, I got a bunch (yeah)
I don't even need no security, I got guns (I got guns)
I need me a moment of clarity, I'm movin' these tons (I'm movin' these tons)
Pulled up in a frog-eyed Bentley, with the big boy drum
Yeah, talk down on the mob who gon' get you sprung
Yeah, and I boot up for fun (fun), do that shit for fun (fun)
Yeah, reloadin' my shit, you 'bout to go to the sun
Travelin' round with thugs, yeah, we number one (we number one)
Brr, light his bitch-ass up, yeah, just like a blunt (brr)
Brr, I'm so cold, my diamonds negative one
I got big old cash, know what I'm sayin'? That bitch want five
I ain't listen to nobody's shit, I'ma live my life, my life
I'm 'bout to boot up, it's just for the night, 'bout to pour up some Sprite, uh
When I'm in Urus, that big body steppin', that bitch 'bout a knife, slice

Yeah, you heard me right (huh)
Uh, he ain't pickin' no fight, he ain't pickin' no fight (huh)
Yeah, got a blick on my side, got a blick on my side (oh, huh)
I got big money, big money ties, and big mob ties (huh, ooh, huh, yeah-yeah)
Slice, hmm, used to buy bread, chop off that loaf, slice (oh, huh)
Yeah, hmm, whole lotta bread, double my money, twice (oh, huh)
Hold up, yeah, put you on read, put you on fled thrice (oh, huh)
Drivin', yeah, runnin' it up, I'm talkin' 'bout big price (oh, huh)
Artist, yeah, I'm the biggest bad of them all
Artist, yeah, I'm the number one, watch 'em fall (fall, fall)
I was sellin' them drugs, now I'm rich (yeah, yeah)
I was yellin' with thugs, we was movin' bricks (yeah, yeah)

Rich on rich, pallbearer and they thunder
Pull up with stick and it got a whole hundred
Give the bitch coverage, I tap her bumper
I know the bitch only want her some money
I get the bitch and I catch me a body
Pull up and I chop it, I pop it and pop it
She fuck with my diamonds, I fuck with her Gotti then
I need to buy me a brand new big body Benz
Ain't comin' in if they ain't let them shottas in
FN in my shirt, I Givenchy my shirt
'Bout to get this shit tailored, I'ma put the pants in
Play, your whole clique get spinned
Play, your whole clique get shot, beat the lil' bitch back in
I don't even go to no show, mama, I get a big backend
Scary-ass nigga, I don't want him 'round me, whoa, he ain't my friend
He ain't my five, my slime, my blood, my kind, no, he ain't my kin
Got the bitch here tattooing her skin, said she wan' do it again
I got them M's and I'll do it again, got a bitch jaw breakin'

Yeah, you heard me right (huh)
Uh, he ain't pickin' no fight, he ain't pickin' no fight (huh)
Yeah, got a blick on my side, got a blick on my side (oh, huh)
I got big money, big money ties, and big mob ties (huh, ooh, huh, yeah-yeah)
Slice, hmm, used to buy bread, chop off that loaf, slice (oh, huh)
Yeah, hmm, whole lotta bread, double my money, twice (oh, huh)
Hold on, yeah, put you on read, put you on flaire, thrice (oh, huh)
Drivin', yeah, runnin' it up, I'm talkin' 'bout big price (oh, huh)
Artist, yeah, I'm the biggest bad of them all
Artist, yeah, I'm the number one, watch 'em fall (fall, fall)
I was sellin' them drugs, now I'm rich (yeah, yeah)
I was yellin' with thugs, we was movin' bricks (yeah, yeah)
