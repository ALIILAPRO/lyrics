		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I move my feet to reach that sun
Where our emotions blur into different shapes and forms
On Ocean Drive, Miami Beach
We call it paradise, so the only place that we need

Oh, yeah (ooh-hoo)
Skip the Monday and Tuesday, right
I wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Oh, yeah (ooh-hoo)
Yeah, loose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Keep us dancin' all through the night
Wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Loose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

Let's ramp it up, accelerate
'Cause workin' nine-to-five, it won't make us celebrate
A beatin' drum under the sun
Let's catch a wave and take a trip to higher grounds

Oh, yeah (ooh-hoo)
Skip the Monday and Tuesday, right
I wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Oh, yeah (ooh-hoo)
Yeah, loose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Keep us dancin' all through the night
Wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Loose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

When I feel low, you get me high
So high, so high
When darkness come, you make it shine
So bright, so bright
When I feel low, you get me high
So high, so high
I just want, I just want
I just want that weekend vibe

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Keep us dancin' all through the night
Wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Loose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Keep us dancin' all through the night
Wanna stay in that weekend vibe
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Loose your body and feel alright
'Cause we just wanna have weekend vibes
