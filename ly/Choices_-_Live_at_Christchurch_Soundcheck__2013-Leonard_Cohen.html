		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've had choices
Since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened i wouldn't be here today
Living, dying with the choices I made

I was tempted by an early age I found
I liked drinking i never turned it down
There were loved ones
But I chased them all away
Now I'm living and dying
With the choices I made

I've had choices
Since the day that I was born i heard voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened i wouldn't be here today
Living and dying with the choices I made

I'm still paying
For the things that I have done
If I could turn back oh Lord, I would run
I'm still losing at this game of life I play
Now I'm living and dying
With the choices I've made

I had choices since the day that I was born
There were voices
That told me right from wrong
If I had listened i wouldn't be here today
Living and dying with the choices I made

Living and dying
With the choices that I made
