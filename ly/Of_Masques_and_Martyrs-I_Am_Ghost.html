		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  


Fate Outside these doors
Of masques and martyrs ad the loveless
The sin was beautiful
Blank empire closed,the eyes of heaven shine a
Smoke screen, a voice
The sound was kissed and sold
Best regards to the fashion corpse of grey
It thins the shallow blood in me

Only the lonely will know
How it feels to decay, it consumes me
She cries inside, tonight we won't die

Vampire kiss, so watch me burn
I raise my hands, I'm stained and shallow
Darkness, bloodless
Tempest hatred for the love that won't die

Only the lonely will know
How it feels to decay, it consumes me
She cries inside, tonight we won't die

Obsession, our gods
I'd die just to feel you
Descend, the fall
I'd die just to be with you

This is the saddest story

Only the lonely will know
How it feels to decay, it consumes me
She cries inside, tonight we won't die
Only the lonely will know(consume me)
How it feels to decay (just for you)
She cries inside, tonight we won't die
