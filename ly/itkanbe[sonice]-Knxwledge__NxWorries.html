		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Believe me, it's me and you 'til the end
Yeah, so nice

I don't even know how it feels anymore, mmh
(The phases)
I don't even look at the bill anymore
(Oh baby)

I can only tell if it's my goal, if it's yours
(The phases)
Mmh, I don't even know how it feels anymore
Look (oh, baby), say yeah

Oh, seems like I gotta double back on a land mine
No tags on my black Polo, cold neckline
Spent a lot of dough, no small conversations
Singin' what you are, she said where she could stay at
You know who you are, you a star to me (you know who you are)
Don't know what you want but I love your dedication (dedication)

Ooh (yeah), you are my star, where you are
Dolo, got me thinkin' bout monogamy (monogamy)
Chicken chili when I gotta chase
Six AM is when I gots to leave (when I gots to leave)
Catchin' feelings, that's your hobby, right? (Oh that's your hobby, right?)
I'm supposed to be an honorable king
I love chillin' with the common types
Got my palm read
Well at least you got the rising right (the rising right)
What's the odds you the kind I like?
Bread, bread, bread, (bread), bet
Bread, bread (bread got me here), bread, yeah

Goddamn, you gotta lay off them backwoods, baby
