		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't wanna see me bratty
Pet the kitty, call me catty
Make your man call me daddy
He talk too much, he's too chatty (yeah cool)
Ceo, I'm savvy
Respect a bitch, I'm a maverick
Flexible, so elastic
But don't you dare bend a bitch backwards

Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting your blood in the sink

I'm crazy, but you like that
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes, glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying

I'm no Cinderella, but I like the shoes
Big glass platforms, bitch, I'm choosey
Long blue hair, blue as a bruise
Only trust a fella for some light amusement
I'm no prey, but I am pursued
Pray for me, not on the churches pews
New dickstraction, can't confuse me
Whiskey in my hip flask, nothing fruity

Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
Being a bitch is my kink
What the fuck else did you think?
Fuck a princess, I'm a king
Bow down and kiss on my ring
It's gonna hurt, it'll sting
Spitting your blood in the sink

I'm crazy, but you like that
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes, glacial with the blue ice
I'm terrifying

I'm crazy but you like that
I bite back, daisies on your nightstand
Never forget, I blossom in the moonlight
Screw eyes, glacier with the blue ice
I'm terrifying

La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
I'm terrifying
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la
I'm terrifying
