		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it's all because I'm working on my energy
Cleaning up
I'm taking care of I, myself and me
Drinking coffee take a sip
They say I'm sparkling
Manifest that, write it down
You know it's happening
Working on my dream life
(You know that I'm successful)
Yeah my bank account be real fine
(You know I got it stacked up)
Got my skincare yeah I glow shine
(You can see me from the moon)
From the moon yeah
How you been wasting your time
Yeah you worried bout the way I've been riding this vibe
Only interested in doing the things that I like
And the things I like are me
Cause last year was a mess
But I'm growing up
Thanking god that I'm so blessed
Yeah he showed me love
Said girl don't cheat out on yourself get that glow
And it's all because I'm working on my energy
Cleaning up
I'm taking care of I, myself and me
Drinking coffee take a sip
They say I'm sparkling
Manifest that, write it down
You know it's happening
And I eat anything that I want
I got a belly, got a booty
Got that duh duh duh
I'm on the grind, I level up I do it just for fun
See you watching, take a picture then it lasts for long.
Cause we don't deal with drama na na
You wanna hate you gone get karma na na
We living big we gone get that nah nah
You look at me you like ooh la la
Tell me where's the truth
I see fake, yeah that won't shine through
Cause I'll be doing me
You do you
Babe you should do you
Switch your point of view
Watch the change
Girl it stars with you
Cause last year was a mess
But I'm growing up
Thanking god that I'm so blessed
Yeah he showed me love
Said girl don't cheat out on yourself get that glow
And it's all because I'm working on my energy
Cleaning up
I'm taking care of I, myself and me
Drinking coffee take a sip
They say I'm sparkling
Manifest that, write it down
You know it's happening
And I eat anything that I want
I got a belly, got a booty
Got that duh duh duh
I'm on the grind, I level up I do it just for fun
See you watching, take a picture then it lasts for long.
Working on my energy
Taking care of me.
