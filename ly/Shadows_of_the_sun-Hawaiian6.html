		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my life that rushes through
like a storm
I threw my future away
in a gutter
Am I the weakest one
on this earth?
Am I the worst one
in this world?
Half of my body is made
by hatred and poison and sin
Crescent oozed in tears
when I shouted
I hate people and even the sun
There are roads that cross
and many to choose
So many regrets keep on
piling on me
Only excuses break through
my mouth and my heart away
Even the tears
that I have shed in sorrow
Has left behind
by the speed ooime lhal we live
I'm a loser just keep blaming on
I'm only a loser
just spitting out
I'm sorry
I am the worst man alive
I'm sorry
I'm weakest man that alive
But I'm still standing here
I still have to crawl forward
I'm sorry for being such a mess
I'm sorry for being a failure
The sun I see from the shadow
shining so bright
Shining so bright
that blinds my eyes

There are roads that cross
and many to choose
So many regrets keep on
piling on me
Only excuses break through
my mouth and my heart away
Even the tears
that I have shed in sorrow
Has left behind
by the speed ooime lhal we live
I'm a loser just keep blaming on
I'm only a loser
just spitting out to the ground
I'm sorry
I am the worst man alive
I'm sorry
I'm weakest man that alive
But I'm still standing here
I still have to crawl forward
I'm sorry for being such a mess
I'm sorry for being a failure
The sun I see from the shadow
shining so bright
Shining so bright
that blinds my eyes...
I'm hiding in the shadow
