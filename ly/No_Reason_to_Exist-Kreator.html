		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Growing up like any other child
Like millions of others before
A statistic living exactly by the norm
Don't need to think about the future now
It's already decided for you
You have all you need so don't ask for more

Existing like the rest
In endless emptiness
Manipulated slaves
From the womb until the grave
You never had a chance
They put you in a trance
Against your will

No reason to exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist

Your by year and day by day you feel the need to escape
You realize that you're not the same
But you're too uncertain to make a step
Away from their false truth
But remember how fast you lose the years of youth

Existing like the rest
In endless emptiness
Manipulated slaves
From the womb until the grave
You never had a chance
They put you in a trance
Against your will

No reason to exist
Life is controlled
No way to resist
No reason to exist
There has to be a reason to exist
