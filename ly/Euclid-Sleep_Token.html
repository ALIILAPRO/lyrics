		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just run it back, give me five whole minutes
I am thick tar on the inside burning
I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning
And a heavy head that won't stop turning
If my fate is a bad collision
And if my mind is an open highway
Give me the twilight two-way vision
Give me one last ride on a sunset sky lane

Call me when you get the chance
I can feel the walls around me closing in

Just running forward, a life like wires
As I see the past on an empty ceiling
I play along with the life signs anyway
But hope to God you don't know this feeling
Yet in reverse, you are all my symmetry
A parallel I would lay my life on
So if your wings won't find you Heaven
I will bring it down like an ancient bygone

Call me when you have the time
I just need to leave this part of me behind

Do you remember me
When the rain gathers?
And do you still believe
That nothing else matters?

For me
It's still the autumn leaves
These ancient canopies
That we used to lay beneath

No, by now
The night belongs to you
This bough has broken through
I must be someone new

No, for me
(Run it back, give me five whole minutes)
(I am thick tar on the inside burning) it's still the autumn leaves
(I've got a ghost in the hallway grinning)
(And a heavy head that won't stop turning) these ancient canopies
(If my fate is a bad collision)
(And if my mind is an open highway) we used to lay beneath
(Give me the twilight two-way vision)

(Give me one last ride on a sunset sky lane) now, by now
(Just running forward, alive like wires)
(As I see the past on an empty ceiling) the night belongs to you
(I play along with the life signs anyway)
(But hope to God you don't know this feeling) this bough has broken through
(Yet in reverse, you are all my symmetry)
(A parallel I would lay my life on) I must be someone new
(So if your wings won't find you Heaven)
(I will bring it down like an ancient bygone)

The whites of your eyes
Turn black in the low light
In turning divine
And we tangle endlessly
Like lovers entwined
I know for the last time
You will not be mine
So give me the night, the night, the night
