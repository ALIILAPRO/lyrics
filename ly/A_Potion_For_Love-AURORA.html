		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I lay in your arms and our worlds can collide
Into one atmosphere, we are here 'till we're not

When I see you again, as a stranger or a friend
Could you give me a kiss from the past?
Make it soft, make it last, like a lake in a glass
Like an endless reminder of us

I don't feel love anymore
And how it hurts when I walk out of the door
Forgetting why we fell in love, hurts me the most

I recall our minds being strange and alike
You were quiet the most, I would watch and explode
With a storm in my mind, you would understand why
They all name hurricanes after us

When I see you again, as a stranger or a friend
I will give you a kiss from the past
I will send you away, hoping you'll be okay
With a piece of your heart living in mine

I don't feel love anymore
And how it hurts when you walk out of the door
Forgetting why we fell in love, hurts me the most

I don't feel love anymore
And how it hurts when you walk out of the door
Forgetting why we fell in love, hurts me the most
