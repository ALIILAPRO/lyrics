		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, ooh
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, ooh

Light a blunt up with the flame (light a blunt up with the flame)
Put that cocaine on a plate (put that cocaine on a plate)
Molly with the purple rain (molly with the purple rain)
'Cause I lost my faith
So I cut away the pain, uh (so I cut away the pain)
Got it swimming in my veins (got it swimming in my veins)
Now my mind is outta place, yeah, uh (now my mind is outta place, yeah)
'Cause I lost my faith

And I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Well, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

I've been sober for a year, now it's time for me
To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you

I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake (stay awake)
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave (to my grave)
I choose Vegas if they offer heaven's gate (heaven's gate)
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay (you know I'd never stay)
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside 
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smiling
While I'm dying
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blinding
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no

I lost my faith (I lost my faith)
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray (I pray)
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
Faith (Faith)
I'm losing my religion every day (every day, every day)
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray (I pray)
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love

I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up (I ended up)
In the back of a flashing car (back of a flashing car)
