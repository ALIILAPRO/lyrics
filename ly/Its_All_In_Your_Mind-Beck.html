		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
Well, it's all in your mind
It's all in your mind
And I wanted to be
I wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your good friend

Well, I cannot believe
You got a devil up your sleeve
And he's talking to me
And I cannot believe

And I wanted to be
And I wanted to be 
I wanted to be
Your good friend

Well, you're all scared and stiff
A sick stolen gift
And the people you're with
They're all scared and stiff

And I wanted to be
I wanted to be
I wanted to be
Your good friend
