		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take all my rage and stuff it down
Call it by its name or something else
It'll change what it becomes
Hype myself up to leave the house
'Cause I don't like to see what's out there

Screaming in an empty room
So you can't see what I do
So you can't see what I do
Screaming in an empty room

Whoever you tie yourself to
Whoever you're gonna begin to
Whoever thinks that you're deep
Whoever you're gonna complain to
Whoever takes time to train you
Whoever keeps you company
Whatever advice you're takin', now who's in the picture?
Frame it, whoever you think you're saving
One day you'll see, it won't be me

Whoever you tie yourself to
Whoever you're gonna begin to
Whoever thinks that you're deep
Whoever you're gonna complain to
Whoever takes time to train you
Whoever keeps you company
Whatever advice you're takin', now who's in the picture?
Frame it, whoever you think you're saving
One day you'll see

Find a place to be alone
Call it by its name or something else
It'll change what it becomes
Pace around and sit back down
'Cause I already know what's out there

Whoever you tie yourself to
Whoever you're gonna begin to
Whoever thinks that you're deep
Whoever you're gonna complain to
Whoever takes the time to train you
Whoever keeps you company
Whatever advice you're takin', now who's in the picture?
Frame it, whoever you think you're saving
One day you'll see, it won't be me

Whoever you tie yourself to
Whoever you're gonna begin to
Whoever thinks that you're deep
Whoever you're gonna complain to

Whatever advice you're takin', now who's in the picture?
Frame it, whoever you think you're saving
One day you'll see, it won't be me
