		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Creepin' through the shadows
Meet the pharaoh of the underground
The competition narrow breakin'
Breakin' Out the mothafuckin' arrows
Leave em resting shallow
Knockin' in the whip and I got
More swing than the fuckin' gallows
Imma imma shimmer
Like a bloody blade under the stars
Standing right in front of me is me
I guess I met the mark
Steppin' with the weapon reckon he gon'
Try and pull my card
I don't give a fuck cos I know you
Don't know who the fuck you are back up
Cos a mothafucka' stacked up
Really wanna be the one pull
Up and I mag dump never gave a fuck
Pack a punch like a magnum
Move with the wind dissipate like a phantom
Tie em up call the bank for the ransom
Nobody knows like who you
You a random
One time for the mothafuckin' anthem
Flow is so murderous feel like I'm Manson
Everybody drop to the
Mothafuckin' deck bitch
I won't ever stop till
A mothafucka' dead bitch
Never made a lot now this
Music shit is endless
Imma keep on pushin' till my
Legacy is set in stone

Out my fuckin' mind
Goin' for your throats like
I'm a rabid canine i don't fuck with many I
Don't like to play nice
Call me Sub-Zero how I leave â€˜em all on ice
Lethal with the rifle 40 40 shoot precise
Always feel like I'm the black sheep
But don't count me out cause I swear
To god I'll be the next thing
You pussies always tryna jack
The wave that's popping
Gotta stay one step ahead
That's why I'm re-inventing

I need violence, ultraviolence, ultraviolence
I need violence, ultraviolence, ultraviolence
I need violence, ultraviolence, ultraviolence
I need violence, ultraviolence, ultraviolence
They will all fall
You will die by my hands
