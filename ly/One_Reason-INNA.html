		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gimme a reason to stay with you another night
When I know that, I know I'm not the only one

And one mistake leads to another mistake
But I'll try to listen and do what it takes
To save our love and give you again another chance
(Another chance, another chance)

You know you broke my heart in, heart in two
But I will walk a thousand miles for you
You know you broke my heart in, heart in two
But I will walk a thousand miles to you

Gimme a reason to stay with you another night
When I know that, I know I'm not the only one

And one mistake leads to another mistake
But I'll try to listen and do what it takеs
To save our love and give you again anothеr chance
(Another chance, another chance)

You know you broke my heart in, heart in two
But I will walk a thousand miles for you
You know you broke my heart in, heart in two
But I will walk a thousand miles to you

(You know you broke my heart)
(You broke my heart in)
(You know you broke my heart)
(You broke my heart)

You know you broke my heart in, heart in two
But I will walk a thousand miles for you
You know you broke my heart in, heart in two
But I will walk a thousand miles to you
