		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

Hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone
When you miss me, close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight
Just remember that we lay under the same stars

And hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay
Just let me hold you for a little longer now

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone

And take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
