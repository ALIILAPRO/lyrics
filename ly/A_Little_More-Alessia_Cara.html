		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you are with your college friends
You played in their marching band
I can't help but wish I knew you then
But I guess I know you now
It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand

Hey you
Hey mister knock on my door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

Say that it's the same
Take a drill right to my brain
Oh the way you did just yesterday
I guess I get it now
It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand

Hey you
Hey mister knock on my door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
Little more, a little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah
Ooh (A little more of you)
Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah
Ooh
Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah
Ooh
Hey yeah, hey yeah yeah
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
