		  (Ooh, Twix, stop playin')
Flooded 
Flooded 
Flooded

AP and Patek Phillipe
Flooded
He got that Richard Mille 
Flooded (ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (ice)
Flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces 
Flooded

Gold diamond chains, I'm the new Mr. T
All this ice on me, I could go and ski
Shorty on fleek with this Patek Phillipe (fleek)
Whole lot to see, clarity Vs
Cold like I pulled up at North Pole
Money stretch all the way from North Dakota 
No pretty bitches like Coca-Cola
Diamonds hit like they inmates in Angola (hmm)
Look like a fight (fight)
Block out your sight (ice)
Whole lot of ice on (on)
These diamonds bite, we shinin' bright
Look like a light show (show)
Hell of a price, expensive nights
She got a nice throat (throat)
She got me right, I bought her ice

AP and Patek Phillipe
Flooded
He got that Richard Mille 
Flooded (ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (ice)
Flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces
Flooded

I spent two-fifty on just one chain
None of this shit came from Johnny Dang (nah)
Eliantte got me goin' insane (ayy)
Diamonds updated, ahead of the game
I'm underrated, the AP from Vegas
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
Pull up Mercedes, my neck lookin' crazy
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change (I knew shit would change)
My life is wavy, I'm highly sedated
They thought I was crazy, I bought some more chains (yeah)
Flood out the shady, I iced out the baby (uh)
And they goin' crazy protectin' the name (yeah)
Reach for these stones and get popped in your brain (stones)
Know I'm smokin' strong, they ain't stoppin' the train (strong)
Today is rose gold, I'm not rockin' the plain
I don't got it on and I don't feel the same

AP and Patek Phillipe
Flooded
He got that Richard Mille 
Flooded (ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (ice)
Flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces 
Flooded
