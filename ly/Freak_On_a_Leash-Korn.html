		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something's raped and taken from me, from me

Life's gotta always be messin' with me (you wanna see the light)
Can't they chill and let me be free? (So do I)
Can't I take away all this pain? (You wanna see the light)
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feelin' like a freak on a leash (you wanna see the light)
Feeling like I have no release (so do I)
How many times have I felt diseased? (You wanna see the light)
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it's my life I can't taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You'll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-ema
Da-boom-na-da-mm, na-na-eh, go

So fight, something on the ming-ah-ooh
Fight, some things they fight
So, something on the ming-ah-ooh
Fight, some things they fight
Fight, something on the ming-ah-ooh
Now, some things they fight
Fight, something on the ming-ah-ooh
Fight, some things they fight

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
