		  Woo, woo, woo, woo
(Steve Aoki)

When the night call, yeah (ayy)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt, brrt, baow
When the night call, yeah (night call)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo brrt (Offset)

When the night call (brrt)
We can link up, we can all ball (ball)
Molly, Xans and all (Xans)
3-2-1 then we takin' off (go)
If you came to party, pour champagne, we can drink Bacardi (woo)
And I'm 'bout to go in (go)
Rave in the crowd, Michael Phelps, I dive in (rave)
When the night call, night call
Roll the dice, dawg, dice, dawg (the dice)
Hoppin' in the white frog (white frog)
Livin' like a outlaw (outlaw)
Shorty got a tight jaw
When the night call, night call, yeah

When the night call, yeah (ayy)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt, brrt, baow
When the night call, yeah (night call)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt

When the night call, pick up the phone
When the night call, pick up the phone
Past 2, I'm an animal
My bitch redbone like a cannibal
My party crazy like carnivals
Flew off them birds like a cardinal
I run up my sack, check my cardio
Bitch, it's Quavo and it's Lil Boat
Steve Aoki with the finger roll
Basketball like a Seminole
In my party we fuck any ho
In my party we'll fuck your ho
When the night calls, drop everythin' that you're doin' and run
We're gon' party 'til the sun come
No cameras just us
Put your drinks in the air
We don't care who's here
We don't care who's here 'cause we having fun in the bedroom
Give a fuck 'bout your feelings
Middle finger to a villain
Split his wig back, now he peelin'
Dot on his head like that nigga named Krillin

When the night call, yeah (ayy)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt, brrt, baow
When the night call, yeah (night call)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
When the night call, night call

I wanna start up a riot (riot)
I wanna flat out your tires (ooh)
Steve Aoki throw the cake (Steve)
I wanna throw me a pie (pie)
That's only when the night call, yeah (night call)
I wanna p-p-p-p-pipe y'all up (oh)
She wanna fuck but don't know me (smash)
I put the ice in the Rollie (ice)
I'm a champion, Kobe (champion)
It's Migo, Migo, Steve Aoki (oh)
Play with that key like piano (key)
I'm in the jungle like Rambo (trap)
Jump off the stage, Geronimo (ah)
Your pockets is dry like camel

When the night call, yeah (ayy)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt, brrt, baow
When the night call, yeah (night call)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt

Night call, diamonds shine with the lights off (night)
Night brawl, I'ma spray like Lysol (brrt)
Thot bitch, that ain't my type, nah (nah)
Bad bitch, pipe down for a pipe y'all (pipe)
I'ma need a Khan with no flaw (Khan)
Lookin' at my diamonds, no flaws (diamonds)
Wanna go to war, we can fight for Geico
All I gotta do is make one call (one)
When I walk in, they applaud ('plaud)
Big back end and we never did fraud (nope)
Staring at me hard 'cause she never seen stars (never)
Lookin' at the door wanna know how they ajar (nah)
Night call, yeah, we know that (know that)
Migo makin' sure they pullin' out Kodaks (flash)
The trophy is Skydweller Rolex
My life is written in books like a codex

When the night call, yeah (ayy)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt, brrt, baow
When the night call, yeah (night call)
I call all my soldiers just to come and brawl, yeah (soldiers)
Brrt, brrt

This time I'ma show you somethin'
This time I'ma pour it up (pull it up)
This time I'ma light it up (light it up)
This time I'ma light it up (light it up)
That's only when night call, yeah (only when night call)
When the night call, night call, yeah
