		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m like the dark in the clouds on a rainy day 
Or the fire in the hills and I’m headed your way 
Oh it's alright baby don’t be afraid 
I'm just giving heads up for my dangerous ways

And I know everything I touch 
Burns right down to dust 
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
And I always seem to fall 
On the wrong side of the law
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
I keep my hand right on the flame 
And I've tried but I can't change 
My reckless ways

I'm gun powder in a shell looking for the lead 
I'm the proof in the poison running thru your head
I'm the blade on the knife and the deepest cut 
And these dangerous ways ain't danger enough 

And I know everything I touch 
Burns right down to dust 
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
And I always seem to fall 
On the wrong side of the law
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
I keep my hand right on the flame 
And I've tried but I can't change 
My reckless ways

Ooo I think I'm in love 
Oh, I think I'm in love 
Yeah, In love with trouble 
Trouble trouble trouble trouble 
I think I'm in love with trouble 

And I know everything I touch 
Burns right down to dust 
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
And I always seem to fall 
On the wrong side of the law
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
I keep my hand right on the flame 
And I've tried but I can't change 
My reckless ways

I know everything I touch 
Burns right down to dust 
‘Cause I'm reckless 
Yeah, I'm reckless
And I always seem to fall 
On the wrong side of the law
‘Cause I'm reckless 
And I can’t help 
My reckless ways 
My reckless ways
My reckless ways
My reckless ways
