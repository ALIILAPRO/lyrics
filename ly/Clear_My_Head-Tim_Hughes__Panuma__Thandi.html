		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hurtless, lay me down
Crisis, lay me down

If I can't, can't go back
Then I should clear my head

My head
My head

Am I your shade then
that's enough
I let it take your shape then,
if that's enough
So I'll be full of your color
til I go
And for my heart won't change let me be your shape
that's enough

Guide me home
Still the rain
Can we go
Like that, like that
If I can't, cant go back
Then I should clear my head

My head (My head, my head)
(My head oh my)
My head (My head, hm-my)

Am I your shade then
that's enough
I let it take your shape then,
if that's enough
So I'll be full of your color
til I go
And for my heart won't change let me be your shape
that's enough
