		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trees of green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Well, I see skies of blue and I see clouds of white
And the brightness of day, I like the dark
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I, I love you"

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world

Everybody gonna save theirself
(?)
(?) help the other
(?)
It's gon- it's like kinda automatic, kinda
You don't need talk, and stuff, when, when happening
And you just gotta let 'em
And that stuff just waiting for when you ready, look what happen

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passing by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I, I love you"
I love you

I hear babies cry and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than we'll know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
What a wonderful world
