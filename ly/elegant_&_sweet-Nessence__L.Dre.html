		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me take you on a ride
I'd like to have you by my side 
Do not be afraid  
I know you haven't gone this way
In your life 
Let me take you on a ride 
I'd like to have you by my side 
Do not be afraid  
I know you haven't gone this way
In your life

Elegant and sweet 
That's 2 things about me  
We have never met before  
Used to gloomy nights 
Let me brighten you up  
I can catch you with my smile

Let me take you on a ride
I'd like to have you by my side 
Do not be afraid  
I know you haven't gone this way
In your life 
Let me take you on a ride 
I'd like to have you by my side 
Do not be afraid  
I know you haven't gone this way
In your life

Martinis on the menu  
Large and spacious venues  
Refinement really does impress you  
Like the stars you're gorgeous  
The angels sing the chorus  
To open up the floor for us

Let me take you on a ride
I'd like to have you by my side 
Do not be afraid  
I know you haven't gone this way
In your life 
Let me take you on a ride 
I'd like to have you by my side 
Do not be afraid  
I know you haven't gone this way
In your life

Come move closer  
Almost touching  
Don't be so afraid  
Come move closer  
Closer, almost
Touching , come my way
