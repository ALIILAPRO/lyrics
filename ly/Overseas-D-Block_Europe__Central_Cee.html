		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The year has just started and right now
I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons
In a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man
I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face
Now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside
Now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille
A crib by the port and it's imported 
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga
Then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now
I am the nigga that taught him

Bro I get the birds in, fuck a drought
Worker is misbehavin', chuck him out
I get the money, money from her house
Out in a lovely, lovely country town
I said if you care about her, fly her out
Go to the Louis store and buy it now
I'ma keep pourin' 'til I'm runnin' out
I just hit it from the back
She scared, she runnin' out
Ooh, young and lit
Money keep on comin' in
Ooh, I keep a rock band on stand by
Pull up and drum that shit
Ooh, deep in it I'ma swim
Hand on heart I love this chick
Ooh, all them niggas 'round me family
Love them on some brother shit

She suck my soul, she done it like Ash Kaash
I keep on gettin' them flashbacks
I was OT so I had to bash
I almost thought about gettin' a cab back
Do it like Rico and video that
If we upload it prolly get some backlash
Backshot, she got the ripple effect
It's two 10's and I can't help but slap that
Fuck that, pull out, I don't wanna be a dad yet
Plan B, girly gotta swallow that tablet
The way that she handle it this one talented
Pum pum soakin', feel like I'm paddlin'
Back come round, I'm a fan of it
Ride on a bike one time and saddle it (oh)
Ayo, her doctor workin' wonders
Damn, that's a big circumference (oh)
Girl wet, she don't need no lube
On the 40th floor you should see the views (alright)
She don't wanna send me her pussy on Snapchat, mad man
I don't wanna leak your nudes
How do I say without seemin' rude?
Huh, I just wanna see if it's cute
Shake that back like a video vixen
Diss one, he don't wanna be in my tunes
She wanna go Nobu just for the snap
If I pay for the tab, you best eat your food
Word on the road it's Cench get hundred a show
This ho wanna see if it's true
Posh ting, she don't wanna be with the squares no more
She said she wanna be with the goons
Thought she could hack it, not active
Too smoky, now she wanna leave the room

The year has just started and right now
I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons
In a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man
I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face
Now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside
Now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille
A crib by the port and it's imported 
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga
Then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now
I am the nigga that taught him

I love the trap
Quarter milli' on cars and never enough
Couple milli' I put it aside
Cop me a villa in Mars
She need ten racks for her ass and bra
I put that on my dargs, yeah (put that on my dargs)
My killers still swervin' the Rona 
But that ain't the reason for masks (yeah)
I fill up the drum and it's kickin' away
Spin it back like I'm Target (yeah)
I sat in my kitchen I whip and I weigh 
And I'm droppin' off white with no garlic
It's a carousel when I'm spinnin' the tray
Hitter, my flights delayed (delayed)
I told my lil' nigga go flex in my Rollie no money to waste (waste)

The year has just started and right now
I'm lookin' for cribs overseas
I'm givin' my lady some drivin' lessons
In a hundred-grand Jeep
When you see me in public, no photos, man
I need some privacy please
Good girl, she just sat on my face
Now she's sayin' her legs have gone weak
Bad, bad, see the jakes outside
Now I'm flushin' the work down the toilet
Mad, mad, Richard Mille
A crib by the port and it's imported 
Sad, sad, if you knew the truth 'bout that nigga
Then it would get awkward
And I know that nigga get money now
I am the nigga that taught him
