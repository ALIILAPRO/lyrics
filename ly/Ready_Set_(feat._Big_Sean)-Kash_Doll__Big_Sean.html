		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kash Doll
Big Sean
Ay (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Ready set, better yet
Got this bitch rockin' like we never left
Big time, big, big time
All she want from me is just a little time
Flooded at the venue, ay
I look better than what I've been through, yeah (ay)
It's a celebration, ay
'Cause we made it out the basement, ay
Stay hungry, stay patient, ay
Then we made it out the basement, yeah

Diamonds you can spot 'em in my ear (that's right)
I'm at the jeweler, I ain't coppin' from the Bears (woo)
Louis luggage at the bottom of the Lear (yeah)
Hotter than the Summer, hits I got 'em for the year
Kash Doll, I'm poppin', I ain't never flowin' wack
Oh you scared to copy? what you scared to blow a stack?
Me and Sean we killin' in the stu' we blowin' bags (that's right)
And failure's not an option, I ain't never goin' back (never)
I took a detour, had to keep learnin'
He a D-Boy, you a cheap version
Do arenas now, like we preach sermon
I'm a D girl, so I'm determined, uh (what's up?)

Ready set, better yet
Got this bitch rockin' like we never left
Big time, big, big time
All she want from me is just a little time
Flooded at the venue, ay
I look better than what I've been through, yeah (ay)
It's a celebration, ay
'Cause we made it out the basement, ay
Stay hungry, stay patient, ay
Then we made it out the basement, yeah

Bottles poppin', not stoppin', yeah we celebrate (celebrate)
Been rich boy, pockets on, "Hella straight" (yeah)
Got him on his knees, meditate
Look I'm hella great, look I never wait
This is bomb music I'm 'bout to detonate
Deer yes, Learjet, had to elevate 
Pockets on swole, like I'm selling weight
Plus I get it in a crunch, lemon cake
More money than they thought that I would ever made (that's right)
Plus I stay gettin' paid, Section Eight
I don't go dutch, I don't ever pay
Boo'd up in Belize, Ella Mai, ay

Ready set, better yet
Got this bitch rockin' like we never left
Big time, big, big time
All she want from me is just a little time
Flooded at the venue, ay
I look better than what I've been through, yeah (ay)
It's a celebration, ay
'Cause we made it out the basement, ay
Stay hungry, stay patient, ay
Then we made it out the basement, yeah (ay)

(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
