		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been in my feelings
So much so, I can't be grinning (I, yeah)
Driving to let all the steam out
This time of day really gets me (I, yeah)
Let it be known, this weighs on my conscience
And I'm sorry for this unexpected vibe switch (yeah)
I'ma spend time with you (you)
We can do whatever you choose (choose)
Laugh to the bank, withdraw hella cash from the safe
Blow it all on you
Let me know, let me know
If that's alright with you
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What if I told you, told you, told you, your touch feels so right?
(What if I told you, oh baby, what if I told you)
What if I told you, told you, told you, your hearts made for mine?
(Made for mine, yeah)

I take my mind to places that people won't go (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It tears me down I'm constantly out of control, yeah (oh)
I've been way too caught up in the past tense
Sorry for my actions, how about we hit the mattress?
I'll make up for these, wasted times (oh, babe)
I want you to myself
Even though we been chilling
In between the sheets hits different
Baby, let me know (let me know)
I'll make sure you tap out (tap out)
(I'll make sure you tap out girl, oh baby)

What if I told you, told you, told you, your touch feels so right?
(What if I told you, oh baby, what if I told you, baby)
What if I told you, told you, told you, your hearts made for mine?
(Made for mine, oh, yeah, yeah)

That's my baby, that's my (oh, yeah)
That's my baby, that's my (oh, yes it is)
That's my baby, that's my, yeah
That's my baby, that's my, yeah
