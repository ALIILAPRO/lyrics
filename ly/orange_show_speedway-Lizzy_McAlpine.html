		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every guy at this festival has you in their eyes
I never think about it too much, but I'm thinking tonight
And it's really annoying that I'm triggered like this
'Cause your name isn't spoken, but I'm speaking it
And I don't know why it happened, but it happened like this

My best friends are with me and I feel okay
But last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

I'm in the middle of the crowd and it's like no time has passed
I'm half-expecting you to be there when I turn to my left
We were stupid and young and I was so in love
We were just friends riding on the line between acceptable
And angering your girlfriend

My best friends are with me and I feel okay
But last time I was here, I was eighteen
My mind is racing and I feel so strange
Last time I was here, you were with me

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
It didn't look like this three years ago
I had it all at the Orange Show Speedway
Or someplace like that, it all looks the same
Everything changes, what a shame

So sheltered 
Uh, yep, ooh, fireworks
This is the best voice memo diary to date I think (oh my God, this is amazing)
Um, um just wanted to update myself
No one else listens to these but myself
(Hey), okay (you got the fireworks if you put that in a song), yeah, yeah

I fell in love at the Orange Show Speedway
But I've never been here in my life
I think it all kinda feels like an Orange Show Speedway
When you're racing head-first towards something that'll kill you in five seconds flat
When I'm racing head-first towards everything that I want back
