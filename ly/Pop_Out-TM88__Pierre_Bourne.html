		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talkin' bout eighty racks, boy, that ain't shit (uh-huh)
Put my city on my back like I'm Miggity Mac (okay)
Ayy, why they criss-cross on me? (ayy)
She wanna taste my flavor, 'cause that sauce on me (ayy)

Baby give me mental when she on her menstrual
Stackin' paper, got info, ayy
Pull up in a Benz, hoe (hey, hey)
Smoking out the rental (ooh, hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)
I wanna pop out (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)
I wanna pop out (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)

We're on the block now, shoutout Ms. Jackie
I made it happen, made her happy, couldn't imagine, ayy
I'm on the south side, yeah, like Curtis Jackson, ayy
Feel like a casting, niggas be acting, when they be rapping
I'm with the Captain, hey, make her say ah-ah, hey
Wanna be Kanye, hey, but that's really CyHi, hey
She sending mixed signals, hey, connected like Wi-Fi, hey
Pussy delivery, hey, she wanna stop by, yeah

Baby give me mental when she on her menstrual
Stackin' paper, got info, ayy
Pull up in a Benz, hoe (hey, hey)
Smoking out the rental (ooh, hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)
I wanna pop out (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)
I wanna pop out (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)

Niggas got no guap (yeah), that's why I be laughing (hey)
What's with your block?
Mine is active, y'all niggas crashing (ay)
2-2-1 night, ayy, I got a coupon, ayy
What movies you like, ayy, said she love Mulan, ayy
Fucking my bitch right, ayy, leaving my shoes on, ayy
She wanna get high, yeah, but my shit is too strong, ayy
Love when I drop by, yeah, with the purple shit on, ayy
Watching the time fly, yeah, she suck me for ten songs (ayy)

Baby give me mental when she on her menstrual
Stackin' paper, got info, ayy
Pull up in a Benz, hoe (hey, hey)
Smoking out the rental (ooh, hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
Wanna pop out? (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)
I wanna pop out (hey)
She wanna pop out (hey)
