		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poetry in your body
You got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I'm watching
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you
Wanna free you with my rhythm (my rhythm)
I know you can't get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm (my rhythm)

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Poetry in your body
Got you started or never end
Feel my rhythm in your system
This is heaven, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest
Beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from its cage
Free the rage like an animal

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Oh (woh uh uh) oh (woh uh uh uh)

Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
Your body's poetry
Move your body for me
(Me, me, me, me, me, me, me)

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
(Move your body, move your body)
I wanna be your muse, use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
(Move your body, move your body)

Oh (woh uh uh) oh (woh uh uh uh)
