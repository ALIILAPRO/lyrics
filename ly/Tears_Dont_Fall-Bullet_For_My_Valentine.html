		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go!

With blood shot eyes, I watch you sleeping
The warmth I feel beside me is slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Tears
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home

The moments died, I hear no screaming
The visions left inside me are slowly fading
Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Tears
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home

Oh, yeah

This battered room I've seen before
The broken bones they heal no more, no more
With my last breath I'm choking
Will this ever end I'm hoping
My world is over one more time

Let's go!

Would she hear me, if I called her name?
Would she hold me, if she knew my shame?

There's always something different going on
The path I walk is in the wrong direction
There's always someone fucking hanging on
Can anybody help me make things better?

Tears
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home
Your tears don't fall, they crash around me (tears don't fall)
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come (conscience calls)

Better!

Your tears don't fall, they crash around me
Her conscious calls, the guilty to come home (conscience calls)
