		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat
You hate it that you love me, love me
Love me

We don't talk about it but
We know that you're mine
It's okay you're nervous, heart racing
You can't hide

We're too close, I should go
Don't let me drive home
Take my soul, need control
Now that we're alone

I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat
You hate it that you love me, love me
Love me

Obsessive, you look closely, but I like that
Possessive, you're not mine
But you imply that

We're too close, I should go
Don't let me drive home
Take my soul, need control
Now that we're alone

I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat
You hate it that you love me, love me
Love me
I can feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Heartbeat
You hate it that you love me, love me
Love me
