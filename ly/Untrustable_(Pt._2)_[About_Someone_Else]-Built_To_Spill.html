		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't trust anyone
'Cause you're untrustable
How can you trust someone you know can't trust you?
You won't help anyone
'Cause you're unusable
No one can tie you down
No, you're nobody's fool

And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And God is whoever you're performing for
And God is whoever you perform for

You don't like anything
'Cause you're unlikable
All because you're not interested in you anymore
It's so unthinkable
'Cause you don't think of it
How many ideas can fit in your reality

And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And God is whoever you're performing for
And God is whoever you perform for

I know you
Feel the things you see
You know they're true
What are you gonna do?

Why can't you
Empathize with Jesus' point of view?
What are you gonna do?

Can you feel the darkness shining through?
What are you gonna do?

Why can't you
Move yourself like other people do?
What are you gonna do?

I know you
Wouldn't be the way you feel if you could choose
What are you gonna do?

Can you feel the darkness shining through?
What are you gonna do?
