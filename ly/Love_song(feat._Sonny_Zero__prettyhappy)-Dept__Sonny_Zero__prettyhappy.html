		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at my phone again
All the places that I've been, yeah
All the faces that I've passed on by
Without a question or asking why

Where did all the time go?
Moving fast in slow-mo
No, I don't even know who I am
So close your eyes and take my hand

No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer 
Why can't we love? Why can't we love?
No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer, why can't we love one another?

Love is something that goes two ways
Even if you're not feeling okay
But these days (these days), it's losing meaning
Thought it was heavier (heavier) but I feel lonelier (lonelier)
Are you the one who could take this all away?

Where did all the time go?
Moving fast in slow-mo
No, I don't even know who I am
So close your eyes and take my hand

No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer 
Why can't we love? Why can't we love?
No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer, why can't we love one another?

Where did all the time go?
Moving fast in slow-mo
No, I don't even know who I am
So close your eyes and take my hand

No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer
Why can't we love? Why can't we love?
No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer, why can't we love one another?

No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer
Why can't we love? Why can't we love?
No love in the summer when nobody loves each other
No love in the summer, why can't we love one another?
