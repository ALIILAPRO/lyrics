		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Faith is something I am not accustomed to
Trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there being wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me?
You said, you've always got your hands out
And I can't continue on my own so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin but I built a house and asked to live in it
Afraid to open up the door to you, let you into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
I know, I've told you I do not need your protection
But I lied to you, this thing is tiring
A man was not created for a God
Please retire me now

Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Trust is something I am not accustomed to
And I know the Bible says that I should always trust in you
But, I will never read that book enough
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up
Or pick it up
It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control, I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity you've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hold of you and not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling then when I look in the sky, in your eyes, it's amazing

Oh these hands are tired
Oh this heart is tired
Oh this soul is tired
But I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on

Woah
Woah
Woah
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
Woah
Woah
Woah
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
Woah
Woah
Woah
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
I'll keep on
