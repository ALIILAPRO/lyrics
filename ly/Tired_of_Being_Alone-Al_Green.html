		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on my own
Won't you help me, girl
Just as soon as you can
People say that I've found a way
To make you say
That you love me
But baby
You didn't go for that
Ha, it's a natural fact
That I want to come back
Show me where it's at, baby

I'm so tired of being alone
I'm so tired of on my own
Won't you help me, girl
Soon as you can
I guess you know that I, uh
I love you so
Even though
You don't want me no more
Hey, hey, hey, hey I'm cryin' tears
Through the years
I tell you like it is
Honey, love me if you can

Ya baby
Tired of being alone here by myself, now
I tell ya, I'm tired baby
I'm tired of being all wrapped up late at night
In my dreams, nobody but you, baby
Sometimes I wonder
If you love me like you say you do
You see baby, I, I, I, I've been thinking about you
I've been wanting to get next to you, baby
Sometimes I hold my arms and I say
Oh baby, yeah, needing you has proven to me
To be my greatest dream, yeah

Awh!

I'm so tired of being alone,
I'm so tired of on my own,
Sometimes late at night I get to wonderin' about you baby
Baby, baby, ya ya, baby you're my heart's desire
