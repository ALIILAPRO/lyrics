		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't leave my bed, but I can't sleep
I've got no clean clothes and I can't eat
And I smoke too much 'til I can't breathe
I'm emotional, I'll always be
And I hate myself but that's alright
And I love myself but that's alright
And I tell myself that it's alright
That I dream about the day I die

To my surprise, there's no one to blame
Nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

I've been dancing at my funeral
Waiting for you to arrive
I was hoping you'd look beautiful
Dancing with tears in your eyes
But nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame (hey)

My hair fell out 'cause I dyed it cheap
I want a real fake smile but I hate my teeth
I want to tell you that I love you but I just can't speak
I've got a fucked up soul and an STD
Do you hate yourself? Well that's alright
Do you love yourself? Well that's alright
Do you tell yourself that it's alright
That you dream about the day you die?
To my surprise, there's no one to blame
Nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

I've been dancing at my funeral
Waiting for you to arrive
I was hoping you'd look beautiful
Dancing with tears in your eyes
But nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I wanna prove my love before I leave
I wanna make you come and scrape my knees
Want you to bite my tongue until I bleed
And you can put these fucking words in my obituary
We all hate ourselves, well that's alright
We all love ourselves, well that's alright
We all tell ourselves that it's alright
That we dream about the day we die

I've been dancing at my funeral
Waiting for you to arrive
I was hoping you'd look beautiful
Dancing with tears in your eyes
But nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame
Nobody came, what a shame, shame, shame, shame, shame
