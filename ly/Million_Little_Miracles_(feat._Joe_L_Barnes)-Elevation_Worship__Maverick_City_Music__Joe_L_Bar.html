		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life I've been carried by grace
Don't ask me how 'cause I can't explain
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here

I've got some blessings that I don't deserve
I've got some scars but that's how you learn
It's nothing short of a miracle I'm here

I think it over and it doesn't add up
I know it comes from above

I've got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Yeah, miracles on miracles
Count your miracles, one, two, three, four 
I can't even count 'em all

Ooh

You held me steady so I wouldn't give up
You opened doors that nobody could shut
I hope I never get over what You've done, ooh

I wanna live with an open heart
I wanna live like I know who You are
I hope I never get over what You've done

It's not coincidence and it's not luck
I know it comes from above

I've got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles, one, two, three, four
I can't even count 'em all

Miracles on miracles
A million little miracles (ooh)
Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles, one, two, three, four 
I can't even count 'em all

I can't even, I can't even count 'em all
I can't even, I can't even count 'em all
I can't even, I can't even count 'em all
One, two, three, four
I can't even count them all

Yeah, I can't even count 'em all (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
I try and I can't keep up (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

Yeah, I can't even count 'em all (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
Count 'em one, two, three, four 
I can't even count 'em all

Like when you healed my mother (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
You redeemed my father (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

Even in the death of my brothers (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
You were closer than no other (one, two, three, four)
(I can't even count 'em all)

Ooh, You broke my chains (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
You saved my life
You set me free (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

You gave me victory
Oh, I can't even count 'em all (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
You kept my mind on it (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

You healed my body, Jesus (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
Oh, I can't even count 'em all (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

I try and I can't keep up (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
'Cause every day there's a new miracle (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

I got breath in my lungs (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
I got clothes on my back (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

My Mother would say, "I got food on my table" (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
Lord, I know that You're able (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

Say, "I can't even" (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
I can't even (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

I can't even (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)
Too many to count (I can't even, I can't even count 'em all)

Miracles
I got miracles on miracles
A million little miracles (yeah)
Yeah

Miracles on miracles
Count your miracles, one, two, three, four
I can't even count 'em all

Miracles on miracles
A million little miracles
Thank your Jesus, for the miracles on miracles
Count your miracles, one, two, three, four
I can't even count 'em all

One, two, three, four
I can't even count 'em all
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
One, two, three, four 
I can't even count 'em all

Every day there's a miracle
One, two, three, four 
I Can't even count 'em all

Last time, right here
One, two, three, four 
I can't even count 'em all
