		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There goes my life
On the open road
Can I be alone?
I can understand you

There goes my light
How can you be sure?
I'll be going home
With everyone beside you

I can understand you
I can understand you
I can understand you

Oh, can I get the window down?
It's getting warm
Oh, can you keep your voices down?
I'm tryna push recall

There goes my life
On the open road
I'll be going home
I can understand you

There goes my life
Can I be alone?
I'll be going home where
I can understand you

Oh, can I get the window down?
It's getting warm
Oh, can you keep your voices down?
I'm tryna push recall

Oh, can I get the window down?
It's getting warm
Oh, can you keep your voices down?
I'm tryna push recall
