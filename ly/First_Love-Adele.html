		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

This love has dried up and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new

Forgive me first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love, forgive me first love 
Forgive me, forgive me first love
Forgive me first love
