		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got me up all night
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night
Down and out with these love songs, she got me up all night
Drown it out with these love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Down and out with these love songs, got me open all night uh huh, got me up all night hey

OK, back when I was sleepin' in my mama crib
Even back then when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Payin' seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent? Had a thing for you
Even wrote the song dreams for you
'Cause I had dreams for you, thoughts of a ring for you
Childish shit, you know childish shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home I'm grown now and this city's my throne now
The same clubs I used to get tossed out
Life got crisscrossed, totally crossed out
'Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks cryin' 'cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spilled on me, while I feel on you, I'm saying

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya

And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are, all I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are (she got me)
And we are we are we are (she got me)

Well this has gotta be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wifin' in the club, man my homies' gon' disown a nigga
Like, give me 20 dolla', dolla'
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you alone now
Can't help but feelin' like I dropped the ball, cliche
I used to pop up on you at the mall, each day
Now typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling please play
For Pete's sake, homie pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through it forever, but

Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love? Baby, I want ya, yeah

And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are, all I'm singin' is love songs
And we are we are we are, got me up all night
And we are we are we are (she got me)
And we are we are we are (she got me)

Got me up all night
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night (all night)
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (all night)
Down and out with these love songs, she got me up all night (all night)
Drown it out with these love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
All I'm singing is love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Constant drinking and love songs, she got me up all night (yeah)
Down and out with these love songs, she got me open all night uh huh
Got me open all night hey
