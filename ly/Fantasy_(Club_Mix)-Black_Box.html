		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get down

Get down
Get down

Get down
Get down

Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever as one

Come to see victory in a land called, "Fantasy"
Loving life for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find other kind that has been in search for you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life now in review

Get down

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to your kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship, fantasize
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never
We all will love forever as one

Come to see victory in the land of fantasy
Loving life, a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty
As you stay for the play fantasy has in store for you
Glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true

As you glide in your stride with the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
"I am free, yes, I'm free, now I'm on my way"

Come to see victory in the land of fantasy (yes, I'm free)
Loving life, a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

Get down

Get down

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never
We all will love forever as one

Come to see victory in the land of fantasy
Loving life, a new degree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty
As you stay for the play fantasy has in store for you
Glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true

As you glide in your stride with the wind as you fly away
Give a smile from your lips and say
"I am free, yes, I'm free, now I'm on my way"
