		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is painful, my blues are pulling down
My heart is painful, my blues are pulling down
I feel like digging six feet in a long sun brown

My heart is painful when my baby got on the train
My heart is painful when my baby got on the train
My heart stopped silent it felt like drops of rain

I've got a baby that keep me feeling blue
I've got a baby that keep me feeling blue
He acts like the weather I can't tell what he's gonna do

Women don't let your man treat you like mine does to me
Women don't let your man treat you like mine does to me
He had me almost crazy like a dog in the country

Tell them all of a man who black my train car ride
Tell them all of a man who black my train car ride
He had me almost crazy till I was satisfied
