		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love the way
You put on your dress
While the scent of the night
Still floats in the air
I love the time
We spend on the road
Looking for answers
Answers to questions
We don't even know
But most of all
I love the way
We're floating in silence
Drifting in words
We don't need to say
You enter the room
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The bravest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
And I love the wallpaper
Of this cheap hotel
The fan's stuck like us
Running in circles
Lost in a spell
And I love the way
The haze can be broken
By the sudden rain
Leaving us drenched
Laughing and soaking
But most of all
I love the way
We're floating in silence
Drifting in words
We don't need to say
You enter the room
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The bravest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
You entered my life
And light up the scene
So this goes to you
The sweetest heartstopper
That I've ever seen
