		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leaving your house, leaving this city
It's taking me out, got me feeling shitty now
I ain't the one you blame it for (no, no)
But I'm the one you came here for (oh)

But I wanna be the next stop
Left dropping for you I dressed up 
Messed up in front of the bar where you told me
You told me “you're mad, falling for me”

Say it one more time baby
Kiss me while the car is in park
Dancing in the street in the dark
Better hold me till the end of the story

Say it one more time baby
Kiss me while the car is in park
Dancing in the street in the dark
Better hold me till the end of the story

cnd it's kinda sweet but 
c little bitter when I look too far back in the past 
But it's just the same old fucking story
You and I can't bear that I've got something you need (I)

I need you and you need time to think over
Go and think it over 
I need you and you got nerve to fuck me over
But can you come over now?

I just wanna the next stop
Left dropping for you I dressed up 
Messed up in front of the bar where you told me
You told me, “you're mad, falling for me”

Say it one more time baby
Kiss me while the car is in park
Dancing in the street in the dark
Better hold me till the end of the story

Say it one more time baby
Kiss me while the car is in park
Dancing in the street in the dark
Better hold me till the end of the story

Leave me I dare you, you'll be back over
Baby I know you better than then
Leave me I dare you
You'll be back overnight (night)

Leave me I dare you, you'll be back over
Baby I know you better than then
Leave me I dare you
You'll be back overnight (night)
