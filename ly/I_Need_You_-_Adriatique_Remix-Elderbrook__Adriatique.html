		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you love me that way, me that way, me that way
And if I jump, do I sink, do I swim, do you save me?
Or would you turn, turn away, turn away and forget me?
There's no way, ain't no way, ain't no way how to say it
Out loud

Do you need me like I need you now?
Do you feel it creeping out?
You're the reason that my head spins 'round
Do you need me like I need you now

'Cause I need you
And I need you

I'm not the same, not the same, not the same, but the only
Love I need, love I need, love I need, well, if only
But you could see, you could see, you could see, you could see me
Oh, believe, oh, believe, oh, believe, oh, believe me, me now

Do you need me like I need you now?
Do you feel it creeping out?
You're the reason that my head spins 'round
Do you need me like I need you now

'Cause I need you
And I need you
'Cause I need you
And I need you
