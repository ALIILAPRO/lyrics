		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ah, that's how you sing it
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah, that's how we played it

And there's no remedy for memory 
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me 
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (dead, like you)

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side

All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ah, that's why I stay here

And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me 
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead (dead, like you)

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight

There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine

Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side (so tell me)
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight

Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh, ha-ha-ha-ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
