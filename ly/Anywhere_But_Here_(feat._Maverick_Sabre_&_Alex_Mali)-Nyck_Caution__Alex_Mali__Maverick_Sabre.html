		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a shout out to all the boys in Pro Era
I want these guys to win a Grammy
I'm going to get better despite the motherfuckin' odds
Win a Grammy, please, hank you
Pound it on the camera, get the, get the pound
He's the guy man, he's the guy
Let's see (yeah), one love, baby

'Cause you don't really to be me
And I can't be you
We all face defeat and when we cut we bleed too
The soul is see-through
I know some people that haven't lived a day in their life
This is the movie, not the read-through, uh
I need a reason to be better than I am
At the moment I been broken, putting pieces of the puzzle back again
Damn, cycles don't ever break
Everybody jaded getting out of line, don't know their place
Ain't nobody thinking anymore
Came to grips with how I lost some people close to me
And probably gonna lose many more (many more)
Try to rush into this life of flow and metaphors
And learn to be a man, something that I wasn't ready for (ready for)
Thought I was really wasn't what I thought it was
Lonely in the crib, going through all your stuff
Always say I'm fine but they call my bluff
Just tryna stay composed every time they brought you up
(You are not as weak as you seem)
You told me that I could be anything I wanted to be
And I'm getting closer to it
But I can't be as happy as I should
'Cause every goal I reach you not gon' be here to see
This shit is fucking with me
Having thoughts you wouldn't fucking believe
Emotionless, it all means nothing to me
All I ever wanted was love, comfort, and peace
Now I'm feeling like the only time you get that is when you're deceased (you're deceased)
Happiness is only a pursuit ('suit)
There's no guarantee you cross the finish line (finish line)
And even if one day you finally do
Life can always take you back to when you didn't shine (didn't shine)
Keep in mind it can't always be summer
And everybody falls but not everyone recovers
It's just another unfair year
So I need to get away, anywhere but here

So I need to get away, anywhere but here
Anywhere but here
I just need to get away, anywhere but here
It can't always be summer
And everybody falls but not everyone recovers
It's just another unfair year
I just need to get away (I need to get away from here)

(Get away from, get away from)
(Get away from, get away)
(Get away from, get away)
