		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see us ladies
And our heels
Long fur coats
Hair pressed out
Rings, lots of rings
Nails
It's funny how y'all don't think we be pimps too

We keep it smooth like a Cadillac
Put the diamonds spinners in the back
We keep it smooth like a Cadillac
Put the diamonds spinners in the back (in the back)
Now you might get five
With the black hand side, no lie
We keep it smooth like a Cadillac
Put the diamonds spinners in the back (in the back)

We women, been winnin' since from the beginning of your whole life
Yeah, your whole life
And if you fuckin' with it, you better be willin' to roll them dice
You gon' roll them dice
And lose all your money, nigga (nigga, nigga, nigga)
'Cause this pussy ain't no alley cat, we comin' from the jungle
Black jag' on your bumper, ask your baby mama

We keep it smooth like a Cadillac
Put the diamonds spinners in the back
We keep it smooth like a Cadillac
Put the diamonds spinners in the back (in the back)
And you might get five
With the black hand side, no lie
We keep it smooth like a Cadillac
Put the diamonds spinners in the back (in the back)
