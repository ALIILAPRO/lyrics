		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a dream that when I woke up you were finally there
and I believed that all the hours turned to minutes 
It's not fair
When I turned to look at where you should've been I started drifting
I tried to stare into your eyes and realized that there was something missing

cnd if I stayed I couldn't help but lie awake
Cause it's not you
It's just a dream it's only fake
I just gotta leave
I gotta leave

Turn the key
I try to drive away into the night 
I try to keep between the lines and out of sight
cnd when I looked beside me where you should've been I started drifting
I tried to stare into your eyes and realized that there was something missing

cnd if I stayed I couldn't help but lie awake
Cause it's not you it's just a dream it's only fake
I just gotta leave
I gotta leave

I gotta get out

When I turned to look at where you should've been I started drifting
I tried to stare into your eyes and realized that there was something

cnd if I stayed I couldn't help but lie awake
Cause it's not you 
It's just a dream it's only fake
Still if I changed everything would be the same
I can't take no more
I don't know what I'm fighting for
I just gotta leave
I gotta leave

I had a dream that when I woke up you were finally there
