		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming up from the shelter
Rolling out on your own
We're rising out of the shadows
A lot of highway to go

And if you had to drop it would you
Break it up make it stop could you
Would the bottom tear a hole in your soul
'Cause if you wanna to raise the ceiling
Gotta do something you've been feeling
'Cause if you wait too long the door's gonna close, whoa

How high, how high, how high
Do you wanna fly
So high, so high, thought I died
And came back to life

In a break away minute
You've got to dig in or fight
Are you in it to win this
Not just along for the easy ride, oh

If in the morning you see rain
Let it baptize you again
Don't lose your faith
Don't lose your place
You choose your way, whoa

How high, how high, how high
Do you wanna fly
So high, so high, thought I died
And came back to life

How high, how high, whoa

How high, how high, how high
Do you wanna fly
So high, so high, thought I died
And came back to life
How high, how high, how high
Do you wanna fly
How high, how high, how high
Do you wanna fly, whoa
