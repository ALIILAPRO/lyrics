		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a bug like an angel
Stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older
I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes a drink feels like family
Family

Hey, what's the matter?
Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep?
Well, when you break them
They break you right back
Amateur mistake
You can take it from me
They break you right back
Break you right back

Ooh, ooh

When I'm bent over
Wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember
The wrath of the Devil
Was also given him by God

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
