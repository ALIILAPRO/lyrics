		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me, that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh oh
Things you never say to me, oh oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again

I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine (oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind (yeah, but this is happenin')
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love (love)

Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent and we can learn to love again
I never stop, you're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again

Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust, but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent and we can learn to love again

Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent, and we can learn to love again
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again

Oh, we can learn to love again
Oh, can learn to love again
Oh, that we're not broken, just bent and we can learn to love again
