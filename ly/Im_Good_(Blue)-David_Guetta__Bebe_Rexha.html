		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

You know I'm down for whatever tonight
I don't need the finer things in life
No matter where I go, it's a good time, yeah
And I, I don't need to sit in VIP
Middle of the floor, that's where I'll be
Don't got a lot but that's enough for me, yeah

'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

I'm good, good
I'm good
Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

So I just let it go, let it go
Oh-na-na-na-na-na
No, I don't care no more, care no more
Oh-na-na-na-na-na
So come on let me know, let me know
Put your hands up, na-na-na
No, baby, nothing's gonna stop us tonight

'Cause I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best fuckin' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
