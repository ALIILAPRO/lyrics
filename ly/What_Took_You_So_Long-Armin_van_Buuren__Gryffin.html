		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was night time, it was déjà vu
In the lime lights, it was only you
Now you're racing, racing, racing, racing through my mind
I was winter 'til you took my hand
Heard you whisper, then the spring began
No more wasting, wasting, wasting, wasting precious time

What took you so long?
Feels like I've known you for all my life
Tell me where you've been all my lonely nights
You're just what I've been waiting on
But what took you so long?

Looking at you, not thinking, "What the hell?"
Can't imagine me with somebody else
When it's been you all along
What took you so long?

What took you so long?

I was angry at the universe
That the others got to love you first
So I made you, made you, made you, made you, made you mine
Now the summers never felt like this
And the colors never looked like this
No more, no more wasting time

What took you so long?
Feels like I've known you for all my life
Tell me where you've been all my lonely nights
You're just what I've been waiting on
But what took you so long?
Looking at you, not thinking, "What the hell?"
Can't imagine me with somebody else
When it's been you all along
What took you so long?

What took you so long?
Feels like I've known you for all my life
Tell me where you've been all my lonely nights
You're just what I've been waiting on
But what took you so long?
Looking at you, not thinking, "What the hell?"
Can't imagine me with somebody else
When it's been you all along
What took you so long?
