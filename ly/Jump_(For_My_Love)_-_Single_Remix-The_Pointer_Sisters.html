		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes tell me how you want me
I can feel it in your heartbeat
I know you like what you see
Hold me, I'll give you all that you need
Wrap your love around me
You're so excited, I can feel you
Getting hotter, oh baby
I'll take you down, I'll take you down
Where no one's ever gone before
And if you want more, if you want more
More, more

Then jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then

Jump, jump for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms
Can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my love

You told me, I'm the only woman for you
Nobody does you like I do
Then make a move before you try and
Go much farther, oh baby
You are the one, you are the one
And heaven waits here at my door
And if you want more
If you want more, more, more

Then jump for my love
Jump in and feel my touch
Jump if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then

Jump, jump for my love
Jump, I know my heart can make you happy
Jump in, you know these arms
Can feel you up
Jump, if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my love

When you are next to me, oh I come alive
Your love burns inside, ooh
Oh, it feels so right
Come to me if you want me tonight

Jump
Jump in if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump, jump
Jump (ooh, yeah) you know my heart can (you know my heart can make you happy)
Make you happy
Jump, you know these arms can feel you up
Jump in if you want to taste my kisses
In the night then
Jump, jump for my love
Jump
C'mon and jump on in (ooh)
Jump (you know I need you, ooh)
Jump in (I got to have you, yeah yeah)
Jump, jump for my love (oh, oh yeah)
Jump (ooh, ooh)
Jump (oh, baby)
Jump in (yeah, yeah, yeah)
