		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm alone at night, 
And there's no one to comfort me, 
I think of you 
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms. 
And when the winter wind comes chasin' after me, 
I think of you 
And it's as though I crawl beneath the blanket 
Soft and warm. 

How did I get from dark to daylight, 
Before you happened to pass by? 
How did I find my way through life, 
Before you brightened up my sky? 
Was there a sky at all, 
Until you painted it for me? 
How did I get on, 
'Till you came along? 

Who knows how many times I pause in every day, 
To think of you? 
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea! 
And if you're wonderin' why it is I only think of you, 
Well it's because I'd like to be as close to you, 
As you've become to me! 
I think of you 
I think of you
