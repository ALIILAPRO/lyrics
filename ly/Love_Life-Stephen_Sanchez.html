		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got scars on my wrist 
From where I used to cut
I didn't wanna live but 
I still wanted love
Oh, she kept me around 
For a little while longer

Just a man in his head 
Too afraid to commit
But a little drop of blood 
Helped him not to forget
That he might want to stay 
For a little while longer
And all these streams down your cheeks

I can see that your insides dying
Less time smilin'
More time crying
I know you want this to be over

I can see that your heartbeat's shaking
I know it's hard if I'm not mistaken
I know you wanna try
To try to love life
Again

Oh the fuel that keeps me driving
Are my flesh on my bones and
Now those are growing scarce 
Since I used up my soul
Can you hold on for just a little while longer?

I ran around with strangers 
And I tried to be fun
But even when surrounded I still feel numb
All the time

I can see that your insides dying
Less time smilin'
More time crying
I know you want this to be over

I can see that your heartbeat's shaking
I know it's hard if I'm not mistaken
I know you wanna try
To try to love life

Oh I just need someone to hear me 
When I call though I am screaming next to
You don't hear me at all
Are you listening at all?
Are you listening at all?

I can see that your insides dying
Less time smilin'
More time crying
I know you want this to be over

I can see that your heartbeat's shaking
I know it's hard if I'm not mistaken
I know you wanna try
To try to love life
