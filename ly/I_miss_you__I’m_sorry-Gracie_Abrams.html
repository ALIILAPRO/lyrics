		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you remember happy together?
I do, don't you?
Then all of a sudden, you're sick to your stomach
Is that still true?

You said, "Forever," in the end I fought it
Please be honest, are we better for it?
Thought you'd hate me, but instead you called
And said, "I miss you", I caught it

Good to each other, give it the summer
I knew you too
But I only saw you once in December
I'm still confused

You said, "Forever," and I almost bought it
I miss fightin' in your old apartment
Breakin' dishes when you're disappointed
I still love you, I promise
Nothin' happened in the way I wanted
Every corner of this house is haunted
And I know you said that we're not talkin'
But I miss you, I'm sorry

I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
(You said, "Forever," and I almost bought it)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
(I miss fighting in your old apartment)
Everything I know brings me back to us
(Breaking dishes when you're disappointed)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
(I still love you, I promise)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
(Nothing happened in the way I wanted)
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
(Every corner of this house is haunted)
Everything I know brings me back to us
(And I know you said that we're not talking)
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
(But I miss you)
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
I don't wanna go, think I'll make it worse
Everything I know brings me back to us
I don't wanna go, we've been here before
Everywhere I go leads me back to you
