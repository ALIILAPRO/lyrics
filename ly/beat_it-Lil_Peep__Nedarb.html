		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I thought I had a feelin' before
And now you closin' the door
Because you don't want me comin' in
Yeah, I know I seen you before
Friday night at the store
You had another boy to hold your hand

Okay, now I see ya, bitch
You want me to beat it, bitch?
I ain't finna beat it, no, no
She said, "Why you so conceited, bitch?
Yeah, I got my reasons, bitch
Why the fuck you geekin' ho? Oh
Blood on the Nike swish
'Cause I had to bite the bitch
Blood steady leakin' ho, oh
Shawty lookin' tasty though
Free Yung Bruh, Lil Tracy, ho
I make shawty scream it, oh, oh
I'ma lil' angel doe
I can see your anger doe
I just can't believe it, oh, oh
She said, "I'm in danger," woah
I don't see no danger though
I'm the one that's creepin' oh, oh
Maybe I'll see you at the strip club
Maybe I'll never see your ass again
Maybe I'll see you when the game's up
Why you fakin', why you playin' pretend?

Yeah, I thought I had a feelin' before
And now you closin' the door
Because you don't want me comin' in
Yeah, I know I seen you before
Friday night at the store
You had another boy to hold your hand

Okay, now I see ya, bitch
You want me to beat it, bitch?
I ain't finna beat it, no, no
She said, "Why you so conceited, bitch?
Yeah, I got my reasons, bitch
Why the fuck you geekin' ho? Oh
Blood on the Nike swish
'Cause I had to bite the bitch
Blood steady leakin' ho, oh
Shawty lookin' tasty though
Free Yung Bruh, Lil Tracy, ho
I make shawty scream it, oh, oh
I'ma lil angel doe
I can see your anger doe
I just can't believe it, oh, oh
She said, "I'm in danger," woah
I don't see no danger though
I'm the one that's creepin' oh, oh
Maybe I'll see you at the strip club
Maybe I'll never see your ass again
Maybe I'll see you when the game's up
Why you fakin', why you playin' pretend?
