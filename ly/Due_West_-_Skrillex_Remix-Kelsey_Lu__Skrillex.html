		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Worship the ground that you walked on below 
Your pedestal
My mind put you onto a throne soon enough
I'll outgrow

Didn't know my feet were too big for my shoes
Running in them led me to bruise
Falling over
Running home to you
You had both my fingers and toes turning blue
So afraid of cutting me loose
You're holding onto me
You're holding on

Due west, I'm headed on this road
Due west, just cruise as far as I can go to
California, California, California
Never looking back, goodbye
A list of all the reasons why I wear them through
I do it all for you

(Oh, oh, oh ohh)
(Ooh, ooh ohh, ooh)

Bare feet against all the broken cement
left untended (ohh)
Picking the flowers of the old picket 
you've mended (ohh)

Didn't know my feet were too big for my shoes
Running in them led me to bruise
Falling over
Running home to you
You had both my fingers and toes turning blue
So afraid of cutting me loose
You're holding onto me
You're holding on


Due west, I'm headed on this road
Due west, just cruise as far as I can go to
California, California, California
Never looking back, goodbye (goodbye)
A list of all the reasons why I wear them through
I do it all for you

(Oh oh oh ohh)
(Oh oh ohh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ohh)
(Ooh ooh ohh)
(Oh oh oh ohh) (do it all) (do it all)
(Oh oh ohh) (do it all) (do it all)
(Ooh ooh ooh ohh) (do it all) (do it all)
(Ooh ooh ooh) (do it all) 

Due west, I'm due (do it all) (do it all) (do it all) (do it all)
Due west, for you (do it all) (do it all) (do it all) (do it all)
Due west, Cali, Cali Cali (do it all) (do it all) (do it all) (do it all)
As far as I can go to California (do it all) (do it all) 
California, California (do it all) (do it all) (do it all)
