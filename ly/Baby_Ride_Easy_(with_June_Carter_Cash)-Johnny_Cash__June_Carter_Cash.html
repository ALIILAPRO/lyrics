		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I drove a truck
And I were a waitress
And I ordered coffee
And I poured you some

Then you'd stop by on your way sometimes later
And if we arm-wrestled
I'd see that you won

Iee my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

If I were a winsome pale senorita
And I a bull-fighter, way down in the sand
While the band kept on playing that Old Paso Doable
Would you throw me a flower
Would you take my hand?

Iee my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

If I ran the country
I'd be your first lady and fix up the White House while you were away
Waiting while you're passing time with world leaders
Left alone together 
Alone we might lay

Iee my baby, ride easy, ride high in the saddle all day
If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away

If your loving is good
And your cooking ain't greasy
We'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
We'll chuck the chuck wagon and we'll ride away
