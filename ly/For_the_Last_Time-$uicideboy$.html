		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay in the cut on the Northside
Hollowpoints, trigger fingers 
On my fucking .45
Demons rising out the crypt
I snort me a fat line
Never gave a fuck
Grew up out the mud
Pull up, then I pop the trunk
Grew up with the fucking robbers
Always kept the mask on
Motherfuckers gon' die if we take the mask off
Suicide when I ride bitch
$carecrow the walking shadow
Mozart with no piano
Kill when I'm Sleepy Hollow
That mystic motherfucker that's addicted to prescriptions
Xanax for the panic
Mental problems you can add in
Multi million owned business
You just signed a deal, bruh?
Three years passed, still broke
And you ain't paid up
Dollars I ain't touched yet
Burn it for the fuck of it
Infamous lunatic
You, you just suck dick
Cut throat with the deathwish
Raised where the savage lives
Straight out the death pit
To keep alive the triple six

Ruby such a Misfit
Hollywood Babylon can't resist it
Fuck a cop bitch
I'm ducking all these piglets
7th Ward be my motherfucking district
Yeah, I still got my motherfucking wrist slit
Bleeding like a pissed bitch
Scheming I'ma hit licks after licking hits of acid in her fucking split lips
Wig split just a fucking tidbit
Dick itch from ingesting pill bits
Blue bill sick of snorting powder
I'ma ditch this hunnid for five twentys
TSA keep testing my money
Now I'ma dip quick
Find me a thick bitch
Tit gripped
Tip gripped
Dick spit in her thick hips
Fuck
Fuck with me, bitch, I'm a-fucking-ddicted
And I don't really give a fuck what it is
Told you already that Ruby can't resist it
Big clip to my head, watch that shit drip
