		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days go by my window
World slows down as it goes
Goodbye to last night
Lost my eyesight
Can't you help me see (they won't get right)

Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive, alive, alive

Waking in the snow
Tracing steps with you
Swimming through the snow
Wrapped in blow we go
Can't you help me see (they won't get right)

Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive, alive, alive

Can you describe to me
All the world that you see?
Oh I need it so much, I'm just waiting on
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to more people
Say hello to the future
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to more people
Say hello to the future

Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive, alive, alive

Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Loving every minute 'cause you make me feel so alive, alive, alive, alive
