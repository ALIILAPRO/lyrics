What makes you feel good?
What makes you angry inside?
Why don't you love me?
Do you wanna fuck me or fight?
You never asked me
If I had something to hide
You wanna hurt me
I'll make it easy tonight

You've got to stay skinny, don't you, girl?
You've got to stay pretty while you can
You've got to stay hungry for the fans
Or they'll try to burn you all out
They'll try to burn you all out, yeah

Your face is rotten
Ugliest smile I have seen
Your name's forgotten
Now go on and cut yourself clean
Why won't you answer?
You think you're better than me?
Go on, surrender
Another suicide teen

You've got to stay skinny, don't you, girl?
You've got to stay pretty as you were
You know we are living in a fucked up world
And they'll try to burn you all up
They're gonna burn you all up, yeah

Whoa, I'm burning out now
Whoa, I'm burning out
Can you feel me burning out?
Oh, I'm burning out

You've got to stay skinny, don't you, girl?
You've got to stay pretty while you can
You know we are living in this fucked up world
And they're gonna burn you all up
They're gonna burn you all out
