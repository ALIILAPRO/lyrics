		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Kane Train, you know what I'm sayin'? A nigga out here, you know me
Nigga, yeah yeah
Too much for these niggas, I need somethin' real quick, you know what I'm sayin'?
Doin' too much
East Side
Yeah, yeah

Rocks in a nigga wrist, too much (yeah)
Forgiatos on a Bent', too much (yeah, yeah)
'42, a nigga sip, too much (yeah)
I done hit another nigga bitch too much (yeah, yeah)

I got way too many enemies, they gotta be chewed up
Nigga with the monkey diamonds, they never could fool us (yeah, yeah)
Backstage at the shows, these hoes gon' choose up (yeah)
ATL to the Chi', these hoes get flewed up (yeah, yeah)
Michael Jackson, might go Tyson, know a nigga gotta beat it (yeah)
If the pussy undisputed then the head was undefeated (yeah)
Once I hit another city, then the number get deleted (yeah)
Hit the pussy undisputed and this pimpin' undefeated (yeah)
Once I seen the ho in person, knew the bitch was overrated 
Knew the shit was hella different with the fiddles and the makeup (yeah)
Got a quarter-ounce of rock up in my pot, I'm 'bout to shake
Skrrt, skrrt, 'bout to make it work, work with the paper, nigga

Rocks in a nigga wrist, too much
Forgiatos on a Bent', too much
'42, a nigga sip, too much
I done hit another nigga bitch too much
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
All these hoes that I got, I could never get boo'd up
Drive these cars on the lot, I be switchin' the shoes up
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
Rocks in a nigga wrist, too much
Forgiatos on a Bent', too much
'42, my nigga sip, too much
I done hit another nigga bitch too much
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
All these hoes that I got, I could never get boo'd up
Drive these cars on the lot, I be switchin' the shoes up
All this money that I got, I could never get too much

I get two hundred a verse and two hundred for a show
I need four hundred a O if I'm breakin' down the bowl
Why you doin' all the typin', we been tryna up the score? 
Niggas gangsta on the 'Gram, Cinderella on the ho (weak)
How much did the Phantom cost, Bagg? Too much 
Driver get me there when I'm high, too clutch
With another nigga bitch, wasn't switchin' two cups
All black, red inside, shit, too plush (go)
Trappin' in designer, new Balenci' with Adidas
Momma knew I was a hustler in her stomach as a fetus
I went back and forth the quarter, now I'm ballin', alopecia
Molly callin' me a cheater 'cause I fell in love with Keisha
First, I take a sip of potion then I trace it with exotic
Can you point out all the haters? I can't see 'em through these Carti's
Let my newer bitch pop it 'cause her ex-nigga watchin'
When you havin' plenty bread, all the pigeons come flockin'
You feel me?
Truth be told, I'ma always show the real me
It's chilly, bust down Cuban with the matchin' Richard Mille
Flyer than a eagle when I'm touchin' down in Philly (up)
Nickname the coupe, "Lil Wayne," no ceilings (drop)
Ain't no layin' up, I'm just drillin' and I'm peelin'
Uh, uh, got a Rolls, skrrt-skrrt out the door with these

Rocks in a nigga wrist, too much
Forgiatos on a Bent', too much
'42, a nigga sip, too much
I done hit another nigga bitch too much
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
All these hoes that I got, I could never get boo'd up
Drive these cars on the lot, I be switchin' the shoes up
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
Rocks in a nigga wrist, too much
Forgiatos on a Bent', too much
'42, my nigga sip, too much
I done hit another nigga bitch too much
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
All these hoes that I got, I could never get boo'd up
Drive these cars on the lot, I be switchin' the shoes up
All this money that I got, I could never get too much
