		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There were times
When I was young and free
And I said I'll need nobody
Only you eternally
But tonight I'm feelin' so alone
And I know I need somebody
But your heart is made of stone
And I know I need somebody
But your heart is made of stone

Tonight don't last forever, babe
Tonight my dreams can come true, baby
'Cause there's no mountain high enough
If God gave love to you

All my dreams are just memory
Of a river full of love, babe
To my endless destiny
Oh you said you'd make
My dreams come true
But I have never been so lonely
I have never been so blue
Oh I need, I need your love, babe
And you know you need me, too

Tonight don't last forever, babe
Tonight my dreams can come true, baby
'Cause there's no mountain high enough
If God gave love to you

Oh if God gave love to you, no

Oh no, oh no no no no no no no no no

Tonight don't last forever, babe
Tonight my dreams can come true, baby
'Cause there's no mountain high enough
If God gave love to you

Oh baby, God gave love to you
Oh baby, baby, God gave love to you
