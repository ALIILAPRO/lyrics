		  Rack rack city, bitch, rack rack rack city, bitch
Rack, rack rack rack city, bitch, (Mustard on the beat ho)

Rack city, bitch, rack rack city, bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenty on yo titties, bitch
100 deep VIP, no guest list
T-T-Raw, you don't know who you fuckin' with
Got my other bitch fuckin' with my other bitch
Fuckin' all night, nigga we ain't celibate
Niggas say I'm too dope, I ain't sellin' it
But I'm fresher than a motherfuckin' peppermint
Gold Lettermans, last king killin' shit
Y-Young Money, Young Money yeah, we gettin' rich
Got ya grandma on my dick (haha)
Girl you know what it is

Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch

I'm a muthafuckin' star (star)
Look at the paint on the car (car)
Too much rim make the ride too hard
Tell that bitch hop out, walk the boulevard
I need my money pronto
Get it in the morning like Alonzo
Rondo, green got cheese like a nacho
If you don't got no ass, bitch, wear a poncho
Head honcho got my seat back
Nigga staring at me, don't get bapped
Got my shirt off, the club too packed
It's too turnt going up like gas
Goddamn, pulled out my rags
Mike, Mike Jackson, nigga I'm Bad
Rat-tat-tat-tat, tatted up on my back
All the hoes love me, you know what it is

Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch

Throwing hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds
Throwing hundreds, hundreds, rack city bitch rack rack city bitch
Hundreds hundreds, Throwing hundreds, hundreds
Hundreds, hundreds rack city bitch rack rack city bitch

Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Rack city bitch, rack rack city bitch
Ten, ten, ten, twenties and them fifties bitch

Throwing hundreds, hundreds, hundreds, hundreds
Throwing hundreds, hundreds, rack city bitch rack rack city bitch
Hundreds hundreds, throwing hundreds, hundreds
Hundreds, hundreds rack city bitch rack rack city bitch

Rack city bitch rack rack city bitch

Rack city bitch rack rack city bitch
