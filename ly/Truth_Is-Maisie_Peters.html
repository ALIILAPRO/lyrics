		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey baby, won't you get up out your dress?
It's just the way you're talking, it's just your head
Hey baby, he's just something you'd regret
He's not a savior or the best you'll ever get

And that's real
But it doesn't stop the lump in my throat
Time will heal
But I'll always be a little bit broke

Truth is, you were the blow behind the bruises
You weren't love but I think I confused it
I see it like I always knew it
And it was ruthless, in cold blood
Still you believe there's no wound and no blood
Who took all of my trust then abused it?
Truth is, you did

Hey baby, all I ever did was care
You played a bitter game of musical chairs
Hey baby, I would fall and you would glare
I was a failure 'til I couldn't fuckin' bear it no more

And I'll never get back months of my life
Time will cure
But you're never gonna know what that's like

Truth is, you were the blow behind the bruises
You weren't love but I think I confused it
I see it like I always knew it
And it was ruthless, in cold blood
Still you believe there's no wound and no blood
Who took all of my trust then abused it? (Oh)
Truth is, you did

Did I rile up all your demons?
Did I give you any reason?
Or did I love you? Did I just love you?
Was it useful? Was it worth it?
Did you think that I deserved it?
'Cause I didn't, I just loved you

Truth is, you were the blow behind the bruises
You weren't love and if I could undo it
I'd never have been yours to ruin
You got off with no court and no blame
Who is out there living with no shame?
Who took my very worst fear and proved it?
Truth is, you did
