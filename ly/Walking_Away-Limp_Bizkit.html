		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down in a hole there are so many ways
To find yourself some light
It's always the miracles
Keep waiting all you like
Ain't got no time to waste
I know the end is near
And if I run away
I'll always end up here

Walking away
From the things I adore
Telling the truth
For once I'm sure
It's always a sign
When you feel yourself bleed
I'm walking away
From all I need

I can't escape the tragedy
That always brings me down
If I could eliminate
Those things that make me frown
Take all the baggage
That follows me around
And just disintegrate
Burn it to the ground

Walking away
From the things I adore
Telling the truth
For once I'm sure
It's always a sign
When you feel yourself bleed
I'm walking away
From all I need

I'm walking away
Yeah!
Walking away

Yeah, I'm walking away
From the things I adore (walking away)
Telling the truth
For once I'm sure (walking away)
It's always a sign
When you feel yourself bleed (walking away)
I'm walking away
From all I need

I'm walking away
