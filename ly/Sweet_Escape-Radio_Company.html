		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He said I want to be the one people turn to
Even if it means I may be wrong
Can't believe the tides are finally turning
Just as I had planned it all along
I'll howl at the moon until you hear me
cnd make all the other voices go away
Knowing somewhere in the dead of night
c better man with a bigger fight may show
cnd give it a go
Til then I'll sail through waters
No one has the nerve to
Tryin' to reach rock-bottom
Though I'm swimming in a bottomless sea
So many knots and kinks out here on the ocean
May as well live it up while I'm still free
I'll howl at the moon until you hear me
cnd make all the other voices go away
Knowing somewhere in the dead of night
c better man with a bigger fight may show
cnd give it a go
