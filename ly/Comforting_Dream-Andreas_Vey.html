		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  skimming pages of a romance while letters to you gather on a pile
the thought that it's over
is washed down with wine
and the silence overwhelms me again
and the memories inside my head
like grains of sand spread upon my bed I refuse
to sweep them away
and the silence overwhelms me again
oh, dreamer don't you cry
the sorrow will go by
just leave it for a while
and get lost in this endlessly wide, comforting dream
then it's time to settle down', they say
no time for a young man, to live for the day you gotta focus, and structure your life'
and the silence overwhelms me again
oh, dreamer don't you cry
the sorrow will go by
just leave it for a while
and get lost in this endlessly wide, comforting dream
oh my lover don't give up
all the sorrows will be passing like the clouds above oh my lover don't give up
it happens to all of us from time to time
oh, dreamer don't you cry
the sorrow will go by
just leave it for a while
and get lost in this endlessly wide, comforting dream
