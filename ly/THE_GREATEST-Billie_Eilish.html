		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm trying my best
To keep you satisfied
Let you get your rest
While I stayed up all night

And you don't wanna know
How alone I've been
Let you come and go
Whatever state I'm in, ah

Man, am I the greatest
My congratulations
All my love and patience
All my admiration
All the times I waited
For you to want me naked
Made it all look painless
Man, am I the greatest

Hm
Oh-oh, hm

Doing what's right
Without a reward
And we don't have to fight
When it's not worth fighting for (fighting for), mm

And you don't wanna know (know)
What I would've done (done), hm
Anything at all
Worse than anyone
Mm, ooh

And man, am I the greatest (greatest)
My congratulations (congratulations)
All my love and patience
All my admiration (admiration)
All the times I've waited (waited)
For you to want me naked (naked)
I made it all look painless
Man, am I the greatest

The greatest
The greatest, ah-oh
I
I loved you
And I still do
Just wanted passion from you
Just wanted what I gave you
I waited
And waited

Man, am I the greatest
God, I hate it
All my love and patience
Unappreciated
You said your heart was jaded
You couldn't even break it
I shouldn't have to say it
You could've been the greatest
