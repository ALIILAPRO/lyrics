		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Isn't truth supposed to set you free?
Well, why do I feel so weighed down by it?
If I could show them everything I've seen
Open their eyes to all the lies then
Would they change their minds like I did?
But when I speak, they tell me, "Sit down"
But how can I when I've already started runnin'?
Oh, this is where we've been
But it's not where we belong
And I may be young, but I know I'm not wrong

So I look up at the stars to guide me
And throw caution to every warning sign
If knowing what it could be is what drives me
Then let me be the first to stand in line
So I make this wish
To have something more for us than this
So I make this wish
To have something more for us than this

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah-ah
More than this, oh-ah-ah-ah

I never knew I needed room to grow
Yeah, I did what I was told when someone told me "no"
Now I've got all of this freedom in my bones
But I've still got the lid on, so it doesn't overflow
'Cause I've got reservations and hesitations
On where I should even begin
I'm past dipping my toes in
But I'm not, no, I'm not past diving in
If I could just be pointed in any given direction
On where to go and what to do
My legs are shaking, but my head's held high
The way you always taught me to

So I look up at the stars to guide me
And throw caution to every warning sign
I'm sure there will be challenges that find me
But I can take them on one at a time
So I make this wish
To have something more for us than this
So I make this wish
To have something more for us than this

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah (so I make this wish)
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah-ah (to have something more)
More than this, oh, ah-ah-ah

So I make this wish
To have something more for us than this
