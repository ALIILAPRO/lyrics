		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around, boy, that's just fine

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you

Ooh boy, I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you, I want you

I'm so excited (look what you do to me)
I just can't hide it (you got me burning up)
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it, yeah
I'm so excited (how did you get to me?)
And I can't deny, no, no, no (I've got to give it up)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) I know, I know that I want you

I'm so excited (look what you do to me)
Oh, boy (you got me burning up)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Hey, hey I think I like it
I'm so excited (how did you get to me?)
You got me (I've got to give it up)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Oh, ooh I like it boy

I'm so excited (look what you do to me)
Ooh, you got me burning up (burning up)
