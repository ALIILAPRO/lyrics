		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like talking to the moon
I told him about you
He said you sound sweet
He said he'd love to meet you
Then I turned away
I ended the conversation
Because I can't bear the thought that I can never introduce you
Sometimes I talk to the stars
They don't have much to say
So I fill the space describing the way your head fit on my chest like a puzzle
It was perfect, it was pleasant
Was it enough
Was I enough
Sometimes I talk to the sun
And tell him how you would shine
And how I miss the days when you were mine
I talk to the moon
I talk to the stars
I talk to the sun
And I tell them of the beauty of your soul
And I tell them the shine of your smile
And that I hope you're doing well
Yes, I hope you're doing well
I talk to the moon
I talk to the stars
I talk to the sun
