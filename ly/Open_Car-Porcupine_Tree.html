		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing like this, felt in her kiss
Cannot resist her
Fell for her charm, lost in her arms
I keep a photograph
Give me a glimpse, let me come in
Be there inside her
Here it begins, here is the sin
Something to lie about

You think you're smart, I think you art
We agree on this
It doesn't work, feeling like dirt
Feeling like you don't care
We get a room and in her gloom
She lights a cigarette
Clothes on the bed, "love me", she said
I lose myself to her

I'm getting feelings I'm hiding too well
(Bury the heart-shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(Being with you is hell)

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car

Okay, what's next after the sex?
What do we do now?
Finding the time, drawing the line
And never crossing it
Gave her the hours, gave her the power
Cannot erase her
Gave her the truth, gave her the proof
I gave her everything

I'm getting feelings I'm hiding too well
(I hide the feelings far too well) (bury the heart-shaped shell)
Something broke inside my stomach
I let the pieces lie just where they fell
(I left the pieces where they fell) (being with you is hell)

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down her arm
Hair blown in an open car
On a drive out to the farm
Hair blown in an open car

Hair blown in an open car
Summer dress slips down your arm
Hair blown in an open car
