		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm five hundred miles away from home

Teardrops fell on momma's note
When I read the things she wrote
She said we miss you son we love you come on home
Well I didn't have to pack
I had it all right on my back
Now I'm five hundred miles away from home
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home

Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
I know this is the same road I took the day I left home (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
But it sure looks different now (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
And I guess I look different too (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
'Cause time changes everything (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
I wonder what they'll say (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
When they see their boy looking this bad (doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)

Oh I wonder what they'll say when I get home
Can't remember when I ate
It's just thumb and walk and wait
And I'm still five hundred miles away from home
If my luck had been just right (away from home)
I'd be with them all tonight (away from home)
But I'm five hundred miles away from home (away from home)
Away from home, away from home
Cold and tired and all alone
Yes, I'm five hundred miles away from home
Oh, I'm five hundred miles away from home
