		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beep, beep, beep, beep with a east side thing
Chillin' on the west side
Hella thick, thick, hit me with the invite, yeah

So we can let it play through
Takin' our time, tasting it
And let it play through
No rewind, it's her favorite

Yeah, maybe I'd be secure
Peaches and cream
'Cause I've been tryna figure out this and more
Any room in those jeans?
Slowly, we be crazy in love
When I put you to bed, yeah
Soco, baby, what about us?
'Cause when I want you, you do

Tell your ex nigga, he can be quiet, be quiet (yeah, yeah)
And let you ride (uh)
He gon' need to be quiet, be quiet (yeah, yeah)
And let you ride (so)

So we can let it play through (let it play)
Takin' our time, pacin' it (ooh)
And let it play through (let it play)
No rewind, it's her favorite (ooh wee)

You should let me love you
You remind me of a girl
Baby, let me buy you a drink
Girl, we've been on repeat
Lots of you, you and me
I can't get 'em out my head (oh, whoa)
Kodak, memory, picture this
We were both butt naked in the bed (bed)
If you let me lay you down (yeah-yeah, ha)
We'll be buried in the sound (yeah-yeah, hey, hey)

Tell your ex nigga
He can be quiet, be quiet (he can be quiet, he can be quiet)
And let you ride (oh)
He gon' need to be quiet, be quiet (be quiet, be quiet)
And let you ride

So we can let it play through (ow!)
Takin' our time, pacin' it 
And let it play through (let it play now)
No rewind, it's her favorite (favorite)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (favorite)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (it's her favorite)

By the way you speak out loud, loud
And say what it is, yeah (ooh yeah)
I ain't come to play around-round
You know what it is (ohh)
Spread a little love right now
I can stand the rain
You can say my name (uh)
I could ease the pain right now
And never be the same

Tell your ex nigga, he can be quiet, be quiet (yeah, yeah)
And let you ride (uh)
He gon' need to be quiet, be quiet (yeah, yeah)
And let you ride (so)

So we can let it play through (let it play)
Takin' our time, pacin' it (ooh)
And let it play through (let it play)
No rewind, it's her favorite (ooh wee)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (favorite)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (it's her favorite)

Let it play
Baby, just let it play
It's her favorite
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (favorite)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (it's her favorite)

Oh, ooh wee, ooh wee, yeah
