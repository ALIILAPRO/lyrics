		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's deeper than rappin', this life can get crazy

Off the porch and didn't know where to go (where to go) 
Cross the street with my dawg, yeah, the woe' (the woe')
Bein' me made it harder to grow
Still went up, got my feet off the floor (off the floor)
Gunna Wunna been wavy (Gunna Wunna been wavy)
But I always been playin' it low (playin' it low)
Gettin' that work on the daily (gettin' work on the daily)
Got a M and went crazy (got a M and went crazy)
Then I went, moved my mom out the shady
Went and bought a Mercedes (Mercedes) 
Took a L, niggas thinkin' it's gravy
Niggas gotta be crazy (gotta be crazy)
Poppin' out, they gon' see me in HD
Give a reason to hate me (reason to hate me)
Me, your bitch, and her friend, that's a cool three
I can give 'em three reasons to hate me
I care less that they talkin' for less
I pull off in a yacht like it don't even phase me (phase me)
I been talkin' to my accountant a lot, tryna make what I got stack tall like KD
Niggas talkin' 'bout who callin' the shots 
Bitches callin' my phone talkin' they want a baby
Shit get tragic, but we still make it happen 
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy

All this money, I'm goin' crazy
All these bitches, I'm goin' crazy
Missed some millions, I'm goin' crazy
All these killers, I'm goin' crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy
Spendin' them racks, go crazy (crazy)
Make it right back, that's crazy (that's crazy)
All these Benjamin's, I'ma go crazy (that's crazy) 
Gettin' it in, my numbers look crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy

Is it true, boy, you reap what you sow?
If you fast, if you know, then you know
When I pray, got my knees on the floor (pray)
To the high even when I feel low (high)
Ride or die, forever, I hope even when shit get crazy (when shit get crazy)
Geekin' up, 'bout to stop bein' sober, livin' every day faded (livin' every day faded)
Think I got me a down bottom bitch do whatever I tell her whenever I say it (whenever I say it)
Come to find out her P stand for pussy and she give it to any player that's payin' (payin') 
I can dig it, but not for no made man 
That's too slow, that lil' money won't phase me
Like you keep pullin' folks out the ditch 
That won't give you back shit and you know that it's crazy
Remember when brother helped me get that chip off my shoulder 
He told me can't nobody save me
We done traveled, we come save the world
Lookin' out for the girls and took care of the babies
I done took some real losses and losses 
I'm still gettin' it back, ain't nothin' you can say to me
Gunna Wunna just said what it was and you still tryna make this shit up and it's crazy

All this money, I'm goin' crazy
All these bitches, I'm goin' crazy
Missed some millions, I'm goin' crazy
All these killers, I'm goin' crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy
Spendin' them racks, go crazy
Make it right back, that's crazy (that's crazy)
All these benjamins, I'ma go crazy (that's crazy)
Gettin' it in, my numbers look crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy (crazy)
It's deeper than rappin', this life'll get crazy
