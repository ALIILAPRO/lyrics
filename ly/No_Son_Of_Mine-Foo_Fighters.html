		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No son of mine will ever do
The work of villains, the will of fools
If you believe it, it must be true
No son of mine, no son of mine

No son of mine will ever need
To beg forgiveness, no wicked deed
Head full of evil, heart full of greed
No son of mine, no son of mine

Here we are, living dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says

No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine

No son of mine will ever be
Under the power vested in thee
March into slaughter down on his knees
No son of mine, no son of mine

Here we are, living dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says

No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine, oh

No son of mine will ever say
Words of illusion, oh, this I pray
Heretofore taking my name in vain
No son of mine, no son of mine

Here we are, living dead
Hand to God with one foot in the grave
Age of lost innocence
Don't forget what your good book says

No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine
No son of mine, oh
