		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you gotta be like that?

So back and forth
I don't know if you're bored
You want nothing then more, ah
Say something should change
But you just stay the same
I can't see in your brain, ah

Every time we kiss I ask you
Why we do this every time?
You say that you're just having fun, well

Why you gotta be like that?
Late night calling my phone
Telling me you wanna get close, ah
There you go giving me hope, I don't know
Why you gotta be like that?
Always coming on too strong
Never wanna stay too long, ah
Then you say that if I fall
Then it's all my fault
Yeah, why you gotta be like that?
(Why you gotta be like that?)
Why you gotta be like that? (Why? Why?)

Can't call it friends
Yeah 'cause it always ends
With you bending all your rules, ah, I know
That it's kinda sadistic
And I'm masochistic you push me away
Then you say that you miss it
I shoulda learned by now that
I can't figure you out, 'cause

Every time we kiss I ask you
Why we do this every time?
You say that you're just having fun, well

Why you gotta be like that?
Late night calling my phone
Telling me you wanna get close, ah
There you go giving me hope, I don't know
Why you gotta be like that?
Always coming on too strong
Never wanna stay too long, ah
Then you say that if I fall
Then it's all my fault
Yeah, why you gotta be like that?
(Why you gotta be like that?)
Yeah, why you gotta be like that?
(Why? Why?)
