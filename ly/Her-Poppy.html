		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give her a face
Give her a name
That isn't hers
Then make her yours
Say she's adored
Call her a whore
Then pick her up
Throw her on the floor

I'm getting to know her
And all of her anger
You won't recognize her
If you encountered
I'm getting to know her
And all of her anger
Picked herself up
Put her back together

Give her a taste
Take it away
Under your thumb
Tell her to stay
Don't say a word
Don't disobey
When she woke up
She ran away

I'm getting to know her
And all of her anger
You won't recognize her
If you encountered
I'm getting to know her
And all of her anger
Picked herself up
Put her back together

Run your mouth to keep her scared
You expected her to care
But when her mind made up
You were illfully prepared

Have you observed?
And what have you learned?
The girl that you knew
Will never be yours

I'm getting to know her
And all of her anger
You won't recognize her
If you encountered
I'm getting to know her
And all of her anger
Picked herself up
Put her back together
