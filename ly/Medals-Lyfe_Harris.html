		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The city getting wild
I been tryna move on the low
And I been 10 toes down can’t turn on myself yet
Im probably MIA when you calling on me, oh
You want me turn down for you Thats so selfish
Oh yea, just meet there
Yea I cant play it safe
No I cant hesitate no more
You know you gotta be clear with your intentions
When you know your calling out shawty
And I been tryna run it up before I let you wear me out shawty
I wear the gold chains like medals when I run from your love
Put the pedal to the metal
Good luck tryna keep up shawty
Now Im done holding back
Done with holding my tongue shawty
And I’m always on road
But I’m there when it means the most to you shawty
I been crying codeine, double cup for my tears
And I been full speed ahead with the devil on my heels shawty
I was out down bad, now I saw it so clear
Another red eye flight when I need you right here
My bitch a diva look just like Renni
I blow a bag on my baby going big at Fendi
I switch lanes in a foreign till the tanks on empty yea
And I won’t change for the death of me
Im stuck in my ways girl yea
I may not face all my fears now girl i'm honest
Got me pouring up again
Almost drown in my cup shawty (Oh yea)
I wear the gold chains like medals when I run from your love
Put the pedal to the metal
Good luck tryna keep up shawty
Now Im done holding back
Done with holding my tongue shawty
And I’m always on road
But I’m there when it means the most to you shawty
