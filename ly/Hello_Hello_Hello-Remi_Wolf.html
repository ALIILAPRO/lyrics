		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There he go, my baby never answers in the room
Steps outside, or puts it on snooze
He just do whatever he do
Me and my baby used to wake up a little past noon
Now he's wakin' up too soon
To get on the phone with you

Like, hello, hello, hello?
How's my little lady in the New York snow?
Yeah, he says I love you, I love you loads
We got a certified gambler messin' with me
Hello, hello, hello
I got one foot in and one out the door
I think it's 'bout time that I take control
'Cause I'm a certified gambler, fuckin' with three
Hello, hello, hello (fuckin' with three)
Hello, hello, hello

When I'm gone my baby makin' eggplant parmesan
When he's with his other baby he's a vegetarian (oh oh oh)
But my baby miss me more than he misses his job
Makin' pizza in the Bronx
He just has to call me up

Like, hello, hello, hello?
How's my little lady playin' rock and roll?
Or maybe these days you like pop and soul
He's a certified gambler messin' with me
Hello, hello, hello
I got one foot in and one out the door
I think it's 'bout time that I take control
I'll be a certified gambler fuckin' with three
A certified gambler messin' with me
Got a lotta things that I didn't even wanna say (hello, hello, hello)
Certified gambler messin' with me (hello, hello, hello)
I got a lot of things that I never wanted to say (hello, hello, hello)
Certified gambler messin' with me, ayy, ayy, ayy

She's starflower and coffee
You can put her in your pocket
And take her across the country
If it ain't cheatin' then what would you call it? (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Starflower and coffee
You can put her in your wallet (ayy, ayy, ayy)
And take her across the country
If you ain't cheatin' then why she be callin'?

Like, hello, hello, hello? (So why she be callin'?)
How's my little lady in the new york snow? (She always be callin')
Yeah he says I love you, I love you loads (but what should we call it?)
We got a certified gambler messin' with me
Hello, hello, hello (so why she be callin'?)
I got one foot in and one out the door (she always be callin')
I think it's 'bout time that I take control (but what should we call it?)
'Cause I'm a certified gambler fuckin' with three
Hello, hello, hello (so why she be callin'?)
Hello, hello, hello (she always be callin')
Ooh
