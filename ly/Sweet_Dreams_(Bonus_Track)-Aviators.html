		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't mind the noise outside the door
It's just a phantom, nothing more
No need to give yourself a scare
When you glance and no one's there
I don't wanna have to hurt you
It's not your fault, I felt his rage
Just a child, about your age
But something drives me to this place
I can see him in your face
You'll never know the hell I've seen

Don't fear what's coming
We can't fight off the urge inside
It's dark and you're afraid of
The devils that come out at night
Let's make this easy
Soon, you'll haunt these beasts you hated
No need for sleep tonight
Sweet dreams are overrated

I'm just a whisper in the void
No one's there, you're paranoid
I'm just a trick of your own mind
Blink your eyes once and you'll find
I'm just a ghost inside your head
Don't fear your fate that soon arrives
It's a deadly lullaby
You'll be with us very soon
Another spirit in the room
Take your place among the lost

Don't fear what's coming
We can't fight off the urge inside
It's dark and you're afraid of
The devils that come out at night
Let's make this easy
Soon, you'll haunt these beasts you hated
No need for sleep tonight
Sweet dreams are overrated

You can't wake from this dream
No one will hear you screaming
So hold on for the ride
I'll take you with me tonight
This nightmare, this prison
Inside the suit's we live in
Don't fear me, together
We'll have sweet dreams forever

Don't fear what's coming
We can't fight off the urge inside
It's dark and you're afraid of
The devils that come out at night
Let's make this easy
Soon, you'll haunt these beasts you hated
No need for sleep tonight
Sweet dreams are overrated

Don't fear what's coming
We can't fight off the urge inside
It's dark and you're afraid of
The devils that come out at night
Let's make this easy
Soon, you'll haunt these beasts you hated
No need for sleep tonight
Sweet dreams are overrated
Sweet dreams are overrated
