I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch
I had put down my Glock but I picked up a stick
Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit
I made a way for you lil' bitty niggas
I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah

They got exotic, I told them to mail it
I don't gotta touch it, somebody gon' sell it
Bro gon' keep it solid, I know he won't tell it
Grew up in the streets, I ain't never stop barely
I didn't have shit, I ain't never get jealous
Born in this shit, I grew up with some felons
Reach for this water, we'll go at your melon
My lil' bro a slime, he'll draw on a reverend
I don't really have to talk about steppin'
'Cause my niggas never get caught when it happen
I'm set on servin' in the mornin', I'm snappin'
You can take this as your warnin', I'm packin'
FN inside of my hand when I back in
Get to actin', I promise we clappin'
Joke's Up, it gotta be stamped on the package
It's the real one, you know that I'm taxin'
Get the ball, I'ma score or I'm passin'
Got no love for no ho, I ain't passionate
I done ran up a dub on an accident
To the streets, I'm the voice, I'm an advocate
Ask the plug, this the most he done ever sent
Niggas broke, what's the most you done ever spent?
Gettin' paid, this the most I done ever saved
We gon' hop out with Ks and it's broad day

I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch
I had put down my Glock but I picked up a stick
Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit
I made a way for you lil' bitty niggas
I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah
I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch
I had put down my Glock but I picked up a stick
Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit
I made a way for you lil' bitty niggas
I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah

All this shit started off in the kitchen (started off in the kitchen)
Showed me once and I was payin' attention
Ask the trenches, they gon' say I'm the realest (say I'm the realest)
Official, the difference between me and niggas
I'm rich when I get off my Insta (get off my Insta)
Get him killed by the night for a sixty
I sent it, I can't even risk it
Opps want me finished but I'm steadily winnin'
Youngest, richest nigga out of my city
I been had the streets in a headlock (headlock)
We had two or three bricks at Miss Jan spot (at Miss Jan's)
Still dead fresh if the feds watch
Send a diss in hidin', get yo' man shot (get yo' man)
Niggas play but they know we gon' air it out
She was actin' bougie, flew her friend out
I went and took it, ain't ask for a handout
Old niggas see me out and put they heads down
I still got my block if the music don't crack
Really livin' what I rap (yeah, yeah)
Two-fifty out the trap, if I say it, it's a fact
You was puttin' on an act
You a killer on the app (killer on the app)
Ask who put us on the map
Put the hood on my back
Three cars, ten straps
Niggas better never lack, yeah

I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch
I had put down my Glock but I picked up a stick
Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit
I made a way for you lil' bitty niggas
I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah
I been savin' my guala, I ain't savin' no bitch
I had put down my Glock but I picked up a stick
Don't get in hatin' shit, I'm on some greatest shit
My people proud, I'm as real as it gets
Gon' have to chase me, I don't like to wait
And I swear I'm impatient, I don't like to sit
I made a way for you lil' bitty niggas
I wish you would play with me, boy, you a bitch, yeah
