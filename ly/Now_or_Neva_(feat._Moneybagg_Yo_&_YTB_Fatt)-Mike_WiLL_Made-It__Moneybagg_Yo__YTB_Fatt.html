Mhm, yeah, mhm-mhm
(Mike WiLL Made-It)
Go

Now or never (now or never)
Now or never (now or never)
Now or never
This yo' moment, it's now or never
Gotta want it
Now or never (now or never)
Now or never (right now, right now)
Now or never
Get that dub, it's now or never
Right now, go

Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, B-roll like a film
Tryna reach the goal, jumpin' from the free throw (above the rim)
White and rose chain cost a whole lot of Cheetos (chips)
When you scorin' triple-doubles, you the neighborhood hero (people's champ)
Y'all was bein' lazy (sleep)
I was on go, go whole time
Drip down daily (he flashy)
Pour four of four though
They can't believe I made it (why not?)
Shot it from the logo (took risks)
Crowd goin' crazy (it's packed)
Turn 'em up some more though (to the max)

Now or never (now or never)
Now or never (now or never)
Now or never
This yo' moment, it's now or never
Gotta want it
Now or never (now or never)
Now or never (right now, right now)
Now or never
Get that dub, it's now or never
Right now, go

Slam on someone like Rose (Derek), everybody out they seats (woo)
I'm sittin' courtside (uh), Louis on my feet
My aim like Curry, if we in trouble, put your faith in me
I stand tall in any situation just like Yao Ming (huh)
Rose gold diamond Rollie (bullets), it hit when the light shine
I ain't showin' no love for nobody, but we smooshin' when it's crunchtime
They thought I was playin' about that championship, it's go time
It's now or never, tell 'em put you in the game, it's your time

Now or never (now or never)
Now or never (now or never)
Now or never
This yo' moment, it's now or never
Gotta want it
Now or never (now or never)
Now or never (right now, right now)
Now or never
Get that dub, it's now or never
Right now, go
