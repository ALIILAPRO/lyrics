		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She came here begging for love
I came here running for sleep
She came here begging for no-one
I can’t be running for sleep

She came here begging for love
I came here running for sleep
She came here begging for no-one
I give you twenty my love

I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love

Oh when you got me really low
And its got me by the phone
And its got me really old
And its got me really

Oh when you got me really low
And its got me by the phone
And its got me really old
And its got me really

I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty

She came here begging for love
I came here running for sleep
She came here begging for no-one
I can’t be running for sleep

She came here begging for love
I came here running for sleep
She came here begging for no-one
I give you twenty my love

I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love

Drink your wine out
I give you twenty my love

And if you let me…

Oh when you got me really low
And its got me by the phone
And its got me really old
And its got me really

Oh when you got me really low
And its got me by the phone
And its got me really old
And its got me really

I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
I give you twenty my love
Twenty, twenty
