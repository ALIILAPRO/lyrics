		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You think you know me
Got me figured out
You?re casting shadows
I?m casting doubt
You think you know me
You think I care
You should spend some time with the person in the mirror

I'm a fist, I'm afraid, I'm a link in the chain
I'm the worst of the best, but I'm in this race
You don't know me
I'm a knife, I'm a rope, I'm a bitter pill
I'm a tooth on the cog that you built to spill
You don't know me

I'm not defined by what you think I am
I won't fall into your predetermined plan
All like diamonds without the shine
If you never take the time you never know what you won't find

I'm a crow, I'm the most with the least to gain
I'm a fading Mona Lisa in a plywood frame
You don't know me
I'm a ring on a tree in a life that fell
What I did I done good and what I done I did well
You don't know me

Hate is a river flowing with money and greed
Drawing borders 
Lines on a map we don't need

I'm a wall, I'm a fence, I'm a dotted line
I'm the land you kill for in the name of your kind
You don't know me
I'm a storm, I'm a sign, I'm a bleeding heart
I'm the time that got away
It's already gone
You don't know me
