		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes is a maybe
And maybe is a no out in LA
I'm taking my time on the East Coast
Where no is a no
And if you're fake it'll show
Calling out mayday
Shit didn't happen in my heyday
Sippin top shelf but I'm still broke
And mama said no
Save a little money let it grow
I keep coming down
'Cause everyone says that they're ok
Fake smiles can't make it past Tuesday
Fighting my personal crusade
Overwhelmed over due dates
Can't wait for my doomsday
Saying I'm ok
If I make it will it make me hate it
Wish I could go back to the basics
Overwhelmed over due dates
Can't wait for my Doomsday Doomsday
Have not slept in a week now
Haven't breathed in a month
And its taking every fibre of my being just to not give up
Laugh it off
coffee cup
not enough
chosen drug call the cops
need to stop
'Cause I keep coming down
Everyone says that they're ok
Fake smiles can't make it past Tuesday
Fighting my personal crusade
Overwhelmed over due dates
Can't wait for my doomsday
Saying I'm ok
If I make it will it make me hate it
Wish I could go back to the basics
Overwhelmed over due dates
Can't wait for my Doomsday
Doomsday
Hope one day I'll find a way to put my feet up and know I could be enough
Hope one day I'll find a way to put my feet up and know I could be enough
'Cause everyone says that they're ok
Fake smiles can't make it past Tuesday
Fighting my personal crusade
Overwhelmed over due dates
Can't wait for my doomsday
Saying I'm ok
If I make it will it make me hate it
Wish I could go back to the basics
Overwhelmed over due dates
Can't wait for my Doomsday Doomsday
