		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God only knows at first sight you're dangerous
You're killing me slowly, our love is scandalous
Look at me now
I have no doubt
I promise, I'll love you till the end of time
So fuck me, I'll fuck you and give you my life
I'm naked, you're naked, so don't ask me why...
I like it, I like it please tell me you're mine
You're never afraid of the Devil in I
Call out my name while I tie up your wrists
Call out my name when I'm kissing your lips
You like it, you like it so don't be so shy
Yeah I know good girls can be naughty sometimes

Pour me some wine, pour it into my heart
The Devil inside you is crushing on mine
Fuck me, I'll fuck you and give you my life
I'm naked, you're naked, so don't ask me why...
I like it, I like it please tell me you're mine
You're never afraid of the Devil in I...
So fuck me, I'll fuck you and give you my life
I'm naked, you're naked, so don't ask me why...
I like it, I like it please tell me you're mine
You're never afraid of the Devil in I
