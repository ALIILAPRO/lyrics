		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel adrenaline rushing through me,
Under my skin.
I can't calm down,
I'm on a high.
Your past becomes,
My beat tonight.

You've gotta,
Push, A little harder.
Push, A little harder.
Push, A little harder.
Push, A little harder.
Push, A little harder.
Push, A little harder.
Push, A little harder.
Ain't no rules tonight.
Turn it up, get it u-up,
Just the way I like it. (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me).
So turn it up, get it u-up
Just the way I like it, (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me).
Hey, hey, hey, just the way i like it,
Hey, hey, hey, wa-way i like it

Strobe lights, flashing ahead??.
I can see your heart,
On infrared.
Blazing high, don't stop,
We're moving in sync and tonight,
We won't leave anything.

You've gotta,
Push, A little harder,
Push, A little harder,
Push, A little harder,
Push, A little harder,
Push, A little harder,
Push, A little harder,
Push, A little harder,
Ain't no rules tonight
Turn it up. get it u-up
Just the way I like it, (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me).
So turn it, up get it u-up
Just the way I like it (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me),
Hey, hey, hey, just the way i like it,
Hey, hey, hey, wa-way i like it
Hey, hey, hey, just the way i like it,
Hey, hey, hey.

You know what to do,
My hands on you.
You know what to do,
There ain't no rules.

You know what to do,
My hands on you.
You know what to do,
There ain't no rules tonight.

Turn it up, get it u-up
Just the way I like it, (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me),
So turn it up get it u-up
Just the way I like it, (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me).

Turn it up get it u-up
Just the way I like it, (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me).
So turn it up get it u-up
Just the way I like it, (Come get with me),
I like it, (Girl watchin' me).

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
