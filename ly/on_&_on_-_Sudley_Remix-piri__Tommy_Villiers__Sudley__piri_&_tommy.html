		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big night, lost my weed
But the beat goes
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Cold outside, they're all tired
But the feet move 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Good vibes seem to be in the air now
Somebody starts jumping, we all follow on
Come downs coming down
But for now we move 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

I think there's something in the water
Making it seem like
The grass is dancing on the ground
I want more, I go in harder
I wanna feel like
I can see the whole world spinning 'round

Big night, lost my weed
But the beat goes 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Cold outside, they're all tired
But the feet move 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Good vibes seem to be in the air now
Somebody starts jumping, we all follow on
Come downs coming down
But for now we move 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

I feel this energy around us
If you see us then leave us where you found us
We've got tomorrow left to ground us, yeah (yeah)
'Cause the crowd moves like it's got a mind of its own
Not done yet, we don't wanna go home
Turn it up, let the beat go on
On, on, on, on, on, on, on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on

Big night, lost my weed
But the beat goes 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Cold outside, they're all tired
But the feet move 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Good vibes seem to be in the air now
Somebody starts jumping, we all follow on
Come downs coming down
But for now we move 
On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on
