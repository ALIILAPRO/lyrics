		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let the madness begin

Living with snakes
Feeding the hate
Kill the betrayal
Shedding of skin
Bitter within
Cower in shame
Venomous tongue
Blacken the lungs
Inducing the pain
Inducing the pain
With constant pushing provoking reactions

Bring out the knives
To cut and divide
Another scar for memory
Bring out the knives
To cut and divide
Let 'em bleed, watch 'em burn in the fire

Digging a hole
Bury the trust
Lay it to rest
Swallow the dirt
Breathe in the dust
Savor the taste
Hammer the nails
Nothing to save
Walking away
Walking away
From constant screaming, provoking, it's madness

Bring out out the knives
To cut and divide
Another scar for memory
Bring out the knives
To cut and divide
Let 'em bleed, watch 'em burn in the fire
Bring out the knives (knives)
To cut and divide
Another scar for memory
Bring out the knives (knives)
To cut and divide
Let 'em bleed, watch 'em burn in the fire

(So keep on digging your own grave)
(Now just focus on the pain)

uh
So keep on digging your own grave
I see the panic, it's sickening
You're not a saint, not a slave
Now just focus on the pain
I hear the voices, they're calling
To sever, forever, insanity
You're not a saint, you're a slave

Breaking apart
Torn at the seems
Sanity fails
Dragged by the edge
Pushed into hell
Never again
Never again
Constant pushing, provoking reactions

Bring out the knives
To cut and divide
Another scar for memory
Bring out the knives
To cut and divide
Let 'em bleed, watch 'em burn in the fire

Bring out the knives (knives)
To cut and divide
Another scar for memory
Bring out the knives (knives)
To cut and divide
Let 'em bleed, let 'em burn
Bring out the knives

Just swallow the dirt
And breathe in the dust
Now savor the taste
No walking away
No walking away
Bring out the knives
