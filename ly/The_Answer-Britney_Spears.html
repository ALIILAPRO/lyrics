		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I've been waiting for you 
So patiently 
And now you're here 
You're my answer 

Thank you 
Yeah 
I think you're my answer 
Here I go 

You're the answer 
All this time I've tried to find you 
I've been yearning 
You're the answer to the question that's been burning 
When they ask me who I love, you're the answer 
You're my answer 

Patiently I've waited for this day to finally come 
Knew someday, somehow, I would find that special one 
Someone perfect, someone true 
Someone that I knew was you 

Who can hold me tight 
Keep me warm through the night 
Who can wipe my tears 
When it's wrong, make it right 

Who can give me love until I'm satisfied 
Who's the one I need in my life 

You're the answer 
All this time I've tried to find you 
I've been yearning 
You're the answer to the question that's been burning 

When they ask me who I love 
You're the answer 
You're my answer 

Baby I'm underneath your spell 
Savor every moment that I have you to myself 
Put my loving to the test cause baby this is destiny 
Yeah, this is destiny 

Who can hold me tight 
Keep me warm through the night 
Who can wipe my tears 
When it's wrong, make it right 
Who can give me love until I'm satisfied 
You're the one I need in my life 

You're the answer 
All this time I've tried to find you 
I've been yearning 
You're the answer to the question that's been burning 
When they ask me who I love 
You're the answer 
You're my answer 

You're the answer 
All this time I've tried to find you 
I've been yearning 
You're the answer to the question that's been burning 

When they ask me who I love 
You're the answer 
You're my answer 
Who can hold me tight 

Keep me warm through the night 
Who can wipe my tears 
When it's wrong, make it right 
Who can give me love until I'm satisfied 
Who's the one I need in my life 

You're the answer 
All this time I've tried to find you 
I've been yearning 
You're the answer to the question that's been burning 

When they ask me who I love 
You're the answer 
You're my answer 
You're the answer 

You're my answer, you're my answer, you're my answer 
You're my answer
