		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling (smiling)
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see?

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

Drop the bass

I'm so alone
Here on my own
And I'm waiting for you to come
I want to be a part of you
Think of all the things we could do

And every day
You're in my head
I want you to have you in my bed
You are the one
You're in my eyes
All I ever wanted in my life

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

(Are you ready?)

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
Was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

All I ever wanted
