		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grenadine quarantine, I like you a lot
It's LA, "hey" on Zoom, Target parking lot
And if this is the end, I want a boyfriend
Someone to eat ice cream with and watch television
Walk home from the mall with
'Cause what I really meant is when I'm being honest
I'm tired of this shit

'Cause my body is my temple, my heart is one too
The only thing that still fits me is this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
My time is running over so the only time you'll ever see me
Is in your dreams, in my black bathing suit
Looking at me looking over at you
Real cute 'cause

He said I was bad
Let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad
Let me show you what bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better

Swisher Sweets, magazines
Promise you it's not 'cause of you that I'm mean
It's my afterthoughts
And what I never said, why there's a price on my head
It's nothing to do with them, it's my karmic lineage
So I'm not friends with my mother but still love my dad
Untraditional lover, can you handle that?

I guess I'm complicated, my life sorta too
I wish you could see to my soul through this black bathing suit
You don't know me any better than they do, baby
'Cause I sing like an angel, my heart's like one too
The only thing that fits is this black bathing suit
Looking at me looking over at you
Real cute 'cause

He said I was bad
Let me show you how bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
He said I was bad
Let me show you what bad girls do
'Cause no one does it better
They said I was bad
And I'll show them what bad girls do

In my black bathing suit
Oh, let 'em talk about me
They're just yesterday's news
They're fucking broke and we're laughin' about him
Mail me when you get the blues
We'll have the last laugh about it
By the way, thanks for the shoes
Your inches really made stacks, your inches really made stacks
Your inches really made stacks out of it
Your inches really made stacks out of it for me (so thanks for that)
Your inches really made stacks out of it for me (so thanks for that)
Your inches really made stacks out of it for me
So thanks for that
