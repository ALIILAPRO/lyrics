		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come fill me up
I can love you crazy baby
Can't get enough, no
Just the feel of your touch can take me
Come take me for the ride of my life

Don't
Don't you stop
Right there
Baby I (Whisper in your ear like)
Don't
Don't you stop
Right there
Right there

With every motion, lose control, you got me floating away
Lose myself to you
When we're alone, that's all I want when I'm alone with you

Come take me for the ride of my life

Constant pleasure
Know just what you want, I got it here forever
Won't you find my treasure
Don't you know that once you feel the flame
It'll never be the same
Oh I just might act right
If you take your time
If you can love me gently
(Speed it up, be steady)
Give it your best shot
Baby love me all night
Need time, got plenty
Take me, I'm ready

Don't
Don't you stop (don't you stop)
Right there (right there)
Baby I (Whisper in your ear like)
Don't
Don't you stop (don't you stop)
Right there (right there)
Right there (right there)

With every motion, lose control, you got me floating away
Lose myself to you (to you) (yeah)
When we're alone, that's all I want when I'm alone with you (alone)

Come take me for the ride of my life

When your lips touch me, I can't take it
Way you make me feel, I can't fake it
Baby don't slow down, just give me your all now
I'ma give it to you how you want
Baby we can do it all night long
Long
