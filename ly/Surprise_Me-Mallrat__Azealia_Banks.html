		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why does it surprise me when you find me?
Is the night young? Is it like me?
Come on, spit it out now, stay beside me
Pull me closer, hold me tightly
Why does it surprise me when you find me?
Is the night young? Is it like me?
Come on, spit it out now, stay beside me
Pull me closer, hold me tightly

Ooh, boy, I know you know
Don't pretend you don't
Boy, I know you know
I won't let it go
I read between the lines
Believe in every sign
Let's leave them all behind
You're all I need

Why does it surprise me when you find me?
Is the night young? Is it like me?
Come on, spit it out now, stay beside me
Pull me closer, hold me tightly
Why does it surprise me when you find me?
Is the night young? Is it like me?
Come on, spit it out now, stay beside me
Pull me closer, hold me tightly

Ooh, boy, I know you know
Don't pretend you don't
Boy, I know you know
I won't let it go
I read between the lines
Believe in every sign
Let's leave them all behind (uh, uh, yeah)
You're all I need

Uh
It's wet and tropical, pussy pi√±a colada
Get on top of it and ride 
while I'm drinking right out the bottle
If I suck it, I'ma swallow
I'm 'bout it nigga
you gotta spend some dollars on this model for Birkin 
I'm 'bout to twerk it
Wanna play, play
I'll be your playmate
You Louis C.K
Jerk it like a Shake Weight
It's a piece of cake, cake
I could steal your bae, bae
Eat the cookie up
Sprinkles on his face, face
Said he wanted this expensive taste
Wanna travel 'round the world, switch the lenses case
I squirted on him like a squid, now he inky faced
He said my pussy tighter than Nicole Kidman's face, yeah

Ooh, boy, I know you know (oh, oh, oh)
I know you know
This pussy the best this year
My pussy the wettest 
I'm really his fetish
And now all these fuckin' bitches is jealous, uh
I won't let it go
I read between the lines
Believe in every sign
Let's leave them all behind
Yeah, A.B. and Mallrat
Y'all bitches really all rats (you're all I need)
