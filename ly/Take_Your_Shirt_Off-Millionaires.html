		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take your shirt off
T-t-take your shirt off.
T-take your (HEY)
Shirt off.
T-take your (HEY)
Shirt off.

Wha'cha doing over there boy, looking at me
I know you wanna take me out to a party
We can get a little freaky boy, a little naughty
But I ain't gonna go unless you take your shirt off!

Damn your looking pretty boy, you got it going on
I know you wanna dance with me, to our favourite song
We should really get out of here, don't take too long
But I ain't gonna go unless you take your shirt off!

Now I see you sweat-sweating
(Yeah I know your getting hot)
Got my eyes on you boy
(Let me see what you've got! )

Take your shirt off
And spin it around
You've got your sunner shades on
And your dancing around
So put your hands up
Yeah, and do the get-down
So take your shirt off
T-t-take your shirt off

(T-t-t-take your HEY)

The lies, the music, the smoke in the sun
As I'm melting through the scene yeah I spot him in my bar
I'll be licking my lips as he looks me up and down
He'll be looking hot hot, when his shirt hits the ground
I got a secret to tell you, I bet you'll never guess
It's to do with me and you, and the secret is my dress
I'm the perfect combination to relieve a little stress
So it's about time that we started to...

Now I see you sweat-sweating
(Yeah I know your getting hot)
Got my eyes on you boy
(Let me see what you've got! )

Take your shirt off
And spin it around
You've got your sunner shades on
And your dancing around
So put your hands up
Yeah, and do the get-down
So take your shirt off
T-t-take your shirt off

Take your shirt off
And spin it around
You've got your sunner shades on
And your dancing around
So put your hands up
Yeah, and do the get-down
So take your shirt off
T-t-take your shirt off

T-take your... shirt off.
T-take your shirt off (off off off).

Take off your top, make my bubble pop
Never gonna stop, I'm putting you on lock
Take off your top, make my bubble pop
Never gonna stop, now make that beat drop

(Suckaaaaaa OW! )

Take your shirt off
And spin it around
You've got your sunner shades on
And your dancing around
So put your hands up
Yeah, and do the get-down
So take your shirt off
T-t-take your shirt off

Take your shirt off
And spin it around
You've got your sunner shades on
And your dancing around
So put your hands up
Yeah, and do the get-down
So take your shirt off
T-t-take your shirt off

Take your shirt off
T-take your shirt off
Take your shirt off
T-take your shirt off

Take your shirt off
Take your shirt off
(Yeah, I know your getting hot)
Take your shirt off
Take your shirt off
(Let me see what you got! )
