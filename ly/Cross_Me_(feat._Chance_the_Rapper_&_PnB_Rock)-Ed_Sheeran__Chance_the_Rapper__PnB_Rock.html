		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you (Fred again)

Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if-

And she ain't messing with no other man
Me and her have something different 
I really need all you to understand
That nobody's coming close
And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumping in and out
But you know I fucking love her now
Like nobody ever could

And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh no
I'm sticking with my baby for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know 
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standing so close
So you know that, ayy

Anything she need, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you

If you cross her 
Then you cross me 
And nobody's coming close, yeah 
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
So come on and let it go 
Oh, I think that you should know (ah!)

And she ain't messing with no other man
Now what you not gon' do 
Is stand there 'cross from me like you got Kung Fu
Death stare, crossed arms, running your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doing CrossFit
Pew! Kung Pow! Get your ass with a cross kick 
Blowing air out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fucking lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me

Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you

If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
Nobody's coming close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
So come on and let it go 
Oh, I think that you should know (ah, ah!)

She stay trippin', and she crazy, oh no
Quit messin' with my baby for sure
Together or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So if you hear about my lady, just know 
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standing so close
So you know that

If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
Nobody's coming close, yeah
And I think that you should know that (huh, huh, huh!)
If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
So come on and let it go (ah!)
Oh, I think that you should know

If you cross her (anything she need, she can call me)
Then you cross me (don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you, oh yeah
