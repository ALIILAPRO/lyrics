		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When lights go down, I see no reason
For you to cry, we've been through this before
In every time, in every season
God knows I've tried
So please don't ask for more

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye
Carrie
Carrie
Things they change my friend, whoa oh
Carrie
Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Somewhere, again

I read your mind with no intentions
Of being unkind, I wish I could explain
It all takes time
Whole lot of patience
If it's a crime, how come I feel no pain?

Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye
(Oh ho ho)
Carrie
Carrie
Oh, things they change my friend
Whoa oh
Carrie
Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again

Oh
Can't you see it in my eyes?
That this might be our last goodbye
(Oh ho ho)
Oh
Carrie
Carrie
Oh, things they change
Carrie, Carrie, Carrie (Oh ho ho)
Carrie
Carrie
Maybe we'll meet again
Oh, somewhere again

When lights go down
