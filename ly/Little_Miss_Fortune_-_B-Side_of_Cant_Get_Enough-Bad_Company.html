		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little Miss Fortune, hit me and I'm down
Little Miss Understanding, ran me out of town
Little Miss Take, she don't understand
I'm in a bad situation, standing at the station
Turning around, round, round, yeah
And facing home, yeah

Little Miss Dealing, set you back a while
Little Miss Freedom, is bound to bring a smile
Little Miss-ery, got to come and go
I'm in a bad situation, standing at the station
Turning around, round, round, yeah, and facing home
Yeah, facing home

I want to get back home, down this long road
The way I'm going, I hope to see you before too long
Time is passing; time is gone, oh, oh, oh
Gettin' on home, I said yeah, yeah, yeah

Little Miss Fortune, hit me and I'm down
Little Miss Understanding, ran me out of town
Little Miss Take, you don't even understand
I'm in a bad situation, standing at the station
Turning around, round, yeah
I'm facing home; I'm facing home
I'm driving home tonight, just to see my baby
I'm home, I love my baby, my baby loves me
Little Miss Fortune, now won't you leave me alone
