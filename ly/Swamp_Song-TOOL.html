		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in
You're wading knee deep and going in

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker
I hope it sucks you down
Down, down, down, down

My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in
And you may never come back again

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker
I hope it sucks you down

My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in
And you may never come back again

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker
I hope it sucks, I hope it suck, I hope it suck 
You fucker
I hope it sucks, I hope it suck, I hope it suck down

Wandering around got you in
No one even invited you
And you still stumble and suffocate, suffocate
Why don't you get out while you can?

Wandering around got you in
No one even invited you
And you still stumble and suffocate, suffocate
Why don't you get out while you can?

No one told you to care
My warning meant nothing
You're dancing in quicksand
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?
You're wading knee deep and going in
And you may never come back again

This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
'Cause you're a stupid, belligerent fucker
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in
'Cause you're a dumbass, belligerent fucker

I hope it sucks
I hope it sucks
I hope it sucks you fucker
I hope it sucks
I hope it sucks
I hope it sucks you
