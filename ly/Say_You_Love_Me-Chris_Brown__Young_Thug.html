Look at the steer of the coupe when I'm droppin' the top from the sky

I got a coupe, cost a million, I bungie that bitch when I ride (skrrt skrrt)
Total the coupe, whoa
That's my boo, whoa
Never been spooked, whoa
Meet you to swoop, whoa
I told the bitch I can never say sorry for fuckin' the crew, whoa
Heard you lil' niggas done run out of loop and you're not in the loop, whoa

Say you love me
Say it twice (yeah)
Say you my bitch
You can call my shots (yeah)
She roll my kush
That make her rider (yeah)
Say put that TEC (yeah)
Right by her eyes (yeah)
She keep it wet (yeah)
She passed my test (yeah)
I count my check (yeah)
I count it irrationally
Rock Louis ties (yeah)
'Cause I got court this week (yeah)
Look in my eyes (yeah)
I count my bread and leave
Yeah, yeah

Do it with no hands (yeah, yeah)
Put it all in my face (yeah, yeah)
