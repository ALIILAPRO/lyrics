		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I break the ice
So they don't see my size
And I have to be nice
Or I'll be the next punchline

I'm just the best friend in Hollywood movies
Who only exist to continue the story
The girl gets the guy while I'm standing off-screen
So I'll wait for my cue to be comedic relief

Can't be too loud
Can't be too busy
If I don't answer now, are they still gonna need me?
Can't be too proud
Can't think I'm pretty
Do they keep me around, so their flaws just seem silly?

I say I'm okay
'Cause they wouldn't care anyway
And I could try to explain
But my effort's in vain
They can't relate to how I've

Drawn out in Sharpie where I take the scissors
If that's what it took for me to look in the mirror
I've done every diet to make me look thinner
So why do I still feel so goddamn inferior?

Can't be too loud
And can't be too busy
If I don't answer now, are they still gonna need me?
Can't be too proud and
Can't think I'm pretty
Do they keep me around, so their flaws just seem silly?

Life of the fat, funny, friend
Life of the fat, funny, friend

It's funny when I think a guy likes me
And it's funny when I'm the one who says, "Let's go to eat"
It's funny when I'm asked to go out on Halloween
Dresses and thigh highs, while I hide my body

Can't be too loud
And can't be too busy
If I don't answer now, are they still gonna miss me?

Can't be too loud
And can't be too busy
If I don't answer now, are they still gonna need me?
Can't be too proud and
Can't think I'm pretty
Do they keep me around, so their flaws just seem silly?

Life of the fat, funny, friend
Life of the fat, funny, friend
Life of the fat, funny, friend
Life of the fat, funny, friend

I've drawn out in Sharpie where I take the scissors
