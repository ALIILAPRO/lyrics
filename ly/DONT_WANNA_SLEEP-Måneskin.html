		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance until I die
Medicate myself 'till my head is in the sky
Oh, oh, when I close my eyes I get too lonely
Don't want a sleep at all
Don't want a sleep at all

So-so-somebody
Come ta-ta-take on my body
This is the shittiest party
I've ever seen in my life
No, no, no, no I'm not leaving
Gonna get my feet on the ceiling
Gonna drink away all my feelings
And no, it's not gonna heal me but I'll

Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance until I die
Wearing Lucy's diamonds to get a little shine
Oh, oh, when I close my eyes I get too lonely
Don't want a sleep at all
Don't want a sleep at all

So-so-somebody
Come ta-ta-take on my body
Into another dimension
I-I'm so bored of my life
I'm a lion tamer of indecent behavior
Making love with danger
It's not gonna heal me but at least I
Like it

And I don't wanna change it
I know it's bad, don't get me wrong
There's something in these strangers
Momentary flavors
I don't wanna sleep at all
No, I don't wanna sleep at all
Don't wanna sleep at all
No, I don't wanna sleep at all

Dance, dance, dance, dance, dance, until I die
Medicate myself 'till my head is in the sky
Oh, oh, when I close my eyes I get too lonely
Don't want a sleep at all
