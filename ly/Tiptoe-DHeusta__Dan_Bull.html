		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Run and hide, don't forget to say your prayers
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
In despair, nearly terrifying affairs

Let it be known
I'm finally grown
To head on these things I would have never approached alone
Is it the sharp teeth
That make me rethink
My strategy rapidly in unhappy catastrophe
There ain't no monkey business
Am I sane or do I choke with sickness
These halls of insanity; Mental, or reality
Gone; the past is spent and done 
No changing mistakes undone 
With only one way out
I serve my lady, devout!

Heard a breath in the night
Turning left and then right
A surge of adrenaline
Get ready for fight or flight
A rush of blood to the head
Keep hush and rush to the end
Don't let it ruffle your feathers
Unless you're up for being dead

Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Sweat and blood, but don't worry 'bout the tears
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Time runs out now to brave your fears
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Run and hide, don't forget to say your prayers
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
In despair, nearly terrifying affairs 

Everything happening is so quick. Hear the cackling
Go from normal to portal, can't tell the ghost from a mortal
I keep my tunnel vision, from the watchers mad delusion
Stalking me, watching me every part of me guarantee
I've had a bad day, couldn't get away from the girl
What girl? Who wanted to play
Woulda coulda played here but I saw the grin disappear
Whispering pain so severe
I run from the devil, dear
Never been so scared in years
But the lady I hope will lead me to the winning slope

You better never stop running
You bet they'll never stop coming
Never ending terrorists, nasty
Never giving up like a sick Rick Astley
Pick a direction, quicken your steps
Whatever you pick, do it fastly
Vastly outnumbered by soul shards
It's so hard, but show heart

Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Sweat and blood, but don't worry 'bout the tears
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Time runs out now to brave your fears
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Run and hide, don't forget to say your prayers
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
In despair, nearly terrifying affairs

Gotta tiptoe among the dead so
Take a step and find the pieces to your escape though
Gotta tiptoe among the dead so
Take a step and find the pieces to your escape though

Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Run and hide, don't forget to say your prayers
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
In despair, nearly terrifying affairs
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Sweat and blood, but don't worry 'bout the tears
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Time runs out now to brave your fears
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
Run and hide, don't forget to say your prayers
Tiptoe in the middle of the tulips
In despair, nearly terrifying affairs
