		  (Young Seven make it splash)

I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and throw the pain away (this boy got a hit)

I'm a young nigga straight from the bottom
Won't be long 'til I get to the top
Feel like half of my bros on the rock
This for Smelly and E, I ain't never gonna stop
I was juugin' and grindin' to get where I got
At this point in my life I done seen me a lot
If you slackin', I'm workin', I'm takin' your spot
All these VVS diamonds, I'm takin' your watch
I done been through so much, I ain't never tell cops
I'ma just work 'til I get me to drop
Step out of line, we gon' wait for a time
Bet you think you're so low, 'til you finna get popped
Talkin' on Smelly, you finna get dropped
All my lil' shooters keep Glizzy, they flock
I send the green, and they spinnin' your block
I send the green, and they spinnin' your block

I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and throw the pain away
I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and throw the pain away

Yeah, I miss the way that this shit used to be
Fucking famous hoes in California, this shit new to me
They say that I changed since I got money, well that's news to me
'Cause through all the bullshit that they threw
I still stayed true to me and that's truthfully
Through all the lies and the scrutiny
Through all the times that they used to be
Talkin' down on my name, now they wanna come around, but they ain't new to me
I used to think you was everything
Now you not even cool to me
I used to think you was everything
Yeah, that's how I used to be
And you cannot say that I didn't try to make time
But I guess time away got you in your brain
Thinking about my mistakes
I don't got the time to waste

I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and throw the pain away
I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and throw the pain away
