		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we dance again
And go all the way
Can we move again
To the place we used to go
Can we take the time
If it's alright
We can just let everything rise

I know my words will comfort you
And ease your mind the way you wanted to
Let's play let's stay together
Until the day comes up again

We can lose ourselves
In the depth of the night
Not afraid to let it shine, oh

Oh, oh
Come, surrounding me
With your flowers
Come and take me
To your desire
Let me be the one who sets
The fire in you

I see the shadows shine
I hear whispers
When you smile
Your voice is calling me
From way behind
You speak to me words of fools
And lead me to your arms
And I knew
You'll take me
Take me, take me, take me to another start

Oh, oh
Come, surrounding me
With your flowers
Come and take me
To your desire
Let me be the one who
Sets the fire in you
Come, surrounding me
With your flowers
Come and take me
To your desire
Let me be the one who
Sets the fire in you, oh

Oh, you, you, you, you, you baby
