		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling numb
I've got the devil on my tongue
And he's spitting words that I'd swallow
But his thoughts are rather hollow
Driving at sixty
Through the cold and the dark parts of this city No red lights show
Only green
For go

Right hand on the wheel 
But my left hands loose 
Got no mind but my body 
And it's owned by you 
Right hand on the wheel 
But my left hands loose 
Got no mind but my body 
And it's owned by you

The drive by shooter
Missed his target on the spot
The second hand shop looter
Says the goods aren't good enough 
Say goodbye to your morals
As you sell your soul for sex
And the wine in the bottle
Being humans like a hunger
And I don't want this no longer

Right hand on the wheel 
But my left hands loose 
Got no mind but my body 
And it's owned by you 
Right hand on the wheel 
But my left hands loose 
Got no mind but my body 
And it's owned by you
