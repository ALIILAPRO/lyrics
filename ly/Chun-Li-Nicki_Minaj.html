		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yo
Look like I'm goin' for a swim
Dunked on 'em, now I'm swingin' off the rim
Bitch ain't comin' off the bench
While I'm comin' off the court fully drenched
Here go some haterade, get your thirst quenched 
Style'd on 'em in this Burberry trench 
These birds copy every word, every inch
But gang-gang got the hammer and the wrench (brrt)
I pull up in that quarter milli' off the lot
Oh, now she tryna be friends like I forgot
Show off my diamonds like I'm signed by the Roc
Ain't pushin' out his babies 'til he buy the rock

Ayy, yo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki, like the Prince song
I-I-I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayy, yo, I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say Chun-Li, drop the Benz off, uh

Oh, I get it
They paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well, it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

I went and copped the chopsticks
Put it in my bun just to pop shit
I'm always in the top shit
Box seats, bitch, fuck the gossip 
How many of them could've did it with finesse? 
Now everybody like, "She really is the best"
You play checkers, couldn't beat me playin' chess
Now I'm about to turn around and beat my chest
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, it's King Kong
Bitch, it's King Kong, this is Kin' Kong
Chinese ink on, Siamese links on 
Call me 2 Chainz, name go ding-dong
Bitch, it's King Kong, yes, I'm King Kong
This is King Kong? Yes, Miss King Kong
In my kingdom with my Timbs on
(How many championships?) What? Six rings on

They need rappers like me
They need rappers like me
So they can get on their fuckin' keyboards and make me, the bad guy
Chun-li

Ayy, yo, I been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
I mean I been Storm, X-Men been formed
He keep on dialin' Nicki, like the Prince song
I-i-i been on, bitch, you been corn
Bentley tints on, Fendi prints on
Ayy, yo, I been North, Laura been Croft
Plates say 'Chun-Li' drop the Benz off, uh

I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs
It's my lifestyle
I come alive, I, I'm always sky high
Designer thigh highs 
It's my lifestyle
I need a Mai Tai, so fuckin' sci-fi
Give me the password, to the fuckin' WiFi
