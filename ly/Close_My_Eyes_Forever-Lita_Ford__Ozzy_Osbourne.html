		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I get so scared inside and I don't really understand
Is it love that's on my mind or is it fantasy?
Heaven is in the palm of my hand and it's waiting here for you
What am I supposed to do with a childhood tragedy?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Sometimes it's hard to hold on, so hard to hold on to my dreams
It isn't always what it seems when you're face to face with me
You're like a dagger, and stick me in the heart
And taste the blood from my blade
And when we sleep, would you shelter me in your warm and darkend grave?

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?

Will you ever take me? No I just can't take the pain
Would you ever trust me? No I'll never feel the same

I know I've been so hard on you, I know I've told you lies
If I could have just one more wish, I'd wipe the cobwebs from my eyes

If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain unchanged?
If I close my eyes forever, will it all remain the same?
