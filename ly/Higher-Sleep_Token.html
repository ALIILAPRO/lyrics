		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you won't 
Begin again
Capitulate 
And let me in
'Cause I am a fire 
And you are dry as bone
You are taking your time
You are killing me slow

And I know
We instigate 
Go back and forth
Lacerate 
'Cause you can remember 
Only when you're alone
I am granting you more 
Than the debt that I owe

'Cause I look for scarlet 
And you look for ultraviolet
And we are exhausted by all this pretending
We just can't resist the violence
And you need a melody 
I only need the silence
But each time we battle
The blood and the fury takes us a little higher

With all that you believe
You still refuse to shelter me
'Cause I am a danger 
And you're a long way from home 
You are one among many 
But you're now on your own

And I hate 
The way you look 
At me when I am not understood
'Cause you can remember 
Only when you're alone
I am granting you more 
Than the debt that I owe

Won't begin again 
You won't begin again
You won't begin again 
You won't begin again

'Cause I look for scarlet 
And you look for ultraviolet
And we are exhausted by all this pretending
We just can't resist the violence
And you need a melody 
I only need the silence
But each time we battle
The blood and the fury takes us a little higher

The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe
The debt that I owe

The debt that I owe
