		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Times have changed 
And we've often rewound the clock 
Since the Puritans got the shock 
When they landed on Plymouth Rock 
If today 
Any shock they should try to stem 
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them

In olden days, a glimpse of stocking 
Was looked on as something shocking 
But now, God knows
Anything goes 
Good authors, too, who once knew better words 
Now only use four-letter words 
Writing prose 
Anything goes

If driving fast cars you like
If low bars you like
If old hymns you like
If bare limbs you like 
If Mae West you like 
Or me undressed you like
Why, nobody will oppose 
When every night the set that's smart is 
Intruding at nudist parties in studios
Anything goes

When the Missus Ned McLean (God bless her) 
Can get Russian reds to "yes" her
Then I suppose 
Anything goes
When Rockefeller still can hoard enough money to let Max Gordon 
Produce his shows
Anything goes

The world has gone mad today 
And good's bad today
And black's white today 
And day's night today 
And that gent today 
You gave a cent today 
Once had several chateaux
When folks who still can ride in jitneys 
Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys 
Lack baby clothes
Anything goes

When Sam Goldwyn can with great conviction 
Instruct Anna Sten in diction
Then Anna shows 
Anything goes
When you hear that Lady Mendl standing up 
Now does a handspring landing up on her toes
Anything goes

Just think of those shocks you've got 
And those knocks you've got 
And those blues you've got 
From those news you've got 
And those pains you've got 
If any brains you've got
From those little radios 
So Missus R., With all her trimmin's
Can broadcast a bed from Simmons 
'Cause Franklin knows 
Anything goes
