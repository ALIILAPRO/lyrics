		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coloratura
We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us is there welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out

Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself
And love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd

And up there in the heavens
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Helix
Oumamama, Heliopause, and Neptune
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll get there

So for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto, Calliope
Betelgeuse, the neon moons
We're a slow burning tune
But we'll touch down soon

So will you
And in this crazy world, I do
I just want you

And up there in the heavens
Galileo saw reflections of us too
Pluribus unum, unus mundus
And all the satellites imbue
The purple, yellow, green, red, orange and the blue
Oh, it's a crazy world, it's true
Sing it out

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

And in this crazy world, I do
I just want
In this crazy world, it's true
I just want you

Poets prophesy up in the blue
Together, that's how we'll make it through
