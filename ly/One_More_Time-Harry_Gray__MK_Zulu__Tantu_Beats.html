		<p>
		  One more time
One more time
Would you be mine
One more time
One more time
Would you be mine

One more time
The night awaits
One more time
Don't hesitate
One more time
Get up and dance
We got one more time
And we gon make it last baby
One more time
The night awaits yeah
One more time
I wanna feel ya flame babe
One more time
Get up let's dance away
We got one more time
Til the break of day

Turn me up
Bring the lights down low
Break it down
Baby nice and slow
Like Usher
Never letting go
Never messing up the flow
Love be our guide
Baby just one dance
Could a real nigga
Vibe with you
Big you up
And get one chance
Or you gon
Stunt fake an attitude
Girl just get up
Shawty take my hand
Or take my soul
Just take my doe
Promise now
Say you won't
That you won't let go
If you feel for me
Then I feel for you
If you here for me
Then I'm here for you
So are you in
Cause I play to win
Tell me now
If you h.e.r
I'm h.i.m
Girl I will do
Whatever that it takes
Yeah

One more time
For a romance babe
We got one more time
Let's make it last babe
One more time
Get up let's dance away
We got one more time
We gon do it right babe

One more time
Let's make it last babe
One more time
For a romance baby
One more time
Get up let's dance away
We got one more time
Til the break of day

One more time
Baby can I get a
One more time
I know ya ain't mine
Aint tryna be here tonight
But before ya slide
Can I get one more grind
Cause ya know this our song
Baby don't be shy
Though this feeling ain't wrong
Baby I can't Lie
When the rhythm get a sync
And then we lock eyes
I don't need to be prom king to get my prize
I got it right here huh
Ayy
Ya body looking good swaying in ya gown
When they see you walk by
they don't make a sound
Me you know how I do when I put it down
Hit the two step slide then I spin around
Ayy Ayy
Ya moves got me going crazy
If anybody else waiting for a dance
They aint getting a chance
I know they finna hate me
But I don't give a fuck
Keep dancing like that
We gon be more than friends
Walk around in the park
Just holding hands
Or at the beach with our
Toes in the sand
I kiss you goodbye
Before ya leave umma need it
One moe gain
Relax I got the zaza and the work
I just need one more time

One more time
One more time
Will you be mine
One more time
One more time
Would you be mine
Now
One more time!
One more time
Would you be mine
One more time
One more time
Babe
