		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody wants to wait for little miracles (little miracles)
Nobody wants to say, "I'm feeling insecure" (feeling insecure)
It's hard to be this big when I am feeling small (I am feeling small)
But I will keep on trying even when I fall

So put one foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other
We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another
One foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other
We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another

I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)

Nobody wants to wait for little miracles (little miracles)
Nobody wants to say, "I'm feeling so unsure" (feeling so unsure)
It's hard to be this big when I'm feeling immature
But I'm gon' keep on trying even when I fall

So put one foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other
We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another
One foot in front of the other, one foot in front of the other
We gotta love one another, we gotta love one another

I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)

Oh, you may not see a pot of gold but rainbows are the sky's way of
Tellin' us we are enough
And if you wanna beat your chest 'cause you feel the emptiness
Go on and feel your loneliness
Go on and feel your loneliness
And call me 'cause we're both in this

I don't wanna quit before the miracles
I don't wanna quit before the miracles
I don't wanna quit before the miracles
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
I don't wanna quit before the miracles
I don't wanna quit before the miracles
I don't wanna quit before the miracles
I don't wanna quit before the miracles (before the miracles)
