		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honey, come over
The party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It's yours if you want it
We're just glad you could visit

Feels like I've been
Ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't
Think to ask you where you'd gone
Why'd you go?

And you said
Mm, mm
And you said

You said my heart has changed
And my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
That my face has changed
And I haven't drank
In six months on the dot

See the graves as you pass through
From a crash back in '02
Not one nick on your finger
You just asked me to hold you
It made you a stranger
And filled you with anger
Now I'm third in the line up
To your Lord and your Savior

Feels like I've been
Ready for you to come home
For so long
That I didn't
Think to ask you where you'd gone
So why'd you go?

And you said
Mm
And you said
Mm

You said my heart has changed
And my soul has changed
And my heart, and my heart
That my life has changed
That this town had changed and you had not
That the world has changed
Don't you find it strange
That you just went ahead and carried on?
And you know I'd say the last time I drank
I was faced down passed out there on your lawn

Are we all just crows to you now?
Are we all just pullin' you down?
You didn't put those bones in the ground
You didn't put those bones in the ground

Honey, come over
The party's gone slower
And no one will tempt you
We know you got sober
There's orange juice in the kitchen
Bought for the children
It's yours if you want it
We're just glad you could visit
