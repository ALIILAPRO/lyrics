		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho

You drew a picture of my morning
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawning
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm licking down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

This ain't got shit to do with shampoo, but watch your head n shoulder
Brother older bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save your flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom, ain't trying to be handsome
Shrinking what you're thinking cause I'm vamping

I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop so

Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho

You heard a lot about a brother gaining mo' ground
Being low down I do the showdown with any little ho round, no!
I wanna know who you're believing, through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleeping you think I'm cheatin'
You said, "I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo PP man, won't only see me man"
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner cause she's hot as a baker
Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not cause I hate ya!
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like something really big is missing
Even though my name's graffiti Written on Ya Kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today

Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho

Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hip Hip Hop Hooray!
There's many hungry Hip Hoppers one reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what ya heard cause I ain't bailing no hay
Ain't chopping no crops, but still growing every day

Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns beat downs are found
Don't know me don't come around

Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Looking for her crew
Any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots, step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hitting woodies in a hoody
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest, Nice & Smooth & Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop
This is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop so

Hip Hop hooray, hey, ho, smooth it out now
