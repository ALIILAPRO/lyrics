		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna love you like me, like me?
Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna touch you like me, like me?

Ooh, said you wanna be good but you couldn't keep your composure
Ooh, said you wanna be good but you're begging me to come over
Ooh, come over
Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me? Yeah

I don't wanna hurt you but you live for the pain
I'm not tryna say it but it's what you became
You want me to fix you but it's never enough
That's why you always call me cause you're scared to be loved
But I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame (shame)
I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame (shame)

Say it louder, say it louder, yeah
Who's gonna love you like me, like me? Yeah
Say it louder, say it louder
Who's gonna touch you like me, like me?

Ooh, said it'd be the last time, all you needed was a little closure
Ooh, said it'd be the last time but you're begging me to come over
Ooh, come over
Ooh, saying who's gonna fuck you like me? Hey

I don't wanna hurt you but you live for the pain
I'm not tryna say it but it's what you became
You want me to fix you but it's never enough
That's why you always call me cause you're scared to be loved
But I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame (shame)
I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame (shame)

Who's gonna fuck you like (who's gonna fuck you like), hey

Ooh
I don't wanna hurt you but you live for the pain
I'm not tryna say it but it's what you became (it's what you became, oh)
You want me to fix you but it's never enough (never enough)
That's why you always call me 'cause you're scared to be loved (scared to be loved)
But I'll always be there for you, I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame (always be there for you, shame)
I'll always be there for you (always be there for you), I'll always be there for you
I'll always be there for you, girl I have no shame
Girl I have no (shame), no shame
