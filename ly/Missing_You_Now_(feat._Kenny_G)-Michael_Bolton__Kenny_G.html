		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I talk to you but it's not the same as touchin' you
And every time you whisper my name, I want to run to you
Well be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong

[Chorus:]
Baby 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait 'till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now

Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night, they should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer
It's so hard on my soul

[Chorus]

Baby I just can't wait
Till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside

When you're close to my heart
Right here in my arms
Then and only then
Will I be satisfied
I'm missing you now
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever, and it's hard to be strong

[Chorus]
