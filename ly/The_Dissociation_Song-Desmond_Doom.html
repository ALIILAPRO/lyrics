		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dissociation imminent,
Feel like a fish caught in a net.
I blame myself, but it's not just me.
The world's a dog, and we're all fleas

Can't buy a house.
Tax on the air.
cll feels so wrong.

So tired, hard to see the light.
Not sure, if I want to fight.
So numb, pins and needles, man.
I'm not really here.
So dead, zombie through the day.
Too fast, here in the Milky Way.
So numb, pins and needles, man.
I'm not really here.

Grateful for those with blood so warm.
Love is the shelter from the storm.
cs for all you vampires in the wings.
I hope you meet the stake and I hope it stings.

They want control,
Want us on our knees.
I just wanna breathe.

So tired, hard to see the light.
Not sure, if I want to fight.
So numb, pins and needles, man.
I'm not really here.
So dead, zombie through the day.
Too fast here in the Milky way.
So numb, pins and needles, man.
I'm not really here.
