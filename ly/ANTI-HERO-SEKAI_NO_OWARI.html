		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I don't give a damn about what's "right"
Or pleasing everyone around me
'Cause I know this world that brought us life
Wasn't made to keep everyone happy
The rules and laws that countries come up with
In front of me, they're all shit
'Cause there are people that I've gotta protect
And if you get in my way, you're dead

You see I'm tired of trying to justify
Every decision that I make
If it's to save the people that I stand by
You better believe what I say
"Stay in the lines
Don't make a scene"
Heroes try to tell us what's right
But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean
I'm ready to start a fight

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah

Righteousness is a thing that I hate
'Cause it doesn't do any good for anyone
And everyone thinks everything is OK
If they just obey
I don't wanna think about what they see
When they look up and see evil me
You see, love isn't what I need
As long as I can set you free

Oh bum bum bum, watch out here I come
I said bum bum bum, you all better run
Oh bum bum bum, watch out here I come
So run!
"Stay in the lines,
Don't make a scene"
Heroes try to tell us what's right
But when push comes to shove, you'll know what I mean
I'm ready to start a fight

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah

I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
So I can save you when the time comes
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Feared and hated by everybody
I'm gonna be the anti-hero
Yeah
