		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way the light hits the road
The way I am unable to protect you
Oh I'm running away
I will never forgive myself
For running away from you

He came back to your house
I didn't take it as a promise
Always thought it was a lie
He went too far the fucker
It's not like I owe him money
This is different

So gather your strength and break free
Or you will surely die
Gather your strength don't follow me
Cause I will surely die

The way my eyes cannot move
The way I hope to be protected
And for one moment I thought
That I was lost among the lights of houses

He came back to your house
I didn't take it as a promise
Always thought it was a lie
He went too far the fucker
It's not like I owe him money
This is different

So gather your strength and break free
Or you will surely die
Gather your strength don't follow me
Cause I will surely die

My dreams of violence
See them coming true

He came back to your house
I didn't take it as a promise
Always thought it was a lie
He went too far the fucker
It's not like I owe him money
This is different

So gather your strength and break free
Or you will surely die
Gather your strength don't follow me
Cause I will surely die
