		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been, I been thinking that
I can't quite get enough
time on the inside of
The cycle that you spin with
gravity and dust
I’ve fallen in between
the planets and the sun

Into the orbit that surrounds you
that orbit that’s around you
that orbit that surrounds you
that orbit that’s around you

Now the
space is filling up;
satellites that
I can't seem to keep track of.
I get the feeling
I’m not quite made of the right stuff
To float between
the rings of cosmic metal love

Into the orbit that surrounds you
that orbit that’s around you
that orbit that surrounds you
that orbit that’s around you

That orbit that surrounds you
that orbit that’s around you
that orbit that surrounds you
that orbit that’s around you
