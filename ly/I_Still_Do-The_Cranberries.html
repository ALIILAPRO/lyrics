		<p>
		  I'm not ready for this 
Though I thought I would be. 
I can't see the future 
Though I thought I could see. 
I don't want to leave you 
Even though I have to. 
I don't want to love you. 
Oh, I still do. 
Need some time to find myself. 
I want to live within. 
Can I go my own way? 
Can I pray my own way? 
I don't want to leave you. 
Oh, I need you. 
Am I ready for this? 
Did I think I would be? 
Can I see the future? 
No, I can't see. 
I don't want to leave you 
Even though I have to. 
I don't want to love you. 
Oh, I still do.
