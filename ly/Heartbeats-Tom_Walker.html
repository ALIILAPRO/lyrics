		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello my friend, it's been a while
It's been a minute since I passed you by
Same cities but we're miles apart
Four kids, a house and two cars
Remember when we used to rule the world?
Park behind the golden arches, we
Had it all when we had nothing
I wish I'd seen it coming

You should've told me you were in deep
You should've told me when it all went wrong
I hear you echo through the concrete
Down the streets where we once belonged

If you need me, just call my name
I know we went our separate ways
But I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll share your pain, no, I won't judge
We'll pick it up where we left off
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh-oh-oh

Hello my friend, I should've called
It's been years, hardly spoke at all
From the same place, just three doors down
Five mates raised in the same town
Remember when we used to rule the world?
Downin' ciders by the station
Telly boys, thought we were famous
It's those days that made us

You should've told me you were in deep
You should've told me when it all went wrong
I hear you echo through the concrete
Down the streets where we once belonged

If you need me, just call my name
I know we went our separate ways
But I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll share your pain, no, I won't judge
We'll pick it up where we left off
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh-oh-oh

When you're low and you need some love
I'll be here to lift you up
When it feels like it's too much
We'll pick it up where we left off
If you're scared and all alone
There's a place that we call home
Racing down the older road
We'll pick it up where we left off

If you need me, just call my name
I know we went our separate ways
But I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll share your pain, no, I won't judge
We'll pick it up where we left off
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh-oh-oh

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh oh-oh
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I'll be there in a heartbeat
I'll be there in a heartbeat, oh, oh
