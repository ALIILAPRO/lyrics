		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spots of red, a prophet said, the time of death is near
Lining shed, she lays in bed, boyfriend runs in fear
Don't try to fight, a woman's rite, blood begins to pour
The darkest night, there is no light, we're begging please no more
Heavy flow, down below, metallic river of blood
Anger rising in the skies above, only hate, no love
Uterus contracting, giver of life, now produces pain
Someone barricade the gates of hell, before we go insane
I-U-D, the Devil's T, stabs her from inside
Every she, must pay the fee, you can run but you can't hide
Hormones drop, with Satan's knock, no egg survives the purge
Toxic shock, it's time to rock, when we feel that crimson urge
Heavy flow, down below, metallic river of blood
Anger rising in the skies above, only hate, no love
Uterus contracting, giver of life, now produces pain
Someone barricade the gates of hell, before we go, before we go insane
Heavy flow, down below, metallic river of blood
Anger rising in the skies above, only hate, no love
Heavy flow, down below, metallic river of blood
Anger rising in the skies above, only hate, no love
Uterus contracting, giver of life, now produces pain
Someone barricade the gates of hell, before we go, before we go insane
Heavy flow
Heavy flow
Heavy flow
Heavy flow
