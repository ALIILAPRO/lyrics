		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you to hold me close
Whenever the night gets cold
I want you to lie to me
And tell me that you'll always stay
Right here with me
Even though that's not true
I know that i'm not the one
But just for the night
I want you to

Hold me close
Whenever the night gets cold
I want you to lie to me
And tell me that you'll always stay right
Here with me
Even though that's not true
I know that i'm not the one
But just for the night
I want you to

Tell me that i'm special
That i'm the only one
That you have your mind on
Every time that you close your eyes
Promise me forever
Even if you would be gone
I know that I don't need you
But I just want you to be around

I know I'll be fine
It might hurt a while
You know I keep doing everything, you want me to stay
I know I'll be fine
It might hurt a while
Please just give me the night

I want you to
Hold me close
Whenever the night gets cold
I want you to lie to me
And tell me that you'll always stay right
Here with me
Even though that's not true
I know that i'm not the one
But just for the night

I want you to hold me
I want you to hold me
Like i'm the only, only one
Like i'm the only, only one
I want you to hold me
I want you to hold me
Like i'm the only, only one
Like i'm the only, only one

I want you to
