		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Train station, I know you all too well
Tainted in salutation
And i'm going back where I belong
With the salt and the sea and the stones
Save them all for me

Train station, I know you all too well
From the boarding we all came and fell
Into your room
The tracks raced beneath our feat
Through square windows, so clean
Well I could see them walking away

I belong with the salt and the sea and the stones
Save them all for me

As you lay sleeping on the cloth seat beside me
I stood awake there dreaming
Some other form to be

And the words you could say
That would always keep me near
Is stay stay

I belong with the salt and the sea and the stones
Save them all for me
