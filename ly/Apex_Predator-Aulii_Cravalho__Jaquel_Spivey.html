		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be fooled by the pink
She is not playing dolls
She is stalking the halls
For the thrill of the kill
Every person in school
Is aware of her stare
When she tosses her hair
They go perfectly still

All their eyes say, "Don't attack me"
Watch them sweat and pant and shake
Every food chain has its acme
Regina George eats steak

She's the queen of beasts
She can smell your fear
In this biosphere
She's the apex predator

Like a lioness
Only with less fur
Do not mess with her
She's the apex predator

At the watering hole
See the girls who weren't nice
Have to scatter like mice
From a jungle cat
And though Janis is great
She does not have this power
People literally cower
Janis can't do that

See her mark her territory
As they follow in her train
They were victims in their stories
Now they shake their mane

She's the queen of beasts
And you're in her pride
You have hitched a ride
With the apex predator

And it's kinda fun
When she bares her claws
You think you're safe because
You're with the apex predator

Do not think you'll be protected by your new exotic pet
Not a chance if she suspected (she suspected)
You were any kind of reproductive threat
But she doesn't know yet
She doesn't know yet

She's the queen of beasts
At this beastly school
Gotta keep things cool
With the apex predator

Will she braid your hair
Will she eat your heart
How can you outsmart
The apex predator
The apex predator
The apex predator
