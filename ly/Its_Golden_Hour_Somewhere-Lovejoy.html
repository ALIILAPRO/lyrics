		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this what you needed? Is this what it's worth
To see the hidden folders, tool tipping out the dirt?
I wish that I could kiss the pixels off your lips
Describe our naked bodies over Zoom call partnerships

Is this why you see him at Tesla dealerships?
His watch doesn't have his name on, how will he know it's his?
The sun reflects the light off hilltop window panes
His grass is the wrong shade of green, but he can pay to make a change

They'll tell you this is normal, they'll tell you this is love
I'm not sure if the stuff I want is even worth the price it costs
Three cars in every garage and six seats between 'em
They'll sell you the rope by which you'll hang yourself

Is this why you need me, to break what you can't chew?
To ram the Holy Scriptures down throats in tennis shoes?
Our father who art thou central Monterey
Take it from me, baby, it's worse when you can't pay
It's worse when you can't pay
It's worse when you can't pay

They'll tell you this is normal, they'll tell you this is love
I'm not sure if the stuff I want is even worth the price it costs
Three cars in every garage and six seats between 'em
They'll sell you the rope by which you'll hang yourself
So tell me, is it normal to totally lose your mind?
I won't announce my sheer descent, but holy fuck, there will be signs
We're all on a CFIT, so take what you see fit
They'll sell you the rope by which you'll hang yourself

It's golden hour somewhere
It's golden hour somewhere
It's golden hour somewhere
It's golden hour somewhere
They'll sell you the rope by which you'll hang yourself
