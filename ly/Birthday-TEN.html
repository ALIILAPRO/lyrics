		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, dance, dance, dance
Wrap me up with your devotion
It's a bad romance, got my body rocking in slow motion

But I can't cope walking on a tight rope
Hanging on the tension
Let me down, down, down with you
Let me give you my attention
(Whoa-whoa-whoa)

Got no self-control
'Cause I want it all
So I'ma make you feel

Like tonight's your birthday

Every second, every minute
Make me wanna celebrate it
(Whoa-whoa-whoa)
Everything about you perfect
Just the way your mamma made it

You're the best, you're my first, first place
Sugar sweet in a million ways
Baby, we don't need no reason
Baby, we don't need to wait

Let's make tonight your birthday

I put my hands, hands, hands
When I know you wanna hold them
I wanna be in so deep baby
Floating like we're deep inside an ocean

No, I don't care as long as I got you there
Baby, let's keep falling
I'm talking with my hands
Oh, baby, here is my confession

Let's make tonight your birthday

Every second, every minute
Make me wanna celebrate it
(Whoa-whoa-whoa)
Everything about you perfect
Just the way your mamma made it

You're the best, you're my first, first place
Sugar sweet in a million ways
Baby, we don't need no reason
Baby, we don't need to wait

Let's make tonight your birthday

I've been blinded by you
Baby, you got full attention yeah
So let us take it slow
I never say this, but girl, you deserve it best
So let it go, do all you want for tonight? 
Hmm-ah-oh-yeah

(Like tonight's your birthday)

Ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh
Like tonight's your birthday

Every second, every minute 
Make me wanna celebrate it (celebrate me baby)
Everything about you perfect
Just the way your mamma made it (ooh! Ooh-hoo)

You're the best, you're my first first place
Sugar sweet in a million ways (baby)
Baby, we don't need no reason
Baby, we don't need to wait

Let's make tonight your birthday

Baby, we don't need no reason
Baby, we don't need to wait

Let's make tonight your birthday
