		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
That everything will be alright, I
I promise these things to you
Girl just believe
I promise

Should of known the things you said been right
Forever is such a very long time
We never even had a fight
Don't let no one change your mind
Cause they don't know how much I care
They don't know the things we share unless they're here babe
But since they're not
How can they say I'm not true, oh, oh, oh

If you need a love, I got the love that you need
Ain't no way they can take that from me
And I pray to God that one day they will see

Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
That everything will be alright, I
I promise these things to you
Girl just believe
I promise

When I think of all the times I said
That I will see you another day
Baby nothing's gonna change, yes it is
Said you mean the world to me
And babygirl I keep you first, yeah
Cause that's the kind of love you deserve
And to know I got a love if you need a love, yeah

If you need a love, I got the love that you need
Ain't no way they can take that from me
And I pray to God that one day they will see

Nothing is promised to me and you
So why will we let this thing go
Baby I promise that I'll stay true
Don't let nobody say it ain't so
And baby I promise
That I will never leave
That everything will be alright, I
I promise these things to you
Girl just believe
I promise

You're the only I want in my life
And I promise everything is alright babe
You're the only I want in my life
I promise, promise, promise you baby

You're the only I want in my life
And I promise everything is alright babe
You're the only I want in my life
I promise, promise, promise you baby

You're the only I want in my life
And I promise everything is alright babe
You're the only I want in my life
I promise, promise, promise you baby
