		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I ain't sure but I've been told
He's baking cakes inside our souls
Stayed awake, took a nap
Got myself my bottles back
I'm breaking down out on the street
Walkin' round my own bare feet
I do not need you to tell me
That I'm not a cat

I caught a rat, we caught some air
He's never gonna cut his hair
He takes more time to make a fake
We now swam down in the lake

And wash the dirt off our intentions
Paddle on with our bad inventions
I came as ice, I came as a whore
I came as advice that came too sure
I came as gold, I came as crap

I came too clean, and I came as a rat
It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you
I don't know but I've been told
You'll never die and you never grow old

I came as a call, I came as flat
I came too soon so I came back
I came as flowers, I came as nice
I came as dirt, and I came as a surprise

It takes a long time, but God dies too
But not before he'll stick it to you
I don't know but I've been told
You'll never die and you never grow old
