		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man

How do you do? My name's Gavroche
These are my people, here's my patch
Not much to look at, nothing posh
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch
This is my school, my high society
From Saint-Denis to Saint Michel
We live on crumbs of humble piety
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell
Think you're poor if you're free
Follow me, follow me!

Look down, and show some mercy if you can
Look down, look down upon your fellow man

As for all the leaders of the land
Head for the swell, to wipe the shore

Only one man and that's LaMarque
Speaks for the people here below

LaMarque is ill and fading fast
Won't last the week out so they say

With all the anger in the land
How long before the judgement day
Before we cut the fat ones down to size
Before the barricades arise

Look down, and show some mercy if you can
Look down, look down upon your fellow man
