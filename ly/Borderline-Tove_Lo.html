		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good people do bad things too
Pretend they don't know, but they do
It takes one to know you're mine
You and me, we are one of a kind, it's true

I like to my feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearin' me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (hey)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up on this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (borderline)
Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up on this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (borderline)

Lost in the magic with you
A pretty disguise from the truth
Truth is ugly, don't open your eyes
I can change, I can change with just one more lie

I like to my feel my bones when they crash into my heart
I like the taste of blood when you're tearin' me apart
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline (hey)

Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up on this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (borderline)
Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you
Hold on 'til I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you
I can't give it up on this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (borderline)

(Borderline)
I like to push you to the edge as long as you say you're mine
Borderline

(Borderline)
Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you (stuck on you)
Hold on 'til I'm makin' it right
No other love felt like you (felt like you)
I can't give it up on this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (hope to die, borderline)
(Borderline)
Tonight, for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be stuck on you (stuck on you)
Hold on 'til I'm makin' it right (make it, make it right)
No other love felt like you (felt like you)
I can't give it up on this fight
I cross my heart and hope to die (hope to die)

(Borderline)
I know I said that I could change (stuck on you)
I don't know what to do, but (felt like you)
Oh man, is this beautiful
I cross my heart and hope to die (hope to die)
