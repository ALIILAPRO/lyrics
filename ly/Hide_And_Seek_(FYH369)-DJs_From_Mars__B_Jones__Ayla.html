		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are we
What the hell is going on
The dust has only just begun to form
Crop circles in the carpet
Sinking, feeling

Spin me around again
And rub my eyes
This can't be happening
When busy streets
A mess with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy

Mm, what'd you say
Mm, that you only meant well
Well of course you did
Mm, what'd you say
Mm, that it's all for the best
Of course it is
Mm, what'd you say
Mm, that it's just what we need
You decided this
Mm, what'd you say
Mm, what did she say
