		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a PC, you got a Mac
I'm giving you flak for your AirPort
I read books and you watch TV
You wanna be free to relax more

But when I think about the other people I could see
Nobody else out there could ever make me happy
I wonder how we came to be

The odd couple is what we are in reality
But we are so happy in everything we do
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me
But we know the feeling that we share is true

Sometimes I want to strangle your neck
Or write you a check to get going
There's only so much more I can take
I made a mistake without knowing

But when I think about the way your little heart beats
When I am holding you and you are holding onto me
I wonder how we came to be

The odd couple is what we are in reality
But we are so happy in everything we do
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me
But we know the feeling that we share is true

I hope you know that I don't mean you disrespect
I'm just pointing out, although the facts I double-checked
Everyone can see that we ain't two peas in a pod
But maybe that's our chemistry that takes us to the top

I think it's working baby, that's the point I'm trying to make
If I said something else to you then I would be a fake
I wonder how we came to be
I wonder how we came to be
I wonder how we came to be

The odd couple is what we are in reality
But we are so happy in everything we do
The odd couple is what they're saying of you and me
But we know the feeling that we share is true
The odd couple
The odd couple
The odd couple
The odd couple

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
