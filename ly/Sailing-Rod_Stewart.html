		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am sailing, I am sailing
Home again, 'cross the sea
I am sailing stormy waters
To be near you, to be free

I am flying, I am flying
Like a bird 'cross the sky
I am flying, passing high clouds
To be with you, to be free

Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night, far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

Can you hear me? Can you hear me?
Through the dark night far away
I am dying, forever crying
To be with you, who can say

We are sailing, we are sailing
Home again, 'cross the sea
We are sailing stormy waters
To be near you to be free

Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free
Oh Lord, to be near you, to be free, oh Lord
