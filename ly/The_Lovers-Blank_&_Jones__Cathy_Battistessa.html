		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nights turn into days and days into nights
And time seamlessly remains
I'm the calling creators
The distance between us now is greater
I'm calling the believers
Come gather in flocks and tribes and lead us

'Cause we are lovers
We're protectors, defenders and healers
'Cause we are lovers (why are we wasting time?)
We are lovers
We're protectors defenders and healers
We are lovers, we're believers and endless receivers (why are we wasting time?)
Tell me everything about you, every single detail, I just wanna know
Tell me everything about you, every single detail, I just wanna know
Tell me every single detail, everything about you, I just need to know

'Cause we are lovers
We're protectors, defenders and healers
'Cause we are lovers, we're believers and endless receivers
We are lovers, we are lovers (why are we wasting time?)
Tell me everything about you, every single detail, I just wanna know
Tell me everything about you, every single detail, I just wanna know

We are lovers
We're protectors, defenders and healers
We are lovers, we're believers and endless receivers

Every day, every day, I will be there for you
Every day, every day, I will be there for you
I will be there for you
Every day, every day, I will be there for you
I will be there for you
I will be there for you

We're believers and endless receivers (why are we wasting time?)
