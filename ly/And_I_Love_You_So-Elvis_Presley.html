		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I love you so 
That people ask me how 
How I've lived 'til now 
I tell them I don't know 
I guess they understand 
How lonely life has been 
But life began again 
The day you took my hand 

And yes I know how lonely life can be 
The shadows follow me 
And the night won't set me free 
But I don't let the evening get me down 
Now that you're around me 

And you love me, too 
Your thoughts are just for me 
You set my spirits free 
I'm happy that you do 

The book of life is brief 
Once the page is read 
All but love is dead 
This is my belief 

And yes I know how lonely life can be 
Shadows follow me 
And the night won't set me free 
But I don't let the evening get me down 
Now that you're around me
