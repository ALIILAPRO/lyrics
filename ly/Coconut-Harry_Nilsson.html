		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime,
His sister had another one she paid it for the lime.

She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em bot' up
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em bot' up.
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em bot' up
She put the lime in the coconut, she call the doctor, woke 'I'm up,

Said "doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?"
I said "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache,"
I said "Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?"
I said "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache."
Now lemme get this straight,

You put the lime in the coconut, you drank 'em bot' up,
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank 'em bot' up,
You put the lime in the coconut, you drank 'em bot'up,
You put the lime in the coconut, you call your doctor, woke 'I'm up,

Said " Doctor, ain't there nothing' I can take?"
I said, "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache."
I said "Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?'
I said, "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache,"

You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em bot' togedther
Put the lime in the coconut and you'll feel better,
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em bot' up,
Put the lime in the coconut and call me in the morning."

Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo.

Brother bought a coconut, he bought it for a dime,
His sister had another one she paid it for a lime.
She put the lime in the coconut, she drank 'em bot' up
She put the lime in the coconut and called the doctor, woke 'I'm up.

And said, "Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?'
I said, "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache."
I said "Doctor, ain't there nothin' I can take?"
I said, "Doctor, now lemme get this straight,

You put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em bot'up,
Put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em bot' up,
Put the lime in the coconut, you drink 'em bot' up,
Put the lime in the coconut.  You're such a silly woman.

Put a lime in the coconut and drink 'em bot' together
Put the lime in the coconut, then you'll feel better.
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em both down,
Put the lime in your coconut, and call me in the morning,

Woo--ain't there nothin' you can take?
I say, woo--to relieve your belly ache,
You say, well woo--ain't there nothin' I can take?
I say woo--woo, to relieve your belly ache,
You say yow--ain't there nothin' I can take,

I say wow--to relieve this belly ache,
I said "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take,"
I said, "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take,"
I said, "Doctor, ain't there nothing I can take,"
I said, "Doctor you're such a silly woman.

Put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em both together,
Put the lime in the coconut, and you'll feel better,
Put the lime in the coconut and drink 'em bot' up,
Put the lime in the coconut and call me in the morning.

Yes, you call me in the morning, You call me in the morning,
I'll tell you what to do if you call me in the morning.
I'll tell you what to do if you call me in the morning.
I'll tell you what to do if you call me in the morning.
I'll tell you what to do and if you call me in the morning
I'll tell you what to do.
