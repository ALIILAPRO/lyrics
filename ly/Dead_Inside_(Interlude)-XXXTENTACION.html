		  Dead inside
Spend a lot of time stuck in this head of mine
Under the assumption love is dead, already
Just let me be here
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands, at night?
Seen the vivid pictures in my head, at night
It left me in tears
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands?
Seen the vivid pictures in my head
I'm under the assumption love is dead
Where was I?
When he was feeling on you with his hands?
I'm under the assumption love is dead
Seen the vivid pictures in my head
