		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you, oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, ooh woh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear 

I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad (I'm going slightly mad)
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened, uh huh
It finally happened, I'm slightly mad
Oh dear

Uh uh ah ah
Uh uh ah ah

I'm knitting with only one needle
Unraveling fast it's true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear, how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened, oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad
Just very slightly mad
And there you have it
