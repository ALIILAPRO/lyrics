		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spent a lot of time in the background
I know I spent a lot of time in the background
Everytime that we together, I black out
Everytime that we together, she tap out
I remember, but she part of my past now
I remember all this shit from the past now
Took a pill and we passed out
I made a deal with the devil

You know I got my problems (problems)
Know you got yours too (know you got yours too)
Hold on to my revolver (revolver)
They ain't looking for you (they ain't looking for you)
Oh, girl, don't even bother (bother)
Why she act brand new? (Why she act brand new?)
Take what the devil offer (offer)
I got nothing to lose (I got nothing to lose)
