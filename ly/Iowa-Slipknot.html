		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Relax, it's over
You belong to me, I fill your mouth with dirt
(Hahaha)
Relax, it's over
You can never leave
I take your second digit with me, love

You are my first
I can barely breathe, I find you fascinating
You are my favorite
Lay you down to sleep
It's all that I can do to stop, love 

So blue, so broken, paper doll decays
I haven't left you yet
So cold, subversive, your eyes are full of bleach
Tomorrow, I will go away again, love

Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Love, love

Oh god, oh god
Oh god, oh god, no god

It makes us all one, tears us apart (shut up)
Tears us apart, it tears us apart (shut up) 
Tears us apart (shut up, shut up)
It tears us apart

It cuts us up
It cuts us
It cuts us, it cuts us
It cuts us
You can't leave

You are mine
You will always be mine
I can tear you apart
I can recombine you
All I want is to covet you all
You belong to me
I will kill you to love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you
Love you

Do you, do you see? Do you see?
Do you see? Do you see?

My love
My, my, my love
Just you and I in love
Just you and through it all

It's you and I in love
It's you and I in love
It's you and I 
Just you and I turned around
(My life) just you and I
It's you and I turned around

I can smell you all over me
I can smell you 
I can smell you all over me

I can smell you all over me, hahaha, oh

I told you
I fucking told you
I told you
I fucking told you

You'll live forever
You'll live forever, hahaha
You will live forever
You will
