		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do the D-A-N-C-E
One, two, three, four, fight
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P.Y.T.
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right

Do the D-A-N-C-E
One, two, three, four, fight
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P.Y.T.
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right

Do the D-A-N-C-E
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Just easy as A-B-C
Do the dance

Do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Do the dance (do the dance)
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance (do the dance)
You're always there for music and me

Do the D-A-N-C-E
One, two, three, four, fight
Stick to the B-E-A-T
Get ready to ignite
You were such a P.Y.T.
Catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C
That's how you make it right

Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance, do the dance
You're always there for music and me
Do the dance, do the dance
The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance, do the dance
You're always there for music and me

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

Under the spotlights
Neither black nor white
It doesn't matter
Do the dance, do the dance
As strong as you might
Working day and night
Whatever happens
Do the dance, do the dance

The way you move is a mystery
Do the dance (do the dance)
You're always there for music and me

The way you move is a mystery
