		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo, well, don't you know, baby?
Child, don't you know, baby?
Oww, don't you know, baby?
Little girl, little girl, don't you know?
Please, listen to me, baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so

Turn your lamp down low
I said, turn your lamp down low
Woo, turn it down
Please, turn your lamp down low
Come on, baby
Girl, I'm in love with you so

Now, I know I've been away
For such a long time
But now, baby I can't get you off of my mind, so come on

Please, baby, come on
Come on, come on
Love your daddy all night long

Now, if you love me
Like I love you
We can do all the things that we
Used to do, so come on

Ow, baby, come on
Please, baby, come on
Love your daddy all night long

Say, have you heard, baby?
Ray Charles is in town
Let's mess around 'till the midnight hour
See what he's puttin' down, come on

Please, baby, come on, child
Oh, lord, baby
Come on, all night long

Turn your lamp down low
'Cause I love you so
Baby, please, come on
Love your daddy all night long
You hear me talkin', baby
Baby, please, come on
