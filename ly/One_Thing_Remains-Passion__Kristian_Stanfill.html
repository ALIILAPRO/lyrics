		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  higher than the mountains that I face
stronger than the power of the grave
constant in the trial and the change
This one thing remains
This one thing remains

your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love

On and on and on and on it goes
Yes it overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
'Cause this one thing remains

your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love

In death, in life, I'm confident 
Covered by the power of your great love
I know my debt is paid, there's nothing that can
Separate my heart from your great love

your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 

and on and on and on and on it goes
Yes it overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
'Cause this one thing remains

your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love never fails, it never gives up
it never runs out on me 
Your love, it's your love

god I know your love is never ending
your love is never failing
it's your love, your love, your love
