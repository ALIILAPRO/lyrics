		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only yesterday they told me you were gone
All these normal people, will I find another one?
Monkey on my back, aching in my bones
I forgot you said one day you'll walk alone
I said I need you, does that make me wrong?
Am I a weak man, are you feeling strong?
My heart was blackened, it's bloody red
A hole in my heart, a hole in my head!

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted, addicted to chaos

Light shined on my path
Turn bad days into good
Turn breakdowns into blocks,
I smashed 'em 'cause I could
My brain was labored, my head would spin
Don't let me down, don't give up, don't give in
The rain comes down, cold wind blows
The plans we made are back up on the road
Turn up my collar, welcome the unknown
Remember that you said
One day you'll walk alone

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see
Tangled abstract fallacy
Random turmoil builds in me
I'm addicted to chaos

Who will help me up?
Where's the helping hand?
Will you turn on me?
Is this my final stand?

In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
Bills bills bills
In a dream I cannot see (in a dream I cannot see)
Tangled abstract fallacy (tangled abstract fallacy)
Random turmoil builds in me (random turmoil builds in me)
I'm addicted, addicted to the chaos
Addicted, addicted, to chaos, chaos
Addicted to chaos, chaos
