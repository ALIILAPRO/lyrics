		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nighttime, sharpens, heightens each sensation
Darkness stirs, and wakes imagination
Silently the senses abandon their defenses
Helpless to resist the notes I write
For I compose the music of the night

Slowly, gently night unfurls its splendor
Grasp it, sense it, tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing, music is deceiving
Hot as lightning, soft as candlelight
Dare you trust the music of the night

Close your eyes, for your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth isn't what you want to see
In thge dark it is easy to pretend
That the truth is what it ought to be 

Softly, deftly, music shall caress you
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which you know you cannot fight
The darkness of the music of the night

Close your eyes, start a journey through a strange new world
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before
Close your eyes and let music set you free
Only then can you belong to me

Floating (floating), falling (falling), sweet intoxication
Touch me (touch me), trust me (trust me), savor each sensation
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in
To the power of the music that I/you write 
The power of the music of the night

You alone can make my song take flight
Help me make the music of the night
Help me make the music of the night
