		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there where it's never hopeless
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?

I know a place downtown, babe, if you wanna go
I'm gonna show you how this Italian amor
Is gonna love you harder than ever before
You will li-i-i-i-ike it
We're gonna get sky-high and create a new world
Where somebody might die, but nobody gets hurt
And if it sounds good for you, baby, just say the word
You will li-i-i-i-i-ike it (ah)

It's 5 AM
We feel so good, it's almost frightening
It's 5 AM
I'm made for you, we can't deny it

Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there where it's never hopeless
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there, I'll give you your roses
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?

Before I found this place I was feeling so blue
But then it turned me out, let it do it to you
It's not a one-night stand if it turns into two
Oh, I li-i-i-i-i-ike it (yeah)

It's 5 AM
We feel so good, it's almost frightening
Let's try again
I don't deserve you, you're a diamond

Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there where it's never hopeless
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?
Meet me there where it never closes
Meet me there, I'll give you your roses
All is fair in love, oh-oh-oh
Honey, are you coming?

Honey, are you coming?
