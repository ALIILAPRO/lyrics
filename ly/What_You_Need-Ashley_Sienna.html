		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm what you need
Don't be afraid
Trust me

When I set my eyes
On somebody I like
He won't leave my sight
I claim that he's mine
I don't do too much
Mix my pretty potion up
Hand it to my crush
And then we just wait for the rush

I'll make you obsessed with me
With a little bit of secret energy
Now you're suddenly on top of me
And you're breathing in so heavily
I'll make you feel heavenly
Just trust in me

I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need
Trust me

Every night you sleep
You wake up from vivid dreams
They're all starring me
Like I'm your favorite girl on screen
You're dizzy from the love
I'm your favorite drug
You can't control your thoughts
Because I'm deep inside your blood

I'll make you obsessed with me
With a little bit of secret energy
Now you're suddenly on top of me
And you're breathing in so heavily
I'll make you feel heavenly
Just trust in me

I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need

You need me you'll see
I'll wipe all you bleed
I'll touch your soft skin while you're falling asleep
I'll make you happy
With love that you need
Look in my eyes and just breathe
Just breathe

I'm what you need
Don't be afraid
Trust me

I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need
I'm what you need

I am what you need
Trust me
I'm just what you need
Baby, trust me
I'm everything you need
Come on trust me
Trust me, baby
