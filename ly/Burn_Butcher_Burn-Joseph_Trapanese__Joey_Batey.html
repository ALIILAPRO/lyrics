		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear you're alive
How disappointing
I've also survived, no thanks to you
Did I not bring you some glee 
Mister "Oh, Look at Me?"
Now I'll burn all the memories of you

All those lonely miles that you ride
Now you'll walk with no one by your side
Did you ever even care
With your swords and your stupid hair?
Now watch me laugh as I burn all the memories of you

Ladies and gentlemen
You have been the most beautiful audience!
Remember to toss a coin if you can
If anyone needs me, I'll be at the bar

What for do you yearn?
It's the point of no return
After everything we did, we saw
You turned your back on me

What for do you yearn?
Watch that butcher burn
At the end of my days when I'm through
No word that I've written will ring quite as true
As "Burn"

Burn, butcher, burn
Burn, butcher, burn
Burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn, burn
Watch me burn all the memories of you
