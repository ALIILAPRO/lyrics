		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Charli, baby
Tiësto

You won't see me cryin' on the bathroom floor
I ain't never comin' back for more
Wanna see you walkin' out that door
Bye-bye, bye-bye
You won't see me beggin' for a second chance
Say I need you 'cause it don't make sense
Boy, you just lost a ten out of ten
Won't lie, lie, lie

And tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it (yeah)
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it

Moving 'til my feet get sore
Hands all on me 'til my dress gets torn
Watch me do it, do it real hardcore
My, my, my, my
You and me, we never ever made much sense
I'm too independent, no offense
Boy, don't be sad about the things I said
Don't cry, cry, cry

Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it (hot in it)
(I look hot in it)

Rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it (yeah)
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
Tonight I'm gon' be rockin' it, droppin' it (yeah)
Shake my ass, no stoppin' it
I look hot in it, hot in it
I look hot in it
