		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eugh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eugh

Rain down the thunder, I banish Andromeda
Chalk on your body, get stomped in your grave
Bulletshell crest, I'm in love with the darkness
Incision the wicked, I cut out your fangs (Roof)
Omen the body, it follows me, I got nobody, alone with it, bitch, I eclipse
Gravity follow me, comets are falling to Earth when I walk out the darkest abyss
Blood on the road, bury my the foes
I eat the marrow right outta your bones
I walk alone with a skeleton cold
Skin looking tattered, gon' rip when it's old
I wanna rot in my coffin, I'm coughing up vomit, I'm broken, the body decays
Lord of the fallen, I call on the wretched, it bubbling up like the blood in your veins

Shh, shh, lights out, but I say none
Lifestyle keeps the veins running and my knife down, keep the blade rugged
Ayy, what? Bite down, keep the K comin'
Gimme symptom, I'ma take something
And that's a big line, but I ain't duck it
Yeah, bitch, I leave 'em buggin'
Lace your body up and cut it
Bleed the fallen, I'ma run it
I've been hunting for abundance
I'm dungeon, I came out the dirt like it's muhfuckin' nothin'
Yeah, Glock .45 with the iced out shells
Aight muhfucka, I'ma kill myself
Hop out the coffin, I'm confident, conscious is falling to sediment, worms are compelled

Cuts on my body, I came out the dark alone, the ghosts in my coffin now
Skin fallen of of the surface of all the bones, I'm broken and lost without
I wanna rot alone, I'm talkin' slow, I can't see what's all around
I've got a heart of stone, I'm on my own, I've always been falling down

I'm the grave man walking, feel decay on my bones
I sit in pain, liquor calling me, my veins overflow, oh-oh
Rain on my body, I done came out the cold
So, baby, stay away, you cannot save me alone, oh-oh
I'm the grave man walking, feel decay on my bones
I sit in pain, liquor calling me, my veins overflow, oh-oh
Rain on my body, I dun came out the cold
So, baby, stay away, you cannot save me alone, oh-oh
