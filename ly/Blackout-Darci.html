		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m forgetting how it’s supposed to be
Feel like I’m forgetting bout most the things
I been burning and turning into the colder me
But it’s worth it, it’s perfect, cause you got close to me
Yeah they told me that nothing could ever last now
But I guess it’s the only thing I could ask now
Made me cave in, they making me wear a mask now
But ur my favorite, my crazy beautiful blackout

You been turning, I see how you throwing cash now
Swerve suburban, we sitting up in the back now
Raise the curtain, off bourbon, I finna act now
I’m uncertain, determined I finna pass out
Hotel room playing when I got you up
You keep on saying how I care too much
Your friends keep hating, I could give two fucks
No time for taking when you in a rush

I’m forgetting how it’s supposed to be
Feel like I’m forgetting bout most the things
I been burning and turning into the colder me
But it’s worth it, it’s perfect, cause you got close to me

I been hurting the questions you finna ask now
Make me nervous my purpose could make you back out
Hotel room playing when I got you up
You keep on saying how I care too much
Your friends keep hating, I could give two fucks
No time for taking when you in a rut

I’m forgetting how it’s supposed to be
Feel like I’m forgetting bout most the things
I been burning and turning into the colder me
But it’s worth it, it’s perfect, cause you got close to me
Yeah they told me that nothing could ever last now
But I guess it’s the only thing I could ask now
Made me cave in, they making me wear a mask now
But ur my favorite, my crazy beautiful blackout
