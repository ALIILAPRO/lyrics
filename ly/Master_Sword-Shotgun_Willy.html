		  Oof

Genie grant a wish I'm getting rich (huh?)
'Member when I said I hit a lick (huh?)
I don't really wanna fuck the bitch (what?)
Willy went and made another hit
Okay like
Prada on my mothafuckin kid (huh?)
Louis on my mothafuckin hip (huh?)
Curry how I dunk no swish (hey)
Fuck it gonna fuck that bitch (hey)
If you ain't gone fuck with me you a dumb fuck (uh)
Pull up and hit the boy feel like one punch (uh)
Look at my bank and I'm getting dumb rich (uh)
And I'm gonna count it up till a hundred (uh)
I'm just tryna get it Like this like that
Ayy
Willy tell me how you get a bitch like that
Ayy
Listen to yo music man this ain't that
Ayy
Willy tell me how you get yo wrist like that

My pockets fat
Got money stacks

He wanna be like me I tell him run it up, (hey) run it up (hey)
My pockets fat

She down to fuck
He wanna be like me I tell him run it up, (hey) run it up (hey)

Round one like Ike I fight (mm-hm)
In the kitchen I'm whippin' like Betty White (mm-hm)
Bad bitch on my list like Light (mm-hm)
I been killin' the business feel like I'm Dwight (mm-hm)
Big bones 'cause ya boy still breast feed (hey)
Bad bitch wanna be my bestie (ouh)
New ice my wrist like jet ski (wet)
Talk shit get hit don't test me (hey)
Runnin' and runnin' and don't ever stop got a mac in the back and we let that shit pop (hey)
Ayy, pull up and skrrt out the lot
See I don't got no time but my wrist got a watch
Hunnid on hunnid get stuffed in a sock and I don't chase a bitch only after the guap
Ay wrist and my drink on the rocks
See I Can't fuck that bitch if her dad is a cop
Bummin' and bummin' these kids wanna be me 'cause everything from me go straight to the top (hey)
Ay made a few bands off a single and end of the day you can't piss in a pot
(Bitch you broke)
Started getting famous now I'm feeling like the pope
Spending time in Vegas 'boutta make a lot of dough
Quick scope no scope you hoes on ghost
Deep throat my load my hoe don't choke

Bitch I'm a legend like Zelda
Bitch I'm a legend like Zelda (yah, hey)
Bitch I'm a legend like Zelda
Bitch I'm a legend like Zelda (ha? What?)
Sorry don't know what to tell ya
Sorry don't know what to tell ya (ha, hey)
Bitch I'm a legend like Zelda
Bitch I'm a legend like Zelda

My pockets fat
Got money stacks
I'm posted in the back and got a hunnid racks, (hey, hey) a hunnid racks (hey, hey)
I'm coming up
She down to fuck
He wanna be like me I tell him run it up, (hey) run it up (hey)
