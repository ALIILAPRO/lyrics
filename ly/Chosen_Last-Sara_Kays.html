		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inside jokes that I never know 
but I Still laugh until I cry
Group photos but I'm standing off to the side
I'm just camera shy

Always at the birthday parties
But never close to anybody

I've been chosen last since the kindergarten
Walk in the grass and it's disregarded
Fast walk to the lunch table
And pack up before I'm ready to go
I don't speak my mind, I just sit and listen
I'm there on time 'cause they won't know I'm missing
Sometimes I would rather stay home
Than show up to be ignored and alone

Carpool everywhere, but there's never room
For me to go too
Ride my bike like all of us used to do
Oh, I don't have a clue

Why I'm at the birthday parties
When I'm not close to anybody

I've been chosen last since the kindergarten
Walk in the grass and it's disregarded
Fast walk to the lunch table
And pack up before I'm ready to go
I don't speak my mind, I just sit and listen
I'm there on time 'cause they won't know I'm missing
Sometimes I would rather stay home
Than show up to be ignored and alone

I've been chosen last since the kindergarten
Walk in the grass and it's disregarded
Fast walk to the lunch table
And pack up before I'm ready to go
I don't speak my mind, I just sit and listen
I'm there on time 'cause they won't know I'm missing
Sometimes I would rather stay home
Than show up to be ignored and alone
