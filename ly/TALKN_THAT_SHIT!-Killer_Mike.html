		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just need someone to help me stay awake
Because evidently Killer Mike has gone to sleep
(All the player haters who be talkin' that shit
Them motherfuckin' player haters who be talkin' that shit)
(DJ Paul)
(CY you did it, you heard?)

Niggas talk to me about that woke ass shit
Same niggas walkin' on some broke ass shit
You see yo' words ain't worth no money I ain't spoke back, bitch
All of you niggas hang together on some Brokeback shit
Really y'all niggas some hoes on some hoe ass shit
Look at me and take a picture on some Kodak shit
What you see is a G and you envy that shit
I can see it in yo' eyes like a envious bitch
I'm in rooms with politicians talkin' business and shit
Hear you come with your opinion, ain't solicit that shit (DJ Paul)
Lola hit up DJ Paul went to Memphis and shit
Pause
Rest in peace to Lord Infamous, bitch
I'm so underground I move like Pimp C in this bitch
I bob and weave and bust on beats like Bun B in this bitch
I'm feelin' like I'm Tony Draper, ballin' G in this bitch
On fire like hot boy Juvi, four hundred degrees in this bitch
All that chatter that you chatter 'bout my manner just don't matter
I don't, I don't forth and backer
I clack-clacka ratta-tatta
Could be blacker could be cracka
It's what ever, that's whenever
Sprinkle salt, I spray pepper
You play bad, I go evil
I know folk, I know people
I'm the shit, I go fecal
You a leach, I'm a leader
Humble down we ain't equal
Kill yo' masters, slap yo' sifu
I'm rich rollin', true blue Regal
I keep a stick don't take shit and that .223 is lethal

(DJ Paul)
(CY)
Let's go
(That- that fucker talk alotta shit
But shit don't impress me
That- that fucker talk alotta shit)

Black Boul√© hate me
I'm too cool, AC
I don't give a fuck if weed gettin' legal if none of my niggas ain't free
Ayy, I don't give a fuck who the president is if the president ain't for me
You ain't never met a nigga like me
I'm a bad nigga, I'm Stagger Lee
I'm a Morehouse man, Spike Lee
Dope man with a plan, Fat Steve
I'll kill 'em, I'm Jose Williams
Unbought, unbossed, I'm chillin'
Tryna get it out the mud off the muscle
Tryna get it like the late Herman Russel
I'm yearnin' like Alonzo Herndon
I'm the new q-ball, I'm earnin'
First rule you better understand
You dealin' with a real black man
If I said it I meant, it I meant it like I said it 
'Cause I said what I said understand
So stay in yo place lil' man
Commentin' on the TV channel
I guarantee you never seen a nigga like me 
'Cause they only make these in Atlanta

(That fucker talk alotta shit
But shit don't impress me
That- that fucker talk alotta shit
(But shit don't impress me)
