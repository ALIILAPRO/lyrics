		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For your beliefs
I lost my life and all of my dreams
For your rules
We buried our smile and youth
How much pressure and pain must resume?
The city is filled with the smell of blood that pours
Will you remember them all?
All for one, one for all
Rise
We are the ashes of a fire
You lit before
Now we burn your lives
You fucked with a wrong generation
Fall
We are taken over
Let the rain fall and cleanse us all
Cleanse us all
The more you hit the less I back down
The more you kill the more I try
To get the right you stole
Do you hear this lullaby?
A mother's song
Do you want more sacrifice?
These are my brothers and sisters
That you take from me
That you take from me
That you take from me
Rise
We are the ashes of a fire
You lit before
Now we burn your lives
You fucked with a wrong generation
Fall
We are taken over
Let the rain fall and cleanse us all
Cleanse us all
All we want is love
All we get is a bullet in our heart
All we ask is to open your eyes
We are all humans
Rise
We are the ashes of a fire
You lit before
Now we burn your lives
You fucked with a wrong generation
Fall
We are taken over
Let the rain fall and cleanse us all
Cleanse us all
