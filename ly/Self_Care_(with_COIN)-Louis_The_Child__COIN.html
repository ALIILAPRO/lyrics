		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do it for myself
I'm dancing for no one else
I do it for myself, baby (ahh)

Turn the lights down, baby
And turn it up to something we know
Never felt so crazy
Haven't slept in days
I'm burning up breaking through the floor

(Oh wow)
When I find myself acting up
(Freak me out)
When I find myself out of touch
I'm sick of love songs, baby
Pushing up daisies
And I've just about had enough

I do it for myself
I'm dancing for no one else
I do it for myself, baby (ahh)

I do it for myself, baby
I'm dancing for no one else
I do it for myself, baby (ahh)

(I do it for myself)
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
(I do it for myself)
(Dance, dance, dance)

Never felt so proud
I'm walking upside down
Through talking televisions
To swimming through superstitions
And slowly submitting to the sound

(Oh wow)
I wanna be the one to look that way
(Freak me out)
I wanna be the one to help you figure it out
And I find myself acting up, so tell me
Is it a crime to care for myself?

I do it for myself, baby
I'm dancing for no one else
I do it for myself, baby (ahh)

I do it for myself
(Once you start it, you can't stop it)
(Once you start it, you can't stop it)
I do it for myself
(Once you start it, you can't stop it)
(Once you start it, you can't stop it) (ahh)

I do it for myself
I do it for myself, baby
I'm dancing for no one else
I do it for myself, baby (ahh)

I do it for my-
(I do it for myself)
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
(I do it for myself)
(Dance, dance, dance)
(I do it for myself)
(Dance, dance, dance, dance)
Ahh
Uh, yeah
