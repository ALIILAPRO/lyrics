		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right from the jump
I was addicted, I was hooked on you
Like July is to the Sun
You're the one that I prayed for all my life
And then you arrived
It's amazing how the time flies by
Do you remember, my baby?

Take me back to the summer breeze
We were sleeping out by the willow trees
It was the first time you laid your head on my chest
It was a night I will never forget
That's when I told you on a Friday night
You're always gonna have this heart of mine
Wherever we go, whatever we do
I just wanna spend forever with you

I know this sounds clich√©
But I was in love with you from the first sight
Like a moth drawn to a flame, mm
And I know, even in another life
I would find you and hold you
Remember I told you I'll never let go, babe

Take me back to the summer breeze
We were sleeping out by the willow trees
It was the first time you laid your head on my chest
It was a night I will never forget
That's when I told you on a Friday night
You're always gonna have this heart of mine
Wherever we go, whatever we do
I just wanna spend forever with you

So get on your favourite dress (my favourite dress)
Let's drive back to the place we met
I knew I'd die for you right from the jump

So take me back to the summer breeze
Sleeping out by the willow trees
It was the first time you laid your head on my chest
It was a night I'll never forget
That's when I told you on a Friday night
You're always gonna have this heart of mine
Wherever we go, whatever we do
I just wanna spend forever with you

Oh, I just wanna spend forever with you, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Mm-mm

(You're always gonna have this heart of mine, right from the jump)
(Right from the jump)
(Right from the jump)
