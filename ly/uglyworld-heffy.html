		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And all i ever want is somewhere to call home
We lost it all the footprints of a ghost
The glam the gloss a shimmer of hope
I thought i seen it all but always wanted more

Oh the world outside
The beautiful people
At peace of mind
So young and satisfied
We walk the line
Oh well i'll say hello
From the other-side

Lately I've been feeling like a stranger
When I look it's not same me
I just want to see the same thing
Hold me close don't let go
I want to feel the warmth of love you don't show
The whimpers of a soul I never could see
Wishing love like this wasn't a dream

And all i ever want is somewhere to call home
We lost it all the footprints of a ghost
The glam the gloss a shimmer of hope
I thought i seen it all but always wanted more

Oh the world outside
The beautiful people
At peace of mind
So young and satisfied
We walk the line
Oh well i'll say hello
From the other side
