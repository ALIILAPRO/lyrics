		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We shine like a dying sun
Nothing seems right
But I'm trying not to waste
I forget who I was, what i wished
I dig my dead memories and throw them away
What hurts now , won't hurt forever
I'm so powerless
But i decide to fight back
Now or never
My wo unded heart beats till my death
We burn all the bridges
We miss those we love
We shine like a dying sun
Burn the negativities
We escape from our fears
We're lost in our dreams
We're going to make the change
Come what may
Stronger than before
Get out of your head
It's not a safe place
I got stuck and tortured myself for years
My black and white world painted with colorful pain
I drew them on the walls of my hopes and dreams
But now
I'm gonna break the walls
What's done is done
And it never returns
I hear the voices in my head
Keep telling me to quit
No matter what I'm up against
I should find my way
Out
You always say
You're never gonna make it
You think I'm paranoid
You want me to surrender
But This is me
Who never knows failure
But This is me
Who never knows failure
We burn all the bridges
We miss those we love
We shine like a dying sun
We burn all the bridges
We miss those we love
We shine like a dying sun
We escape from our fears
We're lost in our dreams
We're going to make the change
Come what may
Stronger than before
