O-5, pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain't no time for tryna lay low, bay bro, if you can't do it all you gotta do is say no
I'll take it from there, Asians on gram ready to work it, displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thanks Einstein that nothing popped off, since I was young,
handled lots of foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that bad thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I'm gonna do this

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we've been here before
Somebody help me
God have mercy
It's like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It's like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

I'm from a place called the jungle where they live in this rough
It had me low for a while now I'm picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems, switching not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? got your bitch nigga gripping the butt
I ran my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My clique is a circle, fuck you want?
You'll end up dumped jumped party in a truck in New York
There's no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, there's no fuckery
Won't find a chick who got a diamond, or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My back flow will mirror your fat flows
Well here it go my, visage is lineal when I'm ripping the video
It's a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds, sick like venereal diseases

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we've been here before
Somebody help me
God have mercy
It's like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It's like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

Dying for nothing
Killing to live, fighting for something
To bad we don't know what it is
What you think all of this cash for?
Trying to put stamps on my passport
Man I'm just scheming on new homes
I already forgot about my last broad

Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we've been here before
Somebody help me
God have mercy
It's like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It's like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on
