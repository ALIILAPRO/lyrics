		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't say that I am free
As long as they return
If I had a way out of here
Would I then return?
They seldom will speak, no
They only breathe, slow

Do they know that I'm afraid, so afraid
They depend on my worries, so I know
And I'm awake, I'm right in the circle now
I am with them

There is no way I am going to be free
Because their hearts, they are similar to mine
There is no way they are going to release me
From this chain of rows unto our own hearts

I can't say that I regret my promises
I can't say that I regret behaving like my enemies
I seldom will speak, no
I only breathe, ghost
