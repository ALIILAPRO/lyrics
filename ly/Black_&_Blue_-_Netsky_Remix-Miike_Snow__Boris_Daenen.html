		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long has it been, shall we get into it again?
Excuse, our disgrace 
We've had no time to paint the place
The dog is always barking at the mailman

I won't waste your time with my revelation
Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, its all been in my head
Hey well I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue

My dear, come again? Your voice is fading out and in
Out of the laundry bin, I found my innocence again
The dog is always barking at the mailman

I won't waste your time with my revelation
Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, its all been in my head
Hey well I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue

Hello my friend, I see you're back again
Hello mystery, don't bother to explain
How 'bout maybe, its all been in my head
Hey well, I'm tired of this black and blue, black and blue
