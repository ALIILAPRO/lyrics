		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so glad I woke up today
A different life in a brand new place
I think I maybe outgrew the last
I needed a change of pace
No more talk of what my burdens say
They've been left behind and that's where they will stay
Fled the scene, nimble, my hands kept clean
I needed a change of pace
Needed a change of pace

Oh, how could you love me so
Oh, with all I've done and the things you know
My dearest
You better never forgive me
Cause if you
Forget what I've done I'll do it again

I died that night and killed god in the morning
Left without a warning or even informing the coroner
I was a foreigner
Never belonged in that place
Played along in that place
Till I had enough of the games
I couldn't find the time
From the afterlife
To apologize
Or even say goodbye

Oh, how could you love me so
Oh, with all I've done and the things you know
My dearest
You better never forgive me
Cause if you
Forget what I've done I'll do it again

I've come to realize
I'd rather flee than fight
To fake your death is
The most honest life
All it takes is an agile step and the vigilance to
Spot that blink of an eye

Oh, how could you love me so
Oh, with all I've done and the things you know
But still, you plead with me
Baby, I guarantee
You're better off if you let me go
Cause even eye to eye
I'm not afraid to lie
A curse and a kiss goodbye

My whole life all I wanted was a change of pace
