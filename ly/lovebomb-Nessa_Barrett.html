		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even remember how it started
Something you said must've set me off
My words are bullets, and you're my favorite target
This isn't what I wanted, but I can't drop the gun

Mhm-mhm
Even I can't stop me
Mhm-mhm
Just so you know, I'm sorry

I'll send you love bombs after the war
Even though I know they don't work anymore
I'll wave a white flag after the storm
I promise I've calmed down, I'm not manic like before
So you lift the rug and I'll sweep the glass
And we can pretend like this never happened
Love bombs after the war
Even though I know they don't work anymore

Even when I say it, I don't hate you
I'm trying even when I lose control
And it's unfair to pull you into my chaos
But after we're out of the trenches, I love you more

Mhm-mhm
Just so you know, I'm sorry
I'll send you love bombs after the war
Even though I know they don't work anymore
I'll wave a white flag after the storm
I promise I've calmed down, I'm not manic like before
So you life the rug and I'll sweep the glass
And we can pretend like this never happened
Love bombs after the war
Even though I know they don't work anymore

Mhm-mhm
I'm so sorry
Love, love bombin'
Don't go
