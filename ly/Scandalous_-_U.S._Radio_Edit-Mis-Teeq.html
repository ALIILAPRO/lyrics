		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, so, so scandalous
You know you wanna sing with us (baby)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (baby)

Nonstop looks to kill
Straight talk sex appeal
One touch gives me chills and we ain't even close yet
Rough neck all around
Inkin' all over town
Show me how you get down
'Cause we ain't even close yet

You got me feenin' and you got me feelin' weak
Listen as I speak 'cause I'm careful as I creep
You got me goin' crazy and you know I can't sleep
Love watchin' your moves and you hypnotize me
You got me tremblin' like a little baby girl
You're so special, you're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinnin' and you got me in a twirl
You're my number one, baby, and you come to rock my world

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinnin' out like crazy
There goes my baby

Scandalous 
So scandalous (baby)
Scandalous 
So, so, so scandalous

Hot stuff, head to toe
Where you go, no one knows
You smile playin' it dumb and we ain't even close yet
Solid as a rock
How many ways can you hit the spot?
Show me what you got 'cause we ain't even close yet

You got me feenin' and you got me feelin' weak
Listen as I speak 'cause I'm careful as I creep
You got me goin' crazy and you know I can't sleep
Love watchin' your moves and you hypnotize me
You got me tremblin' like a little baby girl
You're so special, you're like diamonds and pearls
You got me spinnin' and you got me in a twirl
You're my number one, baby, and you come to rock my world

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinnin' out like crazy
There goes my baby

Scandalous (baby)
So scandalous 
Scandalous (baby)
So, so, so scandalous

A little conversation 
goes a long, long way
Show a little patience
That you are here to stay
So show me that you're game, oh

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinnin' out like crazy
There goes my baby

You're dangerous
Just get it up
The way you move so scandalous
It's all about the two of us
A one night stand just ain't enough
I need some stimulation, baby
A little conversation maybe
You got me spinnin' out like crazy
There goes my baby

You know you wanna sing with us (baby)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (baby)
You know you wanna sing with us (baby)
That's why you know you should be scared of us (baby)
