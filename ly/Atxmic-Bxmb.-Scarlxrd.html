		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasted every second, living like I would regret it
I just had to reinvent myself, of course, you can't relate (move, relate)
B-b-better than I've ever been, the medicine is defining
It's king Scarlxrd on your brain (scar)

Flowing like my big bro mage (yuh)
Kicking in the door, no raid (oh, yeah)
Sipping on the liquor made me sway (oh, wow)
I'm living in your mind rent-free (li-li-li)
Let me do my dance like, "What?" (Like what?)
Every single chance I get (pull up, pull up, wheel! Yeah)
Make 'em take a chance on the boy (like what?)
Metal to your face, say some (wah)
I-i-i never settle, been going in sick (yeah)
Upping my level, you know what it is (oh yeah)
Nigga, be careful, we know where you live (oh, what?)
I switched up my mental and got me some bricks (yeah)

Okay, bitch, you want a lullaby? (Like what?)
Tell me how you can't survive (tell me, yeah)
All your moves are out of spite (your moves are out of spite)
I know that you want a life like mine, but you can't survive
Bitch, we are not in the same conversation, can't survive (move)
None of you pussies are worth my attention, can't survive
People think they know me, can you stop with the questions?
Can't survive, pay the price and I'll confess it (move)

(The-the-the-the medal of honour) (yeah, tsh)
Yeah, huh (it's scarlxrd, bitch)

God! (pull up, pull up, wheel!)
God! (m-m-made in hell, wheel!)
Don't get close (don't get close), don't get close (don't get close)
Don't get close (okay, shut), don't get close to me (nah)
Don't get close (don't get close), don't get close (don't get close)
Don't get close (don't get close), don't get close to me (move, wheel!)
Argh, I fucked my head up a hundred percent (blergh)
Wanna try press me about what I'm doing? The last time I checked they all on the decent (what?)
I never need consent, never gonna take your advice, you ain't got my respect (no)
I never need consent, I'll fuck your head up a hundred percent (huh?)
