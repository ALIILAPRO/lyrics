		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been searching
For a reason
To love you to love you
I've been searching
For a reason
To leave you to leave you
I've been searching
For a reason
To love you to love you
I've been

Picture today picture me Rollin
We get to your place picture us goin
Picture the waves picture them crashing
Now picture my face picture it laughing
Picture the bay picture this moment
Envision this day
There's nowhere to go
And I'm feeling away
Tell me your picture is looking the same
Is it the same
Or did it come out lookin blurry?
Why you in a hurry
Girly you don't got to worry
I'm just tryna kick back
I just wanna kick back
I'm just gonna kick back
And share with you my mishaps
Don't you wanna kick back
You two tryna kick back
Won't you please just kick back
And share with me your mishaps?
So do we got to go
Into the unknown like Geronimo
Dominoes fall and they pushed out the comfort zone
Stomach going upside down It's tops turvy
I ain't seen that bitch around like

I've been searching
For a reason
To love you to love you
I've been searching
For a reason
To leave you to leave you

Catch me on the flip side
Have no other wish I
Just want you to be here
Just want you to be here
I've lost all my magic
I can't fucking find it
Am I losing my touch?
Am I losing myself?
Am I hurting my health
Will I hear those English Bells?
When I sit down for too long
Will I forgot to stand up
Will I remember this song
Will you still be here
I'm losing my mind
You're gonna disappear
This isn't a dream
This shit feels so real
