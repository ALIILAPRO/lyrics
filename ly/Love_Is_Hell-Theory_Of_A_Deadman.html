		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rather be punched in the face
Be sprayed with some mace
Than be head over heals
I'd rather be hit by a truck
Then be totally fucked
I know you know how it feels
I'd rather be buried alive
Than be living a lie with somebody like you

Love is hell
Love is shit
Can't you tell I've had enough of it
Raise your hands, let me hear you yell
Love is hell
Love is hell
Love is hell

I'd rather be broke on the street
Than be losing sleep over something you said
I'd rather spend the weekend in jail
And be stuck without bail
Than have you stuck in my head
I'd rather just play with myself
Than deal with somebody else and get totally screwed

Love is hell
Love is shit
Can't you tell I've had enough of it
Raise your hands, let me hear you yell
Love is hell
Love is hell
Love is hell

I'd rather be stabbed and be cut into ribbons
I'd rather be dead than the way you got me living
I'd rather be shot in the heart and be bleeding
I'd rather be left here alone than be needed

Love is hell
Love is shit
Can't you tell I've had enough of it
Raise your hands, let me hear you yell
Love is hell
Love is hell
Love is hell

Love ain't right
Just as well I'll be alone tonight
Raise your hands, let me hear you yell
Love is hell
Love is hell
Love is hell

I'd rather be stabbed and be cut into ribbons
I'd rather be dead than the way you got me living
(Love is hell)
I'd rather be shot in the heart and be bleeding
I'd rather be left here alone than be needed
(Love is hell)
