		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She wrote her name across, yeah
Never sayin' sorry (oh, no)
I'll tell you what, baby
It's a lifestyle
She love me through the pain and the pleasure
Yeah, she could be the one if I let her
Yeah, I could put her name on a necklace
Yeah, we could just stay on the edge
I met her on the pole where she danced for me
Yeah I gave her half a check, never work for free
Now she up on top of the world with me
Takin' on this life, live and die

Yeah, we are livin' stars
Yeah, we are livin' stars

Love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night

She love me through the pain and the pleasure
Yeah, we could never change for the better
Your beautiful eyes keep me reckless
Yeah, baby put your money where your mouth is
I met her on the pole where she danced for me
Yeah I gave her half a check, never work for free
Now she up on top of the world with me
Takin' on this life, live and die

Yeah, we are livin' stars
Yeah, we are livin' stars

So love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night
Yeah, we are livin' stars
Yeah, we are livin' stars
So love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night
Love me by the night
(Love me by the night)

Yeah we are
Livin' stars
Yeah we are
Livin' stars
Yeah we are
Livin' stars
Yeah we are
Livin' stars
