		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me no lies,
has peace arrived
Or, is this some kind of joke?

What a surprise,
you don't realize
There's some things you don't own.

Can you disguise,
can you simplify
This change you put me through?

Can you revive,
and will I survive
This life you've brought me to?

Physically and emotionally exhausted, 
Nude was confined to a sea-side resort nursing home.
His war had finally begun.
