		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an awful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day (night and day)
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly hoo

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me, ho oh

If I can see it hoo, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day (night and day)
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
Oh, I believe I can fly hoo

Hey, 'cause I believe in me, oh

If I can see it hoo, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it hey

I believe I can fly hoo
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly)
I believe I can fly (I can fly) hey

If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly) yeah
I can fly (I can fly) hey
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
(I can fly) whoa
(I can fly)
(Hmm, fly, fly, fly)
