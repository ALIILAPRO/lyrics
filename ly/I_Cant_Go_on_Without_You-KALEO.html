		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well they thought they were made for each other
One thinking of one another
Never thinking just for one second
She would take a different attraction

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
Can't go on without you, yeah
I can't go on without you

Oh so, what's the point of breaking my sweet heart?
She wanted me to let down my guard
Well, you know what they say, it's better that way
So, so you better hush and walk away

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you, oh lord
Can't go on without you, ooh ooh
I can't go on, won't go on, living on, without you

Woah yeah
Woah ah

Well, was I supposed to wait for you sweetheart?
And hide away the shame
Yes I keep it all inside
Though the thought had crossed my mind
To do all the things I regret and we don't want that

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

I can't, I can't, I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you, oh lord
Go on without you, ooh ooh
I can't go on without you babe
Yeah

Ahh, she loves me
She loves me not
She loves me
My love's gon' love me

Oh so what is left but a broken man?
'Cause nothing hurts like a woman can

I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you, oh yeah
Can't go on without you
I can't go on without you, oh
Oh without you lord, without you
Without you babe, without you
Oh lord, you
