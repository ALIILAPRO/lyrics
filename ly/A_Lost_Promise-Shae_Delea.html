		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is anyone out there? 
I promised if I made it out, I'd find love again
I won't forget the life we've lived

We'll never get back the time spent
I won't pretend I'll find love again
I faked a smile and found the end

I'm tired of all the doubt
The broken promises
Don't know if I'll ever make her proud
I'm sorry my life's a mess

I'm trying to make it out
But something pulls me in
I never know how to find myself
I'm sorry I can't commit

I won't trust ever again
Was I the cause of this?

I want to know what I did to ruin this
I'd love to find the reason I exist
Just tell me if the lies will end

I'm tired of all the doubt
The broken promises
Don't know if I'll ever make her proud
I'm sorry my life's a mess

I'm trying to make it out
But something pulls me in
I never know how to find myself
I'm sorry I can't commit

I won't trust ever again
Was I the cause of this?
