		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Done being the sad girl
I'm done dating rock stars
From now on only actors
Tall boys in the Raptors
I'll become an asshole
Disguised as a bad girl
In my button-up shirt
A natural disaster, hey

You could be my baby, baby, baby
You could be my baby boy, they, lady
You could be my baby, baby, maybe, uh-oh

I'm sorry in advance
I'm only gonna treat you bad
I'm probably gonna let you down
I'm probably gonna sleep around
So sorry in advance
Before you take off your pants
I wouldn't let me near your friends
I wouldn't let me near your dad

But don't blame me, blame Brett
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
Don't blame me, blame Brett
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex

That's why I won't get vulnerable
Don't you dare get comfortable
Heartbreak is impossible
Feelings doing summersaults
I'm not ready for therapy
To take accountability
Right now it's about me
Me and only 'bout me, hey

You could be my baby, baby, baby
You could be my baby boy, they, lady
You could be my baby, baby, maybe, uh-oh

I'm sorry in advance
I'm only gonna treat you bad
I'm probably gonna let you down
I'm probably gonna sleep around
So sorry in advance
Before you take off your pants
I wouldn't let me near your friends
I wouldn't let me near your dad

But don't blame me, blame Brett
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
Don't blame me, blame Brett
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
I'm only in it for the sex
That's why I'm never gonna love again

I'm only in it for the sex
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
Don't blame me, blame Brett
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
Don't blame me, blame Brett
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
