		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm another year older
I won't cry about you anymore
Told my friends to come over
To dye my hair, mm
It's not even the weekend
And I'm wearin' that dress I can't afford
Givin' life a new meanin'
Without you there

Do some stupid shit, maybe get a tattoo (oh)
Whatever I can do to get my mind off you (oh)

It's my birthday
I'ma do what I like
I'ma eat what I like
I'ma kiss who I like
It's my birthday
I'am do what I like
I'ma wear what I like
I'ma party tonight
Goddamn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look at me, gimme money
Damn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Nah, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
It's my birthday

I blow out all the candles, uh (I blow out all the candles)
I can't even afford my rent (hoo)
So I'm not buyin' the drinks, 'cause
I'ma leave that to my friends, yeah

Fall in love with everybody in the room (yeah)
That's what I do, that's what I do, yeah (oh)
Whatever I can do to get my mind off you (huh)
That's what I do, that's what I do (oh)

It's my birthday
I'ma do what I like
I'ma eat what I like
I'ma kiss who I like
It's my birthday
I'am do what I like
I'ma wear what I like
I'ma party tonight
Goddamn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look at me, gimme money
Damn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Nah, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
It's my birthday

Ain't got any wiser
Gonna be hungover
Never learned my lesson (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I ain't gonna listen
I don't really care, 'cause (uh)

It's my birthday (it's my birthday)
I'ma do what I like
I'ma eat what I like (yeah)
I'ma kiss who I like
It's my birthday (it's my birthday)
I'am do what I like (huh)
I'ma wear what I like
I'ma party tonight
Goddamn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look at me, gimme money
Damn, it's my birthday
Everybody love me
Nah, I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

It's my birthday, my birthday
And I ain't thinkin' 'bout you
It's my birthday (no) my birthday (no)
And I ain't thinkin' 'bout you (no, yeah)
It's my birthday (yeah, it's my birthday), my birthday (and I'ma do whatever I like)
And I ain't thinkin' 'bout you (do whatever I like)
It's my birthday (it's my), my birthday (it's my birthday)
So you better treat me nice
