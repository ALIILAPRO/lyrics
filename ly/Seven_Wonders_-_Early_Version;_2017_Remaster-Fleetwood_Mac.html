		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long ago
Certain place
Certain time
You touched my hand
On the way
On the way down to Emmeline

But if our paths never cross
Well, you know I'm sorry, but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge

(Aaron)
(Aaron)

So it's hard to find
Someone with that kind of intensity
You touched my hand, I played it cool
And you reached out your hand to me

But if our paths never cross
Well, no, I'm not sorry, but

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
The rainbow's edge

(Aaron)
(Aaron)

So long ago
It's a certain time
It's a certain place
You touched my hand and you smiled
All the way back you held out your hand
If I hope and if I pray
Ooh it might work out someday

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end (I'll make a path there)
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(You'll never live to see the beauty, the beauty, that same same beauty)

If I live to see the seven wonders
I'll make a path to the rainbow's end
I'll never live to match the beauty again
(Oh well if I hope and I pray, well, maybe it might work out some day)
