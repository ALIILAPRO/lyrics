		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suttin bout you just turns man on
I'm smooth like 007 but they can't break our bond 
Your icon the only one I want 
They can't break our bond 
Do you know they can't break our bond?

Im smooth like James 
My new ting more than flames 
Girl you know your popping 
Expect the hate 
She took it upon her self I changed 
who said that we should stay say same 

Let's do Suttin out of the box 
Uno, liven up my day
Your the chocolate icing on my cake 
Turn around oh my dase 
I ain't got no type on paper 
Just make that you ride alll the way  
Suttin bout you makes man work harder 
cant jeopardize what we gained 

Im smooth like 
Im smooth like A 
Coco butter smooth 
She come out shower freshly shaved 
Juice freshly squeezed don't go back to your toxic ways 
put that stress & mobile down 
We outside for the whole dam day 

& Suttin bout you just turns man on
I'm smooth like 007 but they can't break our bond 
Your icon the only one I want 
They can't break our bond 
Do you know they can't break our bond?

Im smooth like James 
My new ting more than flames 
Girl you know your popping 
Expect the hate 
She took it upon her self I changed 
who said that we should stay say same 

I'm not half half Don't be alarmed 
Something about you makes me feel calm 
The past ain't Nuttin but past 
Essence 007 
Had a feeling she was heaven sent I can't leave that my bredrin 
I wanna learn from you not learn from you I hope you get it

You see how that girl just walked in Everyone clear the entrance convos reflective don't be too obsessive you wanna go to the states 
& live shit let's patterned our Esther's 
im so invested 
Your so interested 

& Suttin bout you just turns man on
I'm smooth like 007 but they can't break our bond 
Your icon the only one I want 
They can't break our bond 
Do you know they can't break our bond?
