		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountain, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains
Growing like the breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather round her
Mine is lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine
Teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice in the morning 
Now she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should've been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, Mountain Mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, country roads
