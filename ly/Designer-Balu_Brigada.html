		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yes, I wanna be your boy at the end of the day)
(I just wanna keep on saying your name)
(Kiss me if you mean all things that you say)
(I don't wanna keep on)

Writing love
It's rearranging on the page here once again (hey, hey)
Is that enough?
To paint emotions on a face until it ends (yeah, uh)
(Yeah) swimming in the sound
Swimming in the sound of love
I wouldn't let you down
But when I see you drowning
And when the world's coming down
And there's nobody left but us
You're the designer

Yes, I wanna be your boy at the end of the day (yeah)
I just wanna keep on saying your name
Kiss me if you mean all the things that you say (yeah)
I don't wanna keep on playing your games
Yes, I wanna be your boy at the end of the day (yeah)
Ain't about to let nobody get in the way
I don't really have much left to say
Baby, just keep on loving me like you do (yeah)
(Like you do, yeah)
Baby, just keep on loving me like you do (yeah)
(Like you do, yeah)
Baby, just keep on loving me like you do

Waking up
And I can feel the simulation start to fade
I'm tuning in
And not dropping out
'Cause I wanna see it when it's coming back around
Yeah, swimming in the sound
Swimming in the sound of love (yeah)
I wouldn't let you down
When I see you drowning (yeah)
And when the world's going down
And there's nobody left but us (yeah)
You're the designer

Yes, I wanna be your boy at the end of the day (yeah)
I just wanna keep on saying your name
Kiss me if you mean all the things that you say (yeah)
I don't wanna keep on playing your games
Yes, I wanna be your boy at the end of the day (yeah)
Ain't about to let nobody get in the way
I don't really have much left to say
Baby, just keep on loving me like you do 
(Yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Baby, just keep on loving me like you do (yeah)
(Like you do, yeah, yeah)

Baby, just keep on loving me like you do
(Like you do, yeah)
(Like you do)
(Baby, just keep on loving me like you do)
(Yeah, yeah)
Baby, just keep on loving me like you do
