		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who who
Twist yourself further from the middle of the floor
Throw a little kiss to the woman next door
Step on the gas put your hand in the air
Make a V-sign and you throw back your hair
Think about nothin' now you're nice and high
You're advocating love but you don't know why
Now you're getting vibrations all down to your feet
That's the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection beat

Put your hand on your hips
Now you let your backbone slip
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air
Make a V sign you just don't care
Now you feel free you gotta lose control
All Gods children got a little bit of soul
You don't have to think you don't have to move a muscle
To do the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection shuffle

Alright
Oh here we go again
Oh that's it you're doin' it
Alright

You Think about nothin' now you're nice and high
You're advocating love but you dont know why
You're getting vibrations all down to your feet
That's the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection beat

Here we go
Put your hand on your hip
You gotta let your backbone slip
Put out your tongue, put your hand in the air
Make a V sign like you just don't care
Now you feel free you gotta lose control

All Gods children got some soul
You don't have to think you don't have to move a muscle
To do the brow beating, heavy, leather, resurrection shuffle

You doin' alright
This is gonna last you for years and years and it alright
You doin' alright, don't get uptight
Uh-huh yea, that sounds alright, um-hum
Do do n do do do
