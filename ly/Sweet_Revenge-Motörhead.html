		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, victims!

I can almost taste it
It's the need to see you die
You thought you had it made
Well here's your final shock surprise
How do you like it
My unfaithful friend?
How do you like it?
How do you like my sweet revenge?
sweet revenge

Turn the key in the door
No one close to hear you scream
You'll never imagine the pain
Even in you're foulest dreams
How do you like that
Invitation friend?
How do you like that?
That's what I call my sweet revenge
sweet revenge
Sweet, sweet revenge

So sweet to see you
Writhe and crawl and scream for life
But I can't listen now
I'm too busy with the knife
I don't hear you laughing
My dismembered friend
I don't hear you laughing
You don't like my sweet revenge
sweet revenge
Ah, sweet revenge
Ah, sweet revenge
Revenge
Revenge, revenge, revenge
sweet revenge
Revenge
