		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put a spell on you, because you're mine
You better stop the thing that you're doin'
I said, "Watch out, I ain't lyin'", yeah
I ain't gonna take none of your, foolin' around
I ain't gonna take none of your, puttin' me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine, all right

I put a spell on you, because you're mine
You better stop, the thing that you're doin'
I said, "Watch out, I ain't lyin'", yeah
I ain't gonna take none of your, foolin' around
I ain't gonna take none of your, puttin' me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine, all right and I took it down
