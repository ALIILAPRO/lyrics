		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I'm gon' give you some instructions
That you can't be scared to try
I want you to touch it softly 
Like the way you do my mind
It got body and it's smooth to touch 
The same way as my skin
But don't you be scared 

To run your hands through my hair, baby
'Cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair, ooh, baby
Said, "don't you be scared"
So come run your hands through my hair

It's been way long overdue
Just like these inches down my back
Usually don't let people touch it
But tonight, you'll get a pass
Spend my dimes and spend my time 
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm

So run your hands through my hair, baby
'Cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair, oh, baby
Said, "don't you be scared"
So come run your hands through my hair

Know this ain't usually me
But I might let it down for ya (mmm)
This ain't usually me (usually me)
But I might let it down for ya

(So come run your hands through my hair, baby)
('Cause that's why it's there)
(So come run your hands through my hair, baby)
(Ooh, "don't you be scared")
(Come run your hands through my hair)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
