		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be afraid
Every time I face the waves
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to be afraid
I don't want to fear the storm
Just because I hear it roar
I don't want to fear the storm
I don't want to fear the storm

Peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
'Til I'm dancing in the deep
Peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks

I'm not gonna be afraid
'Cause these waves are only waves
I'm not gonna be afraid
No, I'm not gonna be afraid
And I'm not gonna fear the storm
You are greater than its roar
Oh, I'm not gonna fear the storm
No, I'm not gonna fear at all

Peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
'Til I'm dancing in the deep
Peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks

Peace, peace over me

You speak peace

Let faith rise up
O heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
Let faith rise up
O heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
Let faith rise up
O heart believe
Let faith rise up in me
Let faith rise up
O heart believe
Let faith rise up in me

Peace be still
Say the word and I will
Set my feet upon the sea
'Til I'm dancing in the deep
Peace be still
You are here so it is well
Even when my eyes can't see
I will trust the voice that speaks

Peace, peace over me
I hear You speaking 
Peace, peace over me

Peace over me
You speak peace
You speak peace
Over me
You speak peace
You speak peace
You speak peace
