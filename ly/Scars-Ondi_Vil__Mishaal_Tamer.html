		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thoughts in my head. Feelings of dread
Leaving me scared. I'm feeling embarrassed
I lay in my bed think about what I said
I cannot love it I just love what it gives
Pour up a cup  I might give up
Sippin on sizsurp I don't give a fuck
My emotions make me feel on the run
Young dumb kid I'm just trying to have fun
When I stay up I stay up til the sun
Drinking until i feel like my demons have won
Questioning shit you was never the one
Look at our past and see what we've become

Thoughts in my head. Feelings of dread
Leaving me scared. I'm feeling embarrassed
We lay in my bed think about what I said
I cannot love it I just love what it gives
Pour up a cup  I might give up
Sippin on sizsurp I don't give a fuck
My emotions make me feel on the run
Young dumb kid I'm just trying to have fun
When I stay up I stay up til the sun
Drinking until i feel like my demons have won
Questioning shit you was never the one
Look at our past and see what we've become
Riding this wave so much to say
How can I live when I'm trapped in my grave
I'm wanting to die yet you tell me be brave
How is it my thoughts have let me astray
You look in my eyes as I'm gasping for breath
You can see lies in the shape of my smile
A glimpse in my mind you'll see that it's vile
A moment of truth is I'm wishing for death
