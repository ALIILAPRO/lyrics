		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shut your mouth
cos i know
that you know
that I would fuck your mother
but what it is you don't know
Is I would fuck your brother too
He looks hot, with his stomach tattoos 
I'm Awake

Shut your mouth
cos i know
that you know
that I could fuck your sister
but what it is you don't know
is I could fuck your father too
He's masculine and sweet
and for him you are grateful
But I know he's not faithful

I spent 28 years
walking these streets 
so confused
too straight to be gay
and too gay to be straight
Now I'm awake

Shut your mouth
cos I know
that you know
and I know
now you know
that I'd like it
if anyone in your family
opens their mouth, but you

I'm Awake
Shut your mouth
