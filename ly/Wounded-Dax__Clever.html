		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  LexNour (yeah, yeah, yeah)
My eyes tell stories
I'll never accept (yeah) uh

Look inside my eyes, I'm wounded, wounded
Wounded they think I'm fine, but I
Can't do this, do this, do this
The pain deep inside my eyes tells
Stories that I can't recite
They think I'm fine, but I
Might lose it, lose it, lose it

I tried move on, I tried to replace
(Tried to replace) changed patterns
Stopped eatin' at our favorite place
(I stopped) i'm in a dangerous cycle
Of self-loathin' and hate (Stop it)
I wanna sleep
But when I do I fuckin' see yo' face
Relivin' past times is how I pass time
Oh, you say you sorry? Bitch
That's what you said the last time (Fuck)
I thought we were a fairy tale
The story ended (It did)
Then you sold it back to me and tried
To paint me as the bad guy
Don't try to act like you
Ain't take me granted
After months of taking care of you
Repairin' your damage i spent time, money
You were takin' advantage
And then you came up with some
Bullshit and you totally vanished, fuck
Just 'cause I'm a man that doesn't
Mean that I cannot cry (Huh)
And just because they love you doesn't
Mean that they will not lie (Facts)
People change and grow apart
I know we cut ties
But sometimes I still wonder how you did it
And I ask why

Look inside my eyes, I'm wounded, wounded
Wounded (Look inside my eyes, I'm wounded)
They think I'm fine, but I
Can't do this, do this, do this
(They think I'm fine, but I can't do this)
The pain deep inside my eyes
(My eyes) tells stories that
I can't recite (Recite)
They think I'm fine, but I might lose it
(Lose it) , lose it (Lose it) , lose it

Every knife is a sword fight
Every thought is a war
And every mirror holds reflection
Of a battle that I'm not winnin' anymore
I took that knife from my back and
I put that knife in my fist
And I took that knife from my fist and
I put that knife to my wrist
I ain't never been good at love but fuck it
I'll take a stab at it
Just got a bad habit of
Lettin' people close to me
That ain't suppose to be
But supposedly you changed
But I don't feel the same
And you should feel ashamed
But the truth still remains that I'm wounded
You think I'm fine but I can't do this, no

Look inside my eyes, I'm wounded, wounded
Wounded (Look inside my eyes, I'm wounded)
They think I'm fine, but I
Can't do this, do this, do this
(They think I'm fine, but I can't do this)
The pain deep inside my eyes
(My eyes) tells stories that
I can't recite (Recite)
They think I'm fine, but I might lose it
(Lose it) , lose it (Lose it) , lose it

(Look inside my eyes, I'm wounded)
(They think I'm fine, but I can't do this)
