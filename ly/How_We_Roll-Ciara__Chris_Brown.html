		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He say that I blow his mind every time I'm activated
You just tryna catch a vibe, CiCi got you fascinated 
Jump up in a brand new ride, BM-dub, we ridin', baby (Breezy)
I ain't gon' tell you lies (yeah)

That's just how we roll (you know what it is, what it is)
How we roll (you know what it is, what it is)
That's just how we roll (you know what it is, what it is)
How we roll (hey, baby, you know what it is, what it is)

Yeah, top off, summer in the wind
You look at me like that again, we make another kid
You my heart, I'm your rib
If I ever had to for you, I would do a bid
And I can tell that you're ready
Three, two, one, it's goin' down like confetti
Pour the ten to one shots again
If we film it on the phone, promise that we gonna trend

Ooh, don't kill the vibes, you know what I like, daddy
Ooh, it's on tonight, I'm talkin' on sight

That's just how we roll (you know what it is, what it is)
How we roll (you know what it is, like that, that, that)
That's just how we roll (ooh, yeah, you know what it is, what it is, yeah)
How we roll (you know what it is, like that, that, that, Breezy)

It's been a minute (yeah) since I been in it (yeah)
Swimmin' in it (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)
You should be livin' in it (yeah)
Keep your hands all over me, and never
Never worry (yeah), keep you cummin' (yeah)
That's how you love it (oh, baby)
Who cares if we in public? (No)
When it comes to you, I'm with whatever
You know I (I), I won't kill your vibe (no) 
I know what you like (on your mark, get, set)
Get ready

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's on tonight, I'm talkin' on sight (alright)

That's just how we roll (you know what it is, how it is, yeah, what it is, that's how we)
How we roll (roll, you know what it is, just like that, that, that)
That's just how we roll (roll, yeah, you know what it is) 
What it is, like that, that, that (that's how we)
How we roll (you know what it is, yeah, baby, like that, that, that)

Yeah, yeah
Baby, do that to me like that (that's how we roll, like that)
Know I like it when you do it like that (like that)
And baby, yeah, that's how we rollin' like that (like that, that's just how we roll)
Baby, yeah, that's how we do it like that, that, that
Oh, baby do that to me like that (come on, that's how we roll)

And baby, yeah, that's how we rollin' like that (that's just how we roll)
Yeah, I love just how we do it like that, that, that
Baby, do that to me like that (that's how we roll, sexy)

Baby, yeah, that's how we rollin' like that (that's just how we roll)
Baby, yeah, that's how we rollin' like that, that, that (do it, lick it)
Do that do me like that (trippin', let me kiss it)
Know I like it when you do it like that (eat that pussy in the kitchen)
And baby, yeah, that's how we rollin' like that (baby girl, can you feel it?)
Yeah, I love it how we do it like that, that, that (you gon' be gone for a minute)
That, that, that, that
