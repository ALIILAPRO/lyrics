		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at us
Ain't it funny
Is it just beginner's luck? maybe

Ooh, with just a touch
Two different people
From such different worlds apart
Has touched each other's hearts
Like candles in the dark
If it's time for us
We've gotta take it
Take the chance
The chance to make it now

Let the love begin
Let the light come shining in
Who knows where the road will lead us now
Look at what we've found
Make this moment turn our hearts around
It may never come again
Let it end
Let the love begin

Ooh, here we are
So close together
I can feel the fire start between us
We've come this far
Too far to stop it now
If this is meant to be (it's meant to be)
A chance for you and me (for you and me)
We found our destiny
Now we're lookin' at a new forever
Make this dream come true together 

Now, let the love begin
Let the light come shining in
Who knows where the road will lead us now
Look at what we've found
Make this moment turn our hearts around
It may never come again
Let it end
Let the love begin

Here we are
So close together
I can feel the fire start between us
Ooh we've come this far
Too far to stop it now
If this is meant to be (it's meant to be)
A chance for you and me (for you and me)
We found our destiny
Now we're lookin' at a new forever
Make this dream come true together

Now, let the love begin
Let the light come shining in
Who knows where the road will lead us now
Look at what we've found
Make this moment turn our hearts around
It may never come again (never come again)
Let it end
Let the love begin

I'll call you next week
No, tomorrow
