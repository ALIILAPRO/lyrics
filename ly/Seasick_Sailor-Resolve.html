		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many pages
Have been soiled with my laments
Now I’m building bridges
Between me and oblivion
This is not the way I wanna seal my fate
I won’t let myself sink into the depths
Don’t tell me not to worry, I know how it ends
Feeling seasick so i’m sailing to the shore
I weave across the monsters under water
They try to reach me, I can hear their growls
Trying my best to steer the ship through the storm
A lonely seasick sailor

Another push and I will reach the harbor

Could it be?
Could I be the one that they said was
Lost at sea
But I’m building my own saving raft
I’m done swimming against the stream
I’ll ride the wave until it brings me back
I’ve lost all of my certainties
I’ve lost it all
And now I’m bouncing back

I’ve learned to live without an end in sight

Swept along with the tide
Getting lost in the mist
Out of breath
In the middle of the seas

I’ve got this feeling, like I’ve been there before
Another push and I will reach the harbor

Could it be?
Could I be the one that they said was
Lost at sea
But I’m building my own saving raft
I’m done swimming against the stream
I’ll ride the wave until it brings me back
I’ve lost all of my certainties
I’ve lost it all

The salt taste on my lips
The fluid in my lungs
It has been so long

The splinters in my fingers
The dryness of my tongue
Bruised and battered
I keep pushing against the odds

I let the current carry me
The northern star will pave the way
Waiting for the day i will finally
Turn the tide and reach the firm ground

Sailing through the sea
Facing the hurricane
I’ve come all this way
Now I’ll break the waves
