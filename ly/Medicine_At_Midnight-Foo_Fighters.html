		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say a prayer, close the light, thumb upon a scale
The pillow is cold, that ship has sailed
Time has run the river dry, dry as a twisted trail
Into the bone, I'm into it

Ever get the feeling nothing else will do
I could hear you singing, painting her blue
Was the joke revealing, did you write your name?
On a dirty ceiling I can't explain

I need medicine at midnight
But it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight calling
But it ain't no cure
I may be sick but you know I'm yours

I remember dancing hard under the dead moon
Howling with you howling

Ever get the feeling nothing else will do
I could hear you singing
I can't explain

I need medicine at midnight
But it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight howling
But it ain't no cure
I may be sick but you know I'm yours

Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes

Medicine at midnight
But it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight howling
But it ain't no cure
I may be sick but you know I'm yours

Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
