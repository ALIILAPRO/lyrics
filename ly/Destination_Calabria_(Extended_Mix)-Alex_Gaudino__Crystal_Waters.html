		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Destination unknown!

I left my job, my boss, my car and my home
I'm leavin' for a destination I still don't know
Somewhere nobody must have beauties at all
And if you like us you can follow me
So let's go
Follow me and let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown

Now I won't feel those heavy shoulders no more
My life got better now I finally enjoy
Yes all the people wanna come here and so
Come on and join us, you can do that now
Let's go, follow me and let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown

Destination unknown

Destination unknown

Destination unknown
Follow me and let's go
Destination unknown
Follow me and let's go
Destination unknown
Follow me and let's go
To the place where we belong
And leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy
A destination unknown
