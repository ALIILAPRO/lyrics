Hey
(Off my, off my, off my, off my, off my, off my, off my)

I just really like how that feels

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

Off my face don't know where I am
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam

(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from Amsterdam)
(From Amsterdam, from Amsterdam, from)
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam (hey)

I just really like how that feels
Hey, hey, hey, hey (don't know, off my face, don't know, off my face)
Off my face don't where I am
'Cause I got my drugs from Amsterdam
Hey
