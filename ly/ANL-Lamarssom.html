		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open your eyes (baby)
Speak from your heart (Will you)
Not fantasize
Learn to disguise
Will you take me in
I'm starving
Hearts turn cold
I'm nervous
Will you hold me down
Will you hold me down (yeah)
I can be the one you run too
I could be your safe heaven
Give you dick on the side
Snatch your soul with the tide
All night long
All night long
I know you nervous
Cos you got a man
And you're not used to this
Booty bodacious, entering my eyes
6 inch niggas, they can't be your type
I know you ain't never been with a 9
I just wanna say what's on my mind
Don't talk bout your man
He cannot withstand
What's on your body
Your precious body
Don't talk bout your man
He cannot withstand
What's on your body
Your precious body
Open your eyes (baby)
Speak from your heart (Will you)
Not fantasize
Learn to disguise
Will you take me in
I'm starving
Hearts turn cold
I'm nervous
Will you hold me down
Will you hold me down (yeah)
I can be the one you run too
I could be your safe heaven
Give you dick on the side
Snatch your soul with the tide
All night long
All night long
