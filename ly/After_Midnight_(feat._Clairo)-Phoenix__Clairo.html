		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere to go
Many years ago
Would you allow? Could you allow?
That's what they're like
Uh, did you look? Did you look?
Heavenly, heavenly sort of sounds adolescent
Well, I told you not, not to look from the start
When the sun is almost gone, it's way too much

Enough said, enough sense, it's unconventional
When the sun is almost gone, it's not enough
Suddenly, finally, without a yell, I'll listen
Ooh, that's what we're like in broad daylight
Ooh, soon, you'll realize it's after midnight

My memories, souvenirs, some originals
High up in the rows
Idolized, canonized
That morning rise
I told you not, I told you not
No veneer behind the mirror, did you call from a distance?
Well, I told you not, not to look from this side
When the sun is almost gone, it's way too much

Enough said, enough sense, it's unconventional
When the sun is almost gone, it's not enough
Suddenly, finally, without a yell, I'll listen
Ooh, that's what we're like in broad daylight
Ooh, soon, you'll realize it's after midnight

Listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, listen
Listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, it's illicit
Listen, listen, listen

Ooh, that's what we're like in broad daylight
Ooh, soon, you'll realize it's after midnight
