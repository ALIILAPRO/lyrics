		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sugar man, won't you hurry?
'Cause I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin, won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams?

Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man met a false friend
On a lonely dusty road
Lost my heart when I found it
It had turned to dead black coal

Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man, you're the answer
That makes my questions disappear
Sugar man, 'cause I'm weary
Of those double games I hear

Sugar man, sugar man, sugar man, sugar man
Sugar man, sugar man, sugar man

Sugar man, won't you hurry?
'Cause I'm tired of these scenes
For a blue coin, won't you bring back
All those colors to my dreams?

Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man met a false friend
On a lonely dusty road
Lost my heart when I found it
It had turned to dead black coal

Silver magic ships you carry
Jumpers, coke, sweet Mary Jane

Sugar man, you're the answer
That makes my questions disappear
