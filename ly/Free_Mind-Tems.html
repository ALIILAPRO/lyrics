		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, body
Yeah, yeah, my mind
Yeah, yeah, my mind

I said five in the morning
I wake up to fight for my earnings
Fear in my mind is a warning
Pray to the one you rely in

I've been wandering all day
I try to be fine but I can't be
The noise in my mind wouldn't leave me
I try to get by but I'm burning

And behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane

My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take me out
Tell you what I need right here

I really need I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need to free my mind now

I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need mine now, ohh yeah (yeah, yeah)

This is the peace that you cannot buy
Send me a love that you cannot mix
One is the joy that you cannot waste
The other one price that you cannot fix (cannot fix)

This is the peace that you cannot buy
Finding the way, when you cannot see
Man will desist if he cannot pray
I need to find release

But behind my mind it runs
All these thoughts of troubling
Fighting to give up my pain
Fighting to be on my lane

My mind running to the other side
When it's time to live my life
Then it tries to take me out
Tell you what I need right here

I really need, I really need mine now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need to free my mind now

I really need, I really need time now
I really need, I need a free mind now
I really need, I really need time now, ohh yeah (yeah, yeah)

So set me free
Freer than the open mind
Farther than the eyes can handle
Freer than the ocean now
Yeah, yeah

So set me free (oh-oh)
Now I need to find release
Set me to the open sky
Now I need to free my mind, yeah
Yeah

Boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
Boom-boom, boom-boom-boom
Ayy, yeah, mmh
Yeah, oh no, mmh

I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep
I might be falling deep

Tell me now what you need
I've been going to God
When I'm all in my mind
I might be falling deep

Falling deep

I might be falling
I might be falling
I might be falling
I might be falling, yeah
