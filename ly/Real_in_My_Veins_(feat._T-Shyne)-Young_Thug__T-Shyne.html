		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell them pussy niggas take a look at what they done created
Ooh, Mario

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVS's in my chains
Remain the same, don't change up, no name
And most these niggas change up for change

I'm just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what they created
Tell the whole circle look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commanding war, make somebody bleed
Now I ain't worry 'bout you, gettin' past these fuckin' bouncers
Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I'm gettin' fuckin' faded
Call your momma Thugger, tell her that you fuckin' made it

Came from the ground to the top, uh
I'm 'bout to rob you some rocks, uh
I'm 'bout to set up a shop, uh
I'm 'bout to buy back the block, uh
I got respect for the 'Wop, uh
First nigga gave me a knot, uh
I put some keys in the pot, uh
She got Versace on her crotch, uh
It's purple, but this is not Watson, uh
I make that bitch squirt, it's a thot, uh
I turn a lil' bitch to a lot, uh
My watch on the floor, need a mop, uh
Rob Jack if he come out the box, uh
I got a tail on, it's a fox, uh
I'm banging that fire, fox, uh
My bitch get wild, uh
Bloody cross on like a pastor
Cooking fish scale with no batter-er-er-er
Chains on me like Jerry Springer beezy
I repent for my sins everyday

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVS's in my chains
Remain the same, don't change up, no name
Most these niggas change up for change

You keep playin' and you get knocked off
I hate to say it but I'm ready for the pop off
Got lil' mama outta drum talkin' top throat
She said she ready, let's get it I got combos
I'm talkin' junk food, eat me up like mumbos
Beat it up, got me hoppin' off the top rope
Beat it up, got me slidin' off the sliding board
Leave it stuck, man lil' shawty ain't cleaned out tho'
I got my money up and I heard that you want some
Nigga moon walkin', Michael Jackson moves
I got latitude, I got gratitude
And if you look up at the moon, you'll see my attitude

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVS's in my chains
Remain the same, don't change up, no name
Most these niggas change up for change

I'm just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what they done creating
Tell the whole circle look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commandin' war, made somebody bleed
Now I ain't worry 'bout you gettin' past these fuckin' bouncers
Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I'm gettin' fuckin' faded
Call your momma Thugger, tell her that you fuckin' made it

Yeah
I got real runnin' through my veins
I heard they tryna find us out in Vegas
Different frames, I got fifty shades
I called my dad and told him that we made it
Lately, I've been riding in that Ghost
So much stress, they thinking that I'm gon' overdose
You talk shit, and you get comatose
All this money, we gon' need a moat
My bitch is bad, so designer, she gon' need it
C at the bottom of her feet like she Jesus (Chanel)
Pussy wetter, so I'm seasick
And we done made it out the struggle, best believe it
Aye

I got real runnin' through my veins
I put VVS's in my chains
Remain the same, don't change up, no name
Most these niggas change up for change

I'm just sayin' tell them pussy niggas take a look at what they done creating
Tell the whole circle look at what they done created
Tell the cops they gon' start chaos if they raid it
Commandin' war, made somebody bleed
Now I ain't worry 'bout you gettin' past these fuckin' bouncers
Tell the critics that they talkin' 'bout the fuckin' founder
Tell Scott I'm on the way, I'm gettin' fuckin' faded
Call your momma Thugger, tell her that you fuckin' made it
