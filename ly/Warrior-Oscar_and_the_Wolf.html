		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me
Baby, I'm a soldier
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me

They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me
They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me

They say that I'm gonna be a star one day
If I just dedicate my life to the game
I aim for the sky and I walk through fire
If you give me one shot, I'ma take it
If you give me two more shots, I'ma make it
I'm gonna destroy this, I'm gonna own this
You better catch me if you can

You better catch me if you can
If I fall, I'm gonna rise
Like a phoenix I'll fly

They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me
They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me

They say everybody will remember my name
I reach for the stars, into the hall of fame
My only desire, I'll walk through fire
If you give me one shot, I'ma take it
If you give me two more shots, I'ma make it
I'm gonna destroy this, I'm gonna own this
You better catch me if you can

You better catch me if you can
If I fall, I'm gonna rise
Like a phoenix I'll fly

They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me
They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me

Baby, I'm a
They say that I'm a
They say that I'm a
They say that I'm a

They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me
They say that I'm a warrior
So what you say about me?
Baby, I'm a champion
No matter what you say about me
