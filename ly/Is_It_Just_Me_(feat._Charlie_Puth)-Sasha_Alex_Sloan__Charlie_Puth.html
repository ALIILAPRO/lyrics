		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it just me? (Ooh)
Is it just me?

I hate holding babies
And people tryna save me
Think religion is a business
Where you pay for God's forgiveness
Modern art is boring
Politicians are annoying
I don't think love lasts forever
And old music was better

Am I just high or am I kinda right?

Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel
They're just not being real
Tell me is it just me or is anybody
Thinkin' all the same shit?
They're just not sayin' it
Or is it just me?

(Is it just me?)
Is it just me?
(Is it just me?)

Weddings are outdated
The show "Friends" was overrated
I think rich kids have it easy
And PDA is creepy
The internet's obnoxious
People my age make me nauseous
I think marijuana's classy
And doing coke is trashy

Am I just high or am I kinda right? (Kinda right)

Is it just me or does anybody
Feel the way that I feel
They're just not being real
Tell me is it just me or is anybody
Thinkin' the all same shit? (All the same shit)
They're just not sayin' it (just not sayin' it)
Or is it just me?

(Is it just me?)
Is it just me?
(Is it just me?)

Should probably bite my tongue, but
Can't be the only one, yeah
Should probably bite my tongue, but
Can't be the only one
