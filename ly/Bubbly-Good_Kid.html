		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came in a bit before the opening set
I took the bet, I know the rest
It's good I guess

The cavern is a crowd around
And I can scarce get by
On second breath between the press

Now it's 1AM And I don't know how I'll get home
The way is barely paved

I can't keep my eyes From closing 
In between each rest, but I'm
Not going to cave

I guess I made it
Yeah, I said that I
I'll come along this time but when I try
I get the feeling I someday will die
And I'm not going to care

I never sleep, I never eat
I never leave my house alone
Another evening in between
What I believe and what I know
And what I know

I'm sitting on the 501
A moment's rest, a glacial pace
I won't lose faith

Maybe if I stay or ran the rest to prove myself
I'd still save face

Now we're on our way before I quit at half past nine
Can't get out of this and now I've lost that little time

I guess I'll make it
Yeah, I said that I
I'll come along this time but when I try
I get the feeling I someday will die
And I'm not going to care

I never sleep, I never eat
I never leave my house alone
Another evening in between
What I believe and what I know

I never sleep, I never eat
I never leave my house alone
Another evening in between
What I believe and what I know
And what I know

So I walked out the back before the second set
Settled my debt, I'll miss the rest
That's fine I guess
The cavern is a crowd around
And I could scarce get by
On second breath between the press

Now it's 3AM and I don't know how I'll get home
The way is barely paved

I can't keep my eyes from closing
So I'll hit replay
