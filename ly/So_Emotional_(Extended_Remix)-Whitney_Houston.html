		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why I like it
I just do

Ooh-ooh, ooh

I've been hearing your heartbeat inside of me
I keep your photograph beside my bed
Livin' in a world of fantasies
I can't get you out of my head
I've been waiting for the phone to ring all night
Why you wanna make me feel so good
I got a love of my own, baby
I shouldn't get so hung up on you

I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Oh, I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

I gotta watch you walk in the room, baby
I gotta watch you walk out
I like the animal way you move
And when you talk
I just watch your mouth

Oh, I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much

Oh, I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do
Ain't it shocking what love can do

See I remember the way that we touch
I wish I didn't like it so much
No no no, I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional
I get so emotional, baby
Shocking what love can do
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
Ain't it shocking what love can do
I get so emotional, baby
Every time I think of you
I get so emotional, baby
