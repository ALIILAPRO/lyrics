		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I must have met him yesterday
He waltzed in from the outskirts of east L.A
Seems to be the name on everybody's lips
So I told myself I wouldn't fall for it
But then

Quicker than a flash, he had me at hello
He took me by the hand, we started dancing slow
Didn't wanna get attached but now, I'm far too close
And he knows just what he's doing

I didn't know, when I met Valentino
I was giving him control over me
Now I'm stuck in his melody
Let me go, let me go Valentino
You're not getting anymore out of me
I don't want your cruel melody

He knew what to say to sweep me off my feet (Ah)
I should've never heard a word he said to me
I was comfortable with ignorance is bliss (Ah)
'Cause I told myself I wouldn't fall for it (Fall for it)
But then

Quicker than a flash, he had me at hello
He took me by the hand, we started dancing slow
Didn't wanna get attached but now, I'm far too close
And he knows just what he's doing

I didn't know
I didn't know when I met Valentino
I was giving him control over me
Now I'm stuck in his melody
Let me go, let me go Valentino
You're not getting anymore out of me
I don't want your cruel melody (Don't want it, oh)
I don't want your cruel melody, oh, no
Oh no, no, ooh yeah (Don't want it)
Ooh, oh, oh (Don't want it)
Yeah, yeah

I should have known not to trust Valentino
I should have known not to trust Valentino
Tonight I'm saying goodbye Valentino
We know just what you're doing

I didn't know when I met Valentino
I was giving him control over me
Now I'm stuck in his melody
Let me go, let me go Valentino (Let me go Valentino)
You're not getting anymore out of me
I don't want your cruel melody (I don't want)
I should have known not to trust Valentino
I should have known not to trust Valentino
Go, let me go Valentino
You're not getting anymore out of me
I don't want your cruel melody
