		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Melo)
(You see Kamale, straight away, yeah)
Uh, look, what the fuck you got that blixky chain on, nigga?
Take it off nigga (look, look)

All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (Traphouse Mob,flexin')
I did fifteen on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big Louboutin when I'm steppin' (steppin')
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
Woo, woo
All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (flexin')
I did fifteen on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)

We gon' hit him and finish him, nobody innocent
If you ain't dead, better lay down (lay down)
All the judge give us sentences, free all my menaces
All on the island like, "What now?" (What the fuck is up, nigga?)
Flossy the jungle where niggas gon' rumble
I aim at your head, we don't spray ground
We gon' shoot one or two, we gon' boom up the room
Back out the chop, we go spray rounds (grrt)
See that .40 on me, roll a forty clip
I bet I make his ass do forty flips (forty flips)
Sheff G, sauce him up
Sheff G told me, "Sauce him up" (sauce that nigga)
Woo
Fuck KiKi
Tell Shanie he can suck a dick (bah, bah)
Bullets leavin' him sleepy like Hallow
One in the head if a nigga wan' follow (yeah)
Niggas only respect you because your brother (uh)
Double-punched you and you called your mother (uh, uh)
That's what brothers do for one another (uh, uh, uh)
That's the only reason I ain't put you under
That double G'll make a nigga cry (cry)
Smokin' big KiKi 'til a nigga high (bye, bye)
I can't trust a bitch 'cause these bitches lie (never)
And that's how a couple my niggas died
Yeah, I'm big 092, woo
I posted on the lanes, I be flossin' (Woo)
Bentley truck when I'm slidin', my bitches exotic 
My hands off the wheel when I'm parking (parking)
Jamos told me get the cash
Amiri the denims, don't ask what it cost though (go get that cash, nigga)
He get nailed to the cross if he SRK
Let's talk about it if you feel a way (grrt)
Nigga everything K
Big 24, don't call me bluff (bah)
Kick down the door (bah)
Big 092, show no remorse
Buyin' designer, all in the stores
Can't get you out, bitch, you a whore
For my lil' guy
D'usse on the floor (uh)
I make a call, bitch, and it's war (War)
Two liter Sprite (Sprite), I pour a four
Pull up TD, I got ten in my jeans (uh)
Pop out with me, was on TV (yeah, yeah)
Patek Phillipe, Givenchy tee (uh)
I need a mil', been in these streets (that's a fact)
Know that I'm Floss, come to the East (uh)
L-O-A-B, screamin', "Free Ree!" (Free Ree)
Shooters in plaza, stay with the sleaze
Or I call up Ape, free Melly Gz (free Melly Gz, nigga)

All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (Traphouse Mob, flexin')
I did fifteen on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big Louboutin when I'm steppin' (steppin')
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
Woo, woo
All the opp niggas know I be flexin' (flexin')
I did fifteen on my check-ins (check-ins)
Big .38 for the weapon (weapon)
