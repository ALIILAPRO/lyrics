		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you are so beautiful

It used to be, you and me
Love like no other
Our world around, could fall apart
But we had each other
Saw you walking, you were smiling
And it hit me like the first time
Feels like yesterday, has come and gone
But nothing's changed, when I look at you

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
You're my eyes
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

Still hurts sometimes
Love on the line
But we said forever, yeah
Sailing on, through the storms
But we had together
And now I
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
And now I
I just want you to know
That after all this time
You're still the one

You, you are so beautiful
You, you are so beautiful
