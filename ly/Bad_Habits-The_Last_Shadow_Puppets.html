		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah
Bad habits
Sick puppy
Thigh high
Knee deep

Do you wanna hold hands?
Should we get back down?
She wanna slow dance?

Should've known, little girl that you'd do me wrong
Should've known by the way you were showing off

Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ah

Deep trouble
Red lollipop, ah
Pale faces
Oh right
Delicious, ah

Do you wanna hold hands?
Should we get back down?
She wanna slow dance?

Woah, oh
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ah

Ah, ah
Should've known, little girl that you'd do me wrong
Should've known by the way you were showing off
Should've known, little girl that you'd do me wrong
Should've known by the way you were showing off
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ah
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits, ooh
Bad habits, yeah
Bad habits
