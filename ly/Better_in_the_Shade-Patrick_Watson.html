		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it was supposed to be so right
I'd be sitting on your bed like I did last night
If it was supposed to be so real
It'd be drunk in the way
That the night makes you feel

If it was supposed to be so right
If it was supposed to be so real
Oh, won't you count? Ooh
Won't you come in?
Ooh, ooh

Whatever follows you in the dark
Whatever follows you in the dark
Whatever follows you in the dark
Let it carry, let it carry
Let it carry you
Somewhere between your rights and wrongs
Ain't there a little bit of space
We could sing all along?

If it was supposed to be so right
If it was supposed to be so real
Oh, won't you count? Ooh
Now, won't you count me in? Ooh
Now, won't you count me in?

It's seven o'clock and
It's just about to get too dark
And you're still playing in the park
You're just sitting there in the shade, ooh

If it was supposed to be so real
Oh, won't you count, count me in?
It was supposed to be so right
Oh, won't you count, count me in?
