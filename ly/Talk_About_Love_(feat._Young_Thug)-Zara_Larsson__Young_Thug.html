		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patience is a virtue, I ain't tryna hurt you
I need you to read between the lines
Calling me out and it's unfair (so unfair)
Told you I don't wanna go there
Swear that I can taste it, all your expectations
Rising up, I push 'em to the side
You know I'm down to go anywhere
But told you, I don't wanna go there
I think you feel good, yeah, I think you're so sweet
But you're taking this all too seriously
You can get close, but I won't, babe
Baby, look into my eyes

I don't wanna talk about love
I don't wanna talk about love
I just wanna keep us right here in the moment
Why you gotta go get lost in emotion?
I don't wanna talk about love
I don't wanna talk about love
I can make your dreams come true overnight, yeah
I'll do anything that you like
But I won't talk about love

I don't wanna talk about love
I don't got time to be lying like a rug
Hot as Taki, Kawasaki, I ride it, ride it
Anaconda, yeah, baby, put your hand in my pocket
I ain't got time to be lying out at no doorway
Shawty, this the way she tryna drown me, I might float away
Can you please tell me I'm in control today?
Sugar for the day, icy like the Eiffel tower, babe, yeah
Why you wanna talk about it all the time?
Keep it up over there, you gon' be mine
I see the way you vibin', keep me hypnotized and
Diamonds loud like sirens, oh

I don't wanna talk about love
(I don't wanna talk about love)
I don't wanna talk about love
I just wanna keep us right here in the moment
Why you gotta go get lost in emotion?
I don't wanna talk about love
(I don't wanna talk about love)
I don't wanna talk about love (oh no)
I can make your dreams come true overnight, yeah
I'll do anything that you like
But I won't talk about love

'Cause love always blows up in your face
And love always goes south in the worst ways
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah
But right now I'm blind in the headspace
And this ain't the time or place to bring it up to me
'Cause honestly, I'll walk away

I don't wanna talk about love
(I don't wanna talk about love)
I don't wanna talk about love
(I don't wanna talk about love)
I just wanna keep us right here in the moment (keep us right here, yeah)
Why you gotta go get lost in emotion?
I don't wanna talk about love
(I don't wanna talk about love)
I don't wanna talk about love
(I don't wanna talk about love)
I can make your dreams come true overnight, yeah
I'll do anything that you like
But I won't talk about love
I don't talk about love (I don't wanna)
I don't talk about love (don't wanna talk about love)
I can make your dreams come true overnight, yeah
I'll do anything that you like
But I won't talk about love
