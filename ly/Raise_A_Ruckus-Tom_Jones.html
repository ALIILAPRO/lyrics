		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love my wife, I love my baby
I love that biscuit dipping in gravy
Save me the hambone, give me the gravy
I love my biscuit's sopped in gravy

Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

Now when I die, won't you bury me deep
Put molasses on my head, on my feet
Put them flapjacks in my hand
All the way to the promised land

Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

Come along, children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
And raise a ruckus tonight!

Now some folk say that
The preacher don't steal
Well, I caught one in my corn-field
One had a bushel, one had a peck
One had a rooster around his neck

Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

Why don't you raise a ruckus tonight?
Come on and raise the ruckus tonight!
