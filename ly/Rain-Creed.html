		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you help me out
Can you lend me a hand
It's safe to say
That I'm stuck again

Trapped between this life
And the light
I just cant figure out
How to make it right

A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more
Something more

I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
With every tomorrow comes another life

I feel it's gonna rain
For days and days

I feel it's gonna rain

I've tried to figure out
I can't understand
What it means
To be whole again
Trapped between the truth
And the consequence
Nothing's real
Nothing's making sense

A thousand times before
I've wondered if there's something more
Something more

I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
So let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine
I feel it's gonna rain like this, rain like this, rain like this

Fall down
Wash away my yesterdays
Fall down
So let the rain fall down on me

I feel it's gonna rain like this for days
Let it rain down and wash everything away
I hope that tomorrow the sun will shine

I feel it's gonna rain like this, rain like this (so let the rain fall down)
I feel it's gonna rain like this, rain like this (so let the rain fall down)
I feel it's gonna rain like this

I feel it's gonna rain
