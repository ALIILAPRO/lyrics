		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh little critter
You've got me close to
I'll drive you crazy
Stepped out of line
I'll step right over
How you've made me
You could be free
But you're caught up
Trying to believe there is more
If you could see
What you're locked in
You would be free
As a bird
I like this cage you've made me
I drink from my spout
What little goes in well
It must come out
I'm held in captive
I feed from the drought
I cannot disobey so
I'll stay devout (you could be)
Free
But you're caught up
Trying to believe there is more
If you could see
What you're locked in
You would be free
As a bird
You could be free
But you're caught up
Trying to believe there is more
If you could see
What you're locked in
You would be free
As a bird
You could be free
You could be free
