		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one
Nowhere
Nobody thought you would run away
Be one
So What
No one ever, ever
No one
Feel it
Already know what I don't bring home
I let a woman know-
I need the weight of another one
Oh I love you so, told you then I'll tell you it forever 
Oh away you go, baby the one who lit the flame from the coal
Oh let a neighbor know, cannot find the right word
Down on another way
Need it, so what, no one ever lied
(how would I be so mean)
But you remember that
You're greatest hope's to be desired
Oh I love you so, baby that's the way I know
Oh this plan is gone, and you're away from the money
Oh I'm afraid you're lost, fold it down, fire in the belly.
Oh I love you so, you're the boy and I'm the body
It was a worthless call, that was just another way to Canada.
And everyone you know, oh they love you like nobody.
Oh that's a worthless law, tell me yes and fall into the water.
