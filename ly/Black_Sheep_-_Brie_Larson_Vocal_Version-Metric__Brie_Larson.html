		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Hello again, friend of a friend, I knew you when
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again

Send you my love on a wire
Lit you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh
From you

Got balls of steel, got an automobile, for a minimum wage
Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outer space
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick the past again

Send you my love on a wire
Lit you up, every time, everyone, ooh, pulls away, ooh
It's a mechanical bull, at number one
You'll take a ride from anyone
Everyone wants a ride, pulls away, ooh, from you
