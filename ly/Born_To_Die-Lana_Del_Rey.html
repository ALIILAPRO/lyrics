		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why? (Got that?)
Who, me? (Louder)
Why? (Got that?)

Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on the Friday nights
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine? 
It's like I told you, honey (louder)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough 
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane, so (louder)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tryna take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey (louder)

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough 
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane, so (louder)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane

So, don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough 
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep making me laugh
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane, so (louder)
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die 

(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
We were born to die

(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
Why? (Got that?)
Who, me? (Louder)
(We were born to die, we were born to die, we were born to die)
Why? (Got that?)

(We were born to die)
(Louder)
(Got that?)
(Louder)
