		  Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

Yo, yo (ooh yeah)
Let me explain this to you
See I'm not gonna let you run me
How we're gonna do it is
I'm gonna run you

You, you've got a lot of nerve
I guess you haven't heard
I'm doin' fine out here on my own
You, you think that you can come
Around here for some fun
But boy you've got a lot to learn

Don't shake your head from side to side
Saying that you've changed enough
That you see the light
'Cause you just say what you say
And want your way
And it's that game that you play
It's a little late

As if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So see you 'round, wave goodbye
Be a bird pass me by
As if 
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love back in my life
Not tonight, get a grip
Baby as if

Come on (oh, oh) come on
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
(Oh, oh)

You seem to think that I (I)
Ain't got no sense of pride (Pride)
Well boy you got a weird perception now (Yo)
Of what it is to love (Love)
And I am sure because (Because)
You got the look of desperation

Don't shake your head from left to right
Saying that you will when you won't ever see the light
And you just say what you say and want your way
And it's that game that you play
It's a little late

As if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So see you 'round, wave goodbye
Be a bird pass me by
As if 
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love back in my life
Not tonight, catch my drift
Baby as if

{Oh, oh, oh, oh}
You gotta go, you gotta go bye-bye
{Oh, oh, oh, oh}
As if
(Never gonna take you back, whoo!)

I, I got places to go (Go)
With people you don't know (You don't know 'em)
We're gonna dance all nice and slow (Ha, ha, ha)

Don't shake your head from left to right
Saying that you've changed and now you're on my side
'Cause you know you just want some lucky charm
And it's that game that you play
So I'm moving on

As if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So be a dear, disappear
Maybe I'm not being clear
As if 
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love back in my life
Not tonight, get a grip
Baby as if

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
No, no, no
As if
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if
I'm ever gonna take you back
As if
It's ever gonna come to that
So see you 'round, wave goodbye
Be a bird pass me by
As if 
I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let your love back in my life
Not tonight, get a grip
Baby as if

I'm gonna let you break my heart again
As if I'm gonna let you try and be my friend
It's the end, take the hint
Baby as if
(He, he, he)
