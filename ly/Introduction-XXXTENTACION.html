		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it was just like
Like I was just a kid of confusion, confusion, thrown into disarray
It's like I really wanna amount to something great
I ain't tryna, like, I ain't tryna, but I'm, in the same sense
I'm tryna go there off energy, I'm tryna go there off effort
I'm not tryna go there off, off hardships and all that bullshit, bro
I felt hardships, I'm tired of that shit, I'm good, bro
I'm tryna, I'm tryna tell the world to fucking relax, bro
Relax, let me be me, let me be my, let me a prince, let me be a king, nigga
Off the sense of my mind, 'cause nigga, my mind is different, you feel me?
I'm not with that torturin' shit, bro, I'm not with that, bro
To be appreciated and to be loved, bro
Let a nigga assert himself, bro
Let a nigga be who he wanna be
If I make my mistakes, if I make my mistakes along the road
Then that's my fault, you feel me?
But I know, I know I be feelin', it's somethin' watchin'
There's something watchin', I know
