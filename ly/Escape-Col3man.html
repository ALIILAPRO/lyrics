		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You brought me up
Gave me all the lift that I need
You showed me how 
To escape from reality

Some people find a vein
Of gold in their brain
And mine until death
I complain and spite them in vain
Cause their life I obsess

And I could be alright but
I’m stuck in this hell
Trying to find a way out
Is like climbing a well
But you

You brought me up 
Gave me all the lift that I need
You showed me how
To escape from reality

Why do I get this pain
When anxiety bangs
Right on my chest
When life’s a mess
Ridden with stress
It’s hard to let go

And I could be alright but
I’m stuck in this hell
Trying to find a way out
Is like climbing a well
But you

You brought me up 
Gave me all the lift that I need
You showed me how
To escape from reality

And I could be alright but
I’m stuck in this hell
Trying to find a way out
Is like climbing a well
But you
