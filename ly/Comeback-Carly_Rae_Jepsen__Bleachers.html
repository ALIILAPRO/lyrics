		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a war with myself
We go back to my place
Take my makeup off
Show you my best disguise
You believe in my heart
You believe in my kind
It's a tragedy boy
Every time you ask me

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me

I'm at peace in the dark
When I know that you're near
Hear the breath of your heart
Singing me a lullaby
All those travelin' years
Till we said our goodbye
And I show up to your place
You don't even ask me why

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me

And if you wanna know why I have had no regrets
Sometimes you've gotta dig low to get 'round to it
And there is nothing I'm so sure of
Nothing I'm so sure of
If you wanna know why I have no regrets then

Come with me, I'm the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper
Come baby, dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I'm the keeper man
And I am the keeper

And I am the keeper

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' 'bout makin' a comeback
Back to me

I don't know what I'm feelin', but I believe
I was thinkin' that maybe you'll come back
Back to me
And I won't say you're the reason I was on my knees
But I'm thinkin' that maybe you'll come back
Come back to me

Come with me, I'm the keeper of that beat
And the fire under your feet
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper
Come baby, dance the night down on your knees
Dance your heart down onto your sleeve
I'm the keeper man
I am the keeper
