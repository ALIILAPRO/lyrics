		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, shut the fuck up before
We blast your ass too, shut the fuck up
Hey, homie, you need some help, uh?

Foenem gon' pull up and load
It, then go bang
Now you and yo' body get broken
Bust out the MAC til' it's smoking
We posted outside of your
Crib like we scopin'
Only backwoods I be rollin', don't
Roll with no goofies, my niggas all goin'
And If I shoot it, I'm scoring
That bitch finna blow through
My semi be hoeing

Yeah, we planning that lick
C is gon' follow the man to his crib
He droppin' them chips, I pull out the stick
Ain't doing that race
I'm beating that case
Catching a Drake on the day Tuesday
Plotting a lick, AK Payday
Nigga, he screaming "Mayday, Mayday"
Nigga, he screaming "Mayday, Mayday"
Yo' hoe wanna fuck on the PC
She don't ask questions
But that bitch she please me
The popo will pull up and freeze me
Watch me throw bullets like my name RG3
A crow but I'm toting a D-E
Get you that SK and shit you can teach me
I'm after the dope like X Y Z
Location off, 'cause the cops tryna find me

Now I'm just run in the liquor store
Droppin' the 40, I up the pole
Nigga, they duckin', they get on the floor
Say you a rapper, I chopped out the flow
Nigga, they talkin' with good shit
Keeping them hollows in my clip
Strap on my waist like a sidekick
Nigga, I go Columbine, bitch
Touche how I come with that data
The head is splattered
Soul is gone like the matter
I plot the planning, 30 out of that xanna
Police is scanning
But their system ain't overload
Conformation, that's that 187
Then money chasing til' I come out that bank
And I roll the stank, scoping out for a stain
And I run the pockets
Then I'm hopping that gate

Aye, I fuck on that bitch, she from Paris
She holding my cash like a heiress
A nigga pull up, get embarrassed
I'm shooting at will but no Ferrell
I'm shooting that whip with no
A nigga get stuck like an arrow
Totin' it smooth like I'm Arrow
Tell that bitch suck on my barrel
I'm bustin' them hollows, they narrow
The bullet went right through the marrow
Got work on the boat like Jack Sparrow
Countin' up all this dinero
I want a lot of them zeros
He wearing too many layers, I'ma tear those
My choppa go dumb like Lil Darryl
That 187 stand tall like a scarecrow

Walk in, now I'm getting the 40's
, yea, I'm tuckin' the 40's the homies
Yeah we plotting a heist
Out in the night, hit the plug
It's on sight walk in like Dark Knight with
That bitch on my right
I talk bout that pipe and that hoe on my side
You on her bio, bitch, she on my line, I
Don't know what that mean, but to me
Shit is fine
Niggas always hatin', hop off dick
She ain't sucking, she get dropped off quick
Think we lovin', must've lost her shit
Bitch smack you with the Mossberg clip
Tell her friends I got big dick
Run out house, yeah, that's big lick
Talkin' shit, get dropped, moshpit
Jump the fence, not catching the
She taken, I give no fuck
I notice her phone blowing up
Wait, pull off, diggin my nut
I skrrt off when he pull up
One nighter 'cuz I have no trust
If I do it twice, she might fall in love
CÃ¡llate puta 'cuz you talk too much
Nueve, nigga, my nina gon' bust
