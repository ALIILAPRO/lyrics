		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Light me up like Christmas, be a first hand witness
To all the nights I swore that I'd miss
Staring at my phone 
Heading home alone 

You get my stupid jokes, gotta keep you close 
Blood oaths from a bloody nose 
On the hemlines of our clothes 
Come on babe, let's get you home

cnd I hate to leave a party before someone shuts it down, 
But where's the fun if you're not gonna stick around?

Cash in all my favors, make me wake the neighbors, 
Take me now while you have any takers 
With something left to take
It's crazy, but it wouldn't be insane 

â€˜Cause you might be the biker to my lost hitch-hiker 
cnd I am betting that you could take me higher 
When I hit the ground 
Some way, somehow 

cnd I know I said that I would die before I settle down 
But Jesus Christ, its just nice when you're around 

cnd if it wouldn't kill me, I would have your baby, 
Drive you to the stars, way past maybe 
cnd into forevermore 
Over Orion and onto the kitchen floor
