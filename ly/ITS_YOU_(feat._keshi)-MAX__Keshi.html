		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm-hmm, no-oh, yeah, yeah

It's you
Loving's so easy to do
It's easy, baby
Oh, ooh-ooh
Think that I'm falling for you
Yeah, it's easy (you got to get a hold of yourself)

Another Sunday afternoon
And I'm still in bed with you
Nothing else I wanna do, no
Order from that place you like (you like)
We don't need to go outside (outside)
'Cause something 'bout you feels so right (feels so right)

Can we stay like this forever?
A white dress or whatever
I keep dreaming there's a somewhere
Where we grow old together

It's you
Loving's so easy to do
Yeah, it's easy, baby
Oh, ooh-ooh
Think that I'm falling for you
Yeah, it's easy

I met you at the right time
See you and I'm still excited
Sittin' on a shallow mind
A little bit but I like it
Snacks on the late night
We don't even do fine dining
Make love when the sunrise
Pillow talk in silence

Like this forever (forever)
A white dress or whatever
I keep dreaming there's a somewhere
Where we grow old together
Innovate, I'm in a mansion
Raining but we're dancing
There's a billion people out there, can't believe the chances

It's you
Loving's so easy to do (to do)
Yeah, it's easy, baby (yeah)
Oh, ooh-ooh (yeah-ooh, uh)
Think that I'm falling for you (for you, yeah)
Yeah, it's easy (ooh)

Loving's so easy to do (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah, it's easy (it is easy)
