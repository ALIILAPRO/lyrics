Ayy, yeah
(BNYX)

I need someone to be patient with me
Someone to get money with, not take it from me, look
They don't even need to be as famous as me
I don't think I'll meet 'em at the places I be
But deep down I think about you all day, mami
I know I'm a pitbull, but dale, mami
I just wanna take you on a holiday, mami
Say what's on your mind, I'm a call away, mami

Come and rescue me, whoa
Take me out the club, take me out the trap
Take me off the market, take me off the map
I'm tryna hit the group chat and tell 'em it's a
Come and rescue me
Take me out the club, take me out the trap
Take me off the market, take me off the map
I'm tryna hit the group chat and tell 'em it's a wrap

I didn't come this far just to come this far and not be happy
Okay, that's fair
Remember that
You didn't come this far just to come this far
Yep, I saw it on the internet

I don't really know how to confess my love
Really seem that God wanna test my love for you
Don't know how to express my love
That's why I American Express my love for you

I need you, yeah, I really do
Tell me what to do (okay)
Tell me what to do (okay)
Tell me what to do
All I know is hit the mall
And see what damage I could do (okay)
I gave you the world
But there's other planets too, and

I need someone to be patient with me
Someone to get money with, not take it from me, look
They don't even need to be as famous as me
I don't think I'll meet 'em at the places I be
But deep down I think about you all day, mami
I know I'm a pitbull, but dale, mami
I just wanna take you on a holiday, mami
Say what's on your mind, I'm a call away, mami

Come and rescue me, whoa
Take me out the club, take me out the trap
Take me off the market, take me off the map
I'm tryna hit the group chat and tell 'em it's a
Come and rescue me
Take me out the club, take me out the trap
Take me off the market, take me off the map
I'm tryna hit the group chat and tell 'em it's a wrap

(Come and rescue me, whoa)
(Take me out the club, take me out the trap)
(Take me off the market, take me off the map)
(I'm tryna hit the group chat)
Man, I'm tryna hit the, ayy, what

Don't hit me up and "WYD" me baby, nah
Send a boy a P-I-C or see me, baby, damn
Okay, now we talkin', yeah, okay, now we talkin', yeah
Okay, now we talkin', yeah, when we talk you gotta listen
I don't wanna go missin', I wanna be consistent
Not a opposition side
Put you in, I won't put you in that fucked up position, I

I need someone to be patient with me
Someone to get money with, not take it from me, look
They don't even need to be as famous as me
I don't think I'll meet 'em at the places I be
But deep down I think about you all day, mami
