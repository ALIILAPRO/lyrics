		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, that's just how I rock, yeah
Yeah, that's just how I roll (808)
Yeah, that's just how I rock
That's just how I roll, that's just how I rock

And roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
I wanna rock and roll, you can tell by my clothes
I get high as fuck every day, I think I see a UFO
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm fuckin' on this ho, I think she emo
She got slits on her wrist, she so suicidal

I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
I'm trippin', I'm trippin'
This A-C-I-D got me trippin'
It feel like I'm in another dimension
I pop me some X and pass one to your bitch, yeah
Pour me some Wock', I don't pour up no Tris, yeah
Roll up a blunt of Metro and get missin'
I'm high as fuck, lil' bitch, I cannot listen
I'm high as fuck, lil' bitch, I cannot hear
I can't hear 'cause I'm holdin' these racks to my ear
This not a Uber, bitch, this is a Lear
If you ain't suckin' or fuckin', you can't ride in here
He tried to run, we shot at his rear
When I got a gun, you cannot come near
I shoot shit for fun, shoot you like a deer
I rock and I roll, I rage and they cheer
You a rat and you told, you can't come 'round here
Swear these niggas be hoes, these niggas be weird
You can get smoked, get shot in your beard
He leakin' blood like a bitch on her period
I'm sippin' mud, my Sprite never clear
If I roll up a blunt, I'll smoke it right here
She wanna rock and roll, she wanna come near
I fuck her for fun, she takin' me serious

Yeah, that's just how I rock, yeah
Yeah, that's just how I roll
Yeah, that's just how I rock
That's just how I roll, that's just how I rock

And roll, roll, roll, roll
Roll, roll, roll, roll
I wanna rock and roll, you can tell by my clothes
I get high as fuck every day, I think I see a UFO
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
I'm fuckin' on this ho, I think she emo
She got slits on her wrist, she so suicidal
