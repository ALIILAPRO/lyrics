		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder where your are tonight
You're probably out on the rampage somewhere
You have been known to take delight
In getting in somebody's hair
And you always had the knack
Fade to black 

I bet you already made a pass
I see a darkened room somewhere
You run your fingers around the rim of his glasses
You run your fingers through his hair
They scratch across his back

Well maybe its all 4 the best
But I wish id never been lassoed
Maybe it some kind of test
But I wish id never been tattooed
Or been to hell and back
Fade to black
