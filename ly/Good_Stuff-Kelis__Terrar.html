		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm telling you, boy
You're wasting your time on them
The good stuff's right here

I seen you when you walked in, stealin' all the light
You're the type of guy that makes them fly girls fuss and fight
They can't love you more, not the way you're wishing for
They go about it all wrong, only experts get it right

(Uh-uh) I'm telling you now, boy, put your eyes on me
(Uh-uh) And if you call now, boy, I'll throw my heart in free
(Uh-uh) I can love you in one million ways
(Uh-uh) And if you don't like it, send it back in thirty days

I know you're sick of them knowin' who you are
All they want to do is ride around in your fancy car
Gimme this, gimme that and yeah, I know it's so wack
All they want to do is be seen with a superstar

(Uh-uh) I'm telling you now, boy, put your eyes on me
(Uh-uh) And if you call now, boy, I'll throw my heart in free
(Uh-uh) I can love you in one million ways
(Uh-uh) And if you don't like it, send it back in thirty days

This is that good stuff
This is that good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
This is that good stuff

Bulletproof under the suit, no need for alarm
The way I flow through the club, call me Disco Don
But my name still Terrar, still the world at my palm
Your chick in heat, front passenger seat, loadin' my arm
Who she with next? One of two Clipse, intended specs
Dance floor, hot sex, my hands rubbing her breasts
What am I saying, baby? Discotheque or this gold TEC?
Either way, to miss my spray, just twist your neck

Now that you've seen you're really wantin' me
And those girls wasted their time thinkin' they could possibly (yeah, right)
You want this, you don't want that, here, girls, he don't want it back
And if you want the next one, you should repeat after me

This is that good stuff
This is that good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
This is that good stuff

(Uh-uh)
This is that good stuff
(Uh-uh, uh-uh)
(Uh-uh, uh-uh)

Yo, you're looking at stars
Yeah, you know who we are (you don't know)
Clipse, Kelis, Neptunes
Star Trak how be back, baby

Good stuff
This is that good stuff
This is that good stuff
You don't know this is that good stuff
