		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're lost
The scent of love has been dried out
The words you gave me has been already dried up, oh yeah
There's no way back, we're lost in this room.
Those scenes of you 
It's all blurred out

So dry, yeah
You're a dried flower, oh yeah
So dry
I'm just a dried bloody dirt, oh

You know, there will be no blossoms for us
We don't have any wetness, no sunlight
Oh, there's no way back
We're lost in this room
Those scenes of you 
It's all blurred out

So dry, yeah
You're a dried flower, oh yeah
So dry
I'm just a dried bloody dirt, oh

So dry
You're a dried flower, hmm
