		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Everyone can see we're together
As we walk on by
(And) and we fly just like birds of a feather
I won't tell no lie

(All) all of the people around us they say
Can they be that close
Just let me state for the record
We're giving love in a family dose

We are family (Hey, y'all)
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing (sing it to me)

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing

Living life is fun and we've just begun
To get our share of this world's delights
(High) high hopes we have for the future
And our goal's in sight

(We) no, we don't get depressed
Here's what we call our golden rule
Have faith in you and the things you do
You won't go wrong, oh no
This is our family jewel

We are family (hey, sing it to me)
I got all my sisters with me
We are family (oh, I can hear you now)
Get up everybody and sing

We are family
I got all my sisters with me
We are family (get up, get up y'all)
Get up everybody and sing

We are family (I got all my sisters with me)
I got all my sisters with me
We are family
Get up everybody and sing (Get up and sing it to me)

We are family
I got all my sisters with me (we're having fun)
We are family 
Get up everybody and sing

Get up, get up, get up and sing it to me
Oh, I can't hear you y'all
Oh, have faith in you and the things you do
Hey hey, oh hey hey hey
Get up, get up y'all
Oh, hey hey hey

I got my sisters with me
Everybody, hey hey hey
Get up, get up and sing it to me
We're having fun
Life, life has just begun for me
Me, me and my family
Get up, get up and sing it
Sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it to me
Yeah, we're back together like birds of a feather
Get up, come on y'all

We are family (yeah, sing it to me)
I got all my sisters with me
We are family (yeah)
Get up everybody and sing (get up and sing it to me)

We are family (we're having lots of fun now)
I got all my sisters with me (get up and sing it sing it to me)
We are family (yeah)
