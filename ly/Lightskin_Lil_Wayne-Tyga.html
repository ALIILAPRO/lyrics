		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you gon' stand next to a nigga like me that really do it
And you don't do it?
The fuck from by me, man

Hello, motherfucker, what's my name? (What's my name?)
In the Rolls, asking bitches how I came (how I came)
Got a king-size bed on the plane (on the plane)
She'll get deplaned if she complain (don't complain)
My diamonds shining, we ain't pay the same (the same)
Got a Jay-Z watch, it changed the game (the game)
Yeah, big dawg status, get it appraised (appraised)
Told that bitch these ain't braids, she gon' fuck for the fame (woo)
I'm the cane cane sugar mane, ice in the ring
I'ma bang bang, let it bang, bust it on your face (baw)
Watch what you say, what you say to me, you gon' feel the bank (baw)
Told that nigga give me space, shoot it pocket corner eight (yeah)
Money in the Chase, big weight by the waist (woah)
If she got a fat ass, put the icing on the cake (ice)
I'm a pussy fanatic, get obsessed with the baddest (yeah)
Put it so deep, told her don't be dramatic (ha)

How you feel? How you feel? I'ma make a film with her
Keep it real, keep it real, you ain't really real, nigga
What's the deal? What's the deal? I'm a big deal, nigga (skrrt)
Ice, ice, ice, she wanna chill with a nigga, ayy

Soaking bitches with the champagne (champagne)
I'm the new lightskin Lil Wayne (Lil Wayne)
I gotta touch it if them titties fake (if it's fake)
I don't do this shit to entertain (entertain)
Soaking bitches with the champagne (champagne)
I'm the new lightskin Lil Wayne (Lil Wayne)
High as a star on a plane (on a plane)
I don't do this shit to entertain (entertain)

Got that mack game, bitches call me Mack Maine (yeah)
And I slide on your block like a nigga that skate
And you know my campaign, got a bitch in every state (yeah)
Got your bitch in her lace, she gon' bend, I don't break (nope)
Dear God, pray for all enemies (yeah)
They gon' fall to they death, she gon' fall to her knees (ah)
I get blessed by the best and I'm fallin' asleep (yeah)
A nigga been hot since 500 Degreez (ayy)

How you feel? How you feel? I'ma make a film with her
Keep it real, keep it real, you ain't really real, nigga (skrrt)
What's the deal? What's the deal? I'm a big deal, nigga (skrrt)
Ice, ice, ice, she wanna chill with a nigga, ayy

Soaking bitches with the champagne (champagne)
I'm the new lightskin Lil Wayne (Lil Wayne)
I gotta touch it if them titties fake (if it's fake)
I don't do this shit to entertain (entertain)
Soaking bitches with the champagne (champagne)
I'm the new lightskin Lil Wayne (Lil Wayne)
High as a star on a plane (on a plane)
I don't do this shit to entertain (entertain)

Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my neck, yeah, yeah
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my neck, ayy
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my neck, ayy
Diamonds on my, neck, diamonds on my neck

Yo, don't give a fuck about what they do
How can they be better? I don't, I breathe this shit
I'm in the studio right now, B
I just done a song with Shakira and Beyonc√©
I just got off 106 premiering my new video today
I switched hoodies and tennis shoes and came to the fuckin' studio, not the club
The studio, nigga
