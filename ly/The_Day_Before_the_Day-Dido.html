		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speeches won't be made today
Clocks will carry on
Flowers won't be left in parks
Work will still be done

People won't be dressed in black
Babies will be born
No flags will fly
The sun will rise but we will know that you are gone

You who loved to love and believed we can never give enough

It wakes me every single night
Thinking through the day
Did you stop at any time
Have doubts at any stage

And were you calm or were you numb
Or happy just to get it done
I've lived my life without regret until today

You who loved to love and believed we can never give enough

I didn't get to say goodbye the day before the day
Was trying to get to work on time
That's why I turned away

And missed the most important thing you've ever tried to say
I've lived my life without regret until today

And you who loved to love and believed we can never give enough
And you who hoped that underneath we all felt the same
That was until the day before the day

The day before the day
The day before the day
Oh
The day before the day
The day before the day
Oh
The day before the day
Oh
The day before the day
Oh
The day before they day
