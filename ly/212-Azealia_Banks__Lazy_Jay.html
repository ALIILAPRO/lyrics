		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, I can be the answer
I'm ready to dance when the vamp up
And when I hit that dip get your camera
You could see I been that bitch since the Pamper
And that I am that young sis, the beacon
The bitch who wants to compete and
I can freak a fit that pump with the peep and
You know what your bitch become when her weave in
I just wanna sip that punch with your peeps and
Sit in that lunch if you're treatin'
Kick it with your bitch who come from Parisian
She know where I get mine from, and the season
Now she wanna lick my plum in the evenin'
And fit that ton-tongue d-deep in
I guess that cunt getting eaten
I guess that cunt getting eaten
I guess that cunt getting eaten
I guess that cunt getting eaten
I guess that cunt getting eaten

I was in 212 on the uptown A
Nigga, you know what's up or don't you?
Word to who made ya
I'm a rude bitch, nigga, what are you made up of?
I'ma eat your food up boo, I could bust your eight
I'm-a do one too, fuck ya gon do? When you do make bucks
I'm a look right, nigga, bet you do want to fuck
Fuck him like you do want to cum
You're gay to get discovered in my 21-deuce
Cock-a-lickin' in the water by the blue bayou
Caught the warm goo in your du-rag too son?
Nigga, you're a kool-aid dude
Plus your bitch might lick it
Wonder who let you come to 12
With your doo-doo crew, son, fuck are you into, huh?
Niggas better oooh-run-run
You could get shot, homie
If you do want to put your guns up
Tell your crew don't front
I'm a hoodlum, nigga, you know you were too once
Bitch, I'm 'bout to blew up too
I'm the one today, I'm the new shit boo
Yung Rapunxel
Who are you bitch? New lunch?
I'ma ruin you cunt
I'ma ruin you cunt
I'ma ruin you cunt
I'ma ruin you cunt
I'ma ruin you cunt

Ayo, ayo
I heard you ridin' with the same tall, (ah) tall
Tale, tall, tellin' 'em you made some (made some)
Sayin' you grindin' but you ain't goin' nowhere (nowhere)
Why you procrastinating, girl? (Natin', girl)
You got a lot, but you just waste all yours and
They'll forget your name soon (name soon)
And won't nobody be to blame but yourself, yeah

What you gon' do when I appear?
W-w-when I premiere?
Bitch, the end of your lives are near
This shit been mine, mine

What you gon' do when I appear?
W-w-when I premiere?
Bitch, the end of your lives are near
This shit been mine, mine

Bitch, I'm in the 212
With the fif' cocked, nigga, it's the 21-zoo
Fuck ya gon' do when ya goon sprayed up?
Bet his bitch won't get him
Betcha you won't do much
See, even if you do want to bust
Your bitch'll get you cut and touch your crew up too, Pop
You playing with your butter like your boo won't true
Cock the gun, too, where you do eat pum, hun
I'm fuckin' with ya cutie q
What's your dick like, homie? What are you into?
What's the run, dude? Where do you wake up?
Tell your bitch keep hatin', I'm the new one two, huh?
See I remember you when you
Were the young new face but you do like to slumber don't you?
Now your boo up too, hun
I'ma ruin you, cunt

What you gon' do when I appear? (I'ma ruin you, cunt)
W-w-when I (I'ma ruin you, cunt) premiere?
Bitch, the end of your lives are near
This shit been mine, mine

What you gon' do when I appear?
W-w-when I premiere?
Bitch, the end of your lives are near
This shit been mine, mine 
This shit been mine, mine
This shit been mine, mine
