		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pulled up on you in the nighttime
Baby, I know you wanna fuck
Yeah, and I heard from a little birdy that you talk about me from night til the morning
Oh girl, I don't mind it
We're fuckin' the climate up, but that's alright baby just climb it
And tell me you like it rough

Fuck you in the back on the backseat babe
Told me that you wanted to have me baby
Open the windows for air
You speak the truth when you're bare
And you love me
And I love you too
And then we get drunk and head up to the room

Yeah
Make that ass go up and down on the balcony
You see what you see, that's fuckin' Miami
Scream my name while you're facing the view
I promise it's staring back at you
Fuck me real, say you love me during sex
Cause' I need to hear it in my head
I know it's great making love on your sheets
But it's always a vibe when I

Fuck you in the back on the backseat babe
Told me that you wanted to have me baby
Open the windows for air
You speak the truth when you're bare
And you love me
And I love you too
And then we get drunk and head up to the room
