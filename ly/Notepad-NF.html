		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I we've been through a lot together
And I look back and I just uh, I appreciate all the times that we had together, you know?
I remember just going down in my room and
You know dealing trying to deal with some things
And you have always been there for that
Always, just me and you

You and I've been best friends, ever since I was a young kid
Everything we did, where has time went?
Got a lot of years coming up ahead of us
And ever since we met
I knew we'd get somewhere
But the fact is I ain't really, I ain't really know when
I don't really know how either, but I can feel the goose bumps my skin writing
Now I've been waiting for the moment
You and I can make it happen
Lot of people think we ain't gonna make it rapping
I ain't got a problem with 'em though, they don't even matter
We ain't looking for the people tryna say that we the baddest
No I never liked that, came a long way, never did it for the money
We ever make it big, I'ma give it to the family
Looking back now everything is looking funny
You and I in the room writing, up late when the mood strikes us
We don't care if they do like us
Writing songs for the haters we ain't even got yet
Freestyling somebody turn the mic up

Talking bout things we don't really understand
Talking bout things we don't really comprehend

Me and you tryna get it, we ain't quitting till the end
Now I'm standing on stage tryna give it to the fans, yah

We took that karaoke machine from my room
And ah, we put it up to and CD player and played instrumentals and
Man we've come a long way
A long way

I made a lot of mistakes
You've been there for the whole thing
Help me with the drama
Rapping in the car outside daily
We don't care if it's the winter
We don't care if its the summer
I remember writing raps with the curse words
I just wanna hear it
It seems like everybody does it
Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'
Trying to find who I was
Being everything I wasn't
Real life yeah
Gotta lot of anger
You know where I'm at
Put it all of it in the pages
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazing, if I give us a chance
Now I'm lookin round like yeah, look at where we at?
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet but they can here us in the background comin'
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
I'ma put it in his hands and let God do the judging, yah
Remember me and you always had you in the backpack
Took you into school writing on you like its nuthin' a lot of people in the room
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, naw they ain't got a clue
We at the beginning hoping someday you and I can say
We made it and we did it
You ain't nuthin' but a notepad to me, Who you kiddin?
I'm just runnin out of space I'll be back in a minute
Turn the page homie

You know what's crazy is
This just started as something that was an escape for us
You know
And now I look around and, there's a lot of people going
Through the same things you know we've been through
Now this music we write is actually making an impact it's crazy

(NF real music)
