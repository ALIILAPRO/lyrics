		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't save me
You don't have to try
It won't help
It won't help

You don't have to stay here
You can let me die

It started out nice
It was easy
I started out fine
But now I'm not so good

And I can't escape it
You can let me go
I want out
I want out

It started out nice
It was easy
I started out fine

I saw your eyes
You don't need me
I saw your eyes
And it's over now
I saw your eyes
You don't need me
I saw your eyes
And there's no way out
