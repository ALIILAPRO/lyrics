		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Threw my bad fortune
Off the top of
A tall building
I'd rather done it with you

Your boy's smile
Five in the morning
Looked into your eyes
And I was really in love

In Chinatown
Hung over
You showed me
Just what I could do

Talking about
Time travel
And the meaning
Just what it was worth

And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

Things I once thought
Unbelievable
In my life
Have all taken place

When we walked through
Little Italy
I saw my reflection
Come right off your face

I paint pictures
To remember
You're too beautiful
To put into words

Like a gypsy
You dance in circles
All around me
And all over the world

And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

And I feel like
Some bird of paradise
My bad fortune slipping away
And I feel the innocence of a child
Everybody's got something good to say

So I take my
Good fortune
And I fantasize
Of our leaving

Like some modern day
Gypsy landslide
Like some modern day
Bonnie and Clyde

On the run again (on the run again)
On the run again (on the run again)
On the run again (on the run again)
On the run again (on the run again)
