		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your six blade knife can do anything for you
Anything you want it to
One blade for breaking my heart
One blade for tearing me apart
Your six blade knife-do anything for you
You can take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
When you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame
Just so you could make me tame

You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin
I'd like to be free of it now, I don't want it no more
I'd like to be free of it now, you know I don't want it no more
Everybody got a knife it can be just what they want it to be
A needle a wife or something that you just can't see
You know it keeps you strong
Yes and it'll do me wrong
Your six blade knife, do anything for you.
