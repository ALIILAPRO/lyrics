		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goddamn I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le?
Lookin' like straight Bozos
I saw it comin' that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
When y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Livin' with the whites, one big house
And not another nigga in site
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm makin' all the dough
White man just rulin'
The Niggas With Attitudes, who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losin'
Ay yo Dre, stick to producin'
Callin' me Arnold, but you been-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody helpin' me
Tryna sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B, and y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy
With no Vaseline

("Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline")
("Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline")
("Now you're gettin' done without Vaseline")
("Damn, it feels good to see people, on it")

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're gettin' fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick, is smellin' like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a hoe be a hoe, so
I couldn't stop you from gettin' ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair and I'll cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like givin' up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Gettin' money out your ass, like a motherfuckin' Ready Teller
Givin' up the dollar bills
Now they got the Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's goin' out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yellin' Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren, 'cause I remember when you drove a be B210
Broke as a mothafuckin' joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they rippin' your asshole apart
By takin' your green, oh yeah
The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

("Now you're gettin' done, get-getting done")
("Now you're gettin' done, get-getting done")
("Now you're gettin' done without Va-va-va-va-seline")

I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fuckin' your homeboys
You little maggot, Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hangin' from a tree
With no Vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation, off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' 'bout?
Get rid of that Devil real simple, put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew tellin' you what to do
Pullin' wools with your scams, now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryna fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk, always into somethin', gettin' fucked at night
By Mista Shitpacker, bend over for the goddamn cracker, no Vaseline
Motherfuckin' nosejob having ass
Motherfuckin' Jheri curl lite
Ambi wearing motherfuckin' bitch
