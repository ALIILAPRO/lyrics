		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm making believe that you're in my arms though I know you're so far away
Making believe I'm talking to you, wish you could hear what I say
And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreaming, so till my dreams come true

I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
I'm making believe that you're in my arms though I know you're so far away
Making believe I'm talkin' to you, wish you could hear what I say

And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreamin', so till my dreams come true
I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you

And here in the gloom of my lonely room we're dancing like we used to do
Making believe is just another way of dreamin', so till my dreams come true
I'll whisper "Good night", turn out the light, and kiss my pillow
Making believe it's you
