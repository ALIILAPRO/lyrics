		  D.a. Got that dope
Hah

You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid (ayy, ayy)
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day (nah)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friends say

Car automatic (yeah), I don't whip it if it's average (woo)
And my bitch got status and your bitch cause static (yeah)
Goddamn, and you niggas ain't worthy (hah)
She gon' kiss on my dick like a Hershey (mwah)
I put it so deep, she like, "Baby don't hurt me" (go, go)
Fuckin' rappers and athletes, she need a jersey
Always in the club, I can't love her 'cause she thirsty (no)
And I'm watching everything, see them niggas lurkin' (bye)
Yeah, she in the backroom working, working
Fucking on my lap and she cursing, cursing (ayy)
Nigga like me, I don't show no mercy (no)
When it get wet, feel like I'm surfing

(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid (ayy)
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friends say
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid

Ayy, slide to the left (ayy), slide to the left (ayy)
Take a lil' step, ayy, slide to the left (slide)
Slide to the right (yeah), slide to the right (ayy)
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night (woo)

Make a loyal bitch unloyal (bah)
Tryna get up in my section, I don't know you (be gone), ayy
Nigga, them ain't diamonds, that's foil (ha)
Big platinum plaques, but they ain't for you (nah)
I'm a California nigga in a yellow Lamborghini (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
When I take off the top, take off your bikini (ayy)
She a lil' freak freak, let a nigga skeet skeet (ayy, ayy)
Beat it like Billie Jean, then I say hee-hee
T-raww so Weezy, make it look easy
She gon' throw it back, I'ma catch it like a Frisbee
Nigga like me, I don't show no mercy (no)
When it get wet, feel like I'm surfing

(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid (ayy)
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friends say
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid

Ayy, slide to the left (ayy), slide to the left (ayy)
Take a lil' step, ayy, slide to the left (Slide)
Slide to the right (yeah), slide to the right (ayy)
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night

Slide on your bitch, I make her slide in my Benzy (in my Benzy)
Dtb for life, I can't be out here actin' friendly (actin' friendly)
Niggas want my life and they can't have it, so they envy (so they envy)
Blow the fuckin' shotty to your body 'til it's empty
Put a bullet hole in your motherfuckin' beanie
Make him disappear like a motherfuckin' genie
Two-tone flair, I be so motherfuckin' flee, B
I could take you home but that's too motherfuckin' easy
Bitches ain't shit, I make her pay for the dick
If I wasn't so up, I'd make her pay for my rent
Go Mike Amiri hoodie, Balmain for the kicks
Richard Mille, yeah, I basically just paid for her wrist

(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid (ayy)
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You coming with me, I don't care what your friends say
(Goddamn)
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid
Ain't got time for no drama, but today the day
(Goddamn)
And my watch gotta be presidente
You a bad bitch, come and get your rent paid

Ayy, slide to the left, slide to the left
Take a lil' step, ayy, slide to the left
Slide to the right, slide to the right
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night (goddamn)
Ayy, slide to the left, slide to the left
Take a lil' step, ayy, slide to the left
Slide to the right, slide to the right
Move your panties to the side, I be in it all night

Goddamn
Goddamn
