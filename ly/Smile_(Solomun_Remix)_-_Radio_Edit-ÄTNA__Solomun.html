		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me smile
You throw my demons into the fire 
ha? Oh
You tame the wild
When you're a friend
To the world in my mind
I'm high high
Take me farther
Lend me your love
We're like bright lights 
In the rain
I can't get enough
I am tough tough
Prototype 
Bonafide
Dime

But I'm sleepless in the nights

3 x Why? Why?Why? Why?Why? Why?

2 x Why slash

You make me smile
You take the cold and gimme fire
high high
Take me farther
Lend me your love
We're the bright lights 
In the rain
I can't get enough
I am tough tough
Prototype 
Bonafide
Dime
But I'm sleepless in the nights

3x Why? Why?Why? Why?Why? Why?

Im loosing it,  I'm loosing my grip
i'm fighting against it, won't take no shhh
still loosing it,  I'm loosing my grip
but I will be the one again, that's my shhh
Im loosing it,  I'm loosing my grip
i'm fighting against it, won't take no shhh
still loosing it,  I'm loosing my grip
but I will be the one again, that's my shhh

You make me smile
You feed my demons to crocodiles
You tame the wild
When you're a friend
To the world in my mind
I'm high high
Take me farther
Lend me your love
We're the bright lights 
In the rain
I can't get enough
I am tough tough
Prototype 
Bonafide
Dime
But I'm sleepless in the nights

3x Why? Why?Why? Why?Why? Why?

2 x Why slash
