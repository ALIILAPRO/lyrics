		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spend my nights down on the wharf
In unlit alleyways
By the church downtown
Where Sally prays
Come down sometime
We'll share a rusty can of corn
And listen to the radio
I love you, I love you, it says

[Chorus]
Where did your heart go
Did you put it on a train
Did you leave it in the rain
Or down in Mexico

You cry, but I don't know
I've heard it all before
There it goes again, the slamming of the door
Sometimes the river calls me
And at night it calls my name
Says "put your troubles down beside me"
Things have always been the same
And rock 'n' roll won't teach me
What the river said that night
I jumped into this beauty
And drifted out of sight

[Chorus]
