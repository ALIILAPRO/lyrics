		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Better, better
Better, better, better, better

Better, does it make you feel a little bit better?
When you're messing with my head for pleasure
You ain't tall enough to act like that
You're loveless, is that a symptom of being gorgeous?
Whatever happened to being modest?
You ain't good enough to treat me bad

To you I'm an overly emotional, easily replaceable
Overthinking dumb blonde who never got her shit together

You think you can do better
Must have hit your head too hard when you fell from heaven
'Cause you're not quite Harry Styles
Running around with your god complex
Do you picture yourself while we're having sex together?
If you think you can do better
Maybe I deserve better

Better
Better, better, better, better

Honest, yeah, you are the source of all my problems
Yeah, you're a piece of work that I've fallen
It would be better if you loved me back

To you I'm an overly emotional, easily replaceable
Overthinking dumb blonde who never got her shit together

You think you can do better
Must have hit your head too hard when you fell from heaven
'Cause you're not quite Harry Styles
Running around with your god complex
Do you picture yourself while we're having sex together?
If you think you can do better

I know that I'm overly emotional, easily replaceable
Even I can admit that
But you're a egotistic maniac who never says the L word back
Guess you really met your match
Bitch
You think you can do better

You think you can do better
Must have hit your head too hard when you fell from heaven
'Cause you're not quite Harry Styles
Running around with your god complex
Do you picture yourself while we're having sex together?
If you think you can do better
Well, maybe I deserve better

Maybe I deserve better
Better
Does it make you feel a little bit better?
Does it make you feel a little bit better?
Does it make you feel a little bit better?
Does it make you feel a little bit?
