		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, Aphrodite
Ooh, I wrote your constellation into the sky
S-s-suns at night

We're out late, at 4 AM
He says, "how's the weather, baby?
How you've been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
They never doubt it at 4 AM
We're out late at 4 AM
He says, "how's the weather, baby?
How you've been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
They never doubt it at 4 AM

4 AM, 4 AM, falling down again
Unraveling

Ooh, Aphrodite
I wrote your constellation into the sky, ooh
S-s-suns at night

We're out late, at 4 AM
He says, "how's the weather, baby?
How you've been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
They never doubt it at 4 AM
We're out late at 4 AM
He says, "how's the weather, baby?
How you've been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
They never doubt it at 4 AM

4 AM, 4 AM, falling down again

We're out late, at 4 AM
He says, "how's the weather, baby?
How you've been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
They never doubt it at 4 AM
We're out late at 4 AM
He says, "how's the weather, baby?
How you've been?"
You're gonna get sick, you don't know when
They never doubt it at 4 AM

4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM
4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM, 4 AM
4 AM, 4 AM, falling down again
4 AM, 4 AM
I'm out late at 4 AM, yeah (4 AM, 4 AM)
I'm out late at 4 AM, yeah (4 AM, 4 AM)
Falling 4 AM, oh, oh
Falling down again, falling down again
Ah, oh
