		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early in the morning I still get a little bit nervous
Fighting my anxiety constantly, I try to control it
Even when I know it's been forever I can still feel the spin
Hurts when I remember and I never wanna feel it again

Don't know if you get it 'cause I can't express how thankful I am
That you were always with me when it hurts, I know that you'd understand

I don't wanna lose control
Nothing I can do anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressing on my chest
I don't wanna lose control

Sometimes I still think it's coming but I know it's not
Tryin' to breathe in and then out but the air gets caught
'Cause even though I'm older now and I know how to shake off the past
I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have you holding my hand

I don't wanna lose control
Nothing I can do anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressing on my chest
I don't wanna lose control

I need you to know I would never be this strong without you 
You've seen how I've grown, you took all my doubts, 'cause you were home

I don't wanna lose control
There's nothing I can do anymore

I don't wanna lose control, oh-oh-oh-oh
Nothing I can do anymore (anymore), anymore
Tryin' every day when I hold my breath
Spinnin' out in space pressing on my chest
I don't wanna lose control
