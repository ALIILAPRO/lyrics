		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My head was warm my skin was soaked
I called your name 'til the fever broke
When I awoke the moon still hung
The night so black that the darkness hums

I raised myself my legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise filled the air
I heard a scream in the woods somewhere

Ooh, oo ooh, oo ooh

A woman's voice i quickly ran
Into the trees with empty hands a fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no words, no sound he made

His bone exposed his hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound? How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes were watching me

Ooh, oo ooh, oo ooh

The creature lunged i turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Dear, in the chase there as I flew
Forgot all prayers of joining you

I clutched my life and wished it kept
My dearest love, I'm not done yet
How many years i know I'll bear
I found something in the woods somewhere

Ooh, oo ooh, oo ooh
