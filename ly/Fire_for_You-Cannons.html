		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was on fire for you
Where did you go?
I could've died for you
How could you not know?
I was alive with you
But you brought in the cold
Was I being lied to? Wish I never met you
Started to regret you

My heart just dropped
Thinkin' about you
The world just stops
When I'm without you

I was on fire for you
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
I was on fire for you
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)

I was on fire for you
You breaking me down
Don't know what should I do
When you come around
I'm leaving without you, love
I have no choice
I know I'm being lied to, I just need some time to
Stop thinking about you

My heart just dropped
Thinkin' about you
The world just stops
When I'm without you
My heart just dropped
Thinkin' about you
The world just stops
When I'm without you

I was on fire for you
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
I was on fire for you
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
I was on fire for you
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
I was on fire for you
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
(Fire, on fire)
I was on fire for you
