		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put it off 'til you see me
Be a better friend
I'm caught gotta break away, yeah
We stalled it, we're stalling
And it won't be wasted, I'll always give you praise
Didn't you let me chase it down, yeah
We fought the wrong way round
I'll see that it gets to you, yeah

You know I love it, but there's an easier way
You tell me I sing things that I'm afraid to say
I'm not above it, I'm just upside down
We don't have to talk, we can just make sounds

So show me something
I think we're haunted
You show me something
We must be haunted

And I know I'm impatient
But I'll wait for a cure
Don't think it's me that you're facing
You've got your heart secure
So I'll leave when it's over, if I'm even allowed
Won't stop as we both get older
We fought the wrong way round
The wrong way round
I'll see that it gets to you, yeah 
We fought the wrong way round
Won't stop as we both get older

You know I love it, but there's an easier way
You tell me I sing things that I'm afraid to say
Well I'm not above it, I'm just upside down
We don't have to talk, we can just make sounds

So show me something
I think we're haunted
You show me something
We must be haunted

So show me something
(I'll just pretend there's still stuff to say)
I think we're haunted
(That's my excuse I'll stick to it anyway)
You show me something
(I'll see that it gets to you)
We must be haunted
So show me something
(I'll just pretend there's still stuff to say)
I think we're haunted
(That's my excuse I'll stick to it anyway)
You show me something
(I'll see that it gets to you)
We must be haunted
