		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your blood, what matter is it made of?
Do you feel it travel in and out your heart?
Needles, stitching up the big holes
You prepared for battle, as you fell apart

Are you dust?
You are dust, dust

Your voice drowning in the white noise
Do you hear the echo begging you to let go? (Let go, let go, let go)
This earth, whoever was it made for?
Just wait until tomorrow, it might not be as cold (cold, cold, cold, cold, cold)

When all inside you burns like a star
It's after you burn out that you are reborn again, reborn again
And maybe if you called out for help
Then I could help you outrun yourself
Come run again, we'll run again

But I, I refuse to die
I refuse to die
But I, I refuse to die
I refuse to die

We are dust, ooh
We are dust

When all inside you burns like a star
It's after you burn out that you are reborn again, reborn again
And maybe if you called out for help
Then I could help you outrun yourself
Come run again, we'll run again

You are dust, you are dust
You are dust, you are dust
You are dust, you are dust
You are dust

Your blood, what matter is it made of?
Do you feel it travel in and out your heart?
