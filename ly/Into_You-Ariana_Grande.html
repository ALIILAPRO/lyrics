		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up, and baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, ooh yeah

This could take some time, hey
I made too many mistakes
Better get this right, right, baby

Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move

So baby, come light me up, and baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don't let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you ('cause I'm so into you)

Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh, whoa, yeah

So baby, come light me up (light me up), and baby, I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous (dangerous), but baby, that's how I want it (how I want it)
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us (watchin' us), so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous (scandalous), but baby, don't let them see it (yeah)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

So come light me up, so come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous, a little dangerous, my boy (how I want it)
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you (I'm so into you)
