Tudutudu

And when you rise in the morning sun
I feel you touch my hand in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

And you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep you warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really need to learn 'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

I believe in you
You know you're the door to my barest soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my savior when I fall (When I fall)

And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love? (Oh)
I really need to learn 'cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

You're the light
You're my life

(When I fall) And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

How deep is your love, how deep is your love?
I really need to learn 'cause we're living in a world of fools
They're breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

Tudutudu (How deep is your love)
So, how deep is your love? (Tudutudu)
How deep is your love? (Tudutudu)(How deep is your love)
So, how deep is your love? (Tudutudu)
How deep is your love? (Tudutudu)
