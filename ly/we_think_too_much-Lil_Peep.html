		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yah, aye
Yah, yah

Nobody wants to talk to me, but everyone wants to walk with me
And I always been that kid, maybe I won't be if I live
Long enough, but I think I'ma die now, yah, aye, aye
I just keep it to myself and try not to cry too loud
I just wanna lay my head on your chest, so I'm close as it gets to your heart
We can fall apart, start over again
Nobody knows me, nobody knows one thing about me
Everyone doubts me
But I'ma make it all come true, and I do it for you
I know all about the pain that you go through
