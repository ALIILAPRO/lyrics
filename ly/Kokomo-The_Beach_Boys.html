		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya
Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go? Jamaica

Off the Florida Keys, there's a place called Kokomo
That's where you wanna go to get away from it all
Bodies in the sand, tropical drink melting in your hand
We'll be falling in love to the rhythm of a steel drum band
Down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

La Martinique, that Montserrat mystique

We'll put out to sea and we'll perfect our chemistry
And by and by we'll defy a little bit of gravity
Afternoon delight, cocktails, and moonlit nights
That dreamy look in your eye gave me a tropical contact high
Way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

Port au Prince, I wanna catch a glimpse

Everybody knows a little place like Kokomo
Now if you wanna go and get away from it all
Go down to Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
Ooh, I wanna take you down to Kokomo
We'll get there fast and then we'll take it slow
That's where we wanna go, way down in Kokomo

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take you to
Bermuda, Bahama, come on, pretty mama
Key Largo, Montego, baby, why don't we go?
