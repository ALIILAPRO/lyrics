		  (I just (?)
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
What, damn
Damn, that's how you're dealin' with me, damn
Damn, that's how you're-, that's how you're-
Ayy, look, look

Who the fuck is that? It's a disguise
You ain't who I thought I recognized
Twenty thousand pound on your rent
Bitch, I coulda spent that on the guys

I don't like what you did on them trips (shit I don't like)
I don't like what you did to your lips (shit I don't like)
I don't like the tone of your replies (shit I don't like)
I don't like the look that's in your eyes (shit I don't like)
Blame this shit on being twenty-five
That excuse for me just doesn't fly
Zack keep sayin', "Meet at seven-nine"
But that shit just gon' have you on my mind
Yeah

And I just wanna get you off of my mind
I just wanna get you off of my mind
I just wanna get you off of my mind
Ayy, yeah, damn
Damn, that's how you're dealin' with me, damn
Damn, that's how you're dealin' with me, damn
I just wanna get you off of my mind
Oh, seven-nine-six-nine, seven-nine-six-nine, seven-nine-six
Seven-nine-six-nine, seven-nine-six-nine

Ayy
Since I had some space to myself
I typed some shit, then I erased what I felt
That talk we had the other day didn't help
Because you really think you're out here movin' stealth
I met the nigga everybody say you fucked
And I could tell he wasn't actin' like his self
Got you out here movin' waste like a belt
If it ain't him then it must be somebody else
Damn

I don't like what you did on them trips (shit I don't like)
I don't like what you did to your lips (shit I don't like)
I don't like you tellin' just one side (shit I don't like)
I don't like the fact you never cried (shit I don't like)
Blame that shit on being twenty-five
That excuse for me just doesn't fly
Zack keep sayin', "Meet at seven-nine"
That shit just gon' have you on my

(Baby)
Dogs will be dogs
(You know I'm in the streets)
Though we may roam
(But I promise)
Leave the door open
Tonight, I'm comin' home
(I'm comin' home)
Dogs will be dogs
(I know you feel me, baby)
No leash in sight
Leave the door open
I'm comin' home tonight
(Let me hear my dogs)
Ah-ooh (ah-woo)
Ah-ooh (ah-woo)
(Let me hear my dogs)
Ah-ooh
(Yeah)

That's that new Teezo touchdown 
Straight for all the dogs that's drivin' around in Beaumont 
Lookin' for some cat 
All you pitbulls should know by now
That hundreds in a roll look like tuna in a bowl (tuna)
This is Curtis Cut-A-Bitch-Off
And you're listenin' to B-A-R-K Radio
Live from Chapel Hill
Where the South was won, whatever that means
We got some new Drake and SZA comin' up
And we gon' be givin' away some Drake tickets as well
You know we comin' to the H-Town to tear the roof off that motherfucker
This is B-A-R-K Radio
