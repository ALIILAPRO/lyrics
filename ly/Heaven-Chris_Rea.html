		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see a turning wheel
On a dusty track
Caught in the void and empty space
In between there and back
And the paradise of going somewhere
That's still so far away
Happy, boy you bet I am
Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can

Heaven

It's all bright in front
And it's all dark behind
Livin' for the now that's in between the bridges and the signs
And getting there is still a long long way to go
While the others dream and wish
This is everything I officially need to know
Happy, boy you bet I am
Holding on to this smile for just as long as I can

Heaven
