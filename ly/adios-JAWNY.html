		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were sitting on your bed, cross legged in your head
You were talking to me so slow, so slow
When you put your pretty red lipstick on a cigarette
And I starting thinking, "Oh no, oh no"

Come a little closer, sink into the sofa
She don't want my, yeah, she don't want my love
And now I feel like a blackout, New York City grid max out
When she said, "Adios, adios"

I was thinking something sweet, but you wouldn't let me speak
And in my head I'm thinking, "Oh no, don't go"
Feeling bluer than your jeans belt buckle to my knees
High waisted self esteem, I know, I know

Come a little closer, sink into the sofa
She don't want my, yeah, she don't want my love
And now I feel like a blackout, New York City grid max out
When she said, "Adios, adios"

Oh, oh, oh

Come a little closer, shift into the sofa
She don't want my, yeah, she don't want my love (ooh)
Said come a little closer, sink into the sofa
She don't want my, yeah, she don't want my love

Come a little closer (said come a little closer) 
Sink into the sofa
She don't want my, yeah, she don't want my love
And now I feel like a blackout, New York City grid max out
When she said, "Adios, adios"

Oh, oh, oh

Come a little closer (said come a little closer) 
Come a little closer
She don't want my, yeah, she don't want my love
Adios
