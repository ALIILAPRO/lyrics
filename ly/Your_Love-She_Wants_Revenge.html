		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not your problem now, this is not your concern
But I've fallen for you terribly, I guess that I'll never learn
There's a gold mine you're sitting on, I wish it were mine
Would you be my girl forever more, til the end of time?
Gotta let you know

Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love, your love, your love, love, love

My friends say I should play it cool, but that's not my style
If I lay down all my cards for you, would you think that's wild?
I pay no mind to all the things I've heard, we all have a past right?
Let's do away with all those silly things, I want a love that will last
Gotta let you know

Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love, your love, your love, love, love
[x2]

Everyone says that we just won't work
They tell me to watch out I might get hurt
Too many voices and too many people trying to bring me down
[x3]

Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love has got me going like you couldn't imagine
Your love, your love, your love, love, love
[x2]
