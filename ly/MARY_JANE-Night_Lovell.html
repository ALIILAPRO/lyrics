		<p>
		  Ayy

Jane, Mary Jane, I don't like you Mary Jane
With the gang, OT gang, for the [?] a nigga
What's the info, ayy, ayy
Where's your info, ayy, ya
My bitch sweet, candy cane, acting like you know my name
It's a shame, why these niggas pillow talking, pussy nigga
What's the info, ayy, ayy
Where's your info, ayy, ya

I don't change, I'm like rain
Sex with your bitch inside a plane
Then I came, put my kids inside your baby mama mouth
She a nympho, ayy, ayy
All these shit's so simple, ya, ayy, ayy
You think that you got it nigga, you can't take my game
I'mma [?] all these niggas, call me Devil Baby James
You a snitch though, ayy
And nigga, I could fuck your bitch too, ayy, ayy, ayy

Mhh, fucking all you bitch, rawr, ayy
See me with the money, now they want a car, ayy
Now they wanna listen to the shit I say
I'm just tryna have you naked all up in my bed, ayy, ayy
Put two shots inside my head
Try to save me but you left my soul beside your leg, ayy
Call me crazy but you such a fan, ayy
All I see is red until the day I'm dead, ayy, ayy

Jane, Mary Jane, I don't like you Mary Jane
With the gang, OT gang, for the [?] a nigga
What's the info, ayy, ayy
Where's your info, ayy, ya
My bitch sweet, candy cane, acting like you know my name
It's a shame, why these niggas pillow talking, pussy nigga
What's the info, ayy, ayy
Where's your info, ayy, ya
