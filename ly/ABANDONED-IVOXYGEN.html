		  (Hello, no one is available to take your call)
(Please leave a message under the tone)
I need a girl who
Can take care of herself
Take care of herself
Take care of herself
I need a girl who
Can take care of herself
Take care of herself
Take care of herself
You all alone
I need you alone
You all alone
Cause you've been all alone
I love you forever she said
I know she playin' pretend
She running from my love again
She running from love again
No, You're in the wrong
Went from being loved to being alone
Wasn't ever gonna tell you no
I wasn't ever gonna do you wrong
Wait, it's your heart again
Bleeding and calling for love again
Next time you'll call me you'll be in pain
Oh look, how you switchin' lanes
I'm not like her
It never worked for us before
You ain't in it for me yeah I know who you for
You ain't in it in love what the fuck are you for?
No, You're in the wrong
Went from being loved to being alone
Wasn't ever gonna tell you no
I wasn't ever gonna do you wrong
I need a girl who
Can take care of herself
Take care of herself
Take care of herself
I need a girl who
Can take care of herself
Take care of herself
Take care of herself
You all alone
I need you alone
You all alone
Cause you've been all alone
I love you forever she said
I know she playin' pretend
She running from my love again
She running from love again
