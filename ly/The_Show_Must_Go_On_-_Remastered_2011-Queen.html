		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty spaces, what are we living for?
Abandoned places, I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for?
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore?

The show must go on
The show must go on
Yeah
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning (I'm learning), I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning (turning, turning, turning), 'round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on (yeah yeah)
Ooh, inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

Yeah

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly my friends

The show must go on, yeah
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show 

Ooh, I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on 
(On with the show, on with the show)

Show (show must go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on)
