		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I call you when I can't sleep alone
Now you keep asking me what that means, oh no
In your feelings, I can feel it
You're in your feelings, you won't admit it, but
That's why I push you away from me
'Cause I know, I know

It drives you crazy, try to tame me
But nobody's taking control over me

Ooh, baby, baby, you be talkin' tough
But your boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?
Ooh, baby, baby, you're just outta touch
'Cause your boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?

Sometimes you call me when you're too drunk, oh God
Then you start telling me I'm the one, I'm not
In your feelings, I can feel it
You're in your feelings, you won't admit it, but
I thought that we were just having fun
'Cause I know, I know

It drives you crazy, try to tame me
But nobody's taking control over me

Ooh, baby, baby, you be talkin' tough
But your boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?
Ooh, baby, baby, you're just outta touch
'Cause your boys can't get enough
When the girls don't need your love
Who says boys don't cry?

Who says they don't cry?
Who says they don't cry?
Who says they don't cry?
Who says boys don't cry?
