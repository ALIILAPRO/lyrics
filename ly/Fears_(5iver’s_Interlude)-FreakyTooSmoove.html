		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Demons on me tryna find my fears 
Dark side of Ohood baby you can find me here
Ye it’s getting live in here talking my shit I feel like big 5 in here 
Deepend shawdy nigga ain’t a diver near 
Bigger picture having visions the Sky is clear 
Ye ye you better watch how you wavin that stick cuz my guys in here 
I ain big as I wanna be 
Far from a wanna be
Whole lotta places I wanna see 
Bro got a stick with some titts and dick like juwanna be 
Talkin my shit now she on to me 
These niggas sit and they judge like your honor be 
Don’t give a shit I won’t budge they not on to me 
Keep that shit on the beat 
Don’t bring it on the streets 
I’m not a nigga ya wanna meet 
Ye ye 
See em hating leave them in the rear view 
Keep Talkin ya shit know I hear you 
Really legit babygirl I don’t fear you
In love with that feeling when a nigga near you 
Ye ye 
Solidarity , true Clarity I’m in my zone babygirl why you scared of me 
Why you leave me alone hope you know that ain’t fair to me 
They ain’t run in yo home nigga you can’t compare to me 
I been a Legend fuck ya popularity 
If it’s time to pop up we gon do em hilariously 
Yee he make me laugh a lot 
In love with Rackades I chase the bag a lot 
Ooouu ima king from out Camelot 
She love to Jam a lot 
Teach lul brodie how to spam the block 
5 5 5 
Push up w big shit they kno we got brooms 
Late night pocket thang slide with the glock goons 
Say that’s it’s smoke I hope he got some fumes 
Play me like a joke he must got me confused 
But fuck it
Babygirl know that I’m M4L 
We known to get buckets like who got a gym for sell 
Dunking this work man I think that rim jus fell 
Shaq attack 
For a rack of stacks 
Push up with brodie we shooting shit back to back
All real they ain’t half of that 
Naw we ain’t havin that 
This shit get deep wtf is you laughing at 
Ye ye yo life a movie 
My life a curse 
If he bring up my life then I’m snatching his first 
Doing me dirty we doing em worse 
Hey 5 
I know everything happen for a reason 
But God Damnn wtf is the reason 
I feel like I keep on runnin threw these seasons
Tryna slow down life speeding 
Pop out in lime lights , I got my time right I believe it 
Speak on 5 he gon get more than a beating 
He’s a whore for a reason 
Kick the door in for treason 
Poked up forever nigga leave em bleeding 
Shroom life psychedelic got me dreaming 
Real love felt it why tf is you leaving 
Say you not for speaking 
But you keep teasing 
Babygirl this is not how you get even 
Ye ye 
Demons on me tryna find my fears 
Dark side of Ohood baby you can find me here 
Ye it’s getting live in here talking my shit I feel like big 5 in here 
Deepend shawdy nigga ain’t a diver near 
Bigger picture having visions the Sky is clear 
I knows boutta be alright 
Strapped up forever baby know we all tight
On repeat like my song & that’s all night 
That boy got a big bark and a small bite 
We get it sold , he tried to bag it and roll then we leave cold like a fall night 
Hey 5 
Hey5 I say that shit with all might 
Jump ina game I can’t fumble work got me grippin the ball tight 
Workout with the left make em fall right 
Ye 
Demons on me tryna find my fears 
Dark side of Ohood baby you can find me here 
Ye it’s getting live in here talking my shit I feel like big 5 in here
