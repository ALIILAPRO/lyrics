		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh!
The way you walk in my hood
Like we're feeling so good
Here I am saying my, my, my
Walking over so fresh
Walking over so fly
All shine, all time
Just talking that truth
No fake
Easy when you walk this way
I'm talking that truth
Okay, hold up!

But enough about me
Let's talk about you
Head down, all blue
You should be signing like these
Yeah, something like me
Make 'em go ooh, ooh, ooh

Just talking that truth
No fake
I truly wouldn't walk that way
Now we're talking that truth
Okay
This is the moment when everybody's in the light
So what you working with?

Drop that body like you're trying to let them know
Twist that high
You know the bass is on the low
Take that feeling like it's something that you stole
It ain't about, ain't about, it ain't about what you not
So what you working with?

Show me, show me
What you working with?
Show me, show me
What you working with?
Show me, show me
What you working with?
What?
What you working with?
What you working with?

Keep running that mouth
I don't need a full round
I make em' say wow
Hit em' like pow, pow, pow
A hundred thou

Yeah, I'm talking that truth
No fake
Easy when you walk this way
I'm talking that truth
Ok
This is the moment when everybody's in the light
So what you working with?

Drop that body like you're trying to let them know
Twist that high
You know the bass is on the low
Take that feeling like it's something that you stole
It ain't about, ain't about, it ain't about what you not
So what you working with?

Show me, show me
What you working with?
Show me, show me
What you working with?
Show me, show me
What you working with?
What?
What you working with?
What you working with?
(Work! Uh!)

Drop that body like you're trying to let them know
Twist that high
You know the bass is on the low
Take that feeling like it's something that you stole
Ooh, whoa!
Show me, show me
What you working with?
Show me, show me
What you working with?
Show me, show me
What you working with?

It ain't about, ain't about, it ain't about what you not
It ain't about, ain't about, it ain't about what you not
It ain't about, ain't about, it ain't about what you not
So what you working with?
