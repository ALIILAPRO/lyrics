		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw a friend that I once knew at a funeral
He took the time out to be seen
His eyes kept glancing to the hour hand on the gold watch
That he'd been given by a magazine

He didn't cry when the priest gave the sermon
Just pulled up the woolen collar on his fleece
Crossed his arms, gave a sigh and checked the time again
As he sat inches from the wife of the deceased

He catches raindrops on his window, it reminds him how he falls
From the stars back to our cities, where we've never felt so small

Rain drops from his window making puddles in his hands
He thinks how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands

He took a chauffeur driven car back to his hotel
Passing through the sick streets where he was born
He said, driver, what's happened to these buildings? 
They all look run down and so alone

He took a shower in the bathroom of his penthouse
Put the Do not Disturb on his door
When the maid came in the morning
She found him shivering on the bedroom floor

He catches raindrops on his window, it reminds him how he falls
From the stars back to our cities, where we've never felt so small

Rain drops from his window making puddles in his hands
He thinks how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands

He catches raindrops on his window, it reminds him how he falls
From the stars back to our cities, where we've never felt so small

Rain drops from his window making puddles in his hands
He thinks how quick the water's rising as another raindrop lands
