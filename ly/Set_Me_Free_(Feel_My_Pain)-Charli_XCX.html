		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am just crushed in the velvet
My heart is locked in a box
I am still sinking in black skylines
But now I want it to stop

I'm sailing high but I can't see
I've been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I'm falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

You've gotta set me free
You devoured my soul
'Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It's crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
'Cause you can feel my pain

You can feel my pain 
You can feel my pain 

I have been dancing with shadows
I have been calling your name
I feel the skin dripping from my bones
Your touch, it makes me insane

I'm sailing high but I can't see
I've been pushed around, up and down in a cloud
And I can't breathe
I'm falling down, down to my knees
You've gotta let me go, you've gotta help me out
You've gotta set me free

You've gotta set me free
You devoured my soul
'Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It's crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
'Cause you can feel my pain

I can't do this no more
You're tearing me apart
So give me one last kiss
And then I have to let you know

You've gotta set me free
You devoured my soul
'Cause I can taste your lips on my lips
Your kisses make me out of control
And I can feel my blood
It's crawling through my veins
And you close your eyes and you twist your smile
'Cause you can feel my pain

You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
You can feel my pain
