		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, I'm reloaded!
Pop my trunk and everybody get to running
Pop-
Pop my trunk and everybody get to running
Pop- pop my trunk, pop-pop my trunk
Pop-pop my trunk and everybody
Get to running, pop-
Chain on bling-bling, same old, same me
Game gone, checkmate, no scope, plain jane
I've been out here all day
Gone get mine the long way
Don't feel like you want me
But promise - you gone need

I need that cool in my Tech (they gone need)
Line 'em up get my respect (they gone need)
I know your bitch is a wreck (they gone need)
Recon' she good with that neck
(they gone need)
Been off a bean no limit (they gone need)
Too much for me to feel it (they gone need)
Faking, don't act like you get it
(they gone need)
Stashing them racks in the ceiling
(they gone need)
Flipping, I'm always on stretch (on stretch)
Dripping, I'm always on flex (drip-drip)
Copy, they copy, they cap (they cap)
Pull up, I'm copping that bag (that bag)
Too much to see all the sauce (the sauce)
Drippin' that Wock got me lost (got lost)
Feel like I'm wop, I'm the boss
(I'm the boss)
Re-up like thirty and off, woah

Pop my trunk and everybody get to running
Pop-
Pop my trunk and everybody get to running
Pop- pop my trunk, pop-pop my trunk
Pop-pop my trunk and everybody
Get to running, pop-
Chain on bling-bling, same old, same me
Game gone, checkmate, no scope, plain jane
I've been out here all day
Gone get mine the long way
Don't feel like you want me
But promise - you gone need

I need that brand new check (they gone need)
Smoking gone serve the sack (they gone need)
Trapping my life is a mess (they gone need)
Messing with work in the rex (they gone need)
Picture me floating, I'm rolling
(they gone need)
Remixing, drinkin' slow motion
(they gone need)
Too much they say that I'm hopeless
(they gone need)
Who wanna play with the hocus
(they gone need)
Flipping, I need all that back (that back)
Fuck you, no feelings attached (no feelings)
Talking, they talking, they cap (thay cap)
Hundred round drum, that's a lap
(that's a lap)
The mag hang low on my MAC (blah-blah)
That yappa that came with a strap (rrrah)
You run up I'm bussing it back (cap-cap)
Been finished my life is a wrap, woah

Pop my trunk and everybody get to running
Pop-
Pop my trunk and everybody get to running
Pop- pop my trunk, pop-pop my trunk
Pop-pop my trunk and everybody
Get to running, pop-pop-
