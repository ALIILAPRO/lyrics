		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
Aw

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going

I don't understand it
Yeah yeah!
Don't understand it
You just a dog gone
Aw

And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
Aw

Who gave you the right to shake my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy

Aw
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
