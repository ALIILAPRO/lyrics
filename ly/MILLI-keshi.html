I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say, milli, I'ma
I just made a, I just made a, I just made a
I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say, milli, I'ma
I just made a, I just made a, I just made a

Had to let 'em know
Been caught up, I been workin' too hard with mi amigos
I ain't need to see ya, I'm just bein' me though
Heard you threw my name around for status
Said you wanna call and talk about it
But I ain't got the time
I just pass you by (by)

I could cut ties with the silence
I can cut ties, I don't mind it
Stay pressed for a text back
'Bout some advice that you sent uninvited

'Cause I like all my vices
Said I like all my vices
Whatever the price is

I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say, milli, I'ma
I just made a, I just made a, I just made a
I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say it loud
I just made a milli, I'ma say, milli, I'ma
I just made a, I just made a, I just made a
