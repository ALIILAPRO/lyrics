		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Big Shaq, the one and only
Man's not hot, never hot
Skrrat, skidi-kat-kat
Boom

Two plus two is four, minus one that's three, quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, smoke trees
See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack, you man were ducking (you man ducked)
Hold tight, Asnee (my brotha), he's got the pumpy (big ting)
Hold tight, my man (my guy), he's got the frisbee
I trap, trap, trap on the phone, movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispies, hold tight my girl, Whitney (my G)
On the road doin' ten toes, like my toes (like my toes)
You man thought I froze, I see a peng girl, then I pose (chilin')
If she ain't on it, I ghost, hah, look at your nose (check your nose fam)
You donut, nose long like garden hose

I tell her man's not hot, I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)

Hop out the four-door with the .44, it was one, two, three and four (us man)
Chillin' in the corridor (yo), your dad is forty-four
And he's still callin' man for a draw (look at him), let him know
When I see him, I'm gonna spin his jaw (finished)
Take man's Twix by force (take it), send man shop by force (send him)
Your girl knows I've got the sauce (flexin'), no ketchup (none)
Just sauce (saucy), raw sauce
Ah, yo, boom, ah

The ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom, you dun know

I tell her man's not hot (man's not), I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot" (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
The girl told me, "Take off your jacket"
I said, "Babes, man's not hot"

Man can never be hot (never hot), perspiration ting (spray dat)
Lynx Effect (come on), you didn't hear me did you? (nah)
Use roll-on (use that), or spray
But either way, A-B-C-D (alphabet ting)

The ting goes skrrrahh, pap, pap, ka-ka-ka
Skidiki-pap-pap, and a pu-pu-pudrrrr-boom
Skya, du-du-ku-ku-dun-dun
Poom, poom

You dun know, Big Shaq
Man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot (never hot)
Forty degrees and man's not hot (come on)
Yo, in the sauna, man's not hot (never hot)
Yeah, skidika-pap-pap
