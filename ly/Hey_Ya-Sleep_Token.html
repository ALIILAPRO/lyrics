		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sure
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Cause the thought alone is
Killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
Cause we don't know how

Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya! Hey ya!

You think you've got it
Oh, you think you've got it
But "got it" just don't get it
'Til there's nothing at all we get together
Oh, we get together
But separate's always better
When there's feelings involved
And they say that "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, love the exception?
Oh why oh why oh why are we so in denial
When we know that we're not happy here?

Hey ya! Hey ya hey ya! Hey ya
Hey ya oh, hey ya
