		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sparkling grey
There my own veins

Any more than a whisper
Any sudden movement of my heart
And I know
I know I'll have to watch them pass away
Just get through this day

Give up your way
You could be anything
Give up my way
And lose myself?

Not today
That's too much guilt to pay

Sickened in the sun
You dare tell me you love me
But you held me down and screamed you wanted me to die,

Honey, you know
You know, I'd never hurt you that way
You're just so pretty in your pain

Give up my way
And I could be anything
I'll make my own way
Without your senseless hate
Hate
Hate
Hate

So run, run, run
And hate me if it feels good
I can't hear your screams anymore

You lied to me
But I'm older now
And I'm not buyin' baby

Demanding my response
Don't bother breaking the door down
I've found my way out
And you'll never hurt me again
