		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Your hair is dancing in the wind
Your eyes are burning up my skin
And I'm so happy when I see
That you are smiling back at me

You're leaving burn marks on the ground
Thank You, God, for what I've found
I don't know how, I don't know why
But you're my angel in the night

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side?

Prepare for lunch in three, two, one

I try my best to satisfy
But all you do is wave me goodbye
I don't know what I'm gonna do
But I'm so crazy about you

Even if I don't know where to start
Even if my love is tearing me apart
I just know that you and me
We were always meant to be

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
Let me hold you now
Just like days before you start to cry

You are my light in the dark
You are the beating in my heart
But that is not enough
Will I ever be by your side? (three, two, one)

You're my angel in the night
