		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I had another face
That didn't cry that didn't talk
You did it once you did it twice
And I don't want to try

Miss you-fuck-it-up
Miss you-fuck-it-up

I wish I had another face that didn't cry that didn't talk
You did it once you did it twice
And I don't need to try

Miss you-fuck-it-up
Miss you-fuck-it-up

Cock diesel, four loko on my head
Your muscles almost crash my face
