		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (One, two, three)
Funny, you know, you were the whole wide world
(I mean you)
You fell for the moment so you lied to the girl
(Didn't mean to)
I gave you the answer, it was in all the songs
(Did you even listen to the playlist?)
Then I gave you the option and you chose wrong
(You were an asshole, face it)

Should've been honest, should've told the truth
It's a shame I told my journal and my mirror
But I never told you

I meant don't go, it came out as goodbye
You said fine, when you should've said, "Or we could try?"
So, now we're seeing other people
And it's too late to tell you
But, man, you know, Yoko never broke up that band
You misunderstood The Beatles
Guess that's being twenty-two
You misunderstood a lot of things
But, yeah, I guess me too

You knew I was scared when you were driving too fast
(Can you just please listen?)
So many signs that you were driving right past
(And, no, I didn't) say how I felt when I felt it
Thought you knew how I felt, now I doubt it

I meant don't go, it came out as goodbye
You said fine, when you should've said, "Or we could try?"
So, now we're seeing other people
And it's too late to tell you
But, man, you know, Yoko never broke up that band
You misunderstood The Beatles
Guess that's being twenty-two
You misunderstood a lot of things
But, yeah, I guess me too

We should've talked it out when it happened
I couldn't talk to you
Got stuff to talk about, then I chickened out
I couldn't talk to you

I meant don't go, it came out as goodbye
You said fine, when you should've said, "Or we could try?"
So, now we're seeing other people
And it's too late to tell you
But, man, you know, Yoko never broke up that band
You misunderstood The Secret
The universe don't always come through

And Paul McCartney is not the villain
Sometimes you can't be the hero and tell the truth
And you misunderstood me leaving as something I wanted
I didn't want it at all
You should've put me above those people you didn't even know
You have a phone, you should've called
You have a phone, you should've called

You misunderstood The Beatles
Guess that's being twenty-two
You misunderstood a lot of things
You misunderstood me too
