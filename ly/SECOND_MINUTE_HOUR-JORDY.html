		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know when the party got so damn loud
Can't hear a thing so I'm just staring at your mouth
I'm leaning closer, can you show me how it feels on mine? (Yeah)
Touch your tattoos as we start walking down the stairwell
I left my jacket and my phone but, fuck it, oh well
I think you're trouble but I'm hoping that you'll prove me right

I want you to show me the worst of you
More than your words can do
Tonight
I'll be whatever you want me to be
Tell me your fantasies

Want you to love me for a second
For a minute, maybe hours
Touch my body like you mean it
Come and meet me in the shower
Got me rolling back my eyes
Like it's a super power
You can have me if you wanna stay another
Second, minute, hour

Lets keep it going, I don't care about the daylight
Don't wanna stop it 'til we finish at the same time
Tell me your secrets, baby, I can make you one of mine, oh yeah
Lose inhibitions, don't you worry when we're all alone
Show me the parts of your body only your mama knows
I never do this but I might let you take control, oh, oh, oh, oh

Want you to love me for a second
For a minute, maybe hours
Touch my body like you mean it
Come and meet me in the shower
Got me rolling back my eyes
Like it's a super power
You can have me if you wanna stay another
Second, minute, hour

I want you to show me the worst of you
More than your words can do
Tonight
I'll be whatever you want me to be
Tell me your fantasies

Want you to love me for a second
For a minute, maybe hours
Touch my body like you mean it
Come and meet me in the shower
Got me rolling back my eyes
Like it's a super power
You can have me if you wanna stay another
Second, minute, hour
