		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Silver dreams are meant to be gold so come on!
Feel free to redim your self and be strong
Be the light, the dark, the reason to cry
 the beast that you know will defeat all the stars yeah
Silver dreams are meant to be gold so move on!
 
shout the stars
call my name
Im the reason that you understand, yeahh
Silver dreams are meant to be gold so come on!
 
Now the pieces are allowed to be fit in the place
 the legends are about to be seen them again, ioou
Silver dreams are meant to be gold so move on! so move oooon  (solo)

Silver dreams are meant to be gold so come on!
Feel free to redim your self and be strong
Be the light, the dark, the reason to cry
 tHE beast that you know will defeat all the stars, YEAH
Silver dreams are meant to be gold so move on!
 
shout the stars
call my name
Im the reason that you understand, yeahh
Silver dreams are MADE OF STONE, so come on!
