		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time since you drove away
It's been a long time since you called my name
And i wonder
Do you ever think of me?
It's been a long time since you drove away
It's been a long time since you called my name
And i wonder
Do you ever think of me?
I tried to stay to strong but my heart is blue
Something always seem to bring me back to you
Cause i wonder
Do you ever think of me?
I be thinking about you every second, every day, I guess it's all the time
I gave you attention, lit up like fluorescent, I just wanted you to shine
I did it all for you
Respected the solitude
Invested in bonds and stocks
So I could go ball for you
Knew I would fall for you
But I stumbled right into your bad side
Yea the side that was hurt, but would act fine
Yea the side that was so into that guy
Yea the side in the parking lot last night
Yea the side that told me I was different
Convinced me that I had it all figured out
Believed every word from your mouth
Call me and you're at his house
What is that about?
It's been a long time since you drove away
It's been a long time since you called my name
And i wonder
Do you ever think of me?
I tried to stay to strong but my heart is blue
Something always seem to bring me back to you
Cause i wonder
Do you ever think of me?
It's been along time since I last saw you
And I hope your fine, I really hope your fine
And it's ok if you don't think of me too
