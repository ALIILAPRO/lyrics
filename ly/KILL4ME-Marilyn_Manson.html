		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's grab a gold switch blade
And make us a blood pact, babe
To love and to fuck and to only see ourselves
And remember this

Your hotel hall won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me

Bloody noses are just like roses
But what happens when we are betrayed?
Won't you drag him to the shed
And unload six rounds in their fucking face?
This is a sacrifice

Your hotel hall won't be so vacant
And I can tell that you ain't faking
Because I take death threats
Like the best of them

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me

Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?

Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
I love you enough to ask you again
Would you kill, kill, kill for me?
You won't be kissing me unless you kill for me

Kill, kill, kill for me
Kill, kill, kill for me

Sideways for attention, longways for results
Who are you going to cross?
