		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the autumn all I could see
Was the fall in the sunrise
I did not envision this prison
I just live in it for now
My sentence was a hundred years
Of words unheard
You said "you're doing this all wrong"
I'm doing this all wrong

It's getting harder to say what I want to say
I spent all my life in Hell and now
I'm trying to get away
And if you think you have
A reason for someone unqualified at everything
To keep hanging around
Then I would not let you down
No, I would not let you down

You keep taking me away
From the thunder and the rain
All the storms of yesterday
See the clouds part
It's just the way you say my name
That makes me see another day
A seething atheist prayed for an angel
I flicked my last cigarette
In the flickering street light
Now we've both burned out
Goodnight, I love you
Talk to you tomorrow
I drank too much
But I needed you to know

I wished wreckage towards the heavens
But I reckon I'm ready for the reckoning
I thought substance abuse could be cute
But now I dream of silence and gardens
If you think you need a needy soul
I'm here on my knees
And ready for the
Gates of gold
Let me in
Take my heart
Repent my sins
A crown of thorns
A face of tears
The past is dead
The future's here

You keep taking me away
From the thunder and the rain
All the storms of yesterday
See the clouds part
It's just the way you say my name
That makes me see another day
A seething atheist prayed for an angel
I flicked my last cigarette
In the flickering street light
Now we've both burned out
Goodnight, I love you
Talk to you tomorrow
I drank too much
But I needed you to know

I needed you tonight
I needed you tomorrow
I needed you to no end
I needed you to know
