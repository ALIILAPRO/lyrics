		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air
Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there
Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night
Everything was in place, everything was all right
But you were missing
Missing...

Last night I dreamed the sky went black
You were drifting down and you couldn't get back
You were lost and in trouble so far from home
I reached for you, my arms went to stone
I woke and you were missing
Missing...

I searched for something to explain
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves
Tell me baby where did you go
You were here just a moment ago

There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall
Your smell drifts through our bedroom
I wake, but I don't move
