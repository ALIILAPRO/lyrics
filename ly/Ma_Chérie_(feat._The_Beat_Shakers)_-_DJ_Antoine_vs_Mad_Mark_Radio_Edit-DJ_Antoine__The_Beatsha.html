		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie

Never seen a girl that's so jolie
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie, ma Chérie, oh oh oh ooh

When I look into your eyes
I see rainbows in the skies
Baby when you're close to me
I know you are ma Chérie, oh

We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie
Never seen a girl that's so jolie
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie, ma Chérie, oh oh oh ooh

We don't need to run more high
I'll be there to hold you tight
You and me, we are on fire
Ma Chérie, you're my desire, oh

We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie

We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie

Never seen a girl that's so jolie
All I want is you, you're ma Chérie

I will take you higher
I will take you higher
I will take you higher

You're my love
You're ma Chérie
