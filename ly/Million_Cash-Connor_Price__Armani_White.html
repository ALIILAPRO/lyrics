		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk in the building like I got a million on me in cash, ok
Tired of counting I hired accountants they doin the math, ok
Took it to places they never could make it I'm forming a path, ok
Not going back, ok
Not going back
Let's go

Not from this planet
Pull up in alien rocket ship
They try to study the way that I been doing it they gon' need a paleontologist
Feel like I'm one of the greats
Money I'm making a lot of it
I did a billion streams independent I swear that they barely acknowledge it
Okay that means that I gotta go harder
I'm flipping the switch
Battery charging, I'm ready to flip
Feel like I'm Arthur, I'm balling my fist
Gimme the call, never calling it quits
Bigger money bigger problems what they said to me
I ain't ever worry cause the stress don't get to me
Live and direct from the mind of my destiny
Diamonds and pressure I thrive in intensity
Low and behold
Sticking around when they told me to go
Calling me up, nobody home
Spinning these numbers like rotary phone
Low and behold
House made of glass they throwing these stones
Markham Ontario, locally grown
Went off the map, I'm globally known

Walk in the building like I got a million on me in cash, ok
Tired of counting I hired accountants they doin the math, ok
Took it to places they never could make it I'm forming a path, ok
Not going back, ok
Not going back

It's a one a million chance that you run up and not end up pissing in bags
I made a cornerstone out of a corner boy, papi store still got my pic in the glass
Aye why they keep messing with Jeep
I Messi the beef
Got burners and burnouts with second degrees
I just totaled my Tesla, ain't stressing receipts
I got back in that thing in like less than a week
I just parked in the building
Matter fact I just stomped in the building and shot through the ceiling
Got art in apartments I bought for a million
Put a cross on the wall then I auctioned the building
Now watch them claim my strip, issa cover up
Watch just sprained my wrist, get another one
Watch which names yall diss, pick a brother up
Watch who came out rich, with the bubble up
Stop it
She popping
I seen them girls too often
My money come from content
Cribs on market, whips self-parking
Wait cuz
I was just doing them walk-ins
Now I got a neighbor with a garden
Just to start my car I gotta log in
Chick on wood tree stump put log in
And I

Walk in the building like I got a million on me in cash, ok
Tired of counting I hired accountants they doin the math, ok
Took it to places they never could make it I'm forming a path, ok
Not going back, ok
Not going back
Let's go
