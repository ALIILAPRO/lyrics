		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't worry, baby
It goes right through me
I'm like the wind and my anger will disperse

Thin persecutors
Your twisted whispers
A horned reptile that is crawled upon the earth

I went for my usual walk
Just tell it like it is
Tell it like it was
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury

When darkness follows
And no tomorrows

It's all been decided
All spies deceptive
All bouncing voices down the echo chamber

Don't worry, baby
It goes right through me

I went for my usual walk
I went around the block
I just can't talk or reason with my executioner
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury

Been wasting trails
You talk in layers

I went for my usual walk
Didn't like this din't like it was
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury, executioner
Judge and jury

Don't worry, baby
It goes right through me
I'm like the wind and my anger will disperse
