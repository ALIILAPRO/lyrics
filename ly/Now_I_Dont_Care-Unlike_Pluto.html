		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spent a few years being afraid
Now it's my profession
Spent a few years hiding my flaws
But this is a confession
Spent a few years drowning in vodka
It was an obsession
By the end I was only a pawn
That was my progression

Now I don't care but I don't care
Now I don't care anymore, anymore
Now I don't care but I don't care
Now I don't care anymore, anymore

Spend a few years waiting in lines
Now they waited on me
Spend a few years nursing red eyes
Now you see the real me
Spend a few years spinning these lies
Hoping that they'd heal me
In the end I'm just chasing that high
I know you can feel me

Now I don't care but I don't care
Now I don't care anymore, anymore
Now I don't care but I don't care
Now I don't care anymore, anymore

Where did I see a sign
Where do I need advice
Hey, is this by design hey, that's fine
Wait, are you kidding me
All the falsehoods and misery
All the bullshit and memories killing me

Now I don't care but I don't care
Now I don't care anymore, anymore
Now I don't care but I don't care
Now I don't care anymore, anymore
