		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't you see
That everyone is dying?
The animals are crying
Religions are dividing
As my family keeps on fighting
As my family keeps

Now I'm caught in something
My eternal suffering
Looking for the meaning of it all
But I got nothing
This internal sadness now I fade the blackness
Don't know where I go when I die
Must be better than this

And I'm here
Just waiting for you to come home
And I'm screaming all on my own
With the revolver and a note
Will you please pick up the phone?
And I'm waiting for you to come home
And I'm screaming all on my own
With the revolver and a note
Will you please come back home?

Ain't it sad when you got nowhere to go?
Got no place to call your home
Burden to everyone you know
And I try
Just not to think about my life
So I do another line
It keeps me numb just for the night
It keeps me numb just for the night

Now I'm caught in something
My eternal suffering
Looking for the meaning of it all
But I got nothing
This internal sadness now I fade the blackness
Don't know where I go when I die
Must be better than this

And I'm here
Just waiting for you to come home
And I'm screaming all on my own
With the revolver and a note
Will you please pick up the phone?
And I'm waiting for you to come home
And I'm screaming all on my own
With the revolver and a note
Will you please come back home?
