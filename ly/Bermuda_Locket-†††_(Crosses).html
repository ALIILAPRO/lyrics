		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got to tell you something
I wanna view your dreams
I wanna pull out your crazy, pour it over me
I might take you somewhere far across the seas
I need your faith, I need your everything

As you enter into my curse
Our dreams reverse and the demons burst
So I wait, anticipate to meet you tonight
Come this way, I will bring your dreams to life

I wanna move you somewhere close to ecstasy
I might tell you things some which you won't believe
I wanna view the signals that control your brain
I need a taste, I need your everything

As you enter into my curse
Our dreams reverse and the demons burst
So I wait, anticipate to meet you tonight
Just come this way, I will bring your dreams to life

From the first time I saw you till now
I have counted the years that have gone by
We'll release those demons tonight, tonight

So I wait, anticipate to meet you tonight
Just come this way, I will bring your dreams to life
So I save this occasion to meet you tonight
Just come this way, I will bring your dreams to life
