		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  14th of June, 1912, I woke up feeling sprightly
Woke out of bed, thought, "Mama, you've done me proud"
Looked over the kitchen sink, thought wow, that's my house
I paid the mortgage, it's mine

Got up, cup of coffee, went down nice, didn't it?
Made me feel a bit moodkey
Then I stood up straight and proud, and I knew I was a man
Thought, "Mama, you've done me proud"

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man
We wear friendly smiles all night
Get bladdered on Lucifer's grain
Pray it never stop
Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

So the car pulls up and I go downstairs
I'm wearing my best trousers and I'm feeling happy
Sunlight is shining down
I'm wearing Topsham blue shoes
With a crisp lime trouser line
Beautiful it is, the day's beautiful too

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man
We wear friendly smiles all night
Get bladdered on Lucifer's grain
Pray it never stop
Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man

Crash bang, when I meet her, she's beautiful, she is
She stands alone, not caring who's looking
Her name's Rebecca Trollop and I fall right into her trap
Bang, it's disgusting

Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man
We wear friendly smiles all night
Get bladdered on Lucifer's grain
Pray it never stop
Here comes the cocaine man
Here comes a man
