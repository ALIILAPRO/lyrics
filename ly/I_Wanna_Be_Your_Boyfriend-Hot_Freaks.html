		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
Woo!
Ooh, I'm in love
It's a mystery
When I see you out at night
I start to get dizzy
Before I see you I pick out some things to say
Don't want to sound foolish and waste my chance away
Oh, I'm not gonna make the same mistakes
I'm not gonna run
Just pick the boy you like
I've got my hopes set

I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna go on walks with you
I wanna have long talks with you
You can be my girlfriend
You can be my girlfriend
I'll compliment you frequently
I wanna treat you decently
La la la

Ooh, you're in demand
It's impossible
When I see you out at night
All the guys are crowding around
They're telling you the same things that I planned to say
I thought I was unique
Maybe I'm not that way

I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna be your boyfriend
I wanna go on walks with you
I wanna have long talks with you
You can be my girlfriend
You can be my girlfriend
I'd compliment you frequently
I wanna treat you decently
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
