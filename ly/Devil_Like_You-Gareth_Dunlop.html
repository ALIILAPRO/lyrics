		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in too deep
You're the fix I've come to need
Ooh no, look what you've done to me
You caught me off guard
Then tore my world apart
Ooh no, this thing has gone too far

It's too late
I can't escape
Only a devil like you
Could make me sin like I do
I've got a weakness
I am a fool
For a devil
For a devil like you
For a devil like you

You're guilty, as charged
My soul bares the marks
Ooh no, I'm just as bad as you are
You are my wicked thrill
I just can't get my fill
Ooh no, this kind of living could kill

It's too late
I can't escape
Only a devil like you
Could make me sin like I do
I've got a weakness
I am a fool
For a devil
For a devil like you
For a devil like you

Only a devil like you
Could make me sin like I do
I've got a weakness
I am a fool
For a devil
For a devil like you
For a devil like you
For a devil like you
For a devil like you
