		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With your love you gave me life
Not knowing right from wrong
You always know that I'll be strong
You set me free and you paid the price
You inspired me in my art
With the rebel in your heart
You gave nothing for nothing
But the spirit of you word happiness could bring
I learned to always do the best I can
You taught me to be true and I never ran
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
Left all alone in the cold
Nowhere to go so I run like the wild
Stumbling, falling
Crying calling you...
As they gave nothing in return
You became their slave although you were brave
You still teach me what is left to learn
Though they brought you to the grave
You will remain to ease my pain
