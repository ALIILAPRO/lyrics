		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I, I've been headed for a breakdown
Every time I leave my house
Well, it feels just like a shakedown
Between the street sweepers and the pushers are the lawyers
Who may as well be butchered
Between the small timing hustlers who all, seem to feed upon each other

[Chorus]
Oh God where you been?
Hanging out in that old violin?
While I've been waiting for you, to pull me through

Lately I, every time I try to lie down
My mind just gets away
I can't even close my eyes now
Between the big fish ambition, and the lovers
Using words as ammunition
Between the woods planks I've been pacing 
And this impossible dream that I've been chasing

[Chorus]

Oh God
Oh God
Oh God where you been?
Hanging out in that old violin?
While I've been waiting for you, to pull me through
