		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a journey 
So hard to describe 
Your harbour so small 
The ocean so wide 
Spin the wheel, spin the wheel 
Go wherever she spins 
Surrender to this wave that's rolling in 

Homing fingers 
Starting to dig 
Raising expectations 
Lifting the lid 
There's a show going down 
Going deeper within 
I long to lose myself 
Inside your skin 

What a feeling under the stars 
My body's rotating from venus through mars 
There's a war going on 
Between my head and my heart 
I wonder how they grew so far apart 

I'm so shaken, about to explode 
The myth of kissing princes 
Is they turn into toads 
There's a war going on 
Between the sun and the moon 
Before they come to terms
We'll be consumed 

Oh my god, please take me now 
I'm ready for ascension 
If I only knew how 
Give me wings give me wings 
Now I'm stuck on the ground 
Recieve this blood and bones 
I'm homeward bound 

See the statue growing wings 
This singer was a virgin 
Until he conceived 
God is love, god is love 
And her lover I'll be 
I long to leave the world in ecstacy 

Dance with me around this fire 
The dance of bad angels who'd love to fly higher 
God is love, god is love 
And her lover I'll be 
I long to lead the world in ecstacy
