		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was a rainy night when he came into sight
Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat
So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile, so we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain
Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight
Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night

All I want to do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I want to do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well
We made magic that night, Oh, he did everything right
He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily
And in the morning when he woke, all I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower, you are the seed
We walked in the garden, we planted a tree
Don't try to find me, please don't you dare
Just live in my memory, you'll always be there

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All want to do is make love to you
I've got lovin' arms to hold on to

Oh, oooh, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day, we came round the same way
You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes
I said please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, ooh
Was the one little thing that you can

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I want to do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me to

All night long, all night long, all night long, all night long 
All I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do, all I want to do
All I want to do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew, yeah
