Rob a nigga bare face, no mask
I don't give a fuck, put the cash in the bag
I pulled up with a stick
Then pulled off real fast
Niggas think they the shit but
They rеally be ass
12 lookin' for me, I'm doin' the dash
It's a CPN, givе a fuck if I crash
I'm rollin' off X, I just took a dab
I'm high as fuck, it's makin' me laugh (Haha)
I'm in New York, you can get stabbed
I'm in LA with a Glock on my lap
I'm in the A with a Glock on my lap
Keep my Glock every day anywhere
I can have it i keep my Glock on me
I treat it like a bad bitch
I keep me a Glock, I can't go out sad, bitch
The last nigga that ain't have it ain't
Live another day to grasp it

I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
Move wrong, you know I'ma shoot
I keep me a stick, I keep me a Groot
I'm totin' a K, ain't talkin' Kahoot
I fuck on your bae, I fuck on your boo
These niggas be gay, I mean they be fruit
Dressin' formal today, got a Raf Simons suit
(yeah)
You know my kicks Maison Mihara too (yeah)
It's Bottega or Rick when
I'm rockin' some boots (yeah)
I rock this shit, make it look cool
You rock this shit, make it look poop (Oh)
Your fit ain't nothin'
My fit somethin' to do (Oh God)
That bitch ain't nothin'
She smash the whole crew
Lil' bitch, I ain't done, lil' bitch
I ain't through (Done)
After we catch 'em lackin'
We catchin' you too (Done)
All you can hear is "Doo doo doo doo doo"
(Ew) you can run
You can hide but we slidin' on you
Send a guy in the sky and he glidin' on you
(You)
Do whatever it take to get the job through
(Oh) there go 12, I'm like "Aw, shoot"
(There go 12)
If they trail, we gon' all shoot

Rob a nigga bare face, no mask
I don't give a fuck, put the cash in the bag
I pulled up with a stick
Then pulled off real fast
Niggas think they the shit but
They really be ass
12 lookin' for me, I'm doin' the dash
It's a CPN, give a fuck if I crash
I'm rollin' off X, I just took a dab
I'm high as fuck, it's makin' me laugh (Haha)
I'm in New York, you can get stabbed
I'm in LA with a Glock on my lap
I'm in the A with a Glock on my lap
Keep my Glock every day
Anywhere I can have it
I keep my Glock on me
I treat it like a bad bitch
I keep me a Glock, I can't go out sad, bitch
The last nigga that ain't have it ain't
Live another day to grasp it

I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
I clutch on whoever look at me
(I clutch every day)
