		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's like were connected, it's like I'm infected
Saw you and expected something would go down
This feeling's electric, it came undetected
Like I've been selected and I don't know how

Cause there's something about you and me tonight
There's something do do got me feeling right
Cause you're so magnetic, yeah I feel ecstatic
I'm done wait and wait, I'm done

I'm done waiting
I'm done, I'm done, wait, wait, wait
I'm I'm done waiting
I'm done wait

Waiting for love, (I'm done) waiting for love, (I'm done)
Waiting for love, (I'm done) waiting for love, (I'm done)
I'm good enough inside, caught up in the strobe lights
I wasn't looking for somebody till I found you
Waiting for love, (I'm done) waiting for love, (I'm done)
Waiting for love, (I'm done) waiting for love, (I'm done)
I'm good enough caught up in the strobe lights
I wasn't looking for someone till I found you

No, my mind is made up
And I just can't say stop
I'm dreaming can't wake up, can't turn around
My hearts in a headlock, try moving but I'm stuck
Was all just a lie before you

Cause there's something about you and me tonight
There's something you do got me feeling right
Cause you're so magnetic, yeah I feel ecstatic
I'm done waiting and wait, I'm done waiting for love
Waiting for love, waiting for love, waiting for love
I'm good enough inside, caught up in the strobe lights
I wasn't looking for someone till I found you
Waiting for love, waiting for love
Waiting for love, waiting for love, I'm good enough caught up in the strobe lights
I wasn't looking for someone till I found you

I wasn't looking for somebody till I found you
