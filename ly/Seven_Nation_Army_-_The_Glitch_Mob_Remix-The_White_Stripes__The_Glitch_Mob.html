		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

And the message coming from my eyes
Says, "leave it alone"

Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
That ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

And a feeling coming from my bones
Says, "find a home"

I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work this job
Make the sweat drip out of every pore
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the lord
Words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me "go back home"

Yeah
