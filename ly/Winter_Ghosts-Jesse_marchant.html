		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the window up in the bedroom
I can hear the storm come
From many roads away
And it brings the night
If the ones who died sit around me
I hope they're going to stay
And that maybe you'll arrive
In the rain that's rolling in
These summer nights
I feel you on my skin

Winter came as a load
Frozen down to the bone
I lived here half asleep
Walking nights to the road
Empty, drunk and alone
In hopes you'd come to me
Before the morning
Before you're running
But why are you running?
Where are you running?
Home?

Once I knew you
Lay my head upon your lap
Once I knew you
In your eyes a calming light
Once I knew you
And your hand upon my back
Once I knew you
In a life ain't coming back
