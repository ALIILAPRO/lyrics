		  Hmm, hmm, hmm
Yeah

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I can cast a spell
But you can't tell
Mix special brew
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Instantly I will appear
'Cause

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I can sense your needs
Like rain on to the seeds
I can make 'em rhyme
Of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
That's what I got (oh yeah, yeah)

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now, every one from A to Z
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I ain't braggin' 'cause I'm the one
You just ask me, ooh, it shall be done
And don't bother to compare
I've got it
Oh, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah
