		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get defensive and insecure
My own worst critic
Behind a closing door
I'm fragile and fractured, that's for sure, ooh

I burned myself down to the ground
Oh, can I ask of you to treat me soft and tender
Love me hard and true (umm)

Keep my heart from building walls
So high, you can't get through
Treat me soft and tender

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

I'll just keep repeating it
In case, you didn't catch me

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that
Can you love me like that

You see the world in colors
I see in black and white
Paint me a picture
Out of the lines that I live in all of the time

Treat me soft and tender
And love me hard and true

Ah, I burned myself down to the ground
Oh, can I ask of you to treat me soft and tender

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

I just keep repeating it
In case, you didn't catch me

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

Sunshine left today
Got caught in the rain all alone
Can you come and pick me up from my blues 
Or am I late to ask you love me soft and tender

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

I just keep repeating it
In case, you didn't catch me

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that

I just keep repeating it
In case you didn't catch me

Ooh, can you love me like
Can you love me like
Can you love me like that
