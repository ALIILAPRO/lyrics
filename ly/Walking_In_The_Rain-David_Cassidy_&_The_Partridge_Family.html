		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want him, and I need him, 
And someday someway woo I'll meet him 
He'll be kind of shy, and real good lookin' too 
And I'll be certain he's my guy by the things he'll like to do

Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain) 
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above 
And being so in love 

When he's near me, I'll kiss him, 
And when he leaves me woo I'll miss him 
Though sometimes we'll fight, I won't really care 
And I'll know it's gonna be alright 'cause we've got so much we share 

Like walking in the rain (like walking in the rain) 
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above 
And being so in love 

(Johnny) no no he'll never do 
(Bobby) no it isn't him too 
They would never no they'd never never ever ever love 
Walking in the rain (like walking in the rain) 
And wishing on the stars (and wishing on the stars) up above 
And being so in love 

Oh oh oh where can he be oh oh
