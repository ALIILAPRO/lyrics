		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't see my mistakes
'Cause to you they're not mistakes
When there's nothing left to say
You still hear me anyway

The nights where I blow up with no excuse
The way that you show up and pull me through
No pretty lies, just the ugly truth
And you feel the same way too

Being with you is easy, easy as breathing
Only you can see me when the lights go out
The way you complete me, so incompletely
Only you can see me when the lights go out
Only you can see me when the lights go out

And when my head's a mess
To you it's making sense

The nights where I blow up with no excuse
The way that you show up and pull me through
No pretty lies, just the ugly truth
And you feel the same way too

Being with you is easy, easy as breathing
Only you can see me when the lights go out
The way you complete me, so incompletely
Only you can see me when the lights go out
Only you, only you, only you
Only you can see me when the lights go out
Only you, only you, only you
Only you can see me when the lights go out

The nights where I blow up with no excuse
The way that you show up and pull me through
No pretty lies, just the ugly truth
And you feel the same way too

Being with you is easy, easy as breathing
Only you can see me when the lights go out
The way you complete me, so incompletely
Only you can see me when the lights go out
Only you, only you, only you
Only you can see me when the lights go out
Only you, only you, only you
Only you can see me when the lights go out

Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you, only you, only you
Only you can see me when the lights go out
