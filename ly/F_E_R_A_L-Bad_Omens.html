		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That crooked smile doesn't hide your greed
All of your hypocrisies
I'm gonna tell everyone the truth
Live in denial while your insides bleed
And I will keep you company
So I can watch when your world's consumed

I was there when it began
And I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in

Once I've sunk my teeth in

I won't take part in your complacency
Or words you don't really mean
All that you did was light my fuse
Soon you'll be nothing but a memory
And I won't keep you company
When everything falls apart for you

I was there when it began
And I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in
I was there when it began
And I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in

I'll take my time with you
Once I've sunk my teeth in

I was there when it began
And I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in
I was there when it began
And I'll be there to watch it end
I'll take my time once I've sunk my teeth in

Once I've sunk my teeth in
