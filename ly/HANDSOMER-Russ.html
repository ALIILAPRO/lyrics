		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up and the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up and the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine

Balenciaga slides so she slidin' (slidin')
Said it's 'cause the vibe, mmm, she lyin'
We both know that I'm a walkin' lick (lick, lick, lick)
Why you think she all up on my dick? (Dick, dick, dick)
It's cool though I ain't mad at ya, I let her go like Passenger
You slept on me like lavender, my body like a map
Your tongue just turn into a traveler 
You started throwin' ass, you think that I'ma throw some cash on you 
But I'm just clappin' you, I know what's up

I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up and the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up and the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine

The possibility of paper
Got her tryna tell me I should date her (date her)
She just tryna play me (play me)
I just play it cool, then I play her (play her)
Baby, hate the game, not the player (player)
I'm 5'6 but the money make me 6'5
She said "I love your songs," I told her to list five
I'm 5'6 but the money make me 6'5
She said "I love your songs," I told her to list five

I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up and the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up and the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
