		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There came the storm that night
It blew out the city lights
A bit too dark inside
We lit some candlelights up

Nobody's home
We melt
Into the candlelights
Poured you some of the wine
And then you filled up mine too
You kept me warm that night
Under those candlelights
Was trippin hard outside
At last, a safer place to hide

Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh-ooh-ooh

Whatever happened that night
We just won't recite
Now those moments we'd had
All snuffed out like those candlelights

All snuffed like candlelights
Left up to broken memories
All snuffed like candlelights
Only a glimmer in me now
Snuffed out like candlelights
Those moments we just won't recite

There came the storm that night
It blew out the city lights
A bit too dark inside
We lit some candlelights up
You kept me warm that night
Under those candlelights
Was trippin hard outside
At last, a safer place to hide

Whatever happened that night
We just won't recite
Now those moments we'd had
All snuffed out like those candlelights

Woo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
