		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shut up and listen
Look at my eyes
Don't ever lie
I need you to tell me the truth

You gotta be clear
Tell me the details
I gotta know
As much as it hurts
I need you to tell me the truth

Shut up and listen
Look at my eyes
Don't ever lie
I need you to tell me the truth

You gotta be clear
Tell me the details
I gotta know
As much as it hurts
I need you to tell me the truth

Bet you like it when I show up in a gown
Let my body work it out, slow your grind
Don't tell me to stop it, just let me on top and
Baby you want it, yeah

When you tie me, do it slow, forget the time
Move position, take me south, ease your mind
Don't tell me to stop it, just let me on top and
Baby you want it, yeah

Slow it down if you need to
Show me how just to please you, ooh
Work it out in the sheets
Do me and see through
I want you feel you

Shut up and listen (shut up and listen to me now)
Look at my eyes
Don't ever lie
I need you to tell me the truth

You gotta be clear
Tell me the details
I gotta know
As much as it hurts
I need you to tell me the truth

Shut up and listen
Look at my eyes
Don't ever lie
I need you to tell me the truth

You gotta be clear
Tell me the details
I gotta know
As much as it hurts
I need you to tell me the truth

Push you back against the wall, I grab your neck
You push me to the side and throw me on the bed
You grab my arms and slowly sit on me
You whisper in my ear now let's begin

Let's begin (let's begin, oh)
Let's begin
Let's begin
Let's begin (let's begin)
You whisper in my ear now let's begin
Let's begin (let's begin, oh)
Let's begin
Let's begin
Let's begin (let's begin)
You whisper in my ear now let's begin
