		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, you gotta get high like this
You gotta get high like me
You gotta get high like this
You gotta get high like me
You gotta get high like this
You gotta get high like me
You gotta get high like this
You gotta get high like me

I'm fuckin' these bitches, alright
I'm havin' my way, alright, uh
My fingers, they muhfuckin' tight
My eyes are open, I'm high
I can't believe I can die
I just realized I was high
I was seventeen on the mic'
But I'm tryna be Carti, not Mike
I'm a gigolo, ho, I bite
My whole career, they bite me
Some niggas, they thinkin' they faster than me
Somebody should tell them they dyin'
I'm done with these niggas and dissin'
I just be pissin', I don't give a fuck
I'm knowin' when you move, boy
Bitch, I'm tryna tell, your ho gon' fuck
All you ever do is copy, all you ever do is mock
Why you talkin' about me?
If you really got a problem, we can handle that problem, yeah, body to body
Buffy the body, my bitch got body, Buffy the body
My bitch got body, yeah, my bitch got body, yeah, my bitch got body
Screech like a hyaena when I get a body

Travel the world, huh, huh, schyeah, hol' up
On tour with your girl
And it's not my world, it's Mollyworld
And she's not my girl, she's Mali's girl
You play with my top, get a referral
Put 'em in smoke, you get refeered

Put 'em in a coff', put 'em in a coff'
Put 'em in a, uh, put 'em in a, uh, put 'em in a coff'
I jump out the Lamb' truck, she thought that I lost it
I jump off my red eye, push out, then I go to Boston
I stay with like ten thots, Austin
Everything is awesome, F-A, fuckin' awesome
Make sure you tell them niggas: Watch me
They don't know how I cross some
Double 0, yeah, the biggest ever, we just gettin' ready for the crossover
Tell the driver he need to pull over, let this bitch come top, then over
Nosebleed, yeah, high speed, huh, I can get the rollover
You been actin' funny and you fake poppin', yeah, just like hot soda
Y'all niggas don't know how to grow up, I been a OG since I was younger
All of my friends are dead, leave 'em in the cold, put 'em in the tundra
I go Ray Charles, I cannot see her, I make her fumble
I was just in Texas with Aaliyah, her pussy a jungle
They wanted this album to be offset, but I told them: I'm comin' normal
When you play this shit, wear a white tux', young nigga, like you in a formal, ha
It's hot, bitch, it's scorchin'
On the porch, New Yorkin'
She still tryna find young Jordan

I was twenty-four when I had lil' Onyx
(Then I had a daughter, I had a daughter too)
Twenty-seven when I had Yves
Now I can finally sleep
I let the sun
I let the sun save these hoes
I let the moon
I let the moon save these hoes
