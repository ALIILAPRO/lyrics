		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've done it before, I've seen it before
Tears splashin' the floor when I open the door for her
She actin' like a whore and I'ma let her
Learned from Project Pat, pimpin', got a masters
Girl improvise, look me in my eyes and lie to me
Lie to me, act like I'll believe anything
Sex on the beach and in the backseat
This could be us

So back to what I was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (money make the girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying (money make the girl go down)

No keys to crank this Mercedes
I ball like Tracy McGrady
Before that girl says anything
She gotta say please (say please)
And I know they really wish we would ball 'til we fall
I'm the big bad wolf, it's a full moon, y'all
Toss the money in the air, girl
Watch how your dreams hit the floor
Wait 'til I get the buzz off this drug
Damn girl, you way too fine for a local club
Killin' someone's vibe should be a fuckin' crime
Wasted so much time, should be a fuckin' crime

So back to what I was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (money make the girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying (money make the girl go down)

Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, baby
Spin the bottle
Truth or dare, nah you don't want no problem
Spin the bottle, spin the fuckin' bottle
If you the reason why it's empty, spin the fuckin' bottle
Truth or dare, no, no, you don't want no problem
You don't want no problem, bitch you must want problems

So back to what I was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
I'm high, I hope I don't sound crazy (money make the girl go down)
Fuck what them niggas was saying (money make the world go 'round)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the girl go down)
This could be us but you're playing (money make the world go 'round)
But shit, that's all I was saying (money make the girl go down)
