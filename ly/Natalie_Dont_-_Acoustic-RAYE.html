		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been twenty four hours, coulda bought me flowers
You know I ain't been happy (nuh-uh), maybe call me in an hour
Do you wish that it was her though singin' songs in the shower?
Baby, no, I can't help it (nuh-uh), what you showed me about her

While you steppin' to him I can see
When you know he belongs to me
You know I'm missin' the sunrise behind his eyes
He is thinkin' of you

Oh, no, there she goes
To take away my man
I'm beggin' her not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't

Oh, no, there she goes
To take him from my hands
I'm beggin' her not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't

He saw it, saw her walkin' like a model
But I won't let it depress me
So I bought another bottle
When you bend over like that
Can't you see my sorrow?
When you bend over like that
You know his eyes gon' follow, oh

While you starin' at him I can see
When you know he belongs to me
You know I'm missin' the sunrise behind his eyes
He is thinkin' of you

Oh, no, there she goes
To take away my man
I'm beggin' her not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't

Oh, no, there she goes
To take him from my hands
I'm beggin' her not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't

I'm still awake at six in the morning
Oh, I know you callin', Natalie
Please feel bad, don't text back
Leave my man like Dolly
Beg Jolene just 'cause you can don't take him please (please, please)

Oh, no, there she goes
To take away my man
I'm beggin' her not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't

Oh, no, there she goes
To take him from my hands
I'm beggin' her not him
Don't, don't, don't do it, no, no
Don't do it, Natalie, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't do it

Don't, don't, don't, don't do it, no, no (please don't)
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do it
