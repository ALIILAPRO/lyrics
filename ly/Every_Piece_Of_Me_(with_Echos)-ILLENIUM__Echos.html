		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

Your energy holds on to me
Still wrapped up in your strings
Those words you speak
They cut so deep
I still feel everything

I am not your enemy
So why do we keep fighting?
I am not your enemy
So why are you still trying

To take me down
When every piece of me is on the ground
To break me down
When every piece of me still needs you now

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh

I see your pain, it's on your face
You're talking through your teeth
Can't rearrange my will to stay
And you're making it the worse 'cause you know me

I am not your enemy
So why do we keep fighting?
I am not your enemy
So why are you still trying

To take me down
When every piece of me is on the ground
To break me down
When every piece of me still needs you now

Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
Whoa, oh, whoa, oh
