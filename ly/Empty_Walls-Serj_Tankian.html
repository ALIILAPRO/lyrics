		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your empty walls
Your empty walls
Pretentious attention
Dismissive apprehension
Don't waste your time, on coffins today
When we decline, from the confines of our mind
Don't waste your time, on coffins today

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication

I want you to be
Left behind those empty walls
Taunt you see
From behind those empty walls

Those empty walls
When we decline, from the confines of our mind
Don't waste your time, on coffins today

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication

Don't you see their bodies burning?
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication

I want you to be
Left behind those empty walls

Taunt you see
From behind those empty walls
I want you to be
Left behind those empty walls
I taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls
The walls

From behind those empty walls
I loved you (From behind those empty walls)
Yesterday, before (From behind those empty walls)
You killed my family (The walls)

Don't you see their bodies burning
Desolate and full of yearning
Dying of anticipation
Choking from intoxication?
Don't you see their bodies burning (I want you)
Desolate and full of yearning (to be)
Dying of anticipation (left behind)
Choking from intoxication? (those empty walls)

I want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
I want you to be left behind those empty walls
Taunt you to see from behind those empty walls
From behind those empty walls
From behind those fucking walls
From behind those goddamn walls
Those walls, those walls
