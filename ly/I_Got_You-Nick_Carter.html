		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People tell me, you stay where you belong
But all my life I've tried 
To prove them wrong
They say I'm looking for 
Something that can't be found
They say I'm missing out
If my feet don't touch the ground

But there are moments 
When you can't deny what's true
Just an ordinary day
Like when I met you

It's funny how life can take new meaning
You came and changed what I believe in
The world on the outside is trying to pull me in
But they can't touch me 
'Cause I got you
I got you, oh yeah

I want to thank you
For all of the things you've done
And most for choosing me
To be the one 

It's funny how life can take new meaning
You came and changed what I believe in
The world on the outside is trying to pull me in
But they can't touch me
'Cause I got you

And it hits me when I reach for you
That I'm afraid you won't be there
Maybe I am in too deep 
But I don't care

(Where would I belong)
I got you
Yeah
I want to prove them wrong
I've got you yeah
You can't deny what's true no
They can't touch me, yeah yeah

I got you
I got you
I got you baby

You can't deny what's true
No, they can't touch me
'Cause I got you
