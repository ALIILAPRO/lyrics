		  Ooh, whoa, ooh, whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa

Yeah, I forgot
Just how dramatic
You always got
But you hit the spot
Can't imagine
Can't imagine
Imagine
'Cause you're twenty-two
You've got the magic
And none to lose
'Cause you got the moves yeah
Can't imagine
Can't imagine
Imagine

Zero to oh my god
Sometime I can't hold my tongue
And I'm just sayin how I feel
Oh we finna be on top
I'd never change for you
Some would say I would
They don't know the half of it
Oh they don't know the truth
So I say

Yeah, I forgot
Just how dramatic
You always got
But you hit the spot
Can't imagine
Can't imagine
Imagine
'Cause you're twenty-two
You've got the magic
And none to lose
'Cause you got the moves yeah
Can't imagine
Can't imagine
Imagine

Oh baby you say the name
It's Always Never playin'
She want her own story
She wanna taste the fame
So I've got some for you nah 
I got some for you nah nah nah if
You want it, want it, want it, want it, ooh

It's the same story
It's the same story
It's the same story
