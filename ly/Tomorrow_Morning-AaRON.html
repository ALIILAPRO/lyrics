		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There you go my love

Dark hair homeless child
Heading to the world
My sigh in your bag

On our way back home
Somewhere by the sea
I have lost your hand
Trying to be me

What was the plan
Being wild and untamed
Too wild is the dream
When you're not a team
Anymore
The streets are dark you stole their light
How can I see without your eyes
Can you hear the wolf cry
Given for his love for the moonlight

All I got is yours
What you are is mine
Can't you hear the silence
That replaces this lie

And I see the world
Through my mortal dreams
Needles in my shoes
Needles in my dreams

What was the plan
Being wild and untamed
Too wild is the dream

When you're not a team
Anymore
The streets are all dark
You stole their light
How can I see without your eyes
Can you hear the wolf-cry
Given for his love for the moonlight

Have you sang the wind
Have you danced the rain
Before all is ended
Have you lived my friend

So let's sing for the drift,
A high beam in our laughs
Let's dance for the pain
That gives life to our hearts

The streets are dark
'Cause you stole their light
How can I see without your eyes
Can you hear the wolf-cry
Given for his love for the moonlight

The streets are all dark
What will I see without your eyes
The streets are dark  
What will I see with my own eyes
