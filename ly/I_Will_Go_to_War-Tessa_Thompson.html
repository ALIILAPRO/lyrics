		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ran the whole way
Ran the whole thing
Never ran away
Never been afraid
Never goin' to break
Never halfway

I don't know if I can take it
I can't take it, I can't take it anymore
I don't know if I can do it
If it wasn't for who I do it for

Doesn't make sense but it makes dollars
Doesn't make sense but it makes dollars
And I wanna spend it all on you
Against the world but I'm with you
I will go to war

Don't let you down (Don't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down)
I will go to war (I will go to war)
I will go to war (I will go to war)
Don't let you down (Don't let you down)
Won't let you down (Won't let you down, down)
I will go to war (I will go to war)
I will go to war
