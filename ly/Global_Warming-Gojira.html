		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Four hundred thousand years ago
They came from outer space
And gave us life here
And we are taking everything for granted
I don't think we should do this now
And when I see the smoke around
I feel like I'm not
From humankind down there
I feel like glaciers are my eyes
And mountains are my head
My heart is ocean
And I feel all alone
Because everybody's wrong
I feel the living
What is this thing that we call hate?
And that's inside of me?
Get out of here!

A world is down
And none can rebuild it
Disabled lands are evolving
My eyes are shut, a vision is dying
My head explodes
And I fall in disgrace

I hold my inner child within
And tell him not to cry
"Don't fear the living"
One day you will stand as a king
And no fear can erase
This light below us
Each one of us is now engaged
This secret we all have
This truth is growing
And as a warrior I have to fight
I can already feel
The love I'll discover

I had this dream, our planet surviving
The guiding stars always growing
And all the worlds
The fates, all the countries
They're all rebuilding at the same time
I never fell and always believed in
We could evolve and get older
Open thy eyes and let all this flow in
Now see a new hope is growing inside

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing

We will see our children growing
