		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

Thumping through the pages of my fantasies
Pushing all the mercy down, down, down
I'll see you try to take a swing at me
Come on, gonna put on the ground, ground, ground

Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny? What the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying when you're bloody down in front of me

All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

Thumping through the pages of my fantasies
I'm above you, smiling at you, drown, drown, drown
I'll kill and rape you the way you raped me
And I'll pull the trigger
And you're down, down, down

Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it's funny? what the fuck you think it's doing to me?
You take you turn lashing out at me
I want you crying while you're bloody down in front of me

All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

All my friends are gone,
They died
They all screamed, and cried
I'm gonna take you down
Gonna take you down
Gonna take you down
Gonna take you down

All of my hate cannot be bound
I will not be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down and
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming

Down

All of my hate cannot be bound
I will no be drowned by your thoughtless scheming
Now you can try to tear me down
Beat me to the ground
I will see you screaming
