		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Free your mind
Hold onto your sanity
Embrace your vibe
You'll be what you're meant to be
In due time
In due time
Whoever said you weren't a diamond
Didn't know
Pressurize it make it shine
Let it show
You can spin the world on your finger
Hypnotize 'em
You gon' take 'em to they knees
With a little love
Love
Something they lack
Got greed attached
It take over empathy
Take all that's left
Clout got us fooled
like we all up for sale
Do it all for a picket fence and a dream
They say they doin it for you and me
You and me
For you and me
But we all just need a little love
Love love love love love
Just a little love
Love love love love love
Free your mind
Hold onto your sanity
Embrace your vibe
You'll be what you're meant to be
In due time
In due time
Been working for some time it's time to take a break
Still feel lint inside my pockets
I can't wait today
We been in this gear for a while time to change the pace
Don't even try to dap me up
Uh uh
Ain't no saving face
Traveled each state
Give me grace
Gave you space
It's okay to take your time
Wait and just be patient it'll ease your mind
I done seen the stars align
Ain't speaking zodiac but shit I saw the signs
Got the juice just like these grapes you see this boy D - vine
Wine
Yep
In my glass it's okay ima sip
Right after class puffin and pass on the gas we get pilt
We always laugh bout the past and the things we done did
Sensible times with the smiles living lives as a kid
Life been different lately
I been working on my craft stop and listen maybe
I can't focus on the past
This new me in the making
I can't focus on the past
Where you wanna go
Where you wanna take it
Eyes on the road
Dreams in the pavement
Highs and the lows still gon embrace it
I been working too hard I can't fake it
Where you wanna go
Where you wanna take it
I been tryna grow many different phases
Mama on the phone saying baby be patient
I been working too hard I can't fake it
I can't fake it
I can't fake it
Sometimes the truth just gotta face it
