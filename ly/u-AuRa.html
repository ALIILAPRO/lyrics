		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seeing green like it's in our eyes
When it's all gone we can't eat money
When we fall back into real life 
The only thing we've got is our bodies 

But I've got you 
You're the only thing that's steady 
When the world just gets too heavy
I've got you 

Buying temporary highs 
Never think about the price
But I've got you

You're the only thing that's steady 
When the world just gets too heavy
I've got you

Building castles but they're made of sand 
When the tide comes in we're left with nothing 
No more flowers growing in my hands 
Feeling lost inside of my own body 
But I've got you 

You're the only thing that's steady 
When the world just gets too heavy
I've got you

Buying temporary highs 
Never think about the price
But I've got you

You're the only thing that's steady 
When the world just gets too heavy
I've got you (you)

But I've got you
We're out here chasing gold
Buying things that we can hold
But I can hold you
