		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ten past three and I'm waking up in your arms
Skin on skin, nothing else matters, mmm
Oh, we've been here for a while
Haven't seen the sun come out, oh
We've been loving in silence
Drawing with our bodies

Oh, I feel like running again
Ooh, I wanna do it again
Yeah, I feel like running again
Ooh, I wanna do it again
Yeah

Every crooked line in your back feels like part of me
(Feels like part of me) mm-hmm
Your story's in my fingers, you'll never wash away
(You'll never wash away) oh

Oh, we've found some secret smiles
Haven't heard the rain come down, oh, oh
Oh, we've been loving in silence
Talking with our bodies

Oh, I feel like running again
Ooh, I wanna do it again
Yeah, I feel like running again
Ooh, I wanna do it again
Yeah

(Again, again) I'm running again
(Again, again) oh, oh, I wanna do it again
(Again, again) mmm, I feel like running again
(Again, again) oh, oh

Ten past three and I'm waking up in your arms, mmm
Skin on skin, nothing else matters
