		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm miss autonomy, miss nowhere
I'm at the bottom of me
Miss androgyny, miss don't care
What I've done to me

I am misused, I don't wanna do
Be not your slave
Misguided, I mind it
I'm missin' the train

And I don't know where I've been
And I don't know what I'm into
And I don't know what I've done to me

And as I watch you disappear into the ground
My one mistake was that I never let you down
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
On miss nothing, miss everything

I'm miss fortune, miss so soon
I'm like a bottle of pain
Miss matter, you had her
Now she's goin' away

I'm misused, misconstrued
I don't need to be saved
Miss slighted, I mind it
I'm stuck in the rain

And I don't know where I am
And I don't know what I'm into
And I don't know what I've done to me

And as I watch you disappear into the ground
My one mistake was that I couldn't let you down
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
On miss nothing, miss everything

Miss everything

And as I watch you disappear into my head
Well, there's a man who's tellin' me I might be dead
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
So I'll waste my time and I'll burn my mind
On miss nothing, miss everything
