		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All white forces
I dont wear Jordans
Off White, Lauren
You cannot afford this
Drip too gorgeous
Cutting up foreigns
I just found opps
Turn them into corpses

Turn them into boof pack
Come and get your boo back
Come and get your bands back
Burberry was 2 racks
You say you gon kill me 
When was you gon do that? 
Your bitch tryna fuck me
Where the fuck the room at?

Where the fuck your hoes at?
Where the fuck you whip at?
You still whipping mopeds 
I might get a scat pack
My lil baby ass fat 
Come and throw that ass back

I dont want a Tesla 
My whip guzzle octane
It cost a lil extra 
Ay,
Ima run these bands up
When I hit an M i might get my mom a Lexus   
I meant 30 of em 
Im a dirty fucker
I make 6 figures 
But I need another 
iPhone out of space
Got a thousand numbers 
You can have that gunker
She just want the money 

She just want a Lil Baby but I'm AMMO, bitch
Go and buy the Plan B, not Nintendos bitch
Go and buy a nice Switch and extendos
Thats a triple entendre for you idiots 
I dont take no threat serious 
if they really bout it they'll be quiet, I ain't new to this
I got blood on the cocaines 
Wipe it with some bleach then ignite it with some propane

All white forces
I dont wear Jordans
Off White, Lauren
You cannot afford this
Drip too gorgeous
Cutting up foreigns
I just found opps
Turn them into corpses
