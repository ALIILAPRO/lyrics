		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you want
I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything, hey

I'm in a two-door
I'm in a new lane
I'm counting new money
I need a new name

I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything, hey

They moving too slow
We on a new plane
So high it ain't funny
Your love is insane

I know what you want, I know what you want
I know what you want, I know what you want
You want everything, so let's do everything, hey

Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This RockaBye, I run, my nigga
