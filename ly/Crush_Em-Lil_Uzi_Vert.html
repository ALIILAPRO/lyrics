		  Crush 'em, crush 'em
Crush 'em, crush 'em
Crush 'em, crush 'em
Crush 'em, crush 'em
Ah
Fuck it, fuck it

Swervin' and smashin' all over the place just like I got road rage
All of these diamonds on top of my watches, bitch, it got no face
I told one of my bitches she need to stop, she looked at me, "No way"
She turn around just to go look at the clock, she worried 'bout old age (huh?)
She told me that she really love me, not worried 'bout knots, I look at her, "Okay" (okay)

Girl, why you always lyin'? (Woah)
I don't take it to the heart, I complete these assignments (yeah)
I'm runnin' through so many hoes, I just need a Heisman (woah)
Standin' in my shoes ten toes, you can never tie them (ah)
This water got me oh-so froze, feel like I'm Poseidon (yeah)
I'm a player and they know your boyfriend stand beside him

Crush 'em, crush 'em, mm, yeah
