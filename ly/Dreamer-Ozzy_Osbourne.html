		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gazing through the window at the world outside
Wondering will Mother Earth survive
Hoping that mankind will stop abusing her, sometime

After all there's only just the two of us
And here we are still fighting for our lives
Watching all of history repeat itself, time after time

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days

I watch the sun go down like everyone of us
I'm hoping that the dawn will bring a sign
A better place for those who will come after us, this time

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away oh yeah
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days

Your higher power maybe God or Jesus Christ
It doesn't really matter much to me
Without each others help there ain't no hope for us
I'm living in a dream of fantasy, oh yeah yeah yeah!

If only we could all just find serenity
It would be nice if we could live as one
When will all this anger, hate and bigotry be gone?

I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away (today)
I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days (okay)
I'm just a dreamer, who's searching for the way (today)
I'm just a dreamer, dreaming my life away (oh yeah yeah yeah)
