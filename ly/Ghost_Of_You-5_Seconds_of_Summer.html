		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am waking up 
Still can't sleep on your side
There's your coffee cup 
The lipstick stain fades with time
If I can dream long enough 
You'd tell me I'd be just fine
I'll be just fine

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house 
With the ghost of you
And I chase it down 
With a shot of truth
Dancing through our house 
With the ghost of you

Cleaning up today
Found that old Zeppelin shirt
You wore when you ran away 
And no one could feel your hurt
We're too young, too dumb 
To know things like love
But I know better now 
(Better now)

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house 
With the ghost of you
And I chase it down
With a shot of truth
Dancing through our house 
With the ghost of you

Too young, too dumb
To know things like love
Too young, too dumb

So I drown it out like I always do
Dancing through our house 
With the ghost of you
And I chase it down 
With a shot of truth
That my feet don't dance 
Like they did with you
