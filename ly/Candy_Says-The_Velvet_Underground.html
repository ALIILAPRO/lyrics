		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Candy says (Candy says)
I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says (Candy says)
I'd like to know completely
What others so discretely talk about

I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

Candy says (Candy says)
I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be
Candy says (Candy says)
I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind

I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly
Over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me

Do-do-wah
Do, do-do-wah
Do, do-do-wah
Do, do-do-wah
Do, do-do-wah
Do
