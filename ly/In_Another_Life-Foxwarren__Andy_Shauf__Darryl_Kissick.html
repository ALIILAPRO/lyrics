		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poor fool look at you now, finding nothing in your locking vest
Hold a feeling, just to feel in the past
Keep it in a closed fist, save it for another night

Oh fool look at you now, what a wicked way to fill up your time
Talking shit until it feels alright
You never had a good heart but maybe in a another life
I will
Need you

Poor fool look at you now, find it easiest to hand out the blame
Pour the man inside of another day
Message from a court, smiles stepping on another knife

Oh fool look at you now
No one finds it in between the lines
Find a whisper for a sliver of light
You never had a good friend but maybe in a another life
I will
Need you

In another life
I will
Be you

In another life
I will
Be you

In Another Life
I will
Be you

In Another Life
