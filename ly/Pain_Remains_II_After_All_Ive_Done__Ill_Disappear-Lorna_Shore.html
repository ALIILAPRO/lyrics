		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll disappear (I'll disappear)
It's like the world I knew keeps passing
Unlike the void I have become

Picking up pieces left from another life
This fleeting memory is everything you left behind
I'm just a whisper, just a specter locked away in time
This purgatory is eating away at my mind

Left to wander, left to dissipate
Without you I will never be the same
Left to confide insecurity
When you disappeared you took a part of me

I see you over and over
Far beyond me
I'm drifting away

Even inside a dream
This world has no meaning

And after all that I've done
After all of my pain
After all that I've become
Will I disappear, disappear
Like a ghost in the breeze?
Like fading memories
Like the world you left was only just a dream
So I'll disappear, I'll disappear, I'll disappear

It's like the world I knew keeps passing
Unlike the void I have become

Letting go of perfection, another lie
This wretched melody is everything you left to die
I'm just a vacuum, just a fragment, an echo in time
This purgatory is eating away everything

Left to suffer, left without your place
Without you I will never be the same
Let me see you one more time
When you disappeared you took a part of me

I see you over and over
Far beyond me
I'm drifting away

Even inside a dream
This world (this world) has no meaning

And after all that I've done
After all of my pain
After all that I've become
Will I disappear, disappear
Like a ghost in the breeze?
Like fading memories
Like the world you left was only just a dream
So I'll disappear, I'll disappear, I'll disappear

After all that I've done
After all of my pain
This fucking world disintegrates (I'll disappear)

And after all that I've done
After all of my pain
After all that I've become
Will I disappear, disappear (disappear)
Like a ghost in the breeze?
Like fading memories
Like the world you left was only just a dream
So I'll disappear (disappear)
I'll disappear, I'll disappear
