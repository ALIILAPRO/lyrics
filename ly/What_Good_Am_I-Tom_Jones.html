		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What good am I, if I'm like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how you're dressed
If I shut myself off, so I can't hear you cry
What good am I?

What good am I, if I know and don't do
If I see and don't say, if I look straight through you
If I turn a deaf ear, to the thundering sky
What good am I?

What good am I, while you softly weep
And I hear in my head, what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment, like the rest who don't try
What good am I? 
What good am I? 

What good am I then, to the others and me
If I've had every chance, and yet still fail to see
With my hands tied must I, not wonder within
Who tied them and why, and where must I have been?

What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face, of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back, while you silently die
What good am I?
What good am I? 
What good am I?
