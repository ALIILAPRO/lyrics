		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of watching you from the windows
You need to get closer but not too close
Loving you is like chasing the rainbows
You look so beautiful but there's nothing to do

I tried to scream but you couldn't hear me
You look like a dream I wanna stop dreaming
'Cause baby, I'm bleeding

I tried to wave but you couldn't see me
There is nothing to save as long as you're leaving
'Cause baby, I'm bleeding

Give me a sign I don't wanna lose my mind
Tell me the truth I can't take another lie
Stop telling me that it's gonna be alright
Give me a sign, I don't wanna lose my mind

Look at the scars you left on my heart
I'll never be the same, I bet you know
Can't tell any more who you really are
Now that it's all clear, I don't know you at all

I tried to scream but you couldn't hear me
You look like a dream I wanna stop dreaming
'Cause baby, I'm bleeding

I tried to wave but you couldn't see me
There is nothing to save as long as you're leaving
'Cause baby, I'm bleeding

Give me a sign I don't wanna lose my mind
Tell me the truth I can't take another lie
Stop telling me that it's gonna be alright
Give me a sign, I don't wanna lose my mind
