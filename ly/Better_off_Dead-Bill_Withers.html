		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She couldn't stand me anymore 
So she just took the kids and went
You see, I've got a drinkin' problem
All the money that we had I spent

Now I must die by my own hand 
'Cause I'm not man enough to live alone
Hey, hey, she's better off without me 
And I'm better off dead now that she's gone

Ah, she gave the most, took the least
She even had the priest come to our home
And I cried and prayed and promised 
That I'd leave the stuff alone

Now I must leave what I can't face
I hope she finds the kids a happy home
Hey, hey she's better off without me 
And I'm better off dead now that she's gone

She used to call her friend and cry
Then the man cut off the telephone
She'd sit and cry while I went out 
And pawned the things we owned

Now I must die by my own hand 
'Cause I'm not man enough to live alone
Hey, hey she's better off without me and I'm better off dead
