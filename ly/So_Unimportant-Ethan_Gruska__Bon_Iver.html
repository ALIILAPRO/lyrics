		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't look down
Hold up your head now
Hang on to your honor
Don't know why I've compromised you the most (the most)

You pull it closer
Don't make it hard now
If I remember one thing, it's
That I don't surprise you at all
Anymore

Is there something that you want to say to me?
Is there somewhere that you want to escape too?
I'll cling like a waterfall
While I don't recognize you at all
Anymore

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Yeah-yeah)
(Oh-ooh oh)

You watch me burn out like a rocket
I catch you mumbling it time after time
I just want all of it to stop your crying
I'll take the bribe now
It's so unimportant what started the fight

(Oh-ooh oh)
(Woo)

All eyes ahead
It's sadder at the end
I drink 'til I'm falling down and
I'm hanging on by a thread

Is there something that you want to say to me?
Is there somewhere that you want to escape to?
I'll cling like a waterfall
While I don't recognize you at all
Anymore

(Oh-ooh oh)
(Ooh-ooh)

You watch me burn out like a rocket
I catch you mumbling it time after time
I just want all of it to stop your crying
I'll take the bribe now
It's so unimportant what started the fight

(Woo)
