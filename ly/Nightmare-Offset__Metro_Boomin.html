		  If Young Metro don't trust you I'm 'gon shoot you!

On demand
Bags on demand
On demand
Bags on demand (racks)
On demand
Bags on demand

Hey!
I need the cash on pronto
Nigga, a lottery ticket
I get the bands at the bando (ey)
Full of the white like it's Iggy (white, white)
Five milli in cash, a wide load, and we 'bout to get it
We from the north, I'm just sayin' tho
Remember my hitta? (yeah)

Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there
Come in the middle of the night, like it's a nightmare
You open your eyes, not dreamin', nigga, we right there

(Offset)

Open your eyes, real life, ain't no facade (ain't not facade)
You tryna rob, get penalized, they taking your life
Run up a bag, a milli in cash, then cover your body in gems (bag)
Fucking a thot, but I don't go for the plot so I'm fucking this bitch on film (smash)
Coming tonight, you won't see 'em (woo)
Black gloves, black hoodie, and Timbs (woo)
You don't wanna be him 'cause soon as they see him they shoot off his limbs (pew pew)
I know I might sound animated (who)
A hunnid racks have a nigga waiting (racks)
You got a Rolex, it outdated (who)
I got your hoe outside, be patient (yeah)
Back in the Maybach, this ain't a 'Rari, this is the latest Mercedes
Spent two-hundred thousand on my whole rider
Five-hundred K just to play
Open your eyes, your whole face (open that)
I got the Mac today (mac)
Pull up, get whacked today (wack)
Pull up and catch some waves (scurr scurr)

Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there
Freddy Kruger, give 'em a nightmare
Soon as you close your eyes, nigga, we right there
Come in the middle of the night, like it's a nightmare
You open your eyes, not dreamin', nigga, we right there

Metro Boomin want some, nigga
