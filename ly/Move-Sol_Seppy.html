		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you waiting for somebody else to move
Don't you know in your heart
Is the power to change everything
Don't you know in your heart
Is the power to change everything

Time to return in a circle
'Bout to miss everything

Come to me sometime
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Give me some of your shine, shine
Maybe for all mine

I need you now tonight
I need you now tonight oh, tonight

Are you waiting for somebody else to move
Don't you know in your heart
Is the power to change everything
Don't you know in your heart
Is the power to change everything
Oh, now it is time to move in unity

Time to return in a circle
'Bout to miss everything

Open the front gate until you gyrate
In the fresh air like an air balloon
Only with you i just wanna be there with you
I just wanna be there with you
I just wanna be there with you, Kay
