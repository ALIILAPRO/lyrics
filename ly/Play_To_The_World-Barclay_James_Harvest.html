		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can make the day seem right
And make the darkness bright
That's what you do 
Girl, don't hide your love away
You'll want it back some day
That's what they say 

And, my friend
We're gonna make it right
And play to the world tonight
We'll play to the world 

Time, what's to become of me?
What will the future see?
What will they say? 

Life is like a passing dream
It's never what it seems to be
From day to day 

And, my friend
We're gonna make it right
And play to the world tonight
We'll play to the world
