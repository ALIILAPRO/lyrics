		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah
Oh, ooh, woah-ooh, woah

You know I'm showin' out and
Different vibes and
You the one livin' righteous
But I'm still me, yeah
I know I said a lot
Then you wouldn't speak to me
You don't give a damn what's fair to me
Why don't you just be my therapy? (Oh-oh)
If the tide didn't rise and
And the gas didn't light
We'd just be alright then
I know it looks like I'm livin' life

But I'm stressing, desperate
Restless, fucked up again
Living life and risking to get it
But you know I'm messed up
Stressing, desperate
Restless, fucked up again
Living life and risking to get it
But you know I'm messed up

I was down, givin' up
Gave me love I didn't deserve
I wasn't worth it
You tried to show me what was right
I didn't wanna learn
This madness, tryna hide the savage
I can't lose another bad bitch, I'm not
But you know it's bad with a little liquor
You should never really mix that with feelings (oh, no)
You know it's bad givin' mixed signals
Puttin' on a good show, no theatre
I know that it appears I'm out here when I'm

Stressing, desperate
Restless, fucked up again
Living life and risking to get it
But you know I'm messed up
Stressing, desperate
Restless, fucked up again
Living life and risking to get it
But you know I'm messed up

I just pulled up in your city
Just pick up, you know it's me
Don't give up on me
And we don't care, do what we want when we want
Where we want, if we want
If we don't, it'd be hard on me (oh-oh)
And that's why I'm still here

Stressing, desperate
Restless, fucked up again
Living life and risking to get it
But you know I'm messed up
Stressing, desperate
Restless, fucked up again
Living life and risking to get it
But you know I'm messed up

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
You know I'm messed up
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh
