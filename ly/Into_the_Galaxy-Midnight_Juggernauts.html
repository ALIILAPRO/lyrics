		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

An apparition
Of twilight visions
A final mission
Of superstition

Reactivated
Now automated
Appropriated
Investigated

Global tectonics
Psycho robotic
Plasma bionic
Bred supersonic

A new translation
For integration
Your invitation
G-L-O-R-I-A

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Hyper creation
Or reinvention
Love and affection
Gaining attention

United Nations
Interrelations
A declaration
Of hypertension

Emerging summits
Pre-emptive plummet
We drop atomic
To shooting comets

The controversial
Ultra commercial
Now universal
G-L-O-R-I-A

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Floating to the edge of the world
Floating to the edge of the sea
Floating off the edge of the ocean
Out into the galaxy

Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy

Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy

Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy

Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
Out into the galaxy
