		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another modern innovation
This time, I mean it
A hazard of the occupation
Desire when needed
Set it down before you break it
This house ain't for children
Doing jumpin' jacks in the basement
These arms are reaching out

Hyperventilation
If I could be so bold all the time

The weight of the feather
You fall like a leaf
Is this a middle-of-the-night call?
A revelation on a split screen?
To see all the color
Run from your eyes
Is this a middle-of-a-life thought?
A revelation on a split screen?

I discern some reservation
Disdain to put the boys in
At the face of obligation
The pain is in the poison
Unprescribed medication
Big plan, let's cancel
I'm a fan of your extensions
Your hair is like a puzzle

Hyperventilation
If I could be so bold all the time

The weight of the feather
You fall like a leaf
Is this a middle-of-the-night call?
A revelation on a split screen?
To see all the color
Run from your eyes
Is this a middle-of-a-life thought?
A revelation on a split screen?

Out in the shadows
The fields are moving
You pack up your head case
And move the needle
Out in the shadows
The fields are moving
You pack up your head case
And move the needle 'round
Move the needle 'round
Move the needle 'round
