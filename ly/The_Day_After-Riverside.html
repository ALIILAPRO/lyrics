		  ""What if it's not If it's not meant to be What if someone Has made a mistake  What we've become There's no turning back Maybe it's time To say that out loud  Question marks are falling down Crushing underneath our memories As we stand and look around The world that remained  On the walls we paint our dreams Hiding in the fallout shelters While The Gardens of Eden Are burning above  What if it's not If it's not meant to be What if someone Has made a mistake  What we've become There's no turning back Maybe it's time To say that out loud""
