		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you need a fix when you fall down
You know you need to find a way
To get you through another day
Let me be the one to numb you out
Let me be the one to hold you
Never gonna let you get away

The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You'll love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

I know what you want so desperately
You know I'll give you one for free
Forever you're coming back to me
Now, I'm gonna give you what you need
'Cause I know what you fiend on and what you lean on
And what you lean on

The shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You'll love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer

Did you find another cure?
Did you find another cure?

I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
You'll love me 'til it's all over, over
'Cause I'm the shoulder you cry on
The dose that you die on
I, I can be your painkiller, killer, killer
Painkiller
