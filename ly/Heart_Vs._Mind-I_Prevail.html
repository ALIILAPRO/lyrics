		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it taking over me.

This is a declaration, of a war fought behind a veil.
This is a revelation, as told through the age old tale.
In which I've heard a thousand times before, nothing matters anymore, 
And I'm reminded as I stare at this revolving door.
Of all the times I've failed, and all the times I've sworn, 
I'd never give up hope, and change what I stand for.

I'm just a stranger, who made a wager, for my life. (I'm afraid that, so afraid that)
I might not escape this time.
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air, 
This is the heart against the mind.

My life is on the line, it seems as if I'm running out of time.
And my thoughts are consuming me, is this the person I'm suppose to be?
It's like the fear of being buried alive, the more I try, the more I die inside.
I struggle to keep my dreams while awake, but the fear grows inside and puts me to sleep.

I'm just a stranger, who made a wager, for my life. (I'm afraid that, so afraid that)
I might not escape this time.
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air, 
This is the heart against the mind.

The war rages on, but I will not quit.
I've seen countless souls fall down that pit.
The walls doubt built up, will fall to the ground, 
I'll rise back up, I won't be held down.

I'm just a stranger, who made a wager, for my life.
I might not escape this time.
Caught in this nightmare, dreams turn to thin air, 
This is the heart against the mind
