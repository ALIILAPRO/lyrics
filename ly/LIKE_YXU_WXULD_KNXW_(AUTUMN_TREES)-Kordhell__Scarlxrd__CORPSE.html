		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Corpselord, corpselord, corpselord)

Feel like lightman when you lie to me (lie to me)
Can't trust a soul, I'm dealin' silently, silently
We fall out like leaves on autumn trees (autumn trees)
Wish I could be what I ought to be, ought to be

I don't wanna focus on the problems
I swear to God, I'm over moving trash and living toxic
I'ma be the only one to finish what he started
A living legend see into your brain like I'm a doctor

Hold up wait, I been inside the game you gotta watch how I start it
Original my plays, it always sharpens my wallet
Kissin' on my neck, I got her lost in my conscious
Gripping on her waist, she wanna cum for an artist

God, please save me
It's been so hard lately
It's just on and on
It's driving me crazy
Just get picked apart
It's hard being lazy
Like you would know

Feel like lightman when you lie to me (when you lie)
Can't trust a soul, I'm dealing silently, silently
We fall out like leaves on autumn trees (but it's falling down)
Wish I could be what I ought to be, ought to be

Wanna be myself
I don't wanna fuck around, just wanna be myself
You should probably settle down, a warning to your health
Focused on my freedom like I'm locked inside a cell

See it to believe it while believing in a spell
Dreaming only deepened all my feelings in the well
Keepin' all my secrets, never speaking on the hell
Left me here in pieces, they retreaed when I fell, oh-yeah

God, please save me
It's been so hard lately
It's just on and on
It's driving me crazy
Just get picked apart
It's hard being lazy
Like you would know

Feel like lightman when you lie to me (when you lie)
Can't trust a soul, I'm dealing silently, silently
We fall out like leaves on autumn trees (but it's falling down)
Wish I could be what I ought to be, ought to be

Talk like you know me
'Cause I fuck you and only
Prefer being lonely
I've been trapped with success
Like you would know

Feel like lightman when you lie to me (when you lie)
Can't trust a soul, I'm dealing silently, silently
We fall out like leaves on autumn trees (but it's falling down)
Wish I could be what I ought to be, ought to be

Feel like lightman when you lie to me
Can't trust a soul, I'm dealing silently, silently
We fall out like leaves on autumn trees (autumn trees)
Wish I could be what I ought to be, ought to be
