		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had a chat with my therapist 
Told her all of the things you did
I wanna be bitter
She told me to be bigger
I found out what you did that night
Roll my eyes while you ugly cry 
But why would I hate you 
I'll just replace you

Are you sorry?
No I bet you're not 
You're sorry
Cause you just got caught 
I'll bury you deep 
Cuz you're dead to me 
And I'm sorry 
But I'm glad you're gone
So sorry 
That it took so long 
Hope you rest in peace
Cause you're dead to me

Your excuses are fun for me
Love your creativity 
You want her you got her 
You tripped and fell right on her
Now you say that you're overwhelmed
I told myself that I wouldn't yell
Keeping my peace
It's too much energy 
Keeping you an enemy 

Are you sorry?
No I bet you're not 
You're sorry
Cause you just got caught 
I'll bury you deep 
Cuz you're dead to me 
And I'm sorry 
But I'm glad you're gone
So sorry 
That it took so long 
Hope you rest in peace
Cause you're dead to me

Say that you'll explain it but i doubt I'll be impressed
Like name a better way to say you're sleeping with my friend 
I hope you rest in peace
Trying not to blame you both and maybe that's the hard part 
I just think it's funny how you find out who your friends are 
Now I've said my piece
