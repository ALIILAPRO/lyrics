		<p>
		  Lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
My lipstick lover, lover, lover

I like lipstick on my neck
It let me know I'm your number one select
I like lipstick on my neck
Hands around my waist, so you know what's coming next
I wanna feel your lips on mine
I just wanna feel a little tongue, we don't have a long time

Ooh, you talkin' nasty and I like (like)
Whisper in my ear, only me and you can hear
I seen it from the back and I'm excited (excited)
Tell me what you do when we walk up in the room, yeah
Hope it's something nasty, we can try it (try it)
Bite me on my neck and you know what's coming next
We can make a movie, I can write it (write it)
Let's just make a move, baby

'Cause for your love, I'll take my time
Just wanna feel your hips on mine

I really got a thing for my lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'd do anything for my lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover

I like lipstick on my neck
Leave a sticky hickie in a place I won't forget
I like lipstick on my neck
Baby, I'm obsessed, get me undressed
I wanna feel your lips on mine
I just wanna feel a little tongue, we don't have a long time

Ooh, you talkin' nasty and I like it (like it)
Whisper in my ear, only me and you can hear
I seen it from the back and I'm excited (excited)
Tell me what you do when we walk up in the room, yeah
Tell me something nasty, we can try it (try it)
Bite me on my neck and you know what's coming next (and you know what's coming next)
We can make a movie, I can write it (write it)
Let's just make a move, baby

'Cause for your love, I'll take my time
Just wanna feel your hips on mine

I really got a thing for my lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'd do anything for my lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I really got a thing for my lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'd do anything for my lipstick lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
