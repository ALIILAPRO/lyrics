		  Yeah
Yeah

Playin' with yourself, I'm poppin' pills
Had a long night, but need some more in me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
Made it off the block into the hills
Slidin' in the foreign, got a four with me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me (hahaha)

Knocked down that bitch, put a Glock on the switch
Passin' out these pills, I done told you how to kill 'em
I done told you how to flip it, I done told you how to dress
I done told you how to pimp it (how to pimp it)
Designer my clothes, I designer my girl
Money, more mud, I mix codeine on her
From the bando to Tokyo, different flavor
Strapped with a pole and I'm talkin' with my chest out
Hang with the bros, we in Turks with the best of 'em
Somethin' like a pro athlete, the way I crossed over
Trap nigga, extravaganza, I told you
One, two, three Phantoms pullin' up and I showed you
Mud in my drink, I got mud on my shoulder (on my shoulder)
Cookin' models up, poppin' bottles up
I'ma lose sense, and the coupe in it, go and speedin' in it
Gotta wear diamonds, like it's a part of my religion

Playin' with yourself, I'm poppin' pills
Had a long night, but need some more in me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
Made it off the block into the hills
Slidin' in the foreign, got a four with me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me

Somethin' gettin' got, I gotta give
Either way it go, you know, it is what it is
Flip flop the soda, 'til it mix what it fizz
Try to payola, that's a stitch in the biz'
I've been in Hoda, cookin' hits at the Ritz
Got a couple comin' over for visits from the strip
Love to come over for events to get bent
You leave with all your sins and then you try to repent (yeah)

Matchin' Wockesha, matchin' Wockesha
Pour another liter, now I gotta eat her
Now I gotta eat her

Playin' with yourself, I'm poppin' pills
Had a long night, but need some more in me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
Made it off the block into the hills
Slidin' to the Palms, got a four with me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me

Made it to the block, to the hills
Ain't answer my thoughts on these pills
Put chef through the block, poppin' a seal
I got chip on me that ain't for sale
I get it, I'm a boss, pushin' 'til it ain't no limit
I spit in my bitch mouth, tell her, "Keep hoes out our business"
Got an iced out her cross, but ain't doin' no repentin'
Money stuck to me, like this mink

(Metro)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
