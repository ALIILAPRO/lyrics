		  Why don't you ask the kids at Tiananmen Square?
Was fashion the reason why they were there?
They disguise it, hypnotize it
Television made you buy it

I'm just sitting in my car and
Waiting for my

She's scared that I will take her away from there
Dreams and her country, left with no one there
Mesmerized the simple minded
Propaganda leaves us blinded

I'm just sitting in my car and
Waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and
Waiting for my girl

I'm just sitting in my car and
Waiting for my girl
I'm just sitting in my car and
Waiting for my girl
