		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I wake up in the morning
Look at my clock
Its way past noon time
Now Im late for work.

Tell me, tell me
What have I done wrong?
Aint nothing go right with me
Must be Ive been smoking too long.

Well I go to find me some breakfast
But I aint got no food
Take me a shower
But the water dont feel no good.

Tell me

Ive got opium in my chimney
No other life to choose
Nightmare made of hash dreams.
Got the devil in my shoes

Tell me

Well when Im smoking
Put my worries on a shelf
Dont think about nothin
Try not to see myself.

Tell me

Well in this blues Im singin
Theres a lesson to be learned
Dont go around smokin
Unless you want to get burned.

Tell me
