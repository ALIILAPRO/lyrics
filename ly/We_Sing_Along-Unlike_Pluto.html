		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, automatic 
Illusion of control
So enigmatic
Buying everything you sold

Who's to blame?
I don't know
Are we both stuck in the same hole?
No escape
Nowhere to go
From here, and it goes

On and on and we sing along
On and on and we sing along
Carousel' movin' on (it goes)
The circus never stops (it goes)

(Goes)
(It goes)
(Goes)
(It goes)

Ooh entertain us
We are sick, medicate us, ohh
I feel like I'm eyeless
And I feel all the broken smiles inside of me

Fill this dream with tales of screams 
And I'm lost in reality, ohh
Vultures fly around
Picking us one by one

Who's to blame?
Maybe me?
Am I stuck in a world that I feed?
No escape
Nowhere to go
From here, and it goes

On and on and we sing along
On and on and we sing along
Carousel' movin' on (it goes)
The circus never stops (it goes)

(Goes)
(It goes)
(Goes)
(It goes)

Who's to blame
Maybe me
Am I stuck in a world that I feed
No escape
Nowhere to go
From here, and it goes

On and on and we sing along
On and on and we sing along
Carousel' movin' on
The circus never stops

On and on and we sing along
On and on and we sing along
Carousel' movin' on (it goes)
The circus never stops (it goes)

(Goes)
(It goes)
(Goes)
(It goes)
