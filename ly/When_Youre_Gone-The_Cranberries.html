		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on to love, that is what I do
Now that I've found you
And from above, everything's stinking
They're not around you

And in the night I could be helpless
I could be lonely, sleeping without you
And in the day, everything's complex
There's nothing simple when I'm not around you

And I miss you, when you're gone
That is what I do, bay-, bay-, babe
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew, bay-, bay-, baby

Hold on to my hands
I feel I'm sinking, sinking without you
And to my mind, everything's stinking
Stinking without you

And in the night I could be helpless
I could be lonely, slipping without you
And in the day, everything's complex
There's nothing simple when I'm not around you

And I miss you, when you're gone
That is what I do, bay-, bay-, babe
And it's going to carry on
That is what I knew, bay-, bay-, baby

Bay-, bay-, baby
Bay-, bay-, babe
