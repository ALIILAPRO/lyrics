		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you looking at me
Like I got something that's for you
And the way that you stare, don't you dare
'Cause I'm not about to
Just give it all up to you
'Cause there are some things I won't do
And I'm not afraid to tell you
I don't ever want to leave you confused

The more you try
The less I buy it
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm into you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh!

You know I got my own life
And I bought everything that's in it
So, if you want to be with me
It ain't all about the bling you bringing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I want a love that's for real
And without that, no deal
And, baby, I don't need a hand
If it only wants to grab one thing

The more you try
The less I buy it
And I don't have to think it through
You know if I'm feelin' you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go

I don't need a
I don't need a man, I don't, a
I don't need a man to get me through
'Cause I'm doin' fine, I feel brand new

I don't need a
I don't need a man, I don't
I don't need a man to make it through
'Cause I know I'm fine without you

I don't need a man to make it happen
I get off being free
I don't need a man to make me feel good
I get off doing my thing
I don't need a ring around my finger
To make me feel complete
So, let me break it down
I can get off when you ain't around, oh!

I don't need a man (I'm over you, yeah!)
I don't need a man (oh oh, I'm over you)
I don't need a man (I'm without you)
(I'm over you, oh!)

I don't need a man
I don't need a man (I don't need ya, I don't need ya, no)
I don't need a man
Oh!
