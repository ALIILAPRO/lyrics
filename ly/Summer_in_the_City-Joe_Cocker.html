		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hot town summer in the city
Back of my neck getting dirty and gritty
Been down, isn't it a pity
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city
All around people looking half dead
Walking on the sidewalk hotter than a match head
But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl come on,
Come on and dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the night
In the summer in the city in the summer in the city

Cool town, evening in the city
Dressed so fine and looking so pretty
Cool cat lookin' for a kitty
Gonna look in every corner of the city
Ill I'm wheezing like a bus stop
Running up the stairs gonna meet ya on the roof top

But at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl come on,
Come on lets dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And babe, don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the night
In the summer in the city in the summer in the city

Solo but at night it's a different world
Go out and find a girl
Come on, come on lets dance all night
Despite the heat it will be alright
And babe don't you know it's a pity
The days can't be like the night
In the summer in the city in the summer in the city
Hot town summer in the city
