		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without you

You taste like Whiskey when you kiss me, oh
I'd give anything again to be your baby doll
This time I'm not leavin' without you

He said, "Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time"
And you said to me there's

(Somethin') Somethin', somethin' about this place
(Somethin') Somethin' about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Somethin') Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, somethin' about baby you and I

It's been two years since I let you go
I couldn't listen to a joke or rock and roll
Muscle cars drove a truck right through my heart

On my birthday you sang me A Heart of Gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes
This time I'm not leavin' without you, oh (oh)

Sit back down where you belong
In the corner of my bar with your high heels on
Sit back down on the couch where we made love the first time
And you said to me there's

(Somethin') Somethin', somethin' about this place
(Somethin') Somethin' about lonely nights
And my lipstick on your face
(Somethin') Somethin', somethin' about my cool Nebraska guy
Yeah, somethin' about baby you and I

You and I
You you and I
You you and I
You you and I-I

You and I
You you and I
Oh yeah, I'd rather die
Without you and I

Come on, put your drinks up

We got a whole lot of money, but we still pay rent
'Cause you can't buy a house in Heaven
There's only three men that I'ma serve my whole life
It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ, there's

(Somethin') Somethin', somethin' about the chase (six whole years)
(Somethin') I'm a New York woman born to run you down
Still want my lipstick all over your face
(Somethin') Somethin', somethin' about just knowin' when it's right
So put your dreams up for Nebraska
For Nebraska, Nebraska, I love you

You and I
You you and I
Baby I'd rather die
Without you and I-I-I

You and I
You you and I
Nebraska
I'd rather die
Without you and I-I-I

It's been a long time since I came around
Been a long time but I'm back in town
And this time I'm not leavin' without you
