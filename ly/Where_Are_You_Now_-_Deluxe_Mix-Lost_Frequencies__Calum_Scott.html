		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

Five days on the freeway
Riding shotgun with you (yeah, yeah)
Two hearts in the fast lane
We had big dreams in blue (yeah, yeah)

Playing Sweet Child O' Mine
And I still feel that line
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Hey, it's been too long
Too long to go, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long

You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

(Where are you now?)
Hey, it's been too long

Some days I can feel it
But the feeling ain't all blue
You got me believing
One day you gotta come through
Lost in these city lights
'Cause I can't sleep tonight
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Hey, it's been too long
Too long to go, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Too late to turn around
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Hey, it's been too long

You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
You're just like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head
Like my favorite song going 'round and 'round my head

Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?
Where are you now?

Where are you now?
