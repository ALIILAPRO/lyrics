		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you notice how
I get quiet when there's no one else around
Me and you and awkward silence 
Don't you dare look at me that way
I don't need reminders of how you don't feel the same

Oh, the burning pain
Listening to you harp about some new soulmate 
She's so perfect
Bla, bla, bla
Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day
Run to me confess your love 
At least just let me say 

That when I talk to you 
Oh, cupid walks right through 
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too? 
Confess I loved you from the start

What's a girl to do 
Lying on my bed staring 
Into the blue 
Unrequited terrifying 
Love is driving me a bit insane
Have to get this off my chest 
I'm telling you today

That when I talk to you 
Oh, cupid walks right through 
And shoots an arrow through my heart
And I sound like a loon
But don't you feel it, too? 
Confess I loved you from the start

Confess I loved you
Just thinking of you
I know I've loved you from the start
