		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you
I know you want me
I made it obvious that I want you too
So put it on me
Let's remove the space between me and you
Now rock your body (ooh)
Damn I like the way that you move
So give it to me (ooh)
'Cause I already know what you wanna do

Here's the situation been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation given my reputation
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you, oh you know

You're so damn pretty
If I had a type then baby it would be you
I know your ready
If I never lied, than baby you'd be the truth

Here's the situation
Been to every nation
Nobody's ever made me feel the way that you do
You know my motivation
Given my reputation
Please excuse me I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you, oh you know

Luda', tonight I'm gonna do
Everything that I want with you
Everythin' that you need
Everything that you want I wanna honey
I wanna stunt with you
From the window, to the wall
Gonna give you, my all
Winter or the summertime
When I get you on the springs
I'ma make you fall, you got that body
That make me wanna get on the floor
Just to see you dance
And I love the way you shake that ass
Turn around and let me see them pants
You stuck with me I'm stuck with you
Lets find something to do
(Please) excuse me I don't mean to be rude

But tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you
Oh you know, that tonight I'm loving you, oh you know
That tonight I'm loving you
That tonight I'm loving you, yeah
