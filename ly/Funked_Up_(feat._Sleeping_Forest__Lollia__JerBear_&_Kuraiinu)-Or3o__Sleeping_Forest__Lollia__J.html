		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo it's Daddy Dearest on the mic
Who's this little kid coming at me all child like
I'm a motherfuckin' demon
Give me a good reason
On why I shouldn't give your little ass a big beatin'

You think that you're good enough for my daughter?
Better prepare cus you're ripe for a slaughter
If you want her you better come at me stronger
But one wrong move and you'll be nothing but a goner

Just wanna take your daughter for a date
When I look into her eyes I knew that it was fate
But what the fuck is this dad doing rapping?
Aren't you too old? might as well be retiring

Think you got the bars to mess with me
I'm one of a kind I'll have you begging on your knees
I've got the sickest rhymes that'll woo her heart
Your flow's so weak, why did you even start?

So confused
It's feels like I'm being used
I'm so conflicted with you two
That I have no idea what to do
Should I stay with him and leave
Or Should I just do as you please?
I'm just gonna take a seat
As I listen to this funky beat

It's Mommy Mearest so watch out little blue boy
I'm gonna break you and I surely will enjoy
The baddest bitch you'll ever see is on the scene
One look and baby you will know that I'm the queen

You think that I am scared of your presence?
I think that I should teach you a lesson
All that I want is to be with her all night
Get in my way and I'll surely win this fight

So confused
It's feels like I'm being used
I'm so conflicted with you two
That I have no idea what to do
Should I stay with him and leave
Or Should I just do as you please?
I'm just gonna take a seat
As I listen to this funky beat

Go on get out of my way
Before i wreck all your pride
You know that I won't be swayed
So hurry up, move aside

I've had enough with the taunts
You think that you got the bars
Im gonna get what i want
You're never gonna get far

Go on get out of my way
Before i wreck all your pride
You know that I won't be swayed
So hurry up, move aside

I've had enough with the taunts
You think that you got the bars
Im gonna get what i want
You're never gonna get far

So confused
It's feels like I'm being used
I'm so conflicted with you two
That I have no idea what to do
Should I stay with him and leave?
Or Should I just do as you please?
I'm just gonna take a seat
As I listen to this funky beat.

Better back off before you get blue balled
If you think you're gonna win, your chance is looking small

No way you're gonna stop me, I ain't gonna flee
I'm gonna have her in my arms even if you disagree

We demons have the power to make you scream
It's two against one, you can't beat this team

Ok Karen, calm down and take a chill pill
You seem to be struggling cus your rap's going downhill

You better sit down before you get wrecked
I have a lot of pride and a daughter to protect

No matter what you say, I'mma have it my way
Gonna make her sway, and make her my bae

Don't care what it takes, I'mma send my whole crew
We'll throw everything until we beat you.

It's the end of the song and I clearly got the win
It's a friday night and it's time to get funkin!
