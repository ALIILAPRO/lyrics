		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  give me a freaky boy 
ill make him sit & beg 
ill put a chain around him 
wrap him between my legs 
i like it bouncy bouncy, so throw me up & down 
just keep on moving through me & turn my world around 

dont need a tiny sucker, i need a real boy 
dont wanna stop it, stop it, just sit back & enjoy 
i like em thick & juicy i like em nice & tall 
im such a bad ass chick, uh, you wont leave me at all 
give me a Freak 

give me a freak 
come on and be my toy 
give me a freak 
give me a freaky boy 
give me a freak 
something i can enjoy 
give me a freak 

give me a freaky boy 
ill make him sit & beg 
ill put a chain around him 
wrap him between my legs 
i like it bouncy bouncy, so throw me up & down 
just keep on moving through me & turn my world around 

dont need a tiny sucker, i need a real boy 
dont wanna stop it, stop it, just sit back & enjoy 
i like em thick & juicy i like em nice & tall 
im such a bad ass chick, uh, you wont leave me at all 
give me a Freak 

give me a freak 

give me a freak
