		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how you seek your man 
And tell me all your secret spells
Tell me how you learn to tell by his voice that he fell. 

I know a ghost will walk through walls 
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall

Try to re-imagine me and I'll re-invent myself still 
I remember scenes of when you looked 
At someone else.

I know a ghost will walk through walls 
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall

When you start doubting me then I start to doubt myself 
And never look through me 
Cause I'll keep close to myself

I know a ghost will walk through walls 
Yet I am just a man still learning how to fall

I am what I am and what I am is who I am
I know what I know and all I know is that I fell
If only I could walk through walls them maybe I 
Would tell you who I was yet I am just a man
Still learning how to fall.

And I am just a man learning how to fall
