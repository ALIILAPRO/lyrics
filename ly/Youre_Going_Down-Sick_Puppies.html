		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Define your meanin' of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up out of control
If it's a fight, I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I know that I know

It's been a long time comin'
And the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

Define your meanin' of fun
Is it fuckin', druggin' or guns?
I feel the heat comin' off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane (do you remember me?)
The words circlin' in my brain (and what you did to me)
You can treat this like another all the same
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time comin'
And the table's turned around
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down

This is hardly worth fightin' for
But it's the little petty shit that I can't ignore
When my fist hits your face and your face hits the floor
It'll be a long time comin'
But you got the message now
'Cause I was never goin'
Yeah, you're the one that's goin' down

One of us is goin' down
I'm not runnin'
It's a little different now
'Cause one of us is goin'
One of us is goin' down
One of us is goin' down
Down
