		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

One, two, one, two, three, four
Pump it up

Aaaah, I ramp, me no ramp
Me no skin
Me no play, yeah
When me chant 'pon the microphone
And me say with the DJ
Junglists in the place
Junglists on the case
Scooter, are you Ratty?

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me, come on

Love, peace and unity
Siberia, the place to be
The K, the L, the F and the -ology
Hallelujah

One, two, one, two, three, yeah
Rough
Ah
Here we go

When I was young, it seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully, watching me
Stand up
Once again
We're gettin' jiggy
Siberia
Yay
Goodbye
