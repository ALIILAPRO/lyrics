		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on over, cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space and shake it, just shake it

Dance a little, move some more
Push it back down to the floor and shake it, just shake it

Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best to break it, to break it

Girl you really look the part, reach right out, you've got my heart
Now take it, just take it, take it

Come on over, cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space and shake it, just shake it

Dance a little, move some more
Push it back down to the floor and shake it, just shake it

Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best to break it, to break it

Girl you really look the part, reach right out, you've got my heart
Now take it, just take it, take it

Come on over, cut some shapes
Get it right up in my space and shake it, just shake it

Dance a little, move some more
Push it back down to the floor and shake it, just shake it

Looking deep into my eyes
Bend it back and do your best to break it, to break it

Girl you really look the part, reach right out, you've got my heart
Now take it, just take it, take it
