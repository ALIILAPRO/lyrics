		  We are paging Mr. Baxxter
Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Simon
To proceed to boarding gate 38 immediately

Encore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Encore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Every minute, every hour, got the power
Take a shower, brand stuff
Screaming Lord, wicked and tough

Encore, Hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
Posse saw ya on the border
Jungle jumper under order

Every minute, every hour, got the power
Take a shower, brand stuff
Screaming Lord, wicked and tough

Right now, say Lord have mercy!

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Sing it!
Jumping all over the world

I've got the music
I've got the lights
You've got the figure
Full of delights
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Let me hear ya!
Jumping all over the world

I've got position
I've got the name
You've got the power
To drive me insane
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Everybody!
Jumping all over the world

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

All together now!

Encore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
Like a train on twisted tracks
See you down at One-Eyed Jack's
Jungle jumper under order
Jump it up while in the corner
Coming rough more slam, wicked and tough

Encore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
Like a train on twisted tracks
See you down at One-Eyed Jack's
Jungle jumper under order
Jump it up while in the corner
Coming rough more slam, wicked and tough

From England and Ireland to Scotland (Jumping all over the world)
India, Russia, Australia (jumping all over the world)
From the USA to Africa and Iceland (jumping all over the world)
All over Europe, and back to Germany

Once again!

I've got the money
I've got the place
You've got the figure
You've got the face
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Together! (Jumping all over the world)

I've got position
I've got the name
You've got the power
To drive me insane
Let's get together
We're jumping all over
All over the world

Everybody now, here we come!

Encore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
(Jumping all over the world)

Encore, hardcore
Rock you down to the floor
(Jumping all over the world)

And now all the ladies to the VIP
