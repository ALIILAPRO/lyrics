		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain fell this mornin', make me feel so bad
On account of my baby walked off with another man.
Like takin' eyesight from the blind man and money from the poor
That woman took my lovin' and walked on out that door.
And it sure got cold after the rain fell,
Not from the sky, from my eye.

Somebody, can you tell me just what make a man feel this way?
Like river without its water, like night without a day.
And it sure 'nuff got cold after the rain fell,
Not from the sky but from my eye.

If you're home early in the mornin' you hear that rain to fall,
With thunderbolts and lightning the wind begins to call.
Your worry's superficial 'cause you slept on through the night
But stormy weather keep you wond'rin' if ev'rything's all right.
And it sure 'nuff got cold after the rain fell,
Not from the sky but from my eye,
Not from the sky, from my eye.
