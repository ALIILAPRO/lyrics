		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My ba-by kissed me good-night, and I am glad to relate 
that by the time I got home, I was feeling great
I climbed up the door and o-pened the stairs.
I said my pajamas and put on my pray'rs.
I turned off the bed and crawled into the light.
and all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

Next morning, I woke and scrambled my shoes.
I shined up an egg, then I toasted the news,
I buttered my tie and took another bite.
and all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

By evening I felt normal, so we went out again.
You said, "Goodnight," and kissed me.
I hurried home and then,

I climbed up the door and opened the stairs.
I said my pajamas and put on my prayr's.
I turned off the bed and crawled into the light,
and all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

I powdered my hair and pinned up my nose.
I hung up the bath and I turned on my clothes.
I put out the clock and wound the cat up tight,
and all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

I ran up the shade and pulled down the stair.
I curled up the rug and I vacuumed my hair.
I just couldn't tell my left foot from my right,
and all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.

By evening I felt normal, so we went out again.
You said, "Goodnight," and kissed me.
I hurried home and then,

I lifted the preach'r and called up the phone.
I spoke to the dog and I threw your Ma a bone.
'Twas mid-night and yet, the sun was shining bright.
and all because you kissed me (Kiss) goodnight.
