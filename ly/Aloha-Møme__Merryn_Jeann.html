		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Soul lover, which way have you moved?
It's been a while since our bodies grooved
Cosmic love, gave you something gold
So you wrap it all up and take it
Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now, somehow
Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now
You're all you have to give
The unknown now
The unknown now
The unknown now
The unknown now

The things you've found
You feel a little younger
And you begin to wonder
What is it you want to love
What is it you want to love
What is it you want to love

Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now, somehow
Suddenly it's all real
Suddenly it's all you feel
You're free now
You're all you have to give
The unknown now
The unknown now
The unknown now
The unknown now

U-unknown, u-unknown
U-unknown, u-unknown
U-unknown, u-unknown
U-unknown, u-unknown

You release
You give yourself away
To the rhythms of the world adored by the sun's rays
What's left to do, to feel it all
You're alive now to die as dust
Nothing less as something more

U-unknown, u-unknown
U-unknown, u-unknown (something more)
U-unknown, u-unknown
U-unknown, u-unknown
