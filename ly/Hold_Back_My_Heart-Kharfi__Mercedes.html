		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and I
We got something stronger than the morning light
I just can't deny
You captivate me more than I could ever hide
When you know, you know I will never let you go
'Cause you got a hold on me and I give you full control
You're the fire that I'm craving, got my mind in a daze
I can't go one day without you close

You can't hold back my heart, I can't stand us apart
This attraction's electric, I'm drawn to your charge
I'm feeling the spark, need to be where you are
I can try to resist but you can't hold back my heart

You can't hold back my heart
You can't hold back my heart
Oh, you can't hold back
You can't hold back my heart
You can't hold back my heart

Mouth to mouth
Your love is like the air so I'll never drowned
Hold me down
Your touch has got me flying high above the clouds
When you know, you know I will never let you go
'Cause you got a hold on me and I give you full control
You're the fire that I'm craving, got my mind in a daze
I can't go one day without you close

You can't hold back my heart, I can't stand us apart
This attraction's electric, I'm drawn to your charge
I'm feeling the spark, need to be where you are
I can try to resist but you can't hold back my heart

You can't hold back my heart
You can't hold back my heart
Oh, you can't hold back
You can't hold back my heart
You can't hold back my heart
