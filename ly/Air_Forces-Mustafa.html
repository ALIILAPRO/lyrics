		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't crease your air forces
Just stay inside tonight
You know what's happenin' outside
You say it's okay
But you touch your chain
Like if they take it
I won't see you for a while
And I tell you how I feel
In case it's the last time
You know the odds, you know the flaws
It's all by design

And you'll go anywhere, though it ain't safe
Just know that I care, I'll always care
And I'll be awake

I'll be awake
I'll be awake
I'll be awake

And all these intersections
Where we've been kept and left in
I wonder why God keeps us alive?
To what are we even destined?
Will we have wives and children
Or is that not written for you and I?
You know they want what's yours
And they want what's mine
And if we're too holy, they think we're foldin'
They don't want us to climb

And you'll go anywhere, though it ain't safe
Just know that I care, I'll always care
And I'll be awake

I'll be awake
I'll be awake
I'll be awake (I'll be)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be awake

You see a couple kids runnin' around, playin' games
The dope boys ridin' around, ridin' bikes
Then you see obviously mans chillin' over at the green box
Just crackin' jokes, kickin' up
