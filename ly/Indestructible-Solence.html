		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won’t let
This break me
Even when the ground is shaking
I’m steady
I’m indestructible 

I won’t let
This crush me
Even when the world is breaking
I’m ready
I’m indestructible 

My heart is made of fire	
My body’s made of steel
My hands are working harder
Than what you think is real

So you can do
AnythingAnything
Anything you want with me
Honestly
I dare you come and Beat me up 
Lock me in
Yeah try it I would always always win
Cuz

I won’t let
This break me
Even when the ground is shaking
I’m steady
I’m indestructible 

I won’t let
This crush me
Even when the world is breaking
I’m ready
I’m indestructible 

My back is made of iron
My strength I find within
And I will never bow down
I don’t care what you think

So you can do
AnythingAnything
Anything you want with me
Honestly
I dare you come and Beat me up 
Lock me in
Yeah try it I would always always win
Cuz

I won’t let
This break me
Even when the ground is shaking
I’m steady
I’m indestructible 

I won’t let
This crush me
Even when the world is breaking
I’m ready
I’m indestructible

Indestructible
I won’t let
I won’t letIndestructible
I won’t let
No I will not let this bring me down bring me down

I won’t let
This break me
Even when the ground is shaking
I’m steady
I’m indestructible 

I won’t let
This crush me
Even when the world is breaking
I’m ready
I’m indestructible
