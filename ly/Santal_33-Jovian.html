		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the only man aside from Baba in this world that's allowed to touch you
Maison Margiela blinds keep out the evil eye it's no discussion
Ain't no need to ever holler back it's only me & wifey out in public
Where we flying to?
Where we shopping?
Making memories the only subject
Uh
No drama
Russian roulette with my karma
I'm not staying stagnant Obama
Trying to live a life low key like Osama
Can't stand whites that's using Ebonics
It's just me, my pugs, and my dogma
I owe all my dreams to my momma
All vegan no need for big pharma
Uh
I'm the only man aside from Baba in this world that's allowed to touch you
Maison Margiela blinds keep out the evil eye it's no discussion
Ain't no need to ever holler back it's only me & wifey out in public
Where we flying to?
Where we shopping?
Making memories the only subject
Stop and drop and roll
Loving too fire
Hope you not a liar
I am certified
Past is classified
Rumors crucified
I ain't got the time
Won't you be my wife
Color out the lines
You are my design
You gave me my decline
You were hard to find
How do we define
I can't find the rhyme
Love you to pieces and oh you know it
I'm the only man aside from Baba in this world that's allowed to touch you
Maison Margiela blinds keep out the evil eye it's no discussion
Ain't no need to ever holler back it's only me & wifey out in public
Where we flying to?
Where we shopping?
Making memories the only subject
If you getting close enough to smell my santal then that means I love you
I don't want no puzzle
Like El Chapo
I want a shovel
To build a tunnel
To feel your puddle
Want all your cuddles
We in some trouble
I'll never fumble
Come get my muscle
Fuck being humble
Ahhh
Want to be your only glow like a nightlight
Pound that shit like fight night
With you by me its only highlight
It's you who own my eyesight
Never thought that I could be with someone that own my soul
Hope you listen
Wrote this song just so you know
I'm the only man aside from Baba in this world that's allowed to touch you
Maison Margiela blinds keep out the evil eye it's no discussion
Ain't no need to ever holler back it's only me & wifey out in public
Where we flying to?
Where we shopping?
Making memories the only subject
