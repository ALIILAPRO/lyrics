		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's with these homies dissin' my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?

(Ooh ooh) But you know I'm yours
(Ooh ooh) And I know you're mine
(Ooh ooh) And that's for all of time

Ooh-wee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian

(Ooh ooh) And you know I'm yours
(Ooh ooh) And I know you're mine
(Ooh ooh) And that's for all of time

Ooh-wee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

Bang bang knockin' on the door
Another bang bang get down on the floor
Oh no, what do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
Whatsa matter babe, are you feelin' sick?
Whatsa matter, whatsa matter, whatsa matter you?
Whatsa matter, babe, are you feelin' blue?

Oh 

And that's for all of time
And that's for all of time

Ooh-wee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
