		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privvy counsellors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
The seven seas of rhye

Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
I belong to you forever

Storm the master marathon I'll fly through
By flash and thunder fire I'll survive
Then I'll defy the laws of nature and come out alive
Then I'll get you

Be gone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good, leave out the bad evil cries
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours
And with a smile
I'll take you to the seven seas of rhye
