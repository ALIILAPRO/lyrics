		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know what it's like when you wanna go cry
But you can't let out all the feelings inside?
So you lay in your bed under blankets and hide
And you let people know that you're feeling just fine
And your pillow gets stained with the tears that you cried
And you're praying nobody comes in and asks why
And the redness is already takin' your eyes
And you wish you could hide it but there's no disguising it

Cry, let it all out, go ahead, just fall down
I'm scared of me now
I don't want them to carry me out
Lies, you're filled up with doubts
When I scream, no words come out, bye
No sit on the couch
Let me hear what you gotta say now
I'm trapped in my mind
Look up, look left, look right, gone
No one's around
I've been calling to God, but it's hard when my voice
Wasn't taken by choice
So I keep making noise hoping they hear me
But they just fear me
I'm trapped in my mind
Look up, look left, look right
Gone, no one's around
I've been calling to God, but it's hard when my voice
Wasn't taken by choice
So I keep making noise hoping they hear me
But they just fear me

Do you know what it's like when you wanna go cry
But you can't let out all the feelings inside?
So you lay in the bed under blankets and hide
And you let people know that you're feeling just fine
And your pillow gets stained with the tears that you cried
And you're praying nobody comes in and asks why
And the redness is already takin' your eyes
And you wish you could hide it but there's no disguising it
Do you know what it's like when you wanna go cry
But you can't let out all the feelings inside?
So you lay in the bed under blankets and hide
And you let people know that you're feeling just fine
And your pillow gets stained with the tears that you cried
And you're praying nobody comes in and asks why
And the redness is already takin' your eyes
And you wish you could hide it but there's no disguising it

Cry, let it all out, go ahead, just fall down
I'm scared of me now
I don't want them to carry me out
Lies, you're filled up with doubts
When I scream, no words come out, bye
No sit on the couch
Let me hear what you gotta say now
I'm trapped in my mind
Look up, look left, look right
Gone, no one's around
I've been calling to God, but it's hard when my voice
Wasn't taken by choice
So I keep making noise hoping they hear me
But they just fear me
