		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always hated sitting in a busy room
Just tryna fake it, waiting to get through
Losing my patience and nobody knew
But somehow you always do
You took my hand, led the way
Opened my eyes, one look at your face
And I knew, I knew
You took my hand, led the way
I don't know why but I wanted to stay
I do, I do
Cause somehow
The city is better with you
Finding places I never knew
Doing things I never thought I'd do
It's better with you
Somehow
The noise never gets too loud
I'll never lose you even in the crowd
I could get used to you being around
It's better with you
The city is better with you
It's better with you
I've always wondered what it could have been
To find another person like me
To show me the world through a different lens
Nothing I've heard has been the same
You took my hand, led the way
Opened my eyes, one look at your face
And I knew, I knew
You took my hand, led the way
I don't know why but I wanted to stay
I do, I do
Cause somehow
The city is better with you
Finding places I never knew
Doing things I never thought I'd do
It's better with you
Somehow
The noise never gets too loud
I'll never lose you even in the crowd
I could get used to you being around
It's better with you
The city is better with you
It's better with you
