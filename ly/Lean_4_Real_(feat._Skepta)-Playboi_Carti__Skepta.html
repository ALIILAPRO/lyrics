That bag loaded, yeah, got it all the time
Nickelodeon way I got that slime
The Dream Mode, yeah, tatts showin', my teeth
Keep it tucked like a tee, shout out Midnight, Nine

Two nights in a coupe, yeah, yeah, silly bih, let's scoop
Oh yeah, yeah, I fucked her by the pool
Oh yeah, diamond wetter than your boo
Oh yeah, all that money take your loot

I'm on 'em beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real

Nickelodeon way I got that slime
The Dream Mode, tatts showin', my teeth
Keep it tucked like a tee, shout out Midnight Nine

Trust, trust
No, I can't dap you up
Yeah, you super sus
Better get used to us, had to go Super Saiyan
Had to go bird's eye view
You's a computer game
GTA, look at us run the streets
Give us this fuckin' food
This is a fuckin' feast
Man, I ain't throwing peace
I just throw up the V
Drinks spillin' on my shoe
Lean spillin' on my seats
Niggas is talkin' greazy
Please, freeze

I'm on the beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real
I'm on the beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real
I'm on the beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real
I'm on the beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real
I'm on the beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real
I'm on the beans for the real, I'm on the lean for real
