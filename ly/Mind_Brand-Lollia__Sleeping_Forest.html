		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on a second ma’am without a care 
The clothes you wear don’t give a damn
Sleeping up and down the block
They got you knocked up by a man
Thinking you’re the mother mary
Pure but very dumb and can’t
Kick the dick from out your mouth
But do you even understand?

Hold on a moment sir without a heart
What kind of shit you tryin’ to sell?
Talking up a simple girl
Ya picked her cherry very well
Promising the sun and moon
The story that you always tell
Now you’re out the door?!
I hope you cherry pick your way to hell

“When’s it coming? Can’t recall
Oh mirror mirror on the wall”
Sex and bitter cynicism 
Laughing, watch it start to fall
Picture perfect pandering
Pathetic, made you miserable
Though I shouldn’t care 
I couldn’t wait to finally see them all in hell
(I’ll drag them as we crawl)

Ah, doing it right, feeling that high, taking what’s mine 
And I feel just fine
You took it all away so now this hero cries in pain
Holding you tight, fighting all night, telling me why
But I can’t rewrite
The memories I made of you and me, won’t go away

Covered in cuts from head toe 
A kinky kind of crazy, not enough
Can you feel it too?
The kind of pain made out of real love
See the needy, greedy me
we bleed to feed so easily?
Idiocracy she breathes 
We needs to teach her everything!

Don’t ya know, it’s time to go?
“So hurry up or fall behind!”
Don’t know what they’re talkin’ bout?
“Well strap on in, enjoy the ride!”
Can’t see what’s ahead at all?
“I guess we’re gonna travel blind!”

Though I shouldn’t care at all
I’m just a drop of water in the sea
(And that’s a part of life)

Ah, changing my face, bearing that pain, joy that I made
And you threw away
The heroine alone and weeping all throughout the night
Feeling okay, talking all day, repeating that play
But they just won't fade
The memories we made of you and me, l couldn't fight

Poker face but the lies you buried deep were found 
Run away but there will be blood to go around
Try to hide but the scars will open up again
“Didn't like but it's gonna hurt you in the end”

Take it in stride, meeting your eyes, planning all night 
Remember those times?
Wallowing away in things I know I just can’t change
Laughing at jokes, getting so close, didn’t we know
That time goes so slow?
The memories are fading, I’ll say goodbye to everything
