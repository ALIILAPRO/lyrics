Ça peut être tout ce que tu veux
N'aie pas peur de tout vouloir
Il n'y a pas assez
(Keshi)

Big ice, feelin' so fine, shit is on me
And we spendin' all night, come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Got my bag right, on my own time
Now these bitches tongue-tied
Tryna get on this side, better come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it (yeah)

Paranoid, white noise, think they up to some'
Come and take more when they give you none
See me doin' good, why you reachin'?
'Cause I got everything I ever needed
Got my money (check), lady (check)
Rollie (check), Mary (check)
From the southside with my dawgies on deck
And we can't sit still less a chain on the neck, huh

Give me everything
Trade you anything you want
All this cash on me
Doesn't matter what it cost
Give me everything
Trade you anything you want
All this cash on me
All-all this cash on me

Big ice, feelin' so fine, shit is on me
And we spendin' all night, come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
Got my bag right, on my own time
Now these bitches tongue-tied
Tryna get on this side, better come and
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it

Ooh
You don't even know which one you are
Do you?
Having trouble telling them apart
