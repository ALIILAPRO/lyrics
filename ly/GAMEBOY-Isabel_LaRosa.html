		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  III don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
I know I'm being played, boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
Stop playing me, boy
Don't be a fucking lame boy
I don't wanna be one of your

3, 2, 1, fuck this, I'm done
It's the last time I pick you up
I drive you home, you're too damn drunk
To take the stairs, I hold you up
1 am headlights
We replay this game every Friday night

And I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
I know I'm being played, boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
Stop playing me, boy
Don't be a fucking lame boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
I know I'm being played, boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
You're like a song that I kinda really hate
Boy

Here I am, I'm now driving home
At 4 I still smell your cologne
Maybe I'll break my fucking phone
So when you call you hear a tone

I'm so sorry
I can't come to the phone right now
I'm no longer talking to
Dumb fucking indie boys bye!

I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
I know I'm being played, boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
Stop playing me, boy
Don't be a fucking lame boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
I know I'm being played, boy
I don't wanna be one of your games, boy
I'm not your Gameboy
You're like a song that I kinda really hate
Boy

Gameboy, Gameboy
I know, I know I'm being played, boy
Gameboy, Gameboy
I know, I know I'm being played, boy
G-G-Gameboy, G-G-G-G-G-Gameboy
G-G-Gameboy, G-G-G-G-G-Gameboy
