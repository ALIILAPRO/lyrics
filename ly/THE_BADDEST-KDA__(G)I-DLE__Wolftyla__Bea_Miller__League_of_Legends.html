		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baddest do, what the baddest do (hey)
The baddest do (hey), we the baddest, ooh
Baddest do, what the baddest do (hey)
The baddest do (hey), we the baddest

Coming at you live
Real, real wild
Here to light it up
Set the world on fire
Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
'Cause that's what the baddest do

Never going back
Nah, not that
Diamonds on drip
'Cause I came to make a splash
Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
'Cause that's what the baddest do

I spit heat, I melt your face off
Disappear, I'm your eraser
In the cut just like a razor
Murder business, where my blazer?
I got all the boys on me
I got all the lines on ring
Knock 'em dead, turnin' heads
I got all the eyes on me

Pretty face 걸어들어와
유행 선두자
원하지만 못하잖아, 애가 타잖아
You like "whoa" KALI you the GOAT
난 알지 I know
준비해 'cause I like to ball
멈추지 않아
나는 lit 크게 like a bit
그거 말고 byte
믿어봐 큰 만큼 크게 어깨 펴고 high
백 퍼센트, 덤비지 못해 죽여주잖아
나는 boss 간지 with the sauce
원하면 줄게

I'm doing damage
Went just how I planned it
I do what I want when I say (when I say, when I say)
모두 날 따라 해, 난 끝내주잖아
To live on the edge of insane

Coming at you live
Real, real wild
Here to light it up
Set the world on fire
Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
'Cause that's what the baddest do

Never going back
Nah, not that
Diamonds on drip
'Cause I came to make a splash
Gonna break rules and hearts in twos
'Cause that's what the baddest do

(It's crazy)
Sorry for the bad news, sorry I'm so bad
Only took a minute for me to get what you had
Sorry for the bad news, know it makes you sad
I'll be here for a minute, baby, you should pack your bags

Way that I look should be breaking the law
If I don't got it, I take what I want
My circle small like a round of applause
You know that I love the sound of applause
You know I mean everything that I say
When you see me coming get out of the way
I came to slay, I came to slay
Back and I'm better and ready to stay

I'm doing damage
Went just how I planned it
I do what I want when I say (when I say, when I say)
모두 날 따라 해, 난 끝내주잖아
To live on the edge of insane

(It's crazy)
Sorry, not sorry for being the best
언제든지 내가 좀 해
Look at the gold all on my chest
Look at the gold, call it a flex
