		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you

Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in, ah

This is the last time

Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I got Tylenol and beer
I was thinking that you'd call somebody
Closer to you

Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You're the only thing I want
And I said I wouldn't cry about it, ah

This is the last time
This is the last time

We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant

We were so under the brine
We were so out of our minds
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant

Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you

Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in, ah

I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waitin' anymore

Jenny, I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny, I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything (it takes a lot of pain)

Jenny, I am in trouble 
Can't get these thoughts out of me to (pick me up)
Jenny, I'm seeing double (it takes a lot of rain)
I know this changes everything (in my cup)

It takes a lot of pain to pick me up
It takes a lot of rain in my cup
It takes a lot of pain 

Baby, you gave me bad ideas
Baby, you left me sad and high
