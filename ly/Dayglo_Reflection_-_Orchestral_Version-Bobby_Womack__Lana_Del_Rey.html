		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The earth is but a Dayglo reflection
A turn that will bring you only life
I'm forming to myself, but I'm not broken
Waiting for the day to bring me light

If everything said everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I break down, I take you down
And I love it every step of the way

Day-ohh

As a singer grows older
His conception goes a little deeper
Because he lives life 
And he understands what he's trying to say a little more
As the singer tries to find out what's happening in life
It gives him a better insight
On telling the story of the song he's trying to sing

Watching from a distant constellation
Eyes that can see the world in changing hues
Visions still unfold in sweet imagining
Time reveals that love's the only truth

If everything said everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I break down, I take you down
And I love it every step of the way

Day-ohh
