		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beneath the starry sky
Of a distant moon
At the magic moment
That's gonna come too soon
There was a girl like me
There was a boy like you
She made him sing like Elvis
When she's feeling blue

You tell me that you want it, yeah, yeah
You tell me that you need it, yeah, yeah
And know you can't have it, yeah, yeah
So get your head down pretty-boy

You got the dreams of children
You gotcha eyes of gold
I hope you live to see them
Before you get too old

You tell me that you want it, yeah, yeah
Tell me that you need it, yeah, yeah
And know you can't have it, yeah, yeah
So get your head down pretty-boy

She was a lot like me
She was a lot like you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
You bring the whole world down
I'll make your dreams come true

Tell me that you want it, yeah, yeah
Tell me that you need it, yeah, yeah
And know you can't have it, yeah, yeah
So get your head down pretty-boy

She was a lot like me
She was a lot like you
No matter what you say
No matter what you do
You bring the whole world down

Can you delete my number?
I wanna get me free
I wanna change my star sign
Because it don't suit me
Because it don't suit me
Because it don't suit me
Because it don't suit me
