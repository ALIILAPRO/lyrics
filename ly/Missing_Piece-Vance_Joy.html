		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been waiting for the tides to change
For the waves to send you my way
I see you darling but you pixilate
It gets hard to take these days

But we'll hold the line, I won't let go
'Cause I'll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind 'cause we both know
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found (oh)
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down (oh)

I remember happy wasted days
Summer's golden haze in our eyes
Lifting you above the breakin' waves
Memories floatin' back to my mind

You said, "Hold the line", I won't let go
'Cause I'll be there when you can finally make it home
And I don't mind 'cause we both know
That we'll be fine when you can finally make it home

Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found (oh)
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down (oh)
It's like when you're far away from me
I get lost in the crowd (oh)
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found (oh)

Oh, I won't waste a minute when you're here
And we're finally in the clear
When every day is like the last
I just keeping holdin' fast

Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found (oh)
You know when you're by my side, darling
Nothing can bring us down (oh)
It's like when you're far away from me
I get lost in the crowd (oh)
Because when I'm in a room with you
That missing piece is found (oh)
