		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, ayyy, yeah, yeah
Gone off the gin yeah, yeah (Ayy)
Ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy, ayy
Ayy, yeah

I feel like a villain
No remorse, I run them out
I had to change my digits
New niggas acting out
I just mind my business
Mask off, dreads down (Ayy, ayy)
You know my position
Turn my shit up fucking loud
Cancel, fucking canceled, they move backwards
Bands up, got my bands up, it's a handful (It's a)
Mansion (Ayy)
Overviews the city like the council
Now look
I had to tear this shit up like an animal
Young nigga, rich as fuck
But I rock no ice
Roll around with my hood up (Ayy, ayy)
They know Scarlxrd isn't nice
Mesh mask on my face
When I'm strolling through the night
Got a handful of friends
Guess I had to pay the price

I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up! (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up! (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

Live in a land alone, my brains the antidote
Eat like a cannibal, feeding myself
Your life is laughable
Took her and dashed the hoe
Ah, just had to challenge myself
Had to go radical
Shits so impractical
Now I just manage myself
It's all about me, me, me, me, me, me, me
I should go fuck myself
Ayy, I do not stress no worries
Ayy, niggas that hate, ain't got money
I'm keeping my head down
Now pay day is coming
I'm not on no bullshit just working
And dusting these fuckers
That though they could try me, yeah
I'm my own biggest rival, yeah
All of these lights are so blinding, yeah
I'm happy and numb to the violence, yeah
Pick up and run the wealth, hey
I had to go run the wealth, hey
Run up the check I dealt, yuh
I got another belt, ayy
I had to learn myself, yeah
I had to learn myself, yeah
I had to learn myself, yeah
I had to learn myself, yeah
Uh, I might dance to my steady notes, of course
I'm on job with my steady form, yeah, yeah
Making moves 'til they're red and blue
Huh, getting down in my mansion
Wait, how did I get my fix some more
I don't buy no new shit no more
Never gonna mix my drink no more
Let them all talk their shit some more
Ever so lit
I'm so on form
It's a miracle
Done with the minimal
If you get ridiculed
Sorry that's just your fault
Nigga that's just your fault

I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
I'm like wait, uh, shut the fuck up!
(Fuck up! Ayy, ayy)
