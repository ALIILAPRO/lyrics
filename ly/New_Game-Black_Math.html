		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fresh wound
Its the start
Zip tied in my lonely heart
Got a new lease on a dark room
Developing pictures and it feels too soon
I can't help it
Lean in
Trust fall onto a concrete floor
But I can't say anything

Oh
Cell phone 
Taped to my palm
Cliffhanging on your painted nails
Oh
Finger on 
Headshot
Gotta watch myself 
 
This is my new game

Look out a window
Glass breaks when I blink in slow motion
Raindrops splitting off
Ten paths on a race to the bottom
And I got some fear on my tongue
And you just gave me a reason
To empty the poison in my lungs
And aim it right through my thumbs

This is my new game

Oh 
Cell phone 
Taped to my palm
Cliffhanging on your painted nails
Oh
Finger on 
Headshot
And I watch myself 
Oh 
Game on 
Race to a bomb
Cliffhanging on the last detail
Oh
Trigger on 
Dead drop
I never stop myself

(It's never gonna go away
Just staring at it in the face
Heavy breath and I feel the weight
Dead drop
Never stop myself)

Never stop myself

This is my new game
This is my new game
This is my new game
I can't help it
This is my new game

This is my new game
This is my new game
This is my new game
This is my new game
