		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I've had you troubled
And I know I've seared your mind
But you know that I love you
And that our love's not blind
I'm sure my dreams lie with you
But I've many more besides
And if I can't see them through
Our love will slowly die

So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your, dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your, dare I say forever

And I've known pious women
Who have lead such secret lives
Shameless in the dark, so shameful in the light
And you may not be pious and I may not be saved
But we could live quite happily and quietly unfazed

So if you doubt for the time that you're spending
And if you doubt for the love in your heart
Think of London and the girl you're returning
And the days you defend will turn to gold

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your, dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your, dare I say forever

I was dreaming of the Liffey
I was thinking of the Thames
And now the east river flows by to the same end
Are we too sentimental to not look back and stare?

So love with your eyes
Love with your mind
Love with your, dare I say forever
Do it for yourself
Do it for the girl
Do it for your, dare I say forever
