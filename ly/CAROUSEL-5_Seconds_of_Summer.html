		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I built it from the ground up just to watch me burn it down
I gotta keep the party goin', ain't no fadin' out
My life's just a carousel spinnin' around
I'd pay again just to keep from stoppin' it now
I try to keep my head above the ocean of my doubt
I'm feeling like a dreamer, don't ya try to wake me now
My life's just a carousel spinnin' around
I'd pay again just to keep from stoppin' it now

Lookin' for myself in the passenger's side
Drivin' to the edge 'til I get this right
Tryna find the city with the brightest sky
How you gonna get there, get there?
Always lookin' back and I don't know why
Something always there in the back of my mind
Everybody's livin' on a one-way ride
How you gonna get there, get there?

I feel like I'm a tiger in the circus, breathe again
Every time I jump it's gettin' higher, never ends
Oh, my life's just a carousel spinnin' around
I'd pay again just to keep from stoppin' it now

Lookin' for myself in the passenger's side
Drivin' to the edge 'til I get this right
Tryna find the city with the brightest sky
How you gonna get there, get there?
Always lookin' back and I don't know why
Something always there in the back of my mind
Everybody's livin' on a one-way ride
How you gonna get there, get there?

(Ah, ah)
My life's just a carousel spinnin' around
I'd pay again just to keep from stoppin' it now
My life's just a carousel spinnin' around
I'd pay again just to keep from stoppin' it now
