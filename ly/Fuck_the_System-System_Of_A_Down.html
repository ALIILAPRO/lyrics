		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm, but a little bit bit bit, show
But a little bit bit bit, shame
But a little bit, bit, bit
Bit Bit Bit

I'm, but a little bit bit bit, show
But a little bit bit bit, shame
But a little bit, bit, bit
Bit Bit Bit

I'm just the man in the back
Just the man in the back
Just the man in the back

I'm just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack

War
Fuck the system
War
Fuck the system
Fuck the system
War
Fuck the system
War
I need to fuck the Sys
I need to fuck the Sys
I need to fuck the Sys

I'm, but a little bit bit bit, show
But a little bit bit bit, shame
But a little bit, bit, bit
Bit Bit Bit

I'm, but a little bit bit bit, show
But a little bit bit bit, shame
But a little bit, bit, bit
Bit Bit Bit

I'm just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack

I'm just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack
Just demeaning the pack

War
Fuck the system
War
Fuck the system
Fuck the system
War
Fuck the system
War

I need to fuck the Sys
I need to fuck the Sys
I need to fuck the Sys

You need to fuck the sys
You need to fuck the sys
You need to fuck the sys
We all need to fuck the sys

I'm, but a little bit bit bit, show
But a little bit bit bit, shame
But a little bit, bit, bit
Bit Bit Bit

I need to fuck the system
I need to fuck the sys
I need to fuck the system
We all need to fuck the system
