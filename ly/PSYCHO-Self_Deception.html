		  P-S-Y-C-H-O
Go psycho
P-S-Y-C-H-O
Go psycho

Oh dear, it seem's like we have struck a nerve here
And she's upset chain-smoking all her cigarettes
While contemplating retribution

They say when you want peace, you prepare for war
Now you have no idea of what she has got in store
'Cause if you want peace, you prepare for war

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

This is a god damn war
You will be paying for
It's fucking drama spelled
P-S-Y-C-H-O
You should be terrified
Of what is held inside
It's fucking drama spelled
P-S-Y-C-H-O

P-S-Y-C-H-O
Go psycho
P-S-Y-C-H-O
Go psycho

Kick back, relax and have another glass, the sass
She packs has precision like a surgeons hands
I swear you haven't yet seen nothing

They say when you want peace, you prepare for war
Now you have no idea of what she has got in store
'Cause if you want peace, you prepare for war

Nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

This is a god damn war
You will be paying for
It's fucking drama spelled
P-S-Y-C-H-O
You should be terrified
Of what is held inside
It's fucking drama spelled
P-S-Y-C-H-O

Got to let it out
Got to let it out
Got to let it out
Got to let it out
Got to let it out

It's a fucking shitshow, c'mon

This is a god damn war
You will be paying for
It's fucking drama spelled
P-S-Y-C-H-O
You should be terrified
Of what is held inside (watch out, watch out)
It's fucking drama spelled
P-S-Y-C-H-O (it's fucking drama spelled)

P-S-Y-C-H-O
Go psycho (come on, come on)
P-S-Y-C-H-O
Go psycho
