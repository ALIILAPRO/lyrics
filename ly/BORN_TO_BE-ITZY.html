		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on, come on, I'm on it
Born to be, born to be, born to be, oh

Brand new fire
이젠 내 시간이야 let me turn the tide, move
Ice blue silver
I'm shining like a star, I go boom, go boom

Sit down, enjoy the show 'cause it's about to go down
Transcend 한계를 넘어 now I'm running it
딱 봐도 yeah, I'm the realest (don't you know?)
절대 없어 I got nothing missing, oh, yeah (yeah, yeah)

모든 시선들이 나를 향해 (yeah, yeah)
잠든 감각들이 깨어나 I'll prove it (I'll prove it)
Don't need your permission (so what? So what?)
Every step I take is in victory lane, yeah

I'm about to have this whole crowd going (let's go)
Crazy like 한 번도 느껴본 적 없는 (come on)
Can you see what I've become now?
Yeah, let's turn it up now

Born to be, born to be, born to be, oh, oh
Born to be, born to be wild and free, oh, oh
누가 뭐라 해도 I'ma say it louder (louder)
난 내 방식대로 always hit it harder
Born to be, born to be wild and free, oh, oh

Born to be (yeah) so fierce (yeah)
한 번도 (yeah) 못 느낀 fears
Sensation (yeah), I'ma bring (yeah)
Get ready (yeah), don't be tense
따라오는 spotlight, watch me glow
Young and wild and free 더 자신 있게
이젠 nothing's going wrong

Don't compare 다른 것들
Just don't care 내 맘대로
Bounce it, bounce it, turn it up
Got that winning pace, I'm going up (going up), oh, yeah

모든 시선들이 나를 향해
잠든 감각들이 깨어나 I'll prove it
Can you see what I've become now?
Yeah, let's turn it up now (ooh-whoa)

Born to be (yeah, yeah), born to be (yeah, yeah), born to be, oh, oh
Born to be (come on), born to be wild and free, oh, oh (wild and free, whoa)
누가 뭐라 해도 I'ma say it louder (louder)
난 내 방식대로 always hit it harder
Born to be, born to be wild and free, oh, oh

누가 뭐라 해도 (ha-ha) 누가 뭐라 해도
누가 뭐라 해도 (ooh) I'ma say it louder
누가 뭐라 해도, 누가 뭐라 해도
(Born to be) 누가 뭐라 해도 always hit it harder (born to be)
Born to be, born to be, born to be

Born to be (yeah, yeah), born to be (yeah, yeah), born to be (yeah), oh, oh
Born to be (yeah, yeah), born to be (yeah, yeah) wild and free, oh, oh
누가 뭐라 해도 I'ma say it louder (louder)
난 내 방식대로 always hit it harder (harder)
Born to be, born to be (oh, yeah) wild and free, oh, oh
