		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been strong for so long
You learned to carry this on your own
Let me be someone
You can lean on
I'm right here, I'm right here
I'm right here

You don't have to be so strong
You don't have to be so strong
You don't have to be so strong

You carry so much on your own
If you need someone to lean on
You carry so much on your own
If you need someone to lean on

You don't have to be so
You don't have to be so
You don't
You carry so much on your own
I'm right here, I'm right here
I'm right here, I'm right here

You don't have to be so strong
(You don't have to be so strong)
You don't have to be so strong
Don't go through it all alone
You don't have to be so strong
Don't go through it all alone
You don't have to be so strong
Don't
Don't
Don't
You don't have to be so strong (don't)
Don't
Don't
Don't
Don't

You don't have to be so strong
You don't have to be so strong
I'm right here, I'm right here
I'm right here, I'm right here
You don't have to be so strong
