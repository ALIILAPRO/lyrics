		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I looked at myself
I said what the hell
And then I thought you were gone
But I knew you were too good

And I said to myself let me go
And I said to myself let me go

'Cause you're burning a bridge
In a field that I sleep in
Working a feeling
And no, I can't keep it
And I'm over it
Let me go

You were looking at me
like you knew I was weak
But the harder I try
The more I let you win

And I said to myself let me go
And I said to myself let me go

'Cause you're burning a bridge
In a field that I sleep in
Working a feeling
And no, I can't keep it
I'm over it

'Cause I feel like a fool when I walk through your fire
I need you to bruise cause I'm sick and I'm tired
Do you hear me now?
Do you hear me now?
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go
