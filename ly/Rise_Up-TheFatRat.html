		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you feel it's hopeless
When you think that you're lost, oh
I will take your hand and
We'll rise up from the dust, oh

Here we go, go, go
Let us heal and grow
You won't be alone, we're unstoppable

Don't be afraid to show
What we're going for
This is what we know

Here we come back to life, we're still breathing
Standing up, everybody's gonna see it
All you need to know is that we're holding on
Even if we fall, we will rise up

And we follow the path that we believe in
No, we're not gonna stop until we reach it
All you need to know is that we're holding on
We rise up from the dust and claim our throne

We rise up from the dust and claim our throne (throne, throne, throne)

We all have our reasons
Why we're on this track, oh
We all have our burdens yeah, but
We just keep on fighting and we never look back

Here we go, go, go
Let us heal and grow
You won't be alone, we're unstoppable

Don't be afraid to show
What we're going for
This is what we know

Here we come back to life, we're still breathing
Standing up, everybody's gonna see it
All you need to know is that we're holding on
Even if we fall we will rise up

And we follow the path that we believe in
No, we're not gonna stop until we reach it
All you need to know is that we're holding on
We rise up from the dust and claim our throne

We rise up from the dust and claim our throne (throne, throne, throne)

We rise up from the dust and claim our throne (throne, throne, throne)
