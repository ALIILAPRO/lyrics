		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been traveling
Met alotta shawties
But I'm back again back again
Back to my Naija shawty
She give me what I want
Every time me ah need
I've been traveling traveling
Met alotta shawties
But I'm back again back again
Back to my Naija shawty
She give me what I want
Every time me ah need

I've been traveling traveling
Met alotta shawties
But I'm back again back again
Back to my Naija shawty
She give me what I want
Every time me ah need (sweet melanin)

Something something sweet
You see di man ah coming from a foreign place
Me nah get time for any hide and seek
Oh oh oh oh my vibration
Tell me what it do
I know say your paddy them dey form e shubs dey do
And they tell you every everything
Wey I dey do when I'm away
E dey make you feel some typa way
Oh my baby see I'm back now
Back with the same dick that made you pass out
Back with the same rizz that gets your pants down
Bad with it you the baddest baby hands down
And I know this cause you know that

I've been traveling traveling
Met alotta shawties
But I'm back again back again
Back to my Naija shawty
She give me what I want
Every time me ah need
I've been traveling traveling
Met alotta shawties
But I'm back again back again
Back to my Naija shawty
She give me what I want
Every time me ah need (sweet melanin)
