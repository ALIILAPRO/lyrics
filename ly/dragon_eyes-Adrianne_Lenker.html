		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Freezing at the edge of the bed
Chewing a cigarette and repeating
Shadows of the words I said
I don't wanna blame you
I don't wanna blame

Stars bloom in the warm summer night
They have a clear view
Without the bedroom light
They don't wanna name you
They don't want a name

Dragons have silent eyes
Cracked eggshells, fireflies
I don't wanna tame you
I don't wanna tame

When the hot sand burns my feet
You have cool hands, you are sweet
I don't wanna change you
I don't wanna change

Carnations into the vase
Unfold your clothes, out of the case
I just want a place with you
I just want a place

As the coastline is shaped by the wind
As we make love and you're on my skin
You are changing me
You are changing

Stars bloom
On a warm summer night
They have a clear view
Without the bedroom light
I just want a place with you
I just want a place
