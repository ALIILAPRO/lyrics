		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slow it down
Unless we focus we won't break ground
We say we wouldn't yet but somehow
We ended up in smoke clouds
Yeah, it's about time
We trusted and ignored the road signs
Let's go another round for old times sake
Making the way out of this low tides
With closed eyes

I would lie
If I'd say that I don't kinda like
All those games that we play
I'd like to play pretend, but in the end
Feels like we are frozen in time

I'm bleeding faster
Feels like my lungs are out of plaster
I feel like I just had enough
My thoughts are coming to a stop
Stuck in a deadlock
Not moving forward, twirling nonstop
Our minds are misbehaving, constantly deviating
Anticipating the worst outcome

I would lie
If I'd say that I don't kinda like
All those games that we play
I'd like to play pretend, but in the end
Feels like we are frozen in time

I would lie
If I'd say that I don't kinda like
All those games that we play
I'd like to play pretend, but in the end
Feels like we are frozen in time

I would lie
If I'd say that I don't kinda like
All those games that we play
I'd like to play pretend, but in the end
Feels like we are frozen in time
