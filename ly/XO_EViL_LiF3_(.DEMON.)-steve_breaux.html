I'm with the dogs with the pack (Grrrrr)
We do not know how to lack (Owooooooo)
Fuck do you know bout these racks? (Uh, Wha?)
Fuck do you know bout these gats? (Ba ba ba)
Vicious, a whole lotta black (Damn)

Bands in my teeth
Keep my receipts
Accountant be busy I'm playing for keeps
Don't fuck with neither uh

My girl look like Nana
Bank account, I'm adding commas huh
Bitch, you got nada
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
Count these racks don't give no fuck
