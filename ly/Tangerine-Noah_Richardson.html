		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh you know
You're a heartbreaker baby
You're too good at leaving
And you know I'm a
Storm chaser baby
I don't stop believing
Me and you got a lot to say
When we go and walk away
Your hair still stuck in my bedsheets
Your scent sweet like tangerine
Doing what I can do to come clean
Addicted to you and your misery
No brush but you left your toothpaste
So I won't forget how you taste
Been going out all place to place
But all I look for is your face
Oh you know you're a sorceress
Dont cha babe
Put me under your spell
And you know I'm
Tortured oh babe
Was it so hard to tell
Me and you got a lot to say
But we won't walk away
Your hair still stuck in my bedsheets
Your scent sweet like tangerine
Doing what I can do to come clean
Addicted to you and your misery
No brush but you left your toothpaste
So I won't forget how you taste
Been going out all place to place
But all I look for is your face
Your hair still stuck in my bedsheets
Your scent sweet like tangerine
Doing what I can do to come clean
Addicted to you and your misery
No brush but you left your toothpaste
So I won't forget how you taste
Been going out all place to place
But all I look for is your face
