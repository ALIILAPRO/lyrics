		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been slowly escaping your dimension
Trying to drag me to another plane
And I can't help but feel your bad intentions
A black cloud I can see from miles away

You're the worst kind of criminal, yeah
You miss your shots
Treat me like I'm invisible
Is that all you've got? Oh

I don't have time for your drama
Follow me around like piranhas
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana, no
Steady sweating me like a sauna
All it's gonna be is bad karma
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana

Walking in like a lamb into the slaughter
Can't comprehend how you do this every time
'Cause no one else can turn wine back into water
Steal the charm just like a crook
You wrote the book on killing vibes

You're the worst kind of criminal, yeah
You miss your shots
Treat me like I'm invisible
Is that all you got? Oh

I don't have time for your drama
Follow me around like piranhas
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana, no
Steady sweating me like a sauna
All it's gonna be is bad karma
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana

Made it this far, so I can't start running
Not gonna let you take this from me
Made it this far, so I can't start running
Not gonna let you take this, take this

I don't have time
I don't have time
I don't have time for your drama
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana, no
Steady sweating me like a sauna
All it's gonna be is bad karma
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana

Made it this far, so I can't start running
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana
Made it this far, so I can't start running
You're acting like you don't, but you wanna
Take my nirvana
Take my nirvana
