		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Glad to see your wide awake 
This is the great escape 
From a life that tried to mold you
And the lie it sold you 

What would you do? 
What wouldn't you do? 
What would you do? 
What wouldn't you do? 
What would you do? 
What wouldn't you do? 

Did you try to reason why 
Look yourself in the eye 
What you are is all you have been 
What will be is all you do now

What would you do? 
What wouldn't you do? 
What would you do? 
What wouldn't you do? 
What would you do? 
What wouldn't you do?

Spill a tear as your sense of self slowly 
Melts away 
Melts away 
Melts away 

Until death's mirror reflects 
The meaning of our lives 
We wander aimless and mesmerized 
As the fear starts to rise.
