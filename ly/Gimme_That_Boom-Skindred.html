		  Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that

Stand to attention, I come to mention
Now we're gonna take you in a different direction
That's the way we rock and make them move dem body
We got those over there asking for selfies
This time I got to say no
Don't try to pull down my bandana
Can't let you ruin my show
Then I hear (then I hear), then I hear them say

Turn around stupid, turn around
Turn around stupid, stupid turn around
Turn around stupid, now turn around
I don't care what you got

Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that

All and all this a place is crawling
Gyaldem a moving their body, dem bawling
Electricity just a light up the place
With a boom, boom, boom, you get a slap of di face
We got di vibes and the vibes is good good
You know we're rocking in di damn neighbourhood hood
You know the 'dred are gonna bring it like we should
Can I hear (can I hear), can I hear dem say
Turn around stupid, uh

Turn around stupid, turn around
Turn around stupid, stupid turn around
Turn around stupid, now turn around
I don't care what you got

Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that

Just gimme that
Gimme that gimme that
Just gimme that
Change up the groove some
Change up the groove some, come on
Change up the groove some
Change up the groove some
Now switch back to that

I don't care what you got
Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that boom, boom
Just gimme that, gimme that boom, boom, boom
Just gimme that, I don't care what you got
Just gimme that

Just gimme that
Just gimme that
Come on, just gimme that
Just gimme that
