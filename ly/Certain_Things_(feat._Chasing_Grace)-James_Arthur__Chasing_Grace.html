		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something about you
It's like a addiction
Hit me with your best shot, honey
I've got no reason to doubt you
'Cause some things hurt
And you're my only virtue
And I'm virtually yours

And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head

There's certain things that I adore
There's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

There's something about you
It's when you get angry
Hold me, I saw mercy
And you're like a shoulder to turn to
'Cause certain things burn just when we're hanging on for dear life
We held on so tight

And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head

And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours (certain that I'm yours)
Certain that I'm yours 

There's certain things that I adore
There's certain things that I ignore
(Let's ignore them, let's ignore them) I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours (I adore you)
(I adore you) certain that I'm yours 
I adore you, I adore you
I adore you, I adore you 
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them
Let's ignore them, let's ignore them
Certain that I'm yours
