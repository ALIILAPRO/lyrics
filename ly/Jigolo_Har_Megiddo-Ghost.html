		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am the one who preys on weak
I offer everything they seek
And I am the one who comes richly endowed
Harvesting crops of fields that others have plowed

I am the one, lascivious

I am the son of one below
The progeny of beast of woe
And I am the son who comes into the daughters of men
Destroying all and make them want it again

I am the son, lascivious

He is the one desacralizer
He is the son of the enticer
The all seeing subterranean kaiser
He is the way, he is the way

I am the way
And you invited me to stay
However fair and pure, you crave the wand
You see through me what lies beyond

I am the one lascivious
I am the one lascivious
I am the one lascivious
With magic potion niveous
