		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unreal, what is this?
God done gave me strength
Are these the front row seats you wanted?
We'll have our final moment

A walk-in attraction
A walkin' distraction
I'm naturally black and
Unnaturally breathin'
Like a waist that is snatchin'
Welcome to my world where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassin'
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yeah, I know when this
Yeah, I know when this drastic, where it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'
When I'm back in the
When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the (ah)

I know our love is forsaken (woo)
But do you care if I was alive? (Whenever I'm back in the)
Or do you wanna be famous? (Woo, yeah)

I took the top off
Like she took that lil' blouse off
Too hard to go drop off
You know that boy not soft
I never would travel
So I need me a time vault
I been up in Cabo
With my palo santo
In this world, look around, yo
It's just mano y mano
I might still eat McDonald's
But don't think I'm a Ronald
I went back to my land
Move like Moses, walkin' over seas
In my state big as the country
Every part of it is part of me
Tell your parliament, "Pardon me" (woo)
Off the saké, turned to Socrates (woo)
Havin' moments on the ground
Finna shape it, in the sound
'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in your house
And you know that we down
If your ass don't know nothin'
Gotta know that it's time
I'm excited, it's jumpin'
So much that I'm flyin'
Put you right in the function
Took you right off a vine
Got this shit in a bind
We at it, we got it now (ah, woo)
Whenever I'm duckin' it (ah, woo)

I'm waiting on a let go
I'm waiting on a let go
I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special
Go, go, let your fame
I'm waiting in an echo
I'm waiting in an echo
'Cause you keep callin' back, I thought I told you that we do not
Sorry, I didn't let you out, out
Out, whoa-oh
(Out)
(Out, whoa-oh)
