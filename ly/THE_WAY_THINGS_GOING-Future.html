		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh-oh, oh

The way things goin', nigga, might not see the backend
Way things goin', gotta ride 'round with an FN
Way things goin', only family matters
Way things goin', made my whole crowd scatter
Way things goin', get the money off top
Way things goin', niggas made it off the block
Way things goin', gotta pull up in that drop
The way things goin', oh

Way things goin', oh (yeah)
Way things goin', oh (hey, you gotta fill my cup)

Tom Ford, suit and dress, them handin' out my business
Raised in the trenches, been in the trap since a infant
Sold all my dope, now, my trap 'bout to finish
Pack came in the mail, I run through 'em in a minute
Money went to my brain, ice done got in my skin
Down as shit, you trappin' shit, I'm treatin' you like my twin
'Rari with the wing on it, I spent like seven tens
Shawty and them goin' seven-thirty every time they go spin
I wouldn't mislead you, too caught up in my winds (I wouldn't mislead you)
Bullet-proof Trackhawk, had to geek out the engine
Got it out the concrete, flyin' to other countries
Bad bitch, poppin' outside, Gucci onesie

The way things goin', nigga, might not see the backend
Way things goin', gotta ride 'round with a FN
Way things goin', only family matters
Way things goin', made my whole crowd scatter
Way things goin', get the money off top
Way things goin', niggas made it off the block (off the block)
The way things goin', gotta pull up in that drop
The way things goin', oh

Way things goin', oh
Way things goin', oh (gotta pull up foreign, you know what I'm sayin'?)

Mad rich, got it out the mud, it was ugly
Average, I can't go back to havin' nothin' (I can't go back)
Savage, product of my environment, I'm hustlin'
Karats, clarity gon' glisten when it's dirty
Karats, they glisten when they dirty, keep a thirty
Bulletproof Suburban, avoidin' all the worries
The way I ball, I know for sure they'll retire my jersey 
Breakin' the laws, wake up early mornin', go serve it
Take the time buildin' my crib like a pyramid (that's my crib)
Reminiscin' where I come from, gettin' money a religion
You got smoke in the air, don't let it cloud your vision
Some of my partners not here, I really do miss you
Take the money and ball it up, and use it for tissues
Sendin' gun powder out, resolvin' these issues
And the way things goin' is very malicious
It's another bloody summer inside of my city

Uh-uh, it's another bloody summer inside of my city
Uh-uh, the way things goin' (the way things goin')
