		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Joyner, yeah

I don't need no intro for you niggas, put my beat on (yeah)
Take them bullshit rappers out your playlist and put me on (yeah)
This the type of shit to blow the speakers out your Neon (uh)
Not right now, I'm busy, ho, don't call me, I'm on Piedmont (brr)
Hit me when the D gone (uh)
Man, the block is hot, this ain't no street for you to speed on (Joyner)
Ever since a youngin, always knew one day I'd be on (be on)
Sick and tired of strugglin', I know this ain't where I belong

No (whoa), this ain't where I belong (yeah)
'Member they all laughed at me when I put my CD on (huh)
Now I made some Ms and treat these bastards like some peons (huh)
Show these pussy niggas I got somethin' for them to bleed on, yeah
And tonight, I'm gettin' my freak on (freak on)
Broke up with my ho 'cause she too hard for me to cheat on
Way too many fishes in the sea for me to feed on (yeah)
I got me some, hold up (yeah), wait
To keep it one hunnid, I never gave up and it's probably 'cause I got no patience
If I gotta bully my way in this bitch, then I'm doin' whatever it's takin'
But just when I feel like I'm growin', it seems all my niggas on the same shit (yeah)
Funny, I'm thinkin' it's probably the women that make all these niggas complacent (uh)
I'm walkin' around in my mansion, I'm thinking 'bout days where I lived in the basement (uh)
But I never changed up my circle, I'm still in the buildin' with niggas I came with (Joyner)
I look at the moves a nigga was makin' (whoa)
I should have been on the news for all of the rules a nigga was breakin' (yeah), uh
I know I'm leavin' they stomach in knots (uh)
I live my life like a demon, I wonder if Jesus still love me or not (uh)
I tried to keep 'em from puttin' they hands on the stove when the oven was hot (uh)
This oughta be the best version of me when they want me to be stuck in a box
I ain't got time to fuck with the clock, I'm duckin' the feds, I'm runnin' the block
I'm feelin' like Pac in Juice, I'm jumpin' on roofs when niggas are runnin' from cops
I swerve to the right, a word of advice, don't ever pretend to be somethin' you're not
And I'm always gon' be around whether you love me or not, bitch

And I don't need no intro for you niggas, put my beat on (yeah)
Take them bullshit rappers out your playlist and put me on (yeah)
This the type of shit to blow the speakers out your Nissan (uh)
Not right now, I'm busy, ho, don't call me, I'm on Piedmont (brr)
Just hit me when the D gone (uh)
Man, the block is hot, this ain't no street for you to speed on (brr)
Ever since a youngin, always knew one day I'd be on (be on)
Sick and tired of strugglin', I knew this ain't where I belong (Joyner, Joyner)

This ain't where I belong (uh)
I go TLC all in your bitch and get my creep on (mm)
Watch your fucking tone, I'm not the one for you to speak on (uh)
I got on CÃ©line, you rockin' Celine Dion
That's the shit you be on
I just turned your bird into a ex, I feel like Elon
She ain't buy my album, tell that ho to get her stream on
If the Celtics playin', shut the fuck up when my team on
Joyner's not the one to scheme on
I pull out this chopper, blow some shots until your knee gone
We don't like your music, rather listen to some emo (emo)
Niggas treat your mixtape like some shit to roll some weed on
I ain't featurin' on your shit, you better dream on (yeah)
"Not right now, I'm busy," what I tell them when they keep on (uh)
This the type of shit to blow the speakers out your Neon (uh)
Take them bullshit rappers out your playlist and put me on

Put me on (put me on)
Uh, yeah
You don't wanna die of-, call toll-free
Now how the hell do I turn this camera on?
Here we go, I think I got it
So my name is Joyner Lucas
