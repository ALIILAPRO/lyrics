		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  from the bottom of my heart
boy i've gotta tell you this
since the day we've been apart
you're the only one I miss
i'm like a tree with no roots
I just can't live without you, yeah yeah

thought we were just a summer romance
nothing but a passing fling
seemed my heart had other plans
now i'm a puppet on a string
don't leave me dangling out there
boy can't you tell how much I care
still see the sunlight in your hair, oh, oh

chorus:
i've been missing your stawberry kisses
cuz nothing's as sweet
the taste still drives me crazy
i've been wishing my strawberry kisses
could fly through the wind
to you from me

there's no question at all
boy, your tops on my list
i'm falling head over toes
at the thought of your lips

I know you're cryin no no
can't write those pretty words to show
me how you feel deep inside -- but oh-oh

chorus:
i've been missing your stawberry kisses
cuz nothing's as sweet
the taste still drives me crazy
i've been wishing my strawberry kisses
could fly through the wind
to you from me

I know what i'll do
when i find you
you're gonna make me your girl
youre gonna be mine
even if I gotta search the whole world

chorus:
i've been missing your stawberry kisses
cuz nothing's as sweet
the taste still drives me crazy
i've been wishing my strawberry kisses
could fly through the wind
to you from me
