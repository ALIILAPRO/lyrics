		  Haha, well now
We call this the act of mating
But there are several other very important differences
Between human beings and animals that you should know about

(I'd appreciate your input)

Sweat, baby, sweat, baby sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes, I'm Siskel, yes, I'm Ebert
And you're getting two thumbs up
You've had enough of two-hand touch
You want it rough, you're out of bounds
I want you smothered, want you covered
Like my Waffle House hash browns
Comin' quicker than FedEx, never reaching apex
Just like Coca-Cola stock, you are inclined 
To make me rise an hour early just like Daylight Savings Time

(Do it now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Do it again now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Gettin' horny now)

Love, the kind you clean up with a mop and bucket
Like the lost catacombs of Egypt, only God knows where we stuck it 
Hieroglyphics, let me be Pacific, I wanna be down in your South Seas
But I got this notion that the motion of your ocean
Means small craft advisory
So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, B-5, you sunk my battleship
Please turn me on, I'm Mr. Coffee with an automatic drip
So show me yours, I'll show you mine, "Tool Time"
You'll Lovett just like Lyle
And then we'll do it doggy style
So we can both watch X-Files

(Do it now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Do it again now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Gettin' horny now)

You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Do it again now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel

(Do it now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Do it again now)
You and me, baby, ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it like they do on the Discovery Channel
(Gettin' horny now)
