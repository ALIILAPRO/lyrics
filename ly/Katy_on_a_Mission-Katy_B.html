		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And this room of darkness I ain't undercover
That won't stop my prowess rubbing off on to another
Elevating higher as my body's moving lower
Now I've reached my element you better move over oh

But he doesn't, he blocks my way
I try to push past but he wants to play
So I sip his drink as I hold his gaze
Ooh

When we erupt into the room
And hear the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
So I sink into the tune
As I inhale the fume
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon

(This right here I swear)
(This right here I swear
(This right here I swear)
(This right here I swear will end too soon)

My limbs seem to move what the beat dictates to me
I push in to the middle the sound becomes a part of me
Taking me back to that sweet familiarity
Making my adrenalin rise I feel the eyes on me

Sip the bottle now don't be slow
Keep up with me as we lose control
Keep up with me as we lose control

Oh, when we erupt into the room
And hear the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
So I sink into the tune
As I inhale the fume
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon

(This right here I swear will end too soon)
(This right here I swear)
(This right here I swear)
(This right here I swear will end too soon)

Oh, when we erupt into the room
And hear the sub go boom
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
So I sink into the tune
As I inhale the fume
A feeling easy to resume
This right here I swear will end too soon
