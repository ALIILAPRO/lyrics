		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was a babe, I fell down in the holler
When I was a girl, I fell into your arms
We fell on hard times and we lost our bright color
You went to the dogs and I lived by my charms

I danced for my dinner, spread kisses like honey
You stole and you gambled and I said you should
We sang for our suppers, we drank up our money
Then, one day, you left, sayin' I was no good

Well, alright, I'm bad, but then you're no prize either
Alright, I'm bad, but then that's nothin' new
You say you won't love me, I won't love you neither
Just let me remind you what I am to you

'Cause I am the one who looks out when you're leapin'
I am the one who knows how you were brave
And I am the one who heard what you said sleepin'
I'll take that and more when I go to my grave

It's sooner than later that I'm six feet under
It's sooner than later that you'll be alone
So who will you turn to tomorrow? I wonder
For when the bell rings, lover, you're on your own

I am the one who you let see you weepin'
I know the soul that you struggle to save
Too bad I'm the bet that you lost in the reapin'
Now, what will you do when I go to my grave?
