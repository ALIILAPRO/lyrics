		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Climb aboard, imaginary waves
Of thought beneath the veils of bluey-green
Armoured horses with sparkling sunset eyes
Give a passing glance

Funny creatures with funny plastic lives
Purple thrones are set in deep disguise
Neptune's world around us lies

Wake up, take a chance, climb aboard
Life is changing the oceans floor
The time is near, when nothing's clear
Nothing's left

Falling, I'm only falling
To the answer, to every question
Is it real, or just deception

Taste, touch and find
What it is, that's in your mind
Truth can be yours so let it come
Just like it did before

Sorrow, there's no tomorrow
And the answer, to every mans question
Is it real, or just deception

Taste, touch and find
What it is, that's in your mind
Truth can be yours so let it come
Just like it did before

Soon now as night turns into day
And minds step out to play in the sun
In the sun

Forever this feeling will be yours
A feel you cannot ignore it's the one
You've waited for it's the one
You've seen before
