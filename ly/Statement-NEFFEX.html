		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  HOOK (3x)
I don’t ever slow up
No I don’t take shit
I got no love 
For the fakeness
If you wanna play tough
And wanna hate this
I’ll always show up
And make a statement

VERSE 1: 
Everything I do so instinctive and so passionate
Every word I move so descriptive like an adjective
I got a vendetta against people who patented
Being negative when you should be getting after it
I got facts over facts over tracks 
This and that spitting slow spittin fast 
I can roast I can gas
Think I’m ok at last 
But I don’t know if that
Can erase all the past 
And the pettiness, a reflection of the emptiness 
Hilarious, you think your worth my time your delirious
Mysterious, because you hide behind a fake exterior
Inferior, you know I’ll always be a bit superior 
Get off of me
This ain’t no humble brag
I want you to hear words you can say them back
I want you to feel free from the chains at last 
And to believe in what you got it was built to last 

PRE
Now that I’ve been put through hell
I never got anyone’s help
Had to do it all myself

HOOK (2x)
I don’t ever slow up
No I don’t take shit
I got no love 
For the fakeness
If you wanna play tough
And wanna hate this
I’ll always show up
And make a statement

VERSE 2: 
They gonna learn the consequence  
Of being incompetent
Mental health is confidence
Dreams and some honest-ness
I’m not here to save the day
That’s for you to take away
I could play a million mind games but instead I say 
Something not illogical
Something that is topical
Rub it on and watch it go
Make yourself unstoppable
Dreams are irresponsible
But they’re always possible
If you just believe you could be so remarkable
I got these thoughts in my head
A collage and they spread
I’ll be great one day going off of my meds
No I’m not giving up 
No I’m not giving in
I will make it to the top takin off in the wind
I gotta make it
I’m slaving every day to taste it 
I’m patient
But my mind it can hardly take it
I’m chasing
A dream that I’ve had for several ages
A vacant
Modern kingdom for the taking 

PRE
Now that I’ve been put through hell
I never got anyone’s help
Had to do it all myself

HOOK (3x)
I don’t ever slow up
No I don’t take shit
I got no love 
For the fakeness
If you wanna play tough
And wanna hate this
I’ll always show up
And make a statement
