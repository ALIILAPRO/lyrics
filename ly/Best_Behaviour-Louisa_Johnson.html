		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got me on my best
Got me on my best

I got eyes, yeah I'm human
But it's only a view
'Cause I don't wanna ruin
Loving you, loving you
I got habits to let go
It's what I gotta do
'Cause I don't wanna mess up
Loving you, loving you

Baby, I swear to you I'm dedicated
Give me your trust and I'll try not to break it

Oh you, got me on my best behaviour
I'm on my best behaviour, I
Know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good to you
I'm on my best behaviour, I
I'm on my best behaviour, I
Know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good, good

I know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good to you

I know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good, good

I got hands, yeah I'm human
And it's tempting to touch
But I won't ever do it (do it)
Use your love, use your love
Got my past on the phone now
But I'm hanging it up
'Cause I don't wanna go out
Lose your love, lose your love

Baby I swear to you I'm dedicated
Give me your trust and I'll try not to break it

Oh you, got me on my best behaviour
I'm on my best behaviour, I
Know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good to you
I'm on my best behaviour, I
I'm on my best behaviour, I
Know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good, good

I know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good to you

I know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good, good

Know you got a heart of porcelain
I'm trying not to crack it in my hands
I'm now that you're good for me
I wanna be good to you
Got me on my best behaviour

Oh you, got me on my best behaviour
I'm on my best behaviour, I
Know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good to you
I'm on my best behaviour, I
I'm on my best behaviour, I
Know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good, good

I know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good to you
I'm on my best behaviour
I'm on my best behaviour
I know that you're good for me, I
Wanna be good, good
