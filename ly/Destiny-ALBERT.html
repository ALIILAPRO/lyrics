		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was lost and you found
me baby girl 얼마나 그리웠는지
broken heart dont heal
when you the only
one for me girl
네가 없는 삶은
on god 지옥 같았어 단
하루도 빠짐없이 난 매일 밤마다
네 생각에 feeling so lonely
and missing you dearly
oh oh oh I love you
oh oh oh only you
you were lost and I found you
너도 내가 그리웠는지 daily
broken hearts dont heal
when we were
meant to be 이건
운명이라고 봐 baby
어떻게 너를 마주쳐 여긴
우리가 같이 왔던 곳
이뻐 여전히 난 너를
보고 또 그대로 얼어있어
어떻게 나를 마주쳐 운명인 것처럼
싫어 여전히 내가
너를 놓진 그 하루부터
I believe that love will save us
the past few months
have been hard
did you cry like I
do I know you cried
like I do cause we
were one of a kind
love works in strange ways and
thats why there was
so much pain
if you loved like I
do I know you
loved like I do cause
I could feel your heart
I was lost and you found
me baby girl 얼마나 그리웠는지
broken heart dont heal
when you the only
one for me girl
네가 없는 삶은
on god 지옥 같았어 단
하루도 빠짐없이 난 매일 밤마다
네 생각에 feeling so lonely
and missing you dearly
oh oh oh I love you
oh oh oh only you
you were lost and I found you
너도 내가 그리웠는지 daily
broken hearts dont heal
when we were
meant to be 이건
운명이라고 봐 baby
운명이라고 봐 baby 다시
만나줘 Im different now
그때의 우린 이뻤지 but since
it didnt work out so well
더 이쁜 미래를 만들 수 있다면
baby we should try it out
I cant change the
past but for the
future I promise youll
be my last
love will save us the
past few months have been hard
did you cry like I
do I know you cried
like I do cause we
were one of a kind
love works in strange ways and
thats why there was
so much pain
if you loved like I
do I know you
loved like I do cause
I could feel your heart
I was lost and you found
me baby girl 얼마나 그리웠는지
broken heart dont heal
when you the only
one for me girl
네가 없는 삶은
on god 지옥 같았어 단
하루도 빠짐없이 난 매일 밤마다
네 생각에 feeling so lonely
and missing you dearly
oh oh oh I love you
oh oh oh only you
you were lost and I found you
너도 내가 그리웠는지 daily
broken hearts dont heal
when we were
meant to be 이건
운명이라고 봐 baby
