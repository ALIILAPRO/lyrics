		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We outer space with it
I'm spaced the fuck out (spaced the fuck out)
Yah mean? Ea Monster (pour me up one man, pour me up, yeah)
(Krazy, boy) Word, nigga

Geek up and roll up and pop me a pill (yeah)
Pour me up a cup, I poured out the seal (pour me up)
In your trap, nigga tryna make some deals (deals)
Everybody know I'm tryna make some mil's (tryna make some mil's)
Record label had to meet me in the 'partment
Yeah, I'm at the top of the hill (top of the hill)
Showin' 'em dead, this shit is for real (for real)
I'm gangster, my nigga, that's just how I live (that's how I live)
I do not listen what a nigga say
I do what I wanna do that's end of the day (that's end of the day)
It's too late for me to go sell my soul
My soul in the street, really shot niggas in the face (yeah)
I done been questioned 'bout some murder cases
I done been questioned 'bout some situations
Made it out the most craziest places, never snitched in that situation (never)

All these niggas fakin', they so fugazi (huh)
Nigga actin' like they so up, they made it (damn)
Nigga ain't even made a hundred thousand (what?)
You actin' like you runnin' shit, is you crazy?
Got my first hundred, I thought that I made it
I found out that shit was nothin', streets had played me
Make this shit back-to-back, it's on the daily
Loaded bank account, that bitch goin' crazy
Business manager tell me not to go brazy
Ready to show these motherfuckers I made it
Give 'em a reason to hate me
Nigga talk about me everyday, keep me up, achin'
I'm makin' money these niggas ain't makin'
Thinkin' 'bout the time when twin had to chase me
Steppin' on the stage, I'm makin' a bag
I'm chasin' this bag, makin' money daily

Makin' 'em stress out, this shit going crazy
Itching to kill me, they wanna come face me
Don't got the nuts or the guts to come try
I am itching for you niggas to die
Ain't no bitchin' when them bullets gon' fly
Ain't no missin' when I'm sendin' them shots off
Callin' me bitchin', I'm getting my rocks off
She want the sausage, she don't want no hotdog
She want some profit, she know that I got it all
I'm in a different league, show buddy how to ball
I'm the nigga that your bitch wanna call
She know I get money, that give that bitch none at all
Know she gon' suck me up, baby, I'm big dawg
Know that I'm big slime, know the big ace hoe
And I got shooters dressed in all black like 8 ball
I'm in EA where the shit never safe dawg
And I keep Drac' man, I call it Dracesha
She gon' protect me every time I need her
She gon' never mind when I gotta squeeze her
Hate when I switch up them bitches and leave her
Talk to the Glock, they say treat us equal
30 workin', bellin', fuckin' over people (fuck it, god damn dawg)
(God damn)

Geek up and roll up and pop me a pill (yeah)
Pour me up a cup, I poured out the seal (pour me up)
In your trap, nigga tryna make some deals (deals)
Everybody know I'm tryna make some mil's (tryna make some mil's)
Record label had to meet me in the 'partment
Yeah, I'm at the top of the hill (top of the hill)
Showin' 'em dead, this shit is for real (for real)
I'm gangster, my nigga, that's just how I live (that's how I live)
I do not listen what a nigga say
I do what I wanna do that's end of the day (that's end of the day)
It's too late for me to go sell my soul
My soul in the street, really shot niggas in the face (yeah)
I done been questioned 'bout some murder cases
I done been questioned 'bout some situations
Made it out the most craziest places, never snitched in that situation (never)

(Haha haha)
(Yeah, nigga, yeah, nigga)
