		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Comfortable in his arms
I might ring the alarm but if I do
Probably won't end up being good for you
Don't wanna see you hurt yourself
Don't wanna see you play yourself
I know that it gives you hell
Get off his dick
Thirsty bitch
Stop waiting for him to reply
Cause right now he and I are spending quality time
I know being lonely can be tough
Sorry but your man's already cuffed
You might have to spend your birthday alone I know it's hard baby

Stay strong
The nigga don't like you cause he like me
Stay strong
Don't wanna be with you he's here with me
Stay strong
You're calling me to stop it
You're falling out of pocket
Explore some other options baby
Stay strong
He ain't fucking with you he's fucking with me
Stay strong
Ain't tryna link with you he's here with me
Stay strong
You're calling me to stop it
You're falling out of pocket

So find somebody else to bother don't bother my man
Stop catching feelings
For you catch these hands
I know that you're fighting temptation
I know that it's driving you crazy
To see my face all on your timeline
You think that'd be enough to get him off of your mind
And get off his dick
Thirsty bitch
Stop waiting for him to reply
Cause right now he and I are spending quality time
I know being lonely can be tough
Sorry but your man's already cuffed
You might have to spend your holidays alone I know it's hard baby

Stay strong
The nigga don't like you cause he like me
Stay strong
Don't wanna be with you he's here with me
Stay strong
You're calling me to stop it
You're falling out of pocket
Explore some other options baby
Stay strong
He ain't fucking with you he's fucking with me
Stay strong
Ain't tryna link with you he's here with me
Stay strong
You're calling me to stop it
You're falling out of pocket

I know being lonely can be tough
Sorry but your mans already cuffed
I need you to stop calling his phone
Fallback and try to stay strong
