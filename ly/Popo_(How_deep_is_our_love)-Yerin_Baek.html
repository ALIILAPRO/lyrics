		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get away from your own sorrow
Let the sun come through your window
You don't have to open up wide
But I want to intimate

You'll never know how much your voice attracts me, boy
It's exceptional
Especially, when you're playing the song for me
I can't take my eyes away

Can I walk with you?
Or have a tea with you
Your scent makes me feel like I live in Paris
Can I love you?
Giving my all to you?
You (yeah yeah)

Get away from their unkindness
But this time we should run together
You don't have to worry or hide
'Cause I get you, with my heart

Now you know, how much your eyes make me wonder 'bout
How deep is our love
Especially, when you appreciate for me
I can't help loving you more

Can I walk with you?
Or have a tea with you
Your scent makes me feel like I live in Paris
Can I love you?
Giving my all to you?
You (yeah yeah)
