		  Do you ever wonder, like, who else is fucking your man?
Your body like this, mm
Your body like this, yeah
Your body like this
Your body like this

I'm so tired (pop, pop, pop, pop, your)
Full of inviting (pop, pop, pop, pop, your)
Yeah (pop, pop, pop, pop, your), (your body like this)
Just come over (pop, pop, pop, pop, your)
Into the night (pop, pop, pop, pop, your), yeah
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, your) in me (your body like this)

It happened like this
I deserve better, but I want the feeling I know
Yeah, I know better

You know I can't trust you (aah-aah-aah-aah)
As far as I can throw you (aah-aah-aah-aah)
But I'ma trust what that body do (aah-aah-aah-aah)
Yeah, I'ma trust what that body do (ah, ah)
Yeah, I could never ever love you (aah-aah-aah-aah)
'Cause I could never ever trust you (aah-aah-aah-aah)
But I'ma trust what that body do (aah-aah-aah-aah)
'Cause I can see what that body do, what that body do, hey

(Pop, pop, pop, pop, your)
Give me that body, like this
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, your)
Give me that, drop it like this 
(Pop, pop, pop, pop, your)
Give me that, lick it like this 
Give me that body, like this 

I want you now
Be so, so scandalous (uh-huh)
Don't slow it down
Baby, go on with it (now)
And I put it down, put it down right
Make the nigga wanna change, yeah, change his life, hey (down)
And I put it down heavy, every time
When you pick it up, make you wanna change your life, hey
Huh, who them other bitches that you had?
I don't even really like to brag, they don't have it like this
Who them other bitches that you had?
When you touch my body-ody, betcha I'ma make sure you forget

I deserve better, but I want the feeling I know
Yeah, I know better (like this)

You know I can't trust you (aah)
As far as I can throw you (aah)
But I'ma trust what that body do (aah)
Yeah, I'ma trust what that body do (aah)
Yeah, I could never ever love you (aah)
'Cause I could never ever trust you (aah)
But I'ma trust what that body do (aah)
'Cause I can see what that body do, what that body do, hey

Give me that body, like this
Give me that, drop it like this 
Give me that, lick it like this 
Give me that body, like this 

Trust you (ah)
As far as I can throw you (ah)
But I'ma trust what that body do (ah)
Yeah, I'ma trust what that body do (ah, ah, ah)
Love you (give me that body, like this, ah, ah)'
Cause I could never ever trust you (give me that, drop it like this)
But I'ma trust what that body do (give me that, lick it like this)

'Cause I can see what that body do
What that body do, hey (give me that body, like this)

Lie to me, baby
You know I'm want it too, baby
Yeah, I make it go crazy
With that body do, that body do, hey
