		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel anything but safe here, I feel anything but safe right here
I feel anything but safe here, I feel anything but safe right
Right here, right now, right here, die slow
Right here, right now, die with the lights out
Fuck coping, I just wake up hoping I'm dead
Still alone and I know that it's all in my head
Just let me go, let me know, where we are in the end
Bleeding slow, on my own, is it all just pretend?
Hoe my life been shit, I am not worth shit
Tear run down my face, like blood and tears run down my wrist
This that self destructive shit, I might self destruct my shit
I might self destruct my whip, end my agony, my wish
Fuck that
I been killing myself from the inside
I'm so sick of this shit, like fuck real life
If I finish it here, is you still mine?
Is you still mine, am I still yours?
Yeah my temper with shit been like real short
Tryna' cope wit this bitch, she a real whore
I still look at my heart and it's still sore
Fuck coping, I just wake up hoping I'm dead
Still alone and I know that it's all in my head
Just let me go, let me know, where we are in the end
Bleeding slow, on my own, is it all just pretend
Is it all just pretend, am I coming or going?
Ashes to ashes but nobody noticed
Shut myself out, yet you still were the closest
Are you talking to me or am I losing focus?
