		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I know what I want
I guess the signs were wrong
'Cause at the end of the day
I came from love
When I see what they've got
I realize that I shouldn't settle
Not for less, not unless
I sacrifice what I miss

I gave you my all and that's the truth
I never gave up on me and you
I need you to give me your best
'Cause I'm not gonna settle for less
And I need to know if I'm the one
I've put in the work, now it's your turn
I need you to give me your best
'Cause I'm not gonna settle for less

I gave you my all
I never gave up on you
I need you to give me your best
'Cause I'm not gonna settle for less

Baby, you know you touch me in them broken parts
So don't you leave
The lonely nights are terrifying
Underneath your ocean
I swim like a firefly
These emotions
The river never runs dry

I know you can do better
So I'ma save you the best of me
I know you can do better
So I'ma give you the rest of me

I gave you my all
I never gave up on you
I need you to give me your best
'Cause I'm not gonna settle for less
I can do better
I can do better
I can do better
I can do better
I can do better
I gave you my all
I can do better
I never gave up on you
I can do better
I need you to give me your best
I can do better
'Cause I'm not gonna settle for less

I know you can do better
So I'ma save you the best of me
I know you can do better
So I'ma give you the rest of me
