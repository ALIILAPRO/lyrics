		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm Mr. Doctor man questions his hands
Lost his mind, clinically fine
Found a way to cope needle in his throat
Falling down but the world is spinning round and round he know

Up down but the world keeps spinning round and round 
I see this place ain't big enough for me
I want you to take me away way, way, way
Up down but the world keeps spinning round and round 
I see this place ain't big enough for me
I want you to take me away way, way, way

What did you want to say?
Chemically it's running through my veins you see? 
Romance of the plastic scenes
I can't see you breathe
They're coming after me
Honestly it's running through my veins you see 
I don't need their surgeries
I just want to be
But they are coming after me

There is a little story I'd like to tell
About this little boy who came from hell
Sit right there and listen real good
I'll tell you all the ways his misunderstood
But I see you standing there with that wicked stare 
Just stay for the show
Are you ready no are you ready to go

Chemically it's running through my veins you see? 
Romance of the plastic scenes
I can't see you breathe
They're coming after me
Honestly it's running through my veins you see 
I don't need their surgeries
I just want to be
But they are coming after me

I'm Mr. Doctor man who questions his hands
Lost his mind but is clinically fine
Found a way to cope needle in his throat
Falling down but the world is spinning round

I'm stuck in my boom boom room
People are dancing after their operation
I want you to move
But nobody's moving after their medications
I can't hear the room
People are dancing after their operation
I want you to move
But nobody's moving at all

Chemically it's running through my veins you see? 
Romance of the plastic scenes
I can't see you breathe
They're coming after me
Honestly it's running through my veins you see 
I don't need their surgeries
I just want to be
But they are coming after me

Oh no
Oh oh no no
Oh no no no
Their coming after me
Oh no
After me
No no
Their coming after me
