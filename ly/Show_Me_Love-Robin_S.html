		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
Yeah, yeah
You've got to show me love

Heartbreaks and promises
I've had more than my share
I'm tired of giving my love
And gettin' nowhere, nowhere
What I need is somebody
Who really cares
I really need a lover
A lover that wants to be there
It's been so long since I've touched a wanting hand
I can't put my love on the line
That I hope you'll understand

So, baby, if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say, alright
You've got to show me love

I'm tired of getting caught up
In those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody
Who will always be there
Don't you promise me the world
All that I've already heard
This time around for me, baby
Actions speak louder than words
If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

So, baby, if you want me
You've got to show me love
Words aren't so easy to say, alright
You've got to show me love

Show me, show me, baby

You've got to give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, yeah
I don't want no fakes, don't want no phony
I need your love
Show me, show me, show me, baby
Give it to me, give it to me
I am not a toy, I'm not a play thing
You've got to understand

If you're looking for devotion
Talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
