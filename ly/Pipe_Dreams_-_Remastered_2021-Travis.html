		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I read it all, every word
And I still don't understand a thing
What had you heard?
What had you heard
Was it love, was it take another walk in the dark?

You'll never learn
I'd pray to God if there was heaven
But heaven seems so very far from here
And it all boils down to the same old thing
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams
And it all boils down to the same old pain
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing

I stood in line and a thought crossed my mind
I had been dreaming but I didn't mind
I signed the line and the woman looked right through me
She didn't smile

I'd pray to God if there was heaven
But heaven seems so very far from here
And it all boils down to the same old thing
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams
And it all boils down to the same old pain
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing

I'd pray to God if there was heaven
But heaven seems so very far from here
And it all boils down to the same old thing
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pints please
And it all boils down to the same old pain
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing

And it all boils down to the same old feat
Just a link in a chain, just a puppet on a string
And it all boils down to the same old pain

Whether you win or you lose
Whether you win or you lose
Whether you win or you lose
Whether you win or you lose
