		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we start cracking at the center 
I won't let it break 
Hold it together through the weather, it's my DNA
So sick of being your giver
Throwing my soul away
All give, no take 

Look what you started 
You're turning me heartless 
I'm trying my hardest 
If I'm being honest
 
I can't take it over and over 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulder 
Nothing changes I'm getting colder 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulders
 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulders

If I start cracking at the center 
All this goes away 
I'm staying numb to my feelings
Dodge 'em like Novocaine
My back is breaking 
From taking all of this dead weight 
All give, no take

Do you even notice 
How easy you got this? 
Taking wings off a goddess 
If I'm being honest 
 
I can't take it over and over 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulder 
Nothing changes I'm getting colder 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulders
 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulders

All give, no take
All give, no take
All give, no take
All give, no take

I can't take it over and over 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulder 
Nothing changes I'm getting colder 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulders
 
I can't take it over and over 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulder 
Nothing changes I'm getting colder 
Dead weight hanging off of my shoulders
