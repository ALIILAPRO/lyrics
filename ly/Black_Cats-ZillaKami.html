Bad luck 'til the bitter end
Bad luck, social injuring
Can't judge where the ending is
Am I A.I.? Probably likely
Bad luck 'til the bitter end
Bad luck, social injuring
Can't judge where the ending is
Am I A.I.? Probably likely

I can't save the world if I can't save myself
Gun pointed at my mental health
Squeezin' on the trigger if it makes me well
Please, nobody can help shit that they can't see
I hate everything and everything that isn't me
And I been dealin' with some negative, my glass is all empty
My wiring is shot, I cannot move my full degrees now
Am I A.I.? Probably likely

Bad luck 'til the bitter end
Bad luck, social injuring
Can't judge where the ending is
Am I A.I.? Probably likely
Bad luck 'til the bitter end
Bad luck, social injuring
Can't judge where the ending is
Am I A.I.? Probably likely
