		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what to do with these feelings
Staying strong, all I do is pretending 'cause
I feel so helpless
I'm losing my senses

Smiling face wearing off, I'm so sorry
But I tried, yeah, I tried, oh I've had enough
Something inside me
Is killing me slowly

Who am I now?
I can't find the answers
When I'm buried in my bed feeling hopeless
How do I breathe?
When I'm underwater
Please don't tell me it's a part of the growing
I'm sick of this pain
So tell me the answers
Why am I feeling all the weight of this world?
Oh, I don't know, know, know, know, know

Maybe I'm tired
Maybe I'm tired, yeah
Think I hit the bottom of myself
Someone come and mend this broken heart
'Cause I'm tired
Baby, I'm tired of myself
Think I've had enough, I've reached my limit
I don't wanna feel this way again, yeah-yeah

If I go take a walk, will it help me?
Take a shot with my friends, will it make it stop?
I'm losing my mind now
Losing direction

If I scream all I want in my bedroom
Will my life get much better than right now? Oh
Somebody help me
'Cause I'm suffocating

Who am I now?
I can't find the answers
When I'm crying in my bed feeling sorry
I don't know, know, know, know, know

Maybe I'm tired
Maybe I'm tired, yeah
Think I hit the bottom of myself
Someone come and mend this broken heart
'Cause I'm tired
Baby, I'm tired of myself
Think I've had enough, I've reached my limit
I don't wanna feel this way again, yeah-yeah

Waking up I'm such a mess
How many nights does it take to grow up?
Please don't ever leave me here
Alone in the dark 'cause I can't help myself
Oh, I (I know, I know, I know)
Oh, I (I know, I know, I know)

Maybe I'm tired
Maybe I'm tired, yeah
Think I hit the bottom of myself
Someone come and mend this broken heart
'Cause I'm tired
Baby, I'm tired of myself
Think I've had enough, I've reached my limit
I don't wanna feel this way again, yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
