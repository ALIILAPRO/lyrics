		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running wild, the city sleeps
You're waking up and you're feeling strong,
It wont take long, and once you're gone,
Where and why as you're moving on,
When you laugh, when you do
Who's gonna tell ya where's the truth,
Will you see it, will you try
I wanna love you but I don't know why

The morning colors you blue, in the night you're the king of taboo,
Though you never could explain, what's your game?

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

Scared sea, we've gotta try, your running was the reason why
Nightmares rising, so unchain
You never would lose but you played the game

The morning colors you blue and the night you're the king of taboo,
The machine is running wild, the coolest tide

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

If you can hold on and, you can't deny your way
We're running out of better time

Where will you be? I wanna know it I don't wanna see
Now I can't even cry "I'm done", 'cos you're stuck in the middle, come along

Hold on, what's going on?
Now you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along

Hold on, what's going on?
But you're stuck in the middle, come along
Hold on, what's going on?
'cos you're stuck just a little, move along
