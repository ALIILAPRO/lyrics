		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  when I leave this travesty
you ain't never gonna hear from me again
so why you makin it weird for me?
why don't you try just to be my friend?

you know this ain't my first rodeo
I know exactly what yer lookin for
if I give you a little show
then I know you're gonna ask for more 

don't get fresh with me
baby
don't ya get fresh with me
it's not that kind of thing
they want everything
everything 
what else could they steal from me?
it's messin with my money, mama
ah ha

then you asked me to dance for you 
and throw the mask down on the ground
yeah but even if I wanted to
I'd never do it with your friends around 

don't get fresh with me
baby
don't ya get fresh with me
it's not that kind of thing
they want everything
everything 
what else could they steal from me?
it's messin with my money, mama
ah ha

ay hey
Fresh with me 
Baby
Fresh with me
Baby 

help me to understand 
the way you feel for me now
help me to recognize
this new face that you have found

don't get fresh with me
baby
don't ya get fresh with me
it's not that kind of thing
they want everything
everything 
what else could they steal from me?
it's messin with my money, mama
ah ha

fresh with me 
baby
fresh with me
Baby
