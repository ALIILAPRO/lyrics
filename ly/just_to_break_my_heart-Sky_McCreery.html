		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love, was it all just talk

It floated away, without a goodbye
I think our hope ran out this time
Relying on dreams to show me your face

And I'll say
Come back, come back, come back someday

Did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love would just fall apart?
Oh, oh
Yeah, I thought you'd stay to save me
And did you leave me here just to break my heart?

I thought you'd stay
I thought you'd stay around (for me)
I thought you'd stay
I thought you'd stay around (for me)
(For me)

And did you leave me here just to break my heart?
And did you fear our love, was it all just talk (baby, I'm dying to know)
And did you leave me here just to break my heart? (Baby, I'm dying to know)
And did you fear our love would just fall apart?
(Oh no)
