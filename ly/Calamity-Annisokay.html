		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drag me down to the depths, you're my calamity
Your touch is burning agony
I know I can't escape reality
I'm falling into you

My fears are taking control
As I'm sinking into this black hole
Shrouded in darkness and woe
From the shadows I cannot let go

Holding on
But you keep pulling me down
I am holdin on
But I can’t seem to break the sound

Drag me down to the depths, you're my calamity
Your touch is burning agony
I know I can't escape reality
I'm falling into you
Drag me down to the depths, you're my disharmony
The chaos and your symphony
I know I cannot escape reality
I'm falling into you

It’s like you turned off the light
It’s like you drained all the colors from life
Why am I lonely at night?
You make me feel like the stars losing light

Holding on
But you keep pulling me down
I am holdin on
But I can’t seem to break the sound

Drag me down to the depths, you're my calamity
Your touch is burning agony
I know I can't escape reality
I'm falling into you
Drag me down to the depths, you're my disharmony
The chaos and your symphony
I know I cannot escape reality
I'm falling into you

Drag me down to the depths, you're my calamity
I know I can't escape this reality
Drag me down to the depths, you're my disharmony
The screams in my head are your melody
Drag me down to the depths, you're my calamity
Your touch is burning agony
I know I can't escape reality
I'm falling into you
