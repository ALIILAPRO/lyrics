		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Burn down my house
I'll blame myself and no one else
Heart in my mouth
Always in doubt about my health

Burn down my house
I'll blame myself and no one else
Heart in my mouth
Never in doubt

Your love will leave me lonely
Repeating, "Oh, if only"
I'm sorry, I'm broke from all the time I spent
Driving myself 'round the bend
Drifting like I'm oil in water
I swear I'm okay
Just hear the words I don't say
I'm sorry the thoughts that I don't apprehend
Tell me there's no happy end
I'm drifting like I'm oil in water

Burn down my house
I'll blame myself and no one else
Heart in my mouth
Never in doubt

Your love will leave me lonely
Repeating, "Oh, if only"
I'm sorry, I'm broke from all the time I spent
Driving myself 'round the bend
Drifting like I'm oil in water
I swear I'm okay
Just hear the words I don't say
I'm sorry the thoughts that I don't apprehend
Tell me there's no happy end
I'm drifting like I'm oil in water

Burn down my house
I'll blame myself and no one else
Heart in my mouth
Always in doubt about my health
