		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I had is now in two
Yeah I had it all
Posted at the party getting loose
We gone have a ball
Back then they all thought they couldn't
Lose then I watched them fall
The sadness in my heart made em recluse
All my friends are gone
In the rough, no one cares for you
They gon' cut you off
Just like Jak, dark eco consumes
My light has just dissolved
All my life, I've been on move
Like Sackboy with his squad
You can't even feel the pain I feel
I overflow likе mob
No lie you can't last a week
Stuck in my head, yeah, I'm finna geek
In thе club, slumped like Terry
In VIP, they watching me
No one, it's only me
In Tokyo, I clear these streets
Mount Toge, I'm drifting clean
Ain't nobody passing me
Life ain't fair, will I even make it far?
Since day one they said I'm fallen star
Please give me a chance, open up like WinRAR
Why the hell did they get they
Wishes? These niggas like Jafar

I can't fathom when will I get better?
Maybe it'll be never until I'm in Heaven
All this stormy weather
Crashing down with pressure
Peep all the vendettas
We up inside Club Venom

Dolce Gabbana baby, I don't wanna
Keep sayin' this shit
But I know that I'm gonna
Try to run me out, I was already gonna go
I'm so fuckin' tired of it
Don't want any more
Should I restart 'cause I feel
Like I'm fuckin' up it hurts my head but I
Think I need another cup
I go to sleep so I just
Don't have to deal with stuff
But then I dream of some shit
I think I've had enough
Feels like I've been movin' on my own
With me or against me, I don't know
Stepped on me when I just wanna grow
Lost out in the cold
When will it get better? watch this
Turn you to a header
You can't even get her
Your girl likes me but my girl is way better

I can't fathom when will I get better?
Maybe it'll be never until I'm in Heaven
All this stormy weather
Crashing down with pressure
Peep all the vendettas
We up inside Club Venom
