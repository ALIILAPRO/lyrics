		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Throw a fit, power trip
Spill some blood then watch it drip
Sticks and stones and pumping fists
Don't care if we sink or swim
'Cause you're cut throat, you're deceiving
You're a masochist on the weekend
Like an incubus, you're a demon
When you fuck the world with no feelings

Double bubble, toil and trouble
Spoke my mind and I got a muzzle
Double, bubble, I'm in trouble
Now I gotta watch a grown man go and-

Burn, burn, burn, burn the witch
Run, run, run, run, heretics
Hey, watch your neck
Burn, burn, burn, burn the witch

No one to save you when you've burnt it to the ground
You fucked the world for power, look who's got it now

I'll swallow you like a sinner
Choke you back like fingers
I could be your blood donor
You could be my fuckable loner
Pussy tastes like liquor
Don't crucify my liver
Mix it with paint thinner
There's blood on the walls, there's spirits in the dolls

There's blood on the walls, there's spirits in the dolls
There's blood on the walls, there's spirits in the dolls
There's blood on the walls, there's spirits in the dolls
There's blood on the walls, there's spirits in the dolls

Double bubble, toil and trouble (hello?)
Spoke my mind and I got a muzzle
Double bubble, I'm in trouble (what?)
Now I gotta watch a grown man go and- (say that again)

Naked in the street (street)
Shameless fucking freak (freak)
My nails are on your chest
Learned from the best
I'm digging deep
Hell yeah, I'm famous (famous)
Most wanted ambitious (ambitious)
My blood rage contagious (contagious)
Paint the sky 'til you hate it

Burn the witch with the whole world watching
Heretic, I'm a dead girl walking
Throw me in but I won't float no stopping
Can't burn the witch
Can't burn the-

Burn, burn, burn, burn the witch
Run, run, run, run, heretics
Hey, watch your neck
Burn, burn, burn, burn the witch

No one to save you when you've burnt it to the ground
Hell snakes will sliver out your eyes and fucking mouth
You fucked the world for power, look who's got it now
You fucked the world for power, look who's got it now
