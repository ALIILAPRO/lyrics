		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Set the tone, when it's just me
And you alone, and we're lonely
In the room, breathin' slowly
Oh, you know me, yeah
Meditate, you can take me
To a place where we can be
All alone, I let you hold me
'Cause you know me, me yeah

Lay your head on my pillow, say, ooh-ooh, oh
Touching's makin' me feel a way, ooh-ooh
When I get around you, I lose it
Lose it

'Cause I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you
I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you
You make me

Wanna get (wanna get), wanna go deep (go)
Intimate (intimate), let you in me
Inside (inside), you deserve it
On my mind, my mind, yeah, oh

Lay your head on my pillow, say, ooh-ooh (touchin')
The way you're touchin', know it's okay with you-ooh
When I get around you, I lose it
Lose it

'Cause I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you
I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you (with you)
You make me

Baby
Lay your head on my pillow, say, ooh-ooh
Way you're touchin' my body, say, ooh-ooh
I ain't lovin' nobody but you-ooh
You-ooh, yeah

'Cause I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you
I feel so comfortable with you
You make me comfortable with you, ooh

You make me
You make me, baby
You make me
You make me
You make me, yeah, yeah
You make me
You make me
You make me
