		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's headed to west in an airplane
Careless with my heart in a carry-on
I'm trying to forget her
I'm trying to forget her

I bet she's in a beach chair somewhere
Breaking new hearts by the poolside
I'm trying to forget her
I'm trying, I'm trying

Well it's the second day of summer
You already got me sweating about it
Oh it's second night of summer
And I'm disintegrating without you

Throwing me that shade like I'm not cool enough

She's always had a soul like cellophane
Walked right through me like a spring rain
I'm trying to forget her
I'm trying to forget

She's always running from her troubles
The trouble is I love her
Won't ever love another one cold as her
I'm trying to forget her
I'm trying, I'm trying

Sun up and sun down
Sun up and sun down

Throwing me that shade like I'm not cool enough
