		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait for me, I'm running
In place, I know that we have something
Coming undone
Tried it all, never call
What am I on?
I'm nothing

Swimming in your eyes (swimming in your eyes)
Seeing through your mind (seeing through your mind)
I could imagine (I could imagine)
I don't have it 'cause

I keep running away from
I keep running from all the things I want
I keep running away from you (I could imagine)
Why do I choose to?

I don't like playing games
Don't like to make mistakes
Can't change things I don't say (I don't say)
If I push away, tell me you'll stay
Wrong in all the right ways

Swimming in your eyes (swimming in your eyes)
Seeing through your mind (seeing through your mind)
I could imagine (I could imagine)
I don't have it 'cause

I keep running away from
I keep running from all the things I want
I keep running away from you (I could imagine)
Why do I choose to?

Why, why do I choose to? (choose to)
Why, why do I choose to?
