		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't nobody stop me, I'm on go (go)
Late night creeping, I'm running on no sleep (skrrt, skrrt)
Used to be the one doing the most (doo, doo)
Pockets getting bigger, it's the protein
Can't go broke (oh)
They try match me, can't come close (oh)
Baby, I'm active, can't move slow (oh)
There's no plan B, can't do both
Can't do both

Mum, I'm sorry, I just seen a ghost (boo-boo, boo)
Life getting scary, dead body in these clothes
Mountains in my nose, watching fountains overflow
Watch them staring funny at me walking down the road
Through the telescope, pusher selling blow
Yeah, you never know, head a wreck, got heading home
Body cold seratone, one thousand bellow, I'm on E
Flying in the wind anytime it blows
Decline play with rocks and water like the seaside
We slide back alley broken bottle felines
Rewind, back inside, sorry, I can't see right
Street lights hazy, got me digging in my jeans like, like

Can't nobody stop me, I'm on go (go)
Late night creeping, I'm running on no sleep (skrr, skrr)
Used to be the one doing the most (doo, doo)
Pockets getting bigger, it's the protein
Can't go broke (oh)
They try match me, can't come close (oh)
Baby, I'm active, can't move slow (oh)
There's no plan B, can't do both
Can't do both

How money weigh me down, anchor on my neck
No sense, empty pool, gliding through the stress
Time spent, dishing dirt rizzla or regrets
Follow 'round on the ground anywhere I went
Alive on other side, grass is always bright (always bright)
On the microwave hot plate, dishing my demise (dishing my demise)
Come inside, tell you come inside (I say)
Yeah, we slide on your mind, everything ain't right (no)
Rewind, I rocks and water on my feet (on my feet)
See right, light speed running through week (running through the week)
Cold sheets, up at night, tryna get some sleep (tryna sleep)
Decay on me got me stomaching disease
Stomach bleeds, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can't nobody stop me, I'm on go (go)
Late night creeping, I'm running on no sleep (skrr, skrr)
Used to be the one doing the most (doo, doo)
Pockets getting bigger, it's the protein
Can't go broke (oh)
They try match me, can't come close (oh)
Baby, I'm active, can't move slow (oh)
There's no plan B, can't do both
Can't do both

Can't nobody stop me, I'm on go (mm)
Late night creeping, I'm running on no sleep (mm)
Used to be the one doing the most (mm)
Pockets getting bigger, it's the protein
Can't go broke (oh)
They try match me, can't come close (oh)
Baby, I'm active, can't move slow (oh)
There's no plan B, can't do both
Can't do both
