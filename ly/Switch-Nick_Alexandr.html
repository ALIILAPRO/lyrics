		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red eyes, double in my cup aye
Switch lanes, cause you know we on the run aye
Might die, baby I don't give a fuck
Cause my hearts gone cold
Don't know how to love ya
Let the cash flow, know we never stop yeah
Bitch I blow smoke, smoking on the run yeah
I don't go slow, I can't feel my pulse yeah
I'm like astro, see me blowing up yeah
Tell me what you saying
I been working so hard running up a payment
And you know we never stopping till we fucking faded
And I'll never let it go until i'm up and famous yeah
I don't deal with all the lies, why you shameless (Shameless)
Guarantee your new girl got me on her playlist (Playlist)
And I'm way to high, bitch I'm feeling brainless (Brainless)
Middle finger to sky I don't need to say shit yeah
And I'm way too high
Bitch I'm feeling brainless yeah
Middle finger to the sky
I don't need too say shit yeah
Red eyes, double in my cup aye
Switch lanes, cause you know we on the run aye
Might die, baby I don't give a fuck
Cause my hearts gone cold
Don't know how to love ya
Let the cash flow, know we never stop yeah
Bitch I blow smoke, smoking on the run yeah
I don't go slow, I can't feel my pulse yeah
I'm like astro, see me blowing up yeah
You know you excite me
Sipping on that liquor but she only sip it lightly
I just want that body got my hands around you tightly
Imma make you realise that nobody do it like me yeah
I ain't ever gonna go ghost (Go ghost)
Before you I was better on my own (On my own yeah)
But now she make me loose all my control (Control)
And I'll never it go cause she's everything I know yeah (I know)
And I'm way too high
Bitch I'm feeling brainless yeah
Middle finger to the sky
I don't need too say shit yeah
Red eyes, double in my cup aye
Switch lanes, cause you know we on the run aye
Might die, baby I don't give a fuck
Cause my hearts gone cold
Don't know how to love ya
Let the cash flow, know we never stop yeah
Bitch I blow smoke, smoking on the run yeah
I don't go slow, I can't feel my pulse yeah
I'm like astro, see me blowing up yeah
I'm like astro, see me blowing up yeah
