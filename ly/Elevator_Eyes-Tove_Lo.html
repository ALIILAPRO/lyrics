		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take in this body
Skin looking salty
Fresh out of the sea
Won't you come taste me?
I'm on vacation
No obligations
But maybe we'll fall in love
Let the stars be our audience

Tell me what you want, what you want, what you want
You keep giving me

Elevator eyes
Elevator eyes
I'm not surprised
You're hypnotized
Going up and down
Elevator eyes
Elevator eyes
If looks could touch
No need to rush
Going up and down

Go get a rubber
No, never mind that
Cooked your boys in the jacuzzi
Let's risk it, it's worth it
I'm on vacation
Body prints in sand
Yeah, I will remember you
Naked and beautiful

Tell me what you want, what you want, what you want
You keep givin' me

Elevator eyes
Elevator eyes
I'm not surprised (no, no)
You're hypnotized
Goin' up and down
Elevator eyes (elevator eyes)
Elevator eyes
If looks could touch (yeah, yeah)
No need to rush
Going up and down

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Sun-kissed in my dirty bed
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Our position's always sitting in the back of my head
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
(Come, come) come back so I don't forget
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You keep giving me

Elevator eyes (elevator eyes)
Elevator eyes
I'm not surprised (no, no)
You're hypnotized
Going up and down
Elevator eyes (elevator eyes)
Elevator eyes
If looks could touch (could touch)
No need to rush
Going up and down
