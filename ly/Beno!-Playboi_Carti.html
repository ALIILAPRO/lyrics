		  (808 Mafia)

Spent a hundred k on my son, I bought my sister a Jeep
Can't fuck with these hood hoes no more, they don't give a fuck about me
All-black two-three, LeBron with the heat (what? Two-three, two-three)
I was just in Miami in the Rolls Royce geeked (what? Yeah, Rolls Royce, geeked)
Lil' Tommy got an FN in the backseat (what? Yeah, in the backseat)
Red rag, red flag, bitch, you better make peace (yeah)
I'm in this bitch with my killers (yeah)
Whole lotta motherfuckin' niggas (yeah)
We got them motherfuckin' choppers (yeah)
I pick you up, nigga, I get you (yeah)
I said I don't fuck with these niggas (yeah)
We see 'em, we punchin' them niggas (yeah)
We uppin' the score on these niggas (yeah)
Go out the back door on that nigga (out the back door, yeah)
Go out the back door on that nigga (out the back door, yeah)
Go out the back door on that nigga (out the back door, yeah)
Go out the back door on that nigga (out the back door, yeah)
Go out the back door on that nigga (yeah)
Go back (yeah, slatt, slatt)
You was still posted with my boy
Yeah, my slatt (okay, slatt, slatt)
Beno, he go crazy, you know that (what? What? Yeah)

Whole lotta bands in this bitch (what? Yeah)
Whole lotta cash in this bitch (yeah)
Hop on the motherfuckin' plane (yeah)
I just popped me a G6 (yeah)
You know that I love to stay high (yeah)
My shawty just said that she bi (yeah)
She carry that shit, she gon' ride (yeah)
I fucked her then told her she mine (yeah)
I'm really not with tellin' lies (yeah)
I really don't hang around guys (yeah)
The streets treat me like a God (yeah)
My bitch treat me like a God (yeah)
Got a main and a side (yeah, side)
Fuck fame, I ride with the fire
Blow out the brain in the ride (ugh)
Blow out the brain in the ride (yeah)
I'm ridin' 'round town with a ratchet bitch (ratchet, ayy)
She say, "Carti, you back on your ratchet shit" (ayy)
I rock diamonds, the Patek from Elliante (what?)
Show me somethin' that Carti not better than
If a nigga keep talkin', we runnin' in (yeah)
Get that nigga kicked out like I'm puntin' it (yeah)
On the block rollin' dice and I'm goin' in
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Spent a hundred k on my son, I bought my sister a Jeep
