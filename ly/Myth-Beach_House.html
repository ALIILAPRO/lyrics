		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drifting in and out, you see the road you're on
It came rolling down your cheek
You say just what you mean
And in between, it's never as it seems

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

If you've built yourself a myth
You'd know just what to give
What comes after this momentary bliss?
A consequence of what you do to me

Help me to name it
Help me to name it

Found yourself in a new direction
Arrows falling from the sun
Canyon calling, would they come to greet you?
Let you know you're not the only one

Can't keep hanging on
To all that's dead and gone
If you've built yourself a myth
know just what to give
Materialize
Or let the ashes fly

Help me to name it
Help me to name it
