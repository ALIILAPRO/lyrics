		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I'm staring at a piece of us
Shattered on the sidewalk
Tragic, broken like a china doll
Burning like a gun shot

My heart was beating
And so was yours
We threw each other
Down on the floor
My heart is breaking
It's made of glass
I guess anything that's good never ever lasts.

So baby if you love me, let me know
'Cause everything that hurts you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glass heart.

So baby if you love me just let me know
'Cause everytime we touch, touch it's turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glass heart. [x3]

Right now, I'm standing in our empty room
Staring out the window
I hear music that we used to make
Boy play me that crescendo.

My heart was beating
And so was yours
We threw each other
Down on the floor

My heart is breaking
It's made of glass
I guess anything that's good never ever lasts.

So baby if you love me, let me know
'Cause everything that hurts you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glass heart

So baby if you love me just let me know
'Cause everytime we touch, touch it's turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glass heart. [x3]

Promise that we'll never fall apart, fall apart
And I'll love you with my glass heart.
And I'll love you with my glass heart.

So baby if you love me, let me know
'Cause everything that hurts you've hurt before
You're about to tear this love apart
And break another glass heart.
So baby if you love me just let me know
'Cause everytime we touch, touch it's turning cold
Promise that we'll never fall apart
And I'll love you with my glass heart.
