		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm a handful
I know I'm just too much to handle
I can't seem to let it go
Darlin', if I'm mad, you bet you're gonna know
I can't keep it all in, regretful

You got me crying in the shower
Look at the power that you hold
Knees to chest, I start to cower
As the water falls down on the bathroom floor
I'm crying in the shower
Look at the power that you hold

Don't tell me I'm pretty, don't say that I'm beautiful
I know if you loved me, it would never go that far
Every lie's like, "La-la-da-da-da, la-da-da-da"
"La-la-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da"
Don't tell me I'm pretty

You got such an ego (ego)
So much pride, it fills the whole cup
And when it starts to overflow
I get mad and you say, "Don't go"
But I can't stay anymore

You got me crying in the shower
Look at the power that you hold
Knees to chest, I start to cower
As the water falls down on the bathroom floor
I'm crying in the shower
Look at the power that you hold

Don't tell me I'm pretty or that I'm beautiful
I know you don't love me, oh-oh
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Don't tell me I'm pretty
