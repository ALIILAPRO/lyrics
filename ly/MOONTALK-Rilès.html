		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why
I cannot really sleep tonight?
You sit here by my side
And I'm talking to you like you're mine
While you
Run away from me every time
I'm missing when you smile
It is cold but you're waiting outside

Feeling my soul, I see the void
Like how you fit it
Is it my fault? Was it my choice?
What is the reason?
I see the stars, but in a sense
I feel your presence
I know you hear my words

Pâle is your face
Hope what I'm saying is not traumatizing
I know you're sad, but it's what makes you shinning
At the end of the night, leaving me without an answer once more

Tell me why
I cannot really sleep tonight
You're sitting by my side
And I'm talking with you like you're mine
While you
Run away from me every time
I'm missing when you smile
It is cold but you waiting outside

Stay by my side, I'll wait oh
You can't seem to find a way no
Stay with me while I'm chasing the sun, for you my love
I know all the words you pray oh
I see you from outter space now
And I'll shine on you everytime you're hopeless my love

Tell me why
You cannot really sleep tonight
You're sitting by my side
And you're talking to me like we one
Why you?
Run away from fear every time
I'm missing when you smile
It is cold but you're waiting outside
