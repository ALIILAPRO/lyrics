		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
It makes no difference if you're black or if you're white
All men are equal till the victory is one
No color or religion ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out on the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

It doesn't matter if you're left or to the right
Don't try to hide behind the cause for which you fight
There'll be no prisoners taken when the day is done
No flag no uniform ever stopped a bullet from a gun

Out in the fields, the fighting has begun
Out in the streets, they're falling one by one
Out from the skies, a thousand more will die each day
Death is just a heartbeat away

There's no communication
No one to take the blame
The cries of every nation
They're falling on deaf ears again

Out the fields
Out in the fields, they are falling one by one
Out in the fields, no flag has ever stopped a bullet from a gun
Death is just a heartbeat away

Out in the fields...
