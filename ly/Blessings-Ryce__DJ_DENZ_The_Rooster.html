		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even when my heart feels miles away
I'm saying thank you everyday
Even when my soul feels so afraid
I'm saying thank you everyday
And that's why I pray
Onto the heavens
Don't look back on to the blessings
I'm not gone this peace has won
I'm not on my own again
It's onto the heavens
One path I'm back for a mission
I'm not gone this peace has won
Know we're going home again
Picking up what I need
One bag two bags on the sleeves
I got more plans and I'll be done
Couple summers and I'm back up home
Really I ain't perfect
My mind was running with issues
But I found my purpose
It's something bout when I'm with you now
It's like I feel the light
Coming I don't know why mmm
Wrist flick quick pic say cheese
Nice smile nice drip my steez
Bald head big cheeks goatee
No stress put them blessings on me
Wrist flick quick pic say cheese
Nice smile nice drip my steez
Bald head big cheeks goatee
No stress put them blessings on me
