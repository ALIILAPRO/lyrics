		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never knew how to swim
Until I jumped in and swam in some M's (some M's)
The Patek on my wrist, a chandelier
And I had it before Khaled did (another one)
Uh, ow, uh, ow, uh, ow, eh
DJ Durel

I told her, "Take off your shoes before you step into my Rolls" (take off your shoes)
I buy her some shit and I take her to places she never would go
They know- they know- they know, it's a tissue, I'm wiping their nose
Double R pulling up, collecting three double O
That's the back end right after my show (row)

The jewelry froze, I'm never gon' fold, watch out for the foes (watch out)
It's been raining, they told 'em take off your shoes before you get in my Rolls (take off your)
Damn, the dab is so strong, we got that bitch wiping her nose (white)
Sipping that codeine, it's potent, as soon as I sit down, a nigga get froze
Wake up-wake up, eyes is closed (eyes)
I planted the seed in that money and watched it grow (grow)
I get they mad I got rich, I suppose (I)
We came from the bottom, now we with the legends, the vets and the pros (now we with the legends)
I heard they told, I hope they do well, but we'll never tell (we won't)
About all the crimes and times a nigga had whipped up the bales (you don't)
She fine as hell, she come from the land, no DJ Durel (came from the land)
Decline to tell, trap out the bando, serving clientele (trap out the bando)
When you successful, you gotta watch who around when you fail (you gotta watch out)
Look at the stretcher, we stretch 'em, impress 'em, put 'em on film

I never knew how to swim
Until I jumped in and swam in some M's (some M's)
The Patek on my wrist, a chandelier
And I had it before Khaled did (another one)

Stop by talkin' about the bitch a choker
When the date was over, told her, "Bend it over" (bend)
I do fashion, this is not the Nova (nah)
They keep asking, I reply, "It's on me" (asking)
Come get a bag, no Walmart or Kroger (no)
Niggas plotting and I know the motive (plot)
Be quiet, don't say that I'm antisocial (quiet)
Money tunnel vision and my mind is focused

I told her, "Take off your shoes before you step into my Rolls" (take off your shoes)
I buy her some shit and I take her to places she never would go
They know- they know- they know, it's a tissue, I'm wiping their nose
Double R pulling up, collecting three double O
That's the back end right after my show

DJ Durel
