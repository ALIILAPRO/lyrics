		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to be a renegade
I used to fool around
But I couldn't take the punishment
And had to settle down
Now I'm playing it real straight
And yes, I cut my hair
You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
'Cause I can tell what's going on

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square

I like my bands in business suits
I watch them on TV
I'm workin' out 'most every day
And watchin' what I eat
They tell me that it's good for me
But I don't even care
I know that it's crazy, I know that it's nowhere
But there is no denying that

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

It's not too hard to figure out 
You see it every day
And those that were the farthest out
Have gone the other way
You see them on the freeway
It don't look like a lot of fun
But don't you try to fight it
And an idea whose time has come
Don't tell me that I'm crazy, don't tell me I'm nowhere
Take it from me

It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
It's hip to be square
So hip to be square

Tell 'em, boys
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be square
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be square
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be square
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip
Here, there, and everywhere
Hip, hip, so hip to be square
Here, there, and everywhere
So hip to be square
Hip, hip
