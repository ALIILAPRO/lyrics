		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We both know you wanna come and get it
What you waiting for?
Now you're scared of what you've see
And only seen it in your dreams before

'Cause when you least expect it
It will take you, take you by surprise
So take advantage, take it all
Take it all before the moment dies

It come without saying
It's already known, it's written all over you
It comes without saying
Don't let it go, keep it inside of you
It comes without saying

Now that you've got it
And it's slipping through your fingertips
Well, you gave and let go
Now it's missing from your life again

So now you're tearing up the walls
Make a mess trying to dig it up
But now it's all too late
You'll never find it and the moment's dead
The moment's dead

It goes without saying
It's already gone, it's written all over you
It goes without saying
You let it go, there's nothing inside of you
Well, it goes without saying

You know you want it
What are you waiting for?
Take it all when the moment dies

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
It's written all over you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
Just keep it inside of you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
It's written all over you

It goes without saying
It goes without saying
There's nothing inside of you
It goes without saying
