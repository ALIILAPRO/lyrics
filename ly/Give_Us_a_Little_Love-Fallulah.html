		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do we belong, where did we go wrong 
If there's nothing here, why are we still here? 

Where do we belong, where did we go wrong
If there's nothing here, why are we still here?

It's another time, it's another day
Numbers they are new, but it's all the same
Running from yourself, it will never change
If you try you could die

Give us a little love, give us a little love
We never had enough, we never had enough
Give us a little love, give us a little love
We never had enough, we never had enough

Pour it in a cup, try to drink it up
Pour it in a well, you can go to hell
We'll get it on the way

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Huh huh

Where do we belong, where did we go wrong
If there's nothing here, why are we still here?

Leave it by it's pain, leave it all alone
If I never turn, I will never grow
Keep the door ajar when I'm coming home
I will try, can't you see I'm trying

Give us a little love, give us a little love
We never had enough, we never had enough
Give us a little love, give us a little love
We never had enough, we never had enough

Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
Huh huh
Huh huh huh
Huhu huh huh huh
Mhm mhm
