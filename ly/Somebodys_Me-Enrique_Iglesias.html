		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, do you remember me?
Like, I remember you
Do you spend your life, going back in your mind to that time?
'Cause I, I walk the streets alone
I hate being on my own
And everyone can see that, I really fell
And I'm going through hell
Thinking about you with somebody else

Somebody wants you, somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that one day you will see
That somebody's me
That somebody's me
Yeah

How, how did we go wrong?
It was so good, and now it's gone
And I pray at night, that our passing will cross
What we hide isn't lost
'Cause you are always right here in my thoughts

Somebody wants you, somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that some day you will see
That somebody's me
Oh yeah

You will always be in my life, even if I'm not in your life
'Cause you're in my memory
You, will you remember me?
And before you set me free, oh listen please

Somebody wants you, somebody needs you
Somebody dreams about you every single night
Somebody can't breathe, without you it's lonely
Somebody hopes that some day you will see
That somebody's me
That somebody's me

That somebody's me
That somebody's me
Oh yeah
