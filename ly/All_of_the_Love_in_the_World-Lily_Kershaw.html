		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I called it at two
You called it at three
Same people, different party
All of the love in the world
Couldn't save me

Deal with me
Steal with me
Just stay for a moment and heal with me
Stray with me
Play with me
Oh how I wish you would stay with me

You pulled away
I let you go
Don't care how long you're gone
Just make sure you come home

All of the love in the world 
Couldn't make me less alone
All of the love in the world 
Couldn't make me less alone

Deal with me
Steal with me
Stay for a moment and heal with me
Stray with me
Play with me
Oh how I wish you would stay with me

All of the love in the world 
Couldn't save me
All of the love in the world 
Couldn't save me
All of the love in the world 
Couldn't save me
All of the love in the world 
Couldn't save me

I called it at two
You called it at three
Same people, different party
All of the love in the world 
Couldn't save me
