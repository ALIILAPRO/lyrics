		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody knows inside that this won't stop
The rain comin' down tonight, we just watch
I know it's too late, I had so much I wanna say
I'll just have to wait

Everybody knows we're done as the lights go off
Had all the time in the world and now it's lost
The sky is blood red, it's the last time you'll reach across
Slippin' away

Chaos
Growin' midnight like a tidal wave
Raindrops
Fillin' up your eyes as the water takes the stage

Everybody knows inside that we had it good
Good things don't last like we thought they would
I've got a front seat, watch it unfold in front of me
It's only the end

Goodnight
Over, but it's not the way I'd choose
Me or you, uh

Chaos
Growin' midnight like a tidal wave
Raindrops
Fillin' up your eyes as the water takes the stage
