		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She sits up high surrounded by the sun
One million branches and she loves every one
"Mom and dad, did you search for me?
I've been up here for so long I'm going crazy"

And as the sun went down we ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I'll put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Three, two, one, where did it go?

Now don't be crazy I smiled of course you can stay here
You know we're going on ten years
Big deal but I guess you're official
I only said it because I know what it's like to feel

Burned down
It gets you down
We've all been there sometimes
But tonight, I'll make you feel beautiful once again

And as the sun went down we ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I'll put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Three, two, one, where did it go?

If I were you, I'd put that away
See, you're just wasted
And thinking about the past again
Darling you'll be okay

She said,
"If you were me, you'd do the same
'Cause I can't take anymore
I'll draw the shades and close the door
Everything's not alright and I would rather"

And as the sun went down we ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I'll put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Tell me where did it go?
