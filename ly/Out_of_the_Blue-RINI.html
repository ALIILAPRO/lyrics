		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Came out of the blue (ooh, ooh)
Girl, I had no clue until I met you
Always had my eyes on you (ooh, ooh)
Still I was unable to see right through (ooh, ooh)

We can bring it back to where we started
Pick up where we left off, you decided
Now the time for me and you (me and you)
Now's the time for me and you, ooh (ooh, ooh)
Oh, tell me I belong to you, belong to me (ooh, ooh)
Oh, you know there's no other place I'd rather be (ooh, ooh)

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

You came and everything just fell into place
At first I thought that it was just another mistake
We were bound to meet again (ooh, ooh)
This is not the way our story ends (nah, nah)

We can bring it back to where we started
Pick up where we left off, you decided
Now the time for me and you (me and you)
Now's the time for me and you, ooh (ooh, ooh)
Oh, tell me I belong to you, belong to me (belong to me)
Oh, you know there's no other place I'd rather be (ooh, rather be)
