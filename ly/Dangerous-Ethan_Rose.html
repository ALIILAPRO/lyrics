		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always stay rolling with my wolves
Baby you know how it fucking goes
We get it on the low
I've never been one for self control
She say she loves my tattoos, had to take her to the back room
I swear him and I ain't in the same lane
Lay her down she's screaming out my stage name
And I'm still pretty faded from last night
Kill that pussy quick like it got nine lives
I treat 'em dangerous
I might fall in love with a stripper
Girl you know me I'm shameless
And you fell in love with the old me
Tell me why you want a part of me, oh
I promise you don't want no part of me, yeah
Oh, oh nah
Always moving with my guard up
Hit a note and make ten thousand women's hearts stop
I'm addicted to the life, so I can't treat you right
Fall asleep while the sun is up and come alive at night, whoa
And you ain't never been with a man like me
I don't think you want to girl
Probably end up dead or in jail, protecting the ones that I care
I swear
I treat 'em dangerous
I might fall in love with a stripper
Girl you know me I'm shameless
And you fell in love with the old me
Tell me why you want a part of me, oh
I promise you don't want no part of me, yeah
Oh, oh nah
I treat 'em dangerous
I might fall in love with a stripper
You know me I'm shameless
Oh
I treat 'em dangerous
I might fall in love with a stripper
Girl you know me I'm shameless
Oh
I treat 'em dangerous
I might fall in love with a stripper
Girl you know me I'm shameless
Oh oh
I treat 'em dangerous
Tell me why you want a part of me, oh
I promise you don't want no part of me
Oh, oh nah
Tell me why you want a part of me, oh
I promise you don't want no part of me yeah
Oh, oh nah
