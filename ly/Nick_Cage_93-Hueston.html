		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could see the look in your eyes 
Got me feeling the vibe
Come on tell me pretty baby is it real
Baby, are you real 
cnd I know that it ain't a surprise 
But I'm so fuckin high
Got my head between your thighs
It gives you chills
Baby, give me chills
I know you want it won't you tell me where to go
You been pulling on my jeans before we could make it home
Is it real?
Tell me what you feel, yeah
Whisper in my ear now you speaking to my soul
You know I tell it like it is and that's just the way it goes
Fuckin real
Yeah I'm too fuckin real, yeah
 
Baby is it fuckin real?
Baby tell me is it real, yeah
Baby I'm too fuckin real
For real
 
The way your body move 
It just do something to me
Got me feeling so damn bad like nick cage in 93
Is it real?
Baby, I'm too fuckin real
Baby bend it over slow, touch your toes 
Let it go baby
I'm an animal 
I ain't doing what I'm told
That's for real
Yeah baby how's it feel
Ohh yeah yeah
I know you want it you just tell me where to go
I been pulling all the strings
Now your takin off your clothes

Baby is it real yeah
 
Baby is it fuckin real
Baby tell me is it real yeah
Baby I'm too fuckin real
For real yeah
