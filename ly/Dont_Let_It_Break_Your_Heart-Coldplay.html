		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And if I lost the map
If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call
'When you're tired of racing
And you find you never left the start
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart'

Though heavily we bled
Still on we crawl
Try to catch a cannonball
And a slowly burning tide, oh
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck I heard her call

She said 'When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still you never hit the mark, oh
Even in your rains and shadows
Still we're never going to part
Come on baby
Don't let it break your heart, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't let it break your heart

Don't let it break your heart
