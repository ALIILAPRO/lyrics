		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart's seen things I wish it didn't
Somewhere I lost some of my innocence
And I miss it
I miss it

Stay up all night thinking it's twisted
My life's been survival of the fittest
But I did it
I did it

I do all my own healing
Manage all of my feelings
I don't ask for help, no
'Cause I don't need it
'Cause I don't need it

Sometimes I wish I could do something stupid
Be kinda reckless while I can
Say I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am
I could get hurt and get some scars to prove it
Just say to hell with all my plans
'Cause I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am

Why am I always the one making decisions?
How do I handle the pressure?
I do my best to fake it
But honestly I hate it, oh

I do all my own fighting
I'm who I'ma confide in
Maybe I need help, no
I won't deny it
I won't deny it

Sometimes I wish I could do something stupid
Be kinda reckless while I can
Say I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am
I could get hurt and get some scars to prove it
Just say to hell with all my plans
'Cause I don't give a damn
But I'm older than I am

Older than I, older than I, older than I
I'm older and I don't give a damn
I'm older than I am
