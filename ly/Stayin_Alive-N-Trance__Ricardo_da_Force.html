		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor

Now who got a fever for the flavor
Who can dig the way that I flex on a track, I'm causin' rampage
Ricky Rick on point with da 9-5 style from my lips, they'll be rollin' mad joints
So put your hands in the air 'cause there's a party over here so grab yourself a beer
Or we can get our fever on I'm with it, so let me put my big brown beaver on
I'm coming with the discos, I can flip so, I'ma try the solo tip
Something for the honeys in the crowd, lend me your ear so I can turn the party out
'Til tomorrow afternoon, 'cause when I raise my spirits, no one leaves the room
So can ya tell do ya feel the
Mad skills coming with the fever, fever, fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor

Step to the side, you'd better run and hide
More to the side, everybody wants to stay alive

Everybody's in the house, we had to run this back so you can bring your flares out
N-Trance and the only one, we got it goin' on, so let me get my flowin' on
It's the blast from the pasts that you heard of, me and the boys comin' down with murder
And it's gotta be da way, everybody wants to make a move, so just party
Or we can have a jam, so get your move on, I'ma take this groove and slam
Flip how I want it flipped, from the back to the front, when I drops me the manuscript
'Cause I got the moves, and I'm always gonna flow with the crazy, crazy groove
So can ya tell do ya feel the
Mad skills coming with the fever, fever, fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor

Step to the side, you'd better run and hide
More to the side, everybody wants to stay alive (yeah)
Step to the side, you'd better run and hide
More to the side, everybody wants to stay alive

Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear you say "Ho" (Ho)
Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear you say "Ho, ho" (Ho, ho)
Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear you say "Ho" (Ho)
Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear you say "Ho, ho, ho" (Ho, ho, ho)

It's about time, everybody in the house bust a move to my vicious rule and rhymes
Ricky Rick on the tip, with my boys bringin' disco noise, as I drop the wickedness
Getting sharp with the flow, we took a Bees Gees loop, and broke it down like Lego
A disco lick that's deeper, 'cause we gotta get with da fever, fever, fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor
