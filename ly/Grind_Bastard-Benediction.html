		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grind Bastard - return of the weapon of war
Discharge my stigma
Now I'm back to even the score
Bastard - was condemned through dignity
Mark my soul eternal
Abasing physically

Reduce your will coz I am the Grind Bastard
Fight the world with the strength within

Arise - I am the bastard, I shall win

Debased - revenge on those two faced
Derise - censure guilty I decry.....Opress

Consume - eat your words and siffer
Degrade - humiliate no other

Erode away your futile will
Harass you with exaction
Memorize my calling
I am the bastard, I am the bastard

Though the mills of god grind on....
....they grind so small
A lesson never learned
The bastards never fall

Grind bastard - Rage away 'til the battle is won
Vex you in your torment
No remorse, grinding on
Bastard - Understand now your life is mine
Dispensing my anger
Flesh is meat, blood is wine

In pain - A world to bathe in sorrow
Grimace - At the Inquisition's horror.....Confess
Intrude - Break the train of your thought
Enrage - Butchered now lie war torn

My principles are to die for
Your end arriving faster
Demonize
I am the bastard, I am the end

Never find distraction
Grinding on reaction
Pain in vain - to retain
The bittersweet one

Rage away in torment
The old ways lie dormant
Your life's mind - Yet sublime
This terror brought from.....Bastard

My needful lust is to direct your fate
Spiteful anger to reciprocate
Obsolete and yet I'm breathing still
Longevity my burden - Immortal kill

Gratitude in my revenge
Accept the fact
Your suffering is all
My vengeance never lacked

What my vengeance never lacked

Share my pleasure - feel my pain
Rational thoughts of a man insane
Septic ways to get me high
Jacking up to watch you die

I'm jacking up to watch you die

I see your torment and anxiety
Recognition of my dignity
There's no survivors
There's no regrets
Nothing more for you to beg...

... except a painless death
Betrayers fear my name
Bastard prophecy
Immortal, I am bound
My eternity
