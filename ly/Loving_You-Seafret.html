		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We built a fire in the snow
Warmed our bodies from the cold
And you said If we never try, we'll never know""
You have to sow the seed and watch it grow

Everywhere I go all I ever see
Are all the little ways that it used to be
People that I know only ever speak
Like everything is heading for catastrophe 
There's nothing I can do, I don't get to choose
Even if I could rewrite the history
It's clear to see, that I'd still be 
Loving you

This is bound to leave a mark
But I'd be proud to wear the scars
They tell a rich tale of disaster
About a love and what came after
I'd be frozen like a stone
Think we should take the long way home

Everywhere I go all I ever see
Are all the little things that it used to be
People that I know only ever speak
Like everything is heading for catastrophe 
There's nothing I can do, I don't get to choose
Even if I could rewrite the history
It's clear to see, that I'd still be 
Loving you
