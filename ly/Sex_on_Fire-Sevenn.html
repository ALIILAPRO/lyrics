		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
They're watching
All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
Has people talking
They're talking
You
Your sex is on fire
The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying
You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired
Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it
Chased it
But it's not forever
But it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest
And you
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire, ah, ah
Consumed
With what's just transpired
And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's just transpired
