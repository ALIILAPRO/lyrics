		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time that I look into the mirror
All these lines in my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay
Well, I know, nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got lose to know how to win

Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true, oh
All these things come back to you

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away
Hey-hey-hey

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away

Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream yourself a dream come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dream comes true

Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on, dream on, dream on, oh

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take it away

Sing with me, sing for the years
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears
Sing with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow will pull out and take it away, yeah
