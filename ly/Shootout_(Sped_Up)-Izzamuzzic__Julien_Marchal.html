		  There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side

There is the girl who was on your side 
There is the girl who was on your side
