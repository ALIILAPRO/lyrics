		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I went for a walk
On a winters day

I'd be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin'
On such a winters day

Went to a church, yes I did
I stopped along the way
When I got down on my bended knees
And I began to pray

You know the preacher digs a call
'Cause he knows I'm gunna stay
He knows I'm gunna stay, I told him so
California dreamin'

Oh, somebody hit me now
I wanna go so bad, yeah

'Cause all the leaves are brown
And the skies are gray, yeah
I went for a walk
On a winters day, ooh

I'd be safe and warm
If I was in LA
California dreamin'
On such a winters day
Such a winters day
On such a winters day
Yeah, yeah, whoa

California dreamin'
California dreamin'
Gotta, gotta, gotta get some sunshine
Before I blow my mind

Gotta get some sunshine
California dreamin'
California dreamin'
Ohh, let's go there one day

California dreamin', ohh
California dreamin'
Got to get to LA
Friend of mine told me there's sunshine every day
California dreamin', ohh
