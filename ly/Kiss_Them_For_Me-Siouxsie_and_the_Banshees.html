		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It glittered and it gleamed
For the arriving beauty queen
A ring and a car
Now you're the prettiest by far

No party she'd not attend
No invitation she wouldn't send
Transfixed by the inner sound
Of your promise to be found

"Nothing or no one will ever
Make me let you down"
Kiss them for me, I may be delayed
Kiss them for me if I am delayed

It's divoon, oh it's serene
In the fountains pink champagne
Someone carving their devotion
In the heart-shaped pool of fame

"Nothing or no one will ever
Make me let you down"
Kiss them for me, I may be delayed
Kiss, kiss them for me, I may find myself delayed

On the road to New Orleans
A spray of stars hit the screen
As the tenth impact shimmered
The forbidden candles beamed

Kiss them for me, I may be delayed
Kiss them for me, I may find myself delayed
Kiss them for me, kiss them for me
Kiss them for me, I may find myself delayed
Kiss them for me, kiss them for me
