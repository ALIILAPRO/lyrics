		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever had this feeling
Have you ever had this feeling
Have you ever had this feeling
Have you ever had this feeling
Have you ever had this feeling
In your heart
That brings you down and leaves a scar
Have you ever had this feeling
In your mind
That brings you down and makes you howl
Have you ever had this feeling
Feeling
This feeling
In your mind
Feeling
Feeling
Feeling
Feeling
Feeling
Feeling
Feeling
Feeling
