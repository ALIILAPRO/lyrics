		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I losing my faith
Am I losing my ideals
when my words are drowned out loud
disappear into the ground
 
Oh could it be conquered
is it hidden in a place
can it be made
can it be faked
 
A vanished world that I can see
A vanished world that I can breathe
 
And what is this, the very idea
the only way to be
Another chance just taken away
the only way to be
 
A vanished world that I can see
A vanished world that I can breathe
 
And the city will rise, as your voice changes
I can hear the echo
what was not here now fills the air
and I hear the echo
 
A vanished world that I can see
A vanished world that I can breathe
A vanished world that I can see
A vanished world that I can breathe
