		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When somethin' so near and dear to life
Explodes inside, you feel your soul is set on fire
When somethin' so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside your cries can be heard
So loud and clear

Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it all alone

When something so dear to your life
Explodes inside, you feel your soul is burned alive (burned alive)
When something so deep and so far and wide
Falls down beside your cries can be heard
So loud and clear

Your life is your own
You're in charge of yourself
Master of your home
In the end, in the end
You have to face it alone

When the moon has lost its glow
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
When the moon has
When the moon has lost its glow
Da-da-da, da, da, da, da
When the moon
When the moon has lost its glow
You have to face it all alone
