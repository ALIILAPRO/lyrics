		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day I first met you
You told me you never fall in love
But now that I get you
I know fear is what it really was

Now here we are so close yet so far
How did I pass the test?
When will you realize
Baby I'm not like the rest

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know your scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait to waste
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break

Oh yeah yeah

A Sunday you went home alone
There were tears in your eyes
I called your cell phone, my love
But you did not reply

The world is ours if you want it
We can take it, if you just take my hand
There's no turning back now
Baby try to understand

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know you're scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait to waste
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break

Oh yeah yeah

When your lips are on my lips
And our hearts beat as one
But you slip out of my fingertips
Every time you run

Don't wanna break your heart
Wanna give your heart a break
I know your scared it's wrong
Like you might make a mistake
There's just one life to live
And there's no time to wait to waste
So let me give your heart a break
'Cause you been hurt before
I can see it in your eyes
You try to smile it away
Some things you can't disguise
Don't wanna break your heart
Baby I can erase the ache, the ache
So let me give your heart a break
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break
There's just so much you can take
Give your heart a break
Let me give your heart a break
Your heart a break

The day I first met you
You told me you never fall in love
