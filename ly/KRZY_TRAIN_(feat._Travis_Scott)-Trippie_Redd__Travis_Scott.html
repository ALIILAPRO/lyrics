		  (Bosley)

Brand new coupe
And the inside new, and the inside blue
And you know I'm Big Redd, but I count that blue
Might lose my cool, don't try to shoot
I know I'm the one, but I pour me a deuce
What will I become, if I ain't got you?
Can't say you done, I ain't through with you
Married to the game, yeah, I do

Yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I love you
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do

I can't lose my focus 'cause I'm married to the game (wow, wow)
If you actin' out your conscience then I'll blow your fuckin' brain
Are you ready? All aboard the fuckin' crazy train (wow, wow)
Can't save me, walk up in this bitch and make it rain

(Who?)
Rockstar or rap star, turn this to an avatar
Hundreds turn you avatar (straight up)
Know a crazy Leo that's gon' flip you in a leotard (yeah)
Put her on a train around the ghetto just to see what's up (it's lit)
Take a lil' sip up out my cup, and now I'm seein' stars
I just took a bar, and it don't feel like I went to a bar
Passin' out and wake up in the day, I really from the dark
Me and all the bros we on whoa, when we be goin' hard (sick, sick)
Where we goin'? Up (let's go)
You said, "Farewell"
Make you feel crazy when you by yourself
Now when I take it, it ain't got no-

Yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I love you
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do

I can't lose my focus 'cause I'm married to the game (wow, wow)
If you actin' out your conscience then I'll blow your fuckin' brain
Are you ready? All aboard the fuckin' crazy train (wow, wow)
Can't save me, walk up in this bitch and make it rain

Double R outside, Bentley coupe, frog eyes
Take that bitch to Five Guys (wow, wow)
Cuban link turn you blind, please don't peek, close your eyes
Put your homie in the sky, turn his shirt to tie-dye (wow, wow)
Niggas always talkin tough, that's why they gon' all die
She say I'm a monster, somethin' like I'm sci-fi
Said she need a sponsor, connected her like wi-fi 
Pussy so good, I woke up and gave her a high-five (wow, wow)

Yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I do
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do
Bae, I love you, yeah, I love you
Bae, yeah, I do, yeah, I do

I can't lose my focus 'cause I'm married to the game (wow, wow)
If you actin' out your conscience then I'll blow your fuckin' brain
Are you ready? All aboard the fuckin' crazy train (wow, wow)
Can't save me, walk up in this bitch and make it rain
