		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh I got this feeling
Maybe it's just madness
I'm so in love with myself
It's so romantic
I see 'em staring as I walk down the line
I'm looking good, I don't think it's a crime

But everybody's so quick to stand up and say
Gotta be this way or that way
Gotta ask yourself, is this really what I wanted
Everybody's so quick to fly up and say
You gotta keep your shit together
Well baby watch me freak out

Gonna feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to feel

Feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to feel

I'm gonna feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way, yeah

I'm gonna feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way, yeah

(Come on)
Let me show you what I got
(Come on)
Let me show you what I got

There's only so much that a person can take
Too much abuse and somebody'll break
I took a pill and I hopped on a plane
And I'm never looking back again
'Cause I am on a strike against my body and mind
What once was pain
Is now pleasure of mine

Everybody's so quick to stand up and say
You gotta try to stay together 
Fuck that, gotta ask yourself
Is this really I wanted
Everybody's so quick to sit you down and say
Try to be cool about it
Baby watch me freak out

Gonna feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to feel

Feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to
Feel the way I want to feel

Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way, yeah

Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way, yeah

Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way, yeah

Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way
Feel the way, yeah
