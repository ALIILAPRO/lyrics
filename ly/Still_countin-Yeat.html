		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Racks came in, I was still in the Tonka
Racks came in, they can't fit in this Tonka
Racks came in but I'm still in this Tonka, yeah
Seven mil' on the table and I'm still sayin' Tonka, yeah

Luh crank, luh crank, luh crank
Luh crank, luh crank, luh crank (go)
Luh wonky, luh wonky I boot it up (boot it up, boot it up)
Eatin' the Perc, they gon' take me, I booted up, yeah
I'm on the Xan' and the bean, you get smacked off
Keep on talkin' 'bout it like that
Bitch say she love me, she addicted to crank
Bitch say she love me (what?), I don't love her back (ha)
Some of my twizzys real deal crazy, they get you whacked
I ain't tryna hear your music, turn it off, that shit some trash

I touched me a mil', and I bought me a building
Pull up to the show, and I'm breakin' the ceiling, turn up
Yeah, fuck your girl, fuck your world, fuck your feelings
Yeah, I make too much cheese, I don't want no dealings (with you)
Yeah, I'm on the X tonight (ooh-ooh)
Yeah, I'm on the Perc' tonight (okay)
Fuck a crib, I'm 'bout to hop on a jet and just live in the sky (sky)
Yeah, I just been callin' my demons, I do what they say, don't know why
Heard there's a fountain of youth (you-youth), told 'em to fill it with Wock'
Yeah, Balenci' my shoe, yeah, told 'em I pulled out the lot (ooh)
Fuck 12, fuck cop (ooh)
Big bag, lil' Glock (ooh)
They tryna fuck with the squad, they tryna fuck with the God (ooh)
I don't know who they is, I don't know who they are, yeah (ooh)
I been outside in the Lamb', you don't even have you a car (ooh)
It's up and it's stuck like some jam, no, they can't tear me apart
All of you rappers be soundin' the same, bitch, I couldn't even tell you apart
I just pulled up in the Track, hundred-forty, watch it park

Racks came in, I was still in the Tonka, ha (ooh-ooh)
Racks came in, they can't fit in this Tonka, ha (ooh)
Racks came in, but I'm still in this Tonka, yeah (ooh-ooh)
Seven mil' on the table and I'm still sayin' Tonka, yeah (ooh-ooh)

Luh crank, luh crank, luh crank
Luh crank, luh crank, luh crank (go)
Luh wonky, luh wonky I boot it up (boot it up, boot it up)
Eatin' the Perc, they gon' take me, I booted up, yeah
I'm on the Xan' and the bean, you get smacked off
Keep on talkin' 'bout it like that
Bitch say she love me, she addicted to crank
Bitch say she love me (what?), I don't love her back (ha)
Some of my twizzys real deal crazy, they get you whacked
I ain't tryna hear your music, turn it off, that shit some trash
