		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold my hands down
So they don't, they don't
Reach for you
In case you don't know
A saint is a sinner too

Blind my eyes
So I can't see
What's coming for you
Is coming for me

I hear the choir sing
Calling me on back to you
And I, I forget now 
Just what I'm supposed to do
When 
A saint is a sinner too

I hear the choir sing
Calling me on back to you
And I, I forget now 
Just what I'm supposed to do
When a saint is a sinner too

When a saint is a sinner too

Hold, hold my hands down
Hold my hands down
So I don't reach
So I don't reach
So I don't reach for you

Oh 
Oh
A saint is a sinner too
