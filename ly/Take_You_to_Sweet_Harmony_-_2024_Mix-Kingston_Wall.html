		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I hear you complain 'bout your life makes me
Wonder if you'll get love tonight
You have chosen everything, I say all the time
You had the alternate way
Everything's wrapped together it seems all the
Rights and responsibilities
It's just a matter of your own attitude
If you feel alright, I know you look cute
Everything is so fine it could be
Don't let your mind take you in misery
All the feelings you're not so much pleased
They're just to take you to sweet harmony
