		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll bring my love to you
I'll bring my love to you

I've been stood up messed around
And taken for a fool
But next time round
I'm gonna change the rules

And I don't care about the things that people say
It's you I think about each and everyday
It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay

When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me, I'll be around

Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just want to be with you

Lost inside your love is where I want to be
I'm just asking you to spend some time with me
Time and time you say you want to be free
And you can have some fun that's okay with me

You will never know just how good I feel
The joy inside of me makes me feel so real
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me, I'll be around

Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just want to be with you

I'll bring my love to you
I just want to be with you

I'll bring my love to you
I just want to be with you

It's much too late for you to change your ways
I can't keep holding on expecting you to stay
When you're all alone and if you're feeling down
Call me, I'll be around

Whenever you need somebody
I'll bring my love to you
You don't have to say you love me
I just want to be with you
