		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brain freeze, nose bleed
Hold hands, no please
We tried, no luck
Can't hide what you don't want
New life, new friends
Rewind, same thing
We tried, no luck
Can't hide what you don't want
You watched as I
Fell apart and I
Two cups in the middle of the cup holder
We were driving
But the sun wasn't out today
I can tell that you weren't in love with me
Stop, put it in park, let's talk
Drop that, I know where I messed up
I could've told you the moment I'm running
Where did we go wrong?
Brain freeze, nose bleed
Hold hands, no please
We tried, no luck
Can't hide what you don't want
New life, new friends
Rewind, same thing
We tried, no luck
Can't hide what you don't want
