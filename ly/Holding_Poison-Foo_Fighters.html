		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this thing and I've been taking it out on you
Taking it out on you, oh you
Like a machine that's always breaking down on you
Breaking down on you, so true

I spin around, around, around
Spin around, around around
Spin around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
I know what I need, I know what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down

I get the feeling there ain't nothing that I can do
Nothing will get me through, so blue
Sometimes I dream, I can dream, I can dream
And then I bleed, and I bleed, and I bleed
I get the feeling that there's nothing that I can do

I spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Spin around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
I know what I need, I know what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down

Stand around, around, around
Stand around, around, around
Stand around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
I know what I need, I know what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
