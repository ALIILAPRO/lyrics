		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the "Boom, boom" we are breaking through

We prepared for the turbulence
But there's no preparing for this
Got paid on Tuesday, but I'm still broke when the weekend ends
Another trip around the sun, it was a good run
Just mixing all of my prescriptions with my problems
Yeah, streets are full of seasons
Saw what they did to Jesus
Dude'll kill you for no reason, and charge you for treason
I know this one for a fact
My phone they got it on tap
'Cause every time I'm talkin' I can hear them in the back (hands up)

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the "Boom, boom" we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the "Boom, boom" we are breaking through

She windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
She windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
She windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
She's windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
Knock, knock, knock, knock, who is it? (hands up)

She said this is a surprise visit
It's my fantasy I'm gonna live it
Hands up, and don't you refuse it
I wanna tattoo you on me
Just look what you created
Dear future self, I hope it's going well
I'm drunk on cheap whiskey in an airport hotel, yeah

Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the "Boom, boom" we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom (hands up, hands up)
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune (talking 'bout, talking 'bout)
You can hear us comin' with the zoom (you can hear us comin' with the)
Listen to the "Boom, boom" we are breaking through

She windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
She windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
She windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
She's windin' like she losing her mind, yeah
Knock, knock, knock, knock, who is it?

Hands up
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the "Boom, boom" we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune (never mind the, yeah)
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the boom, boom, we are breaking through
