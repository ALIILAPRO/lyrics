		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your life is like a crack in the mirror
7 years of bad luck it ain't getting better now
Not till all is said and done
Reflection in the window is the same old face
Background small town everywhere you look around
Tell me what you're runnin from

Flip a coin and let it land in your hand
Heads you gonna stay but its tails.. 

So you can move to another town
Hide where you're sure you won't be found
But its still just you on the inside
You can pretend it'll be alright
Said it to yourself but you know it's just a lie
Cause it's still just you on the inside

Still you on the inside...

Nothin faster than the speed of your leavin
A hundred miles an hour and there aint no slowin down
But you can't outrun yourself
Hey you can say you fit in like a joker in the deck
But now you're skipping like a broken record goin round
You're the last to ask for help

You flip a coin and let it land in your hand
Heads you gonna stay but its tails

So you can move to another town
Hide where you're sure you won't be found
But it's still just you on the inside
You can't pretend it'll be alright
Said it to yourself but you know it's just a lie
Cause it's still just you on the inside

Still you on the inside

It's never really been a question of how far
And at the end of every destination..
There you are

You can move to another town
Hide where you're sure you won't be found
But it's still just you on the inside
Oh you can pretend it will be alright
No matter how you sell it
When you tell it it's a lie
Cause it's still just you on the inside
Still you on the inside (You can go and change and to me you'll always be the same)
Still you on the inside (You can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside)
Still you on the inside (You can go and change and to me you'll always be the same)
Still you on the inside (You can try and run and know you'll always be the same inside)
Still love you on the inside.
