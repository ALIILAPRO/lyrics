		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not strong enough to stay away
Can't run from you
I just run back to you
Like a moth I'm drawn in to your flame
You say my name, but it's not the same
You look in my eyes I'm stripped of my pride
And my soul surrenders and you bring my heart to it's knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight 
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

I'm not strong enough to stay away
What can I do?
I would die without you
And your presence my heart knows no shame
I'm not to blame
'Cause you bring my heart to it's knees

And it's killin' me when you're away
And I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away

There's nothing I can do
My heart is dream to you
And I can't get free
Look what this life's done to me

And it's killin' me when you're away
I wanna leave and I wanna stay
I'm so confused, so hard to choose
Between the pleasure and the pain
And I know it's wrong, and I know it's right
Even if I try to win the fight
My heart would overrule my mind
And I'm not strong enough to stay away
Strong enough
Strong enough
Not strong enough
Strong enough
To stay away
Strong enough
Strong enough
Strong, strong enough
Strong enough
And I'm not strong enough
To stay away
