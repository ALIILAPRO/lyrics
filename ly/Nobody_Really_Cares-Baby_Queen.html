		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who would you be if there was nobody watching?
How many parts of your identity are you squashing down?
Just to toe the societal line
And why do people that you've never laid your eyes on define
Your taste, your weight and the way you dress?
Do you even know the people that you're trying to impress?

Talks cheap
It's okay to be scared
But listen up because I've got a secret to share

Nobody really cares
Crash your daddy's car
Get kicked out the bar
Sabotage your two months sober
Spend a weekend on your sofa
Cut your hair
Nobody really cares

Yup

Just think about it
Do you think about me?
Or do you think about the way I change your reality?
You see
Everybody's so in love with themselves
They've got no mental capacity for anyone else
Your taste, your weight
And the way you dress
Is irrelevant to somebody who's self obsessed

Yes
Talks cheap
It's okay to be scared
But if you're playing by the rules
I really hope you're aware

Nobody really cares
Crash your daddy's car
Get kicked out the bar
Tell your boyfriend that it's over
Write a song for Jodie Comer
Cut your hair
Nobody really cares
Nobody really cares
Nobody really cares
Nobody really

Kiss your best friends at the disco
Catch a flight to San Francisco
Throw your phone into the ocean
Start a fight cause a commotion
Get a tattoo, change your name
Take your clothes off in the rain
And cut your hair
Nobody really cares

Crash your daddy's car (nobody, nobody, nobody really cares)
Get kicked out the bar (nobody, nobody, nobody really)
Tell your boyfriend that it's over
Write a song for Jodie Comer
Cut your hair (nobody, nobody)
Nobody really cares
