		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A life lesson
A life lesson
I guess you were a life lesson
A life lesson

I've been falling for you
And it seems to me, yeah
That it was always too good to be true
I tried to right my wrongs
Find myself, time will tell
I thought we could make it work
Still I'm hurt, I won't learn, oh no

I guess you're just a, a life lesson
Had my mind messing
Now I don't need your blessing
I guess you're just a, a life lesson
How I felt, I said it
Now look at all you're left with

A life lesson
A life lesson
I guess you were a life lesson

I guess you're just a, a life lesson
Had my mind messing
Now I don't need your blessing
I guess you're just a, a life lesson
How I felt, I said it
Now look at all you're left with

I've been falling for you
And it seems to me, yeah
That it was always too good to be true
I tried to right my wrongs
Find myself, time will tell
I thought we could make it work
Still I'm hurt, I won't learn, oh no

I guess you're just a, a life lesson
Had my mind messing
Now I don't need your blessing
I guess you're just a, a life lesson
How I felt, I said it
Now look at all you're left with

I guess you're just a, a life lesson
Had my mind messing
Now I don't need your blessing
I guess you're just a, a life lesson
A life lesson
Now look at all you're left with

(A life lesson)
(A life lesson)
(I guess you were a life lesson)

I guess you're just a, a life lesson
Left my mind messing
Now I don't need your blessing
I guess you're just a, a life lesson
How I felt, I said it
Now look at all you're left with

A life lesson
A life lesson
A life lesson
I guess you were a life lesson
A life lesson
A life lesson
