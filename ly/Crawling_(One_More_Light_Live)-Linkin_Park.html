		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahh, I hate you so much right now

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface (beneath the surface)
Consuming (consuming), confusing (confusing)
This lack of self control, I find so overwhelming (so overwhelming)
Controlling (controlling)
I can't seem
To find the strength within
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence 
And I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has laid itself upon me (laid itself upon me)
Distracting (distracting), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (my own reflection)
It's haunting (it's haunting) how I can't seem

To find the strength within
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence 
And I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement (to find the strength within, my walls are closing in)
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Raindrops put the rhythm on the pavement (I've felt this way before, so insecure)
And drip from the blacktop into the basement
Traces of the rain pervade this
To erase your hate and take this from the fakeness

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
