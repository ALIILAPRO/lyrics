		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cute, your car is sports, like, is that fast?
I hear you talking over me, like, is that smart?
'Cause I've played Wembley Stadium, like, is that hard?
Not really, really, oh, really, oh
Tell me more about your money, babe, drop them oh's (oh)
And while you're out at, drop a name and then bum a smoke (smoke)
Did someone drop you as a kid or is that coke? (Coke)
No really, really, oh, really, oh

Listen, boy, somebody's gotta say it
It might cut to the core
Got this far but I'm Joan of Arc
And you're just a guy on a horse

Stand me up and crack a smile, like, is that plaque? (Plaque)
And say you're pretty sure that blonde wants you so bad (bad)
And your friends are oh so famous, like, is that Brad? (Brad)
Not really, really, oh, really, oh

I don't envy, only pity
You'll be lonely in your fifties

Listen, boy, somebody's gotta say it
It might cut to the core
Got this far but I'm Joan of Arc
And you're just a guy on a horse (just a guy on a horse)
Then I try to be nice but
I can't keep it in anymore (no way)
Got this far but I'm Joan of Arc
And you're just a guy on a horse

Got this far but I'm Joan of Arc (somebody)
And you're just a guy on a horse

Sour in your saddle
I think you want to start a war
I've got bigger battles
And you're just a guy on a horse
And you're just a guy on a horse
