		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit my peak at sixteen
Couldn't get to me, I got a pocket full of dreams
Then life hit at twenty-three
It's embarrassing and messy as it should be

Got dizzy, too busy tryna people please
I see it so clearly from the driver's seat
They were talking in circles, tryna get to me
They said I had to

Said I had to know somebody who knew somebody
To get to where I wanted to go
I had to love somebody to lose somebody
Sorry, you're the first to go

There'll be another like (you)
I, I'll find another like (you)
Always be another like (you)
Sorry, you're the first to go

Sunscreen, thicker skin
I'm not mad, I'm the happiest I've ever been
Whiplash, the last laugh
Broke the rearview mirror

Call it karma if you wanna
'Cause it's just around the corner
Thought it'd kill me but I'm stronger
Don't it hit you that much harder?

Said I had to know somebody who knew somebody
To get to where I wanted to go
I had to love somebody to lose somebody
Sorry, you're the first to go

There'll be another like (you)
I, I'll find another like (you)
Always be another like (you)
Sorry, you're the first to go

Call it karma if you wanna
'Cause it's just around the corner
Thought it'd kill me but I'm stronger
Don't it hit you that much harder?

(You)
I, I'll find another like (you)
Always be another like (you)
Sorry, you're the first to go
