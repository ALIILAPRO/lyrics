		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holding back the flood in this skyscraper town
You gave all that sweat and blood, now you think you're gonna drown
You can't tell that you're bigger than the sea that you're sinking in
And you don't know what you got but you got it at your fingertips
 
Ooh, you got it in you
Ooh, you got it in you
 
When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark
No one ever told you this would be so hard
I know you think your fire's burning out
But I still see it shining through
You got it in you
 
Not everything you hear should sound like the truth
'Cause nobody else's words can't define you
Maybe you don't see it but you're quicker than the world can spin
You should know what you got 'cause you got it at your fingertips
 
Ooh, you got it in you
Ooh, you got it in you
 
When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark
No one ever told you this would be so hard
I know you think your fire's burning out
But I still see it shining through
You got it in you
 
When the lights go out and leave you standing in the dark
No one ever told you this would be so hard
I know you think your fire's burning out
But I still see it shining through
You got it in you
You got it in you
You got it in you
