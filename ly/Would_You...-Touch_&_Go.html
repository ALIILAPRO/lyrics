		  Umm, I've noticed you around
I find you very attractive
I've noticed you around, umm
I find you very attractive
I find you very attractive
Umm, would you go to bed with me?

I've noticed you around, umm
I find you very attractive
Would you, umm

I find you very attractive
Would you, umm

Umm, would you go to bed with me?

I've noticed you around
I find you very attractive
I've noticed you around, umm
