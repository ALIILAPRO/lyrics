		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You cross the schoolyard with your head held down
And walk the streets under the breaking cloud
With a hundred futures cascading out
It's complicated

You think of love as just a memory
A fog that smothers you, it's hard to breathe
But when you're on your own, that's when you're free
You're 3 years older and you'll always be now

I can feel you more than you really know
I will love you more than I'll ever show

There was a time when someone seemed to care
A tourist in your bed, you left him there
And found a simple life with no one to share
It's not complicated

You make a list of all your big regrets
And share with people that you've never met
You slowly move towards the medicine chest
You're 3 years older and you'll always be now

I can feel you more than you really know
I will love you more than I'll ever show
You only have to say
And the world will slip away 
From you

Shame on you for getting older every day
This place is not for you so why do you still stay?
You're standing with the other fuckers in the rain
Life in not some sinecure for you to claim
You have to pay

I can feel you more than you really know
I will love you more than I'll ever show
You only have to say
And the world will slip away 
From you
