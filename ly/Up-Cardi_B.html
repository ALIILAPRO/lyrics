		  Up, up, up (ayy) up, up
(This is fire) look

Once upon a time man, I heard that I was ugly
Came from a bitch, who nigga wanna fuck on me
I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Birkin bag Bardi back and all you bitches fucked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck huh
Up then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck huh

I could make the party hot
I could make your body rock
Bitches say they fucking with me
Chances are they probably not
If I had a dick you probably lick it like a lollipop
Hoes speaking Capanese hit 'em with karate chop
I'm forever popping shit
Pulling up and dropping shit
Gotta argue with him, 'cause a nigga love a toxic bitch
Niggas out here playing gotta make him understand
If ain't no ring on my finger you ain't going on my 'Gram

I said my face bomb, ass tight
Racks stack up Shaq height
Jewelry on me, flashlight
I been lit since last night
Hit him with that good good
Make a nigga act right
Broke boys don't deserve no pussy
(I know that's right)

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Birkin bag Bardi back and all you bitches fucked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh
Up then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh

Bitches ain't fucking with me now and I can see why
Dirty ass, dusty ass bitch, you got pink eye
Bitches want smoke until I bring it to they doorstep
Tell that bitch "That bad breath smell like horse sex"
Put it on him now, he will never be the same
Tatted on my ass 'cause I really like the pain
He nutted on my butt, I said "I'm glad that you came"
If that nigga had a twin, I would let 'em run a train

Big bag bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Balenciaga Bardi back and all these bitches fucked
It's big bags bussin' out the Bentley Bentayga
Man, Birkin bag Bardi back and all you bitches fucked

If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh
Up then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck
If it's up, then it's up, then it's up, then it's stuck, huh

Gotta play it safe, huh, no face no case
