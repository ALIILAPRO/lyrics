		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like a feather oh 
There's no gravity 
I'm floating in this scene 
And I'm serene 
Come on closer 
Walking in the air 
That's the just the way you make me feel 

Like a thousand little stars 
Take me way way out to Mars 
I can taste your Milky Way 
Wanna have you every day 
Running rings around my world 
Baby boy you're mystical 
Every touch I explode 
Never wanna let you go (Falling) 
Stars all around us (I'm falling) 
Hard (The universe) 
Is our playground 

You're taking me 
Taking me 
Taking me 
Taking me far 

Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop it 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop 

You're my captain 
Take a trip round the stars 
Take a pic, write a caption 
I want action, wanna feel 
On your body while we're naked in the cabin 
Come and touch me 
I'm kinda heaven sent 
Yeah kinda otherworldly 
I know you want it 
So boy come and show me how you really really want it 

Goin' through the galaxy 
Baby boy just you and me 
You are all that I can see 
You are all that I believe 
Goin' through the galaxy 
Baby boy just you and me 
You are all that I can see 
You are all that I believe 

Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop it 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop it 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop 

Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop it 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop it 
Let's ride in your rocket 
Zoom fast like a comet 
Ride in your rocket 
Go fast boy don't stop
