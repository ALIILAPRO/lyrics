		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, we could've made up
Yeah, we should've stayed up tryna fix you and me
But all that I know is coulda, shoulda
Just don't mean a goddamn thing
Looking at you, I realize
Looking at you, I feel like I'm emotional
Watching our love go stupid, crazy
Fast until we lost control

Could you stay right by my side
One more time just to try?
What if we could've been so much more
Than this was? (Than this was)
Pretend you're mine for the night
Before I say goodbye
What if we could've been so much more
Than this was? (Than this was)

Yeah, we could've made up
Yeah, we should've stayed up tryna fix this love
'Cause all that I know is coulda, shoulda
Never really worked for us (for us, no, no)
Can we get back momentum?
'Cause I can feel the tension, do you feel it too?
Yeah, I've been up late and second-guessing
Reminiscing 'bout us two (ooh)

Could you stay right by my side
One more time just to try?
What if we could've been so much more
Than this was? (Than this was)
Pretend you're mine for the night
Before I say goodbye
What if we could've been so much more
Than this was? (Than this was)
Was it only young love?
Was I out of my mind?
Did we really mess up?
Can we press rewind?
What if we could've been so much more
Than this was? (Than this was, so much more, so much more)
Was it only young love? (Was it only young?)
Was I out of my mind? (Was I out of my mind?)
Did we really mess up? (Did we really mess up?)
Can we press rewind?
What if we could've been so much more
Than this was? (Than this was)

Yeah, we could've made up
Yeah, we should've stayed up tryna fix you and me
But all that I know is coulda, shoulda
Just don't mean a goddamn thing
