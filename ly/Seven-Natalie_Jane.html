		<p>
		  You and I
What a lie
Wasted time
On a feeling
I wish I (I wish I)
Saw the signs (saw the signs)
I was blind (I was blind)
It was thrilling 

Was it ever really love if the night that we broke up
Both went out to go hook up
With the one we told each other not to worry about?
Was it really everything? Was I caught up in a dream?
Seven months was just a fling, I'm starting to freak out

Ha, ha, ha, ooh, ooh, ooh
Was it ever really love?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha-ha
Was it ever really?

Remember when you said you wanted me to go blonde
Well, now it makes sense that you ran right in to her arms
I bet you think she's nice
I bet she's just your type
I can't blame you, guess we both got what we fantasized 

Was it ever really love if the night that we broke up
Both went out to go hook up
With the one we told each other not to worry about?
Was it really everything? Was I caught up in a dream?
Seven months was just a fling, I'm starting to freak out

Ha, ha, ha, ooh, ooh, ooh
Was it ever really love?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

Was it ever really love if the night that we broke up
Both went out to go hook up
With the one we told each other not to worry about?
Was it really everything? Was I caught up in a dream?
Seven months was just a, just a fling
