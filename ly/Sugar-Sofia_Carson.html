		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ow

I knew from the first night 
And I haven't been the same since
'Cause when we kiss it's like (it's like) 
Cherry licorice on my lips

I start to hear music 
That I haven't heard before
Don't know how you do this (do this)
But I know I'd love some more
So kiss me some more

You taste just like sugar, my sugar, sugar high
I like it but I shouldn't, so good that I could die
And, oh my God, the sweet paradise with you by my side
Oh baby, say you'll be mine
My sugar, my sugar, sugar high
I like it but I shouldn't, so good that I could die
And, oh my God, the sweet paradise with you by my side
Oh baby, say you'll be mine
My sugar

My mama said, "Careful (careful)
Too much honey makes you lovesick"
I said, "If you say so
But I can't stop thinking 'bout him"

I start to hear music (music)
That I haven't heard before
Don't know how you do it
But I know I'd love some more
So kiss me some more

You taste just like sugar, my sugar, sugar high
I like it but I shouldn't, so good that I could die
And, oh my God, the sweet paradise with you by my side
Oh baby, say you'll be mine
My sugar, my sugar, sugar high (my sugar)
I like it but I shouldn't, so good that I could die (I could die)
And, oh my God, the sweet paradise with you by my side
Oh baby, say you'll be mine
My sugar

(Oh) and every time you leave, you know I miss your face
'Cause I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, babe
I'm up in cotton candy clouds with you for days
Baby, it's not that bad to crave

Sugar, my sugar, sugar high
I like it but I shouldn't, so good that I could die (I could die)
And, oh my God, the sweet paradise with you by my side
Oh baby, say you'll be mine
My sugar (sugar), my sugar, sugar high
I like it but I shouldn't, so good that I could die
And, oh my God, the sweet paradise with you by my side
Oh baby, say you'll be mine
My sugar
