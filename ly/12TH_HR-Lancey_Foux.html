		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh
I'm falling
I see just how I land 
My death
I see just how I land 
My death
I notice who I am
I'm falling
I know just how I land 
My death
I know just how I land 
I'm falling
I know, I know it, I notice who I am

I close my eyes, I'm seeing my life infront of me
I own my vibe before I look why in another me
In disguise I can't let them uncover me
Look in her eyes, I can see she in love with me
Ride or die, she said she gonna walk in blood
Rise and shine everyday that I'm under the Sun
What's gonna be my fate? Is it money or drugs?
Imma be late to my death
I was busy gettin' stuck

You don't understand
You don't understand
You don't understand
You don't understand
You don't understand
You don't understand
You don't understand"
