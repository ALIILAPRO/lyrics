		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The war's inside your mind
The smoke is rising, getting higher now
Without your voice yellin' to me
Where I gonna go now?

I walk in the valley
I pray upon the stars
When my heart is long gone
And I'm yearning for your love

Didn't know I was losing ya
Baby, I was feeling the ride, letting go
Oh, it's all my delirium
It's all my delirium
Didn't know I was gonna lose you
Oh, out in oblivion
It's all just delirium
It's all just delirium

It's all just delirium

So over intoxicating
Finally came crashing down
I've been sober since the moment
I burned our world down

I walk in the valley
And I pray among the stars
When my heart is long gone
And I'm yearning for your love

Didn't know I was losing ya
Baby, I was feeling the ride, letting go
Oh, it's all my delirium
It's all my delirium
Didn't know I was gonna lose you
Oh, out in oblivion
It's all just delirium
It's all just delirium

It's all just delirium
(It's all just delirium)
(It's all just delirium)
