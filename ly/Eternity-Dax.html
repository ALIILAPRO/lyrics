		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when you really examine
The concept of eternity
One will find that there is no end
Life after death is a concept humans
Still don't understand

How long is eternity? I don't understand
Some say forever, but if it's forever
Then when does it come to an end?
It's more than a concept
(It's more than a concept)
And infinite time that we spend (We spend)
It confirms that our lives here
On earth are a
Blip of existence and don't make a dent
As we get older, it creeps in our mind
The thought of the end and beginning of time
The life that we thought that
We lived doesn't matter
Approachin' the thought that someday
We all die
I get confused when I look in the sky
What is this water hitting my eyes?
Maybe the rain is the pain and shame
That hit's earth when God cries
As we get older, we don't care what we did
(We don't care)
It's not the things we receive
But the things we give
We try to go back to the time we were kids
But those shoes no longer fit
And then we finally realize
That everyone dies but not everyone lives
So I'm takin' a chance (A chance)
I'm livin' my life in the moment and not
In the future that's not in my hands
(My hands)
I'm givin' my time to the people who
Love me for everything that I am
I'm livin' my life in reality
Not for a post that they'll tap
When they open the 'Gram
I'm doing whatever it takes
I'm not gonna dwell on my past mistakes
I'm bridgin' the gap between my dreams
And what I see while I'm awake (I swear)
They say leave it up to fate
Well, fate favors those who take
'Cause if eternity's forever and
All this is temporary, why wait?
Humanity's lost (Lost)
We obsess the price of material things
But at what cost? (At what cost?)
Then treat time like currency and
Spend it for applause
Because we think that life is just a
Game we can turn on and off
We build, we break, renew, replace
We nine-to-five and count the days
For forty years 'til sixty-five
Then live off what our pension pays
We fall in line as mental slaves
Our bodies work, our minds are caged
And that's why people say the richest place
You'll find is at the graves
Full of hopes and dreams
That people never chased
Full of feelings that we felt
But never got to say (Say)
All the thoughts inside our heads that
We kept stored and locked away (Locked away)
As our age increased and we
Got old and everything decayed
And when we finally realize that our
Whole life was not a game
And that time was a commodity
That we could not regain
And that we were in control
And there was no one else to blame
Is the day that we change

It's eternity, no end (No end)
Eternity, no end (No end)
It's eternity, no end
Eternity, no end (No end)
It's eternity, no end (No end)
It's eternity, no end (No end)
It's eternity, no end eternity, no end

What are you doing with your time?
What is your definition of happiness?
Are you giving more than you're taking?
And finally if it were to all end right now
What are you holding on to
That you need to let the world see?
