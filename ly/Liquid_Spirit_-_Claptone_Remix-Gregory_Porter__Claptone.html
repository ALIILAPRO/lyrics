		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Un re-route the rivers
Let the dammed water be
There's some people down the way that's thirsty
So let the liquid spirit free

The people are thirsty
'Cause of man's unnatural hand
Watch what happens when the people catch wind
When the water hits the banks of that hard dry land
Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands now
Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands no, hmm

Get ready for the wave
It might strike like the final flood
The people haven't drank is so long
The water won't even make mud

After it comes, it might come with a steady flow
Grab the roots of the tree
Down by the river, fill your cup when your spirit's low

Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands now
Clap your hands now
Clap your hands now

Dip down and take a drank
And fill your water tank
Dip down and take a drank
And fill your water tank

Un re-route the rivers
Let the dammed water be
There's some people down the way that's thirsty
Let the liquid spirits free

The folk are thirsty
Because of man's unnatural hand
Watch what happens when the people catch wind
Of the water hitting banks of hard dry land

Clap your hands now
Clap your hands now
Go 'head and clap your hands now
Clap your hands now

Hmm

Get down and take a drink
And fill your water tank
Dip down and take a drink
And fill your water tank

Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit
Liquid spirit

Clap your hands now
Liquid spirit
