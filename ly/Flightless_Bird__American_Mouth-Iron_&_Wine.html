		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was a quick wet boy
Diving too deep for coins
All of your straight light eyes
Wide on my plastic toys

Then when the cops closed the fair
I cut my long baby hair
Stole me a dog eared map
And called for you everywhere

Have I found you?
Flightless bird, jealous, weeping
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big bill looming

Now I'm a fat house cat
Cursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks

Pissing on magazine photos
Those fishing lures thrown in the cold and clean
Blood of Christ mountain stream

Have I found you?
Flightless bird, brown hair bleeding
Or lost you?
American mouth
Big bill, stuck going down
