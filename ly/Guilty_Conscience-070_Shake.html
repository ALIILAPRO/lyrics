		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mind won't let me rest
Voice in my head
I hear what it said
I can't trust a thing
If I picked up and left
How fast did you forget?
Resting while I'm inside your presence
I don't want to think nothing bad
This time I won't
This time I won't

Five AM when I walked in
Could not believe what I saw, yeah
You on another one's body
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me
I caught you but you never caught me
I was sitting here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
There goes my guilty conscience

Five AM when I walked in
Could not believe what I saw, yeah
You on another one's body
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me
I caught you but you never caught me
I was sitting here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
There goes my guilty conscience

No, I won't let you stay
Thanks for the hours
Thanks for the days
If I see your eyes
I turn to stone
I look away
I gotta go

Gone for the week, don't bother
'Til pigs fly, shit, keep on calling
I've been working for me, not sorry
Next time that we speak, I'll be calm
Next time that I go in, I'm all in
Why you so close but you feel so far?
You look like the moon in the morning
Jaded, faded, almost gone

Resting while I'm inside your presence
I don't wanna think nothing bad
Goodnights are never really good nights, nights, nights
Feel something that's heavy inside

Five AM when I walked in
Could not believe what I saw, yeah
You on another one's body
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me
I caught you but you never caught me
I was sitting here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
There goes my guilty conscience

Five AM when I walked in
Could not believe what I saw, yeah
You on another one's body
Ghosts of the past came to haunt me
I caught you but you never caught me
I was sitting here waiting on karma
There goes my guilty conscience
There goes my guilty conscience
