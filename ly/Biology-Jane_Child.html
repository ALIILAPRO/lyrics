		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm attracted anatomically
Need to know you scientifically
Strange confusion has come over me
Need the fusion between you and me

Mother Natures legislature
Mother Nature takes her course
Gravitation of the nation
Gravitation to the source

I'm distracted biologically
My attention dominating me
I'm a victim of divine design
I'm a victim of a one-track mind

Gut reaction, satisfaction
Gut reactions never lie
Need I mention my intention
Do I need an alibi

It happens every time you're next to me, biology
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh, biology
It happens every time you're next to me, biology
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh, biology

I'm defenseless, lacking all control
It's relentless, longing of my soul
I am driven, I'm completely yours
It's a given, I'll be back for more

It's instinctive, so distinctive
And on that you may depend
Don't go mess with Mother Nature
She'll defeat you in the end

It happens every time you're next to me, biology
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh, biology
It happens every time you're next to me, biology
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh, biology

Need I mention my intention
Are you willing to supply?
Gut reaction, satisfaction
Gut reactions never lie

It happens every time you're next to me, biology
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh, biology
It happens every time you're next to me, biology
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-uh-oh, biology
