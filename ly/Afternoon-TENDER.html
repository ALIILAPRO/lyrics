		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me hoping I'm wrong again
Girl, it's not what I need
I'm spending all of my time tryna' open up
Let it breathe, let it breathe
It all comes down to whether you love me anymore
God, I hope you do 'cause I can't tell, I can't tell

By the look in your eyes, uhm uhm
It was the early afternoon
I thought I lost you to the tune
You got me singing that, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on

Can you let it be?
You're the air I breathe
You said it all come down when the morning comes
You said we'd both come 'round when the sun was up
'Round and 'round, we go
God, I'm trapped in a daydream
Paint my soul on the big screen

Tell by the look in your eyes, uhm uhm
It was the early afternoon
I thought I lost you to the tune
You got me singing that, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on, uhm uhm uhm
Got me holding on

Uhm uhm uhm, uhm uhm, uhm uhm
Got me holding on
Uhm uhm uhm, uhm uhm, uhm uhm
Got me holding on
