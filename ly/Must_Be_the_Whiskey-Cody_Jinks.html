		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, I'm not goin' crazy, but lately my head and my heart
Seem to be at least a million miles apart
My heart says to love you, my head says to run
It's like my heart is to afraid to tell my head when it's done
I know that it can never be the way it was
Even though you'll be the death of me, I can't give you up
Too much is not enough, it's not the love 
It's not the lust that grips me
It must be the whiskey

I've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget
I got I love you on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath
And loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me
It must be the whiskey
Oh-oh-oh 

No, I'm not goin' crazy, but lately these thoughts in my head
Are a whirlwind of a world of a million regrets
All the things I should've done, all the things I should've said
All the pain that comes with hatin' the mess you've made of yourself
I know I'm chasin' rainbows, thinkin' I could make it work
But the fact is that my actions speak louder than my words
And it only makes it worse thinkin' of her, thinkin' she'll forgive me
It must be the whiskey

I've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget
I got I love you on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath
And loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me
It must be the whiskey

I've been drinkin' to remember and drinkin' to forget
I got I love you on my mind, I got Jim Beam on my breath
And loneliness has got the rest, I've got nothin' left within me
Sometimes it hits me whenever I'm a little tipsy
Oh, it hits me whenever I'm a little tipsy
It must be the whiskey
Oh-oh-oh
It must be the whiskey
Oh-oh-oh
It's that whiskey
Oh-oh-oh
It must be the whiskey
