Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, oh
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know if you comfortable, oh
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, boo
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know if you comfortable, oh

I found your vibe, and I, and I found my high, yeah
Let's touch the sky, I'ma, I'ma change your life, yeah
Do you realize I love the way you look me in my eyes? Yeah
Don't kill my vibe, nigga, don't kill my vibe, yeah
On top of my game, nigga, we aren't the same, ayy
I wonder why lame niggas think that they run things
I wonder why, I, I wonder why, yeah
Just feel the vibes, just, just feel the vibes, yeah

Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, oh
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know if you comfortable, oh
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, boo
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know if you comfortable, oh

Now when you left, left, it wasn't right, yeah
I took a left, swerve, then I took a right, yeah
I was feeling right, yeah, see it in the night air
They talking dumb, well frankly I don't care
Do you realize I'm the man and I'm in my prime? Yeah
And it's my time, I swear to God I won't waste no time, yeah
You ain't worth a dime, no, you ain't worth a dime, yeah
Still on my mind, whoa, you're still on my mind, yeah

Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, oh
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know if you comfortable, oh
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know what's up with you, boo
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Let me know if you comfortable, oh

(I wonder why, I, I wonder why, yeah)
(Just feel the vibes, just, just feel the vibes)
(I wonder why, I, I wonder why, yeah)
(Just feel the vibes, just, just feel the vibes)
(I wonder why, I, I wonder why, yeah)
(Just feel the vibes, just, just feel the vibes)
(Just feel the vibes, just, just feel the vibes)
