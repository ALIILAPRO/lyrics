		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to be with you
No matter what they say
Just want to be with you
Every night and every day
Cold nights, dark days
I want to be with you

I just want to be with you
Till the final curtain falls
Just want to be with you
Then know nothing at all
Cold nights, dark days
I want to be with you
want to be with you

I know there's a price to pay
For doing what we do
But I just want to be with you
Just want to be with you

Don't want to hold you down
Whatever that you do
Shine on, sweet angel
'cause I just want to be with you
I want to be with you
