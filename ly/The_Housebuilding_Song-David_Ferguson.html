		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, let me have a rule and a saw and a board and I'll cut it
I'll climb up a ladder with a hammer and a nail and I'll nail it

Well, we worked so hard to build a little house together
In the snow or the rain or the ice-cold wind, whenever

No matter
What the weather
We're together

Let me have a rule and a saw and a board and I'll cut it
Climb up a ladder with a hammer and a nail and I'll nail it

Well, we worked so hard to build a little house together
In the snow, in the rain or the ice-cold wind, whenever

No matter
Any weather
We're together
