		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me to the factory
Where my heart will bleed
The sweets inside of me
Now that's his favorite treat
Take me to the candy shop
And buy me lollipop's, you know it gets me high
The way my bubble pop pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
My pop pop pop pop
My pop pop pop pop
My pop pop pop pop
Hiding all my treats away
Because I heard you say
That you don't like the way
I used to stuff my face
Jealous of my candy crush
It gives me such a rush
It makes my bumble plump
The way you bubble up up up
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
You give me a sweet tooth baby, he said he like my
You give me a sweet tooth baby, my pop pop pop
