		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm T'd up
I've been taking drugs 'til my heart stop, re'd-up
I might hit the plug, I need all Wock', drink up
She just tryna lick me 'cause my ice like it's Rita's
She know that she want me 'cause it's finders keepers
Got 'em lookin' silly, he can't find her, weeper
Brodie got her stripping
Get behind her, and team her
She gon' hit the floor and give me mind 'til her knees hurt
But I had to kick her to the side, I don't need her

I'ma keep on countin' all this money 'til my fingers hurt
Then I get a money counter, this shit got a endless limit
Rock out in my wonderland like I can't hear a hating nigga
Smoke out all my useless feelings, I do not debate with Satan
On the dark side of your life
Got a lot of evil energy but it's not mine
Got a lot of evil enemies and that's all fine
But you're the only thing I'm worried 'bout when I'm not high

Oh, I'm T'd up
I've been taking drugs 'til my heart stop, re'd-up
I might hit the plug, I need all Wock', drink up
She just tryna lick me 'cause my ice like it's Rita's
She know that she want me 'cause it's finders keepers
Got 'em lookin' silly, he can't find her, weeper
Brodie got her stripping
Get behind her, and team her
She gon' hit the floor, give me mind 'til her knees hurt
But I had to kick her to the side, I don't need her

Pop out at your party
Snuck the whole gang in it, huh
Tryna have the fam' eatin' like it's Thanksgiving
Lil' brodie bang Smith &'s and
I just chase millions
Used to wear the same shit, just on my day to day mission, uh
We giving out smoke, you get high from that contact
And we takin' souls like a Death Row contract
Smith & Wesson compact
Hit 'em with that, "Damn, where you find that?"
Head tap, make that nigga blam, where his mind at

Oh, I'm T'd up
I've been taking drugs 'til my heart stop, re'd-up
I might hit the plug, I need all Wock', drink up
She just tryna lick me 'cause my ice like it's Rita's
She know that she want me 'cause it's finders keepers
Got 'em lookin' silly, he can't find her, weeper
Brodie got her stripping
Get behind her, and team her
She gon' hit the floor, give me mind 'til her knees hurt
But I had to kick her to the side, I don't need her

But I had to kick her to the side, I don't need her
