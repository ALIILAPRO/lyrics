		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know
No, she don't know
I'm just another

My heart's in Calico
Underneath the midnight coal
I'm not your lover
I'm just another (shh)

My heart's in Calico
Underneath the midnight coal
Don't dig around my lows
You don't want to be alone

My heart is lost in Calico
Oh, girl, you'll never know
It's just another show
I don't want you all alone

Underneath a love like this
Tell me what you feel in a kiss
I thought you would be okay
You thought I would be the same

Underneath a love like this
Tell you what I feel in a kiss
I thought you would be okay
You thought I would be the same

I've been lost in your gaze
Constant fogs in your way
The blue nights were heavenly
Just you and me
With no certainty
You lit my cigarette up in the thunderstorm
Then you put me out like I'm nothing more
Why'd you think I was so into you
Into you

My heart is lost in Calico
Oh, girl, you'll never know
It's just another show
I don't want you all alone

Underneath a love like this
Tell me what you feel in a kiss
I thought you would be okay
You thought I would be the same

Underneath a love like this
Tell you what I feel in a kiss
I thought you would be okay
You thought I would be the same

You're so addicted to my bad decisions
You locked yourself in this imagination
And as we draw our goodbyes
I'll be patient for your words (for your words)
But you told me you had nothing to say
What do you want me to say?

We hid in the night everyday
You took my heart and snuck away
All I wanted was you to be okay
But you told me you had nothing to say

We hid in the night everyday
You took my heart and snuck away
All I wanted was you to be okay
But you told me you had nothing to say

Underneath a love like this
Tell me what you feel in a kiss
I thought you would be okay
You thought I would be the same

Underneath a love like this
Tell you what I feel in a kiss
I thought you would be okay
You thought I would be the same
