		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you ever just stand there and watch people be happy and ask yourself
Well, where am i in all of this?
Well sometimes i just don't know
Empty room and empty faces
The sun is shining but i'm feeling cold
I've got a feeling but i can't explain it
Feels like there's nothing that could heal my soul
Oh, why am i feeling so blue?
Is everyone faking a smile?
I'm watching life go by before my eyes
I don't understand
Are you listening to me?
I'm talking
I don't get it
Am i invisible?
Can't you see my blood
Dripping on the floor
Yes, i'm writing all these songs
But hey, can't you read between my lines?
I call for help but nobody answers the call, yeah
Answer the call, yeah
Because i'm falling
Oh, why am i feeling so blue?
Is everyone faking a smile?
I'm watching life go by before my eyes
