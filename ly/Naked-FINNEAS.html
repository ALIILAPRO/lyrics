		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This microphone is like the first time I've ever heard the truth in my life
I hate it because I was a coward

La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da da, da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da

You can't make me cry anymore, don't try
If you see me walk by, maybe you should be shy

If I don't feel it, I don't fake it
If I'm being real, it was overrated
If I know the deal, then I won't take it
I can't believe you've seen me naked

La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da da, da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da

Ended back in early eighteen, we didn't want the same thing
I didn't like the taste of cigarettes or your complaining
Then you called all my friends and told 'em all lies
Man, I wish I was surprised

If I don't feel it, I don't fake it
If I'm being real, it was overrated
If I know the deal, then I won't take it
I can't believe you've seen me naked

La-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
La-da-da da, da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da, la-da-da
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da

All that time spent with my therapist
Talking over all your arrogance
Told her how you loved to drink and drive
All that footage, I got rid of it
But I bet somewhere you've hidden it
Just like you to bury me alive

If you're gonna send it, they might save it
And if you're gonna bend it, you might break it
And if you're gonna spend it, then don't waste it
I can't believe you've seen me

If I don't feel it, I don't fake it
And if I'm being real, it was overrated
If I know the deal, then I won't take it
I can't believe you've seen me
