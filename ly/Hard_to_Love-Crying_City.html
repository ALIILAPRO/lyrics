		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the point in any love song
When you're away why does it feel so long

How do I figure you out
When you're not even around
Guess the stress, got my head again
Can you reckon where I am

How to beat the bitter boy
If it means to fill the void
Lovin you is killing me
When disappearing's easy for us all
Hard to love

Nothing left to talk about
When you mind my every doubt
"If" and "might", words I like to play my brain
Think of you all day

How to beat the bitter boy
If it means to fill the void
Tried to mend the thing that only I could see
Guess I'll give in, baby

What's the point in any love song
I'm writing this to say unspoken thoughts about
How to beat the bitter boy
