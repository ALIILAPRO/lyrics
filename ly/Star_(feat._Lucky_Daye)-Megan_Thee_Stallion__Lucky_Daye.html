		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (J. White, I need a beat, I can go off on, ooh)
They don't need eyes to see when you next to me
I'm a superstar (a star, a star, a star)
Ayy, you should wanna take me out and make me smile
Lemme jump in yo' car (yo' car, yo' car, yo' car)

You gotta be a star to jump over the moon
So when you touch on me you're a shootin' star, oh yeah (a star, a star)
You know you got somethin' for the world to see
And there I go, still wonderin' who you are (a star, a star)

Yeah, yeah (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Man, you must be crazy (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy
I'm a star, I'm a star

Ayy, how you get me is how you keep me (yeah)
The pussy get stringy every time you get cheesy (ah)
I used to get flowers and get fucked in the shower (yeah, uh)
My pussy ate for hours (yeah)
Now we gotta argue what's yours and what's ours
These other niggas lined up (lines up)
Before your time's up you better hope nobody help me make my mind up (yeah)
Treat me like you wanna keep me and like you only see me (ayy)
And any bitch after Megan prolly wanna be me (whoa, whoa)

Gotta be a star to jump over the moon
Come fly with me
You're a superstar, oh yeah (a star, a star)
I know you got somethin' for the world to see
And there she goes, the one wonderin' who you are (a star, a star)

Oh (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
You might go crazy (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Wanna be my baby? (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
You must be crazy
I'm a star, I'm a star

Ay-yeah, cash out, pass out
Big Benz, Bentley coupe
Shoppin' spree, swipe cards, I ain't got no room
Flex just to see, or out in Rome
'Cause we got time, dinner in a arena, what's wrong?
He pay attention, I pay that and more
Who you think I'm stackin' these racks for?

You gotta be a star to jump over the moon
So when you touch on me you're a shootin' star, oh yeah (a star, a star)
I know you got somethin' for the world to see
And there I go, still wonderin' who you are (a star, a star)

Yeah, yeah (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy (ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Tryna be my baby? (Ooh)
I'm a superstar, I'm a motherfuckin' superstar
Must be crazy
I'm a star (oh), I'm a star
Oh
