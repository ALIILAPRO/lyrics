		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a lost cause
You wouldn't even recognize me
I'm not the same person I was
Didn't mean to drop jaws
If you see me wait just stop and pause
Better know I'm just awaiting the applause
This life's got me paranoid
Lookin' for something sufficient I know to fill the void
Surrounded by silhouettes
Good and a bad choice
The best things in life are the ones you can't destroy
Do you spend too much time with people who quit?
Don't click?
Who never make the most of it?
Guess you could say I'm sick of it
That's it
I wanna see color in my world not just shit that's dimly lit
Do you spend too much time with people who quit?
Don't click?
Who never make the most of it?
Guess you could say I'm sick of it
That's it
I wanna see color in my world not just shit that's dimly lit
You ever wonder the colors on display?
You'll get them if you simply allow them to paint
But show restraint
You may wanna use the brush to decorate
Staining over the tracks is still covering all the mistakes
Let them speak to you in the only way they can
And they must
If your floods 'bout to give way
Remember it's okay if you have to step away
Sometimes an empty canvas is the only way to breathe again
Do you spend too much time with people who quit?
Don't click?
Who never make the most of it?
Guess you could say I'm sick of it
That's it
I wanna see color in my world not just shit that's dimly lit
Do you spend too much time with people who quit?
Don't click?
Who never make the most of it?
Guess you could say I'm sick of it
That's it
I wanna see color in my world not just shit that's dimly lit
