		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patience, that's all we need
A chemical dream all for you
My head case, is spinning around
Just don't shoot it down like you do

So bar the front door and don't let it in
I am the poster child, a sucker for original sin
I'm such a bore, wish I could wind my neck in
I don't deserve it but I savor every touch of your skin

These fucking problems keep following me
Maybe I'm the problem, maybe it's me
Find me at the bottom because that's where I'll be
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle

Free will is gathering dust, we do what we must
To be good
Slow down you're moving too fast
The past is the past, I'd change if I could

These fucking problems keep following me
Maybe I'm the problem, maybe it's me
Find me at the bottom because that's where I'll be
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle

So bar the front door and don't let it in
I am the poster child a sucker for original sin
I'm such a bore, wish I could wind my neck in
I don't deserve it but I savor every touch of your skin

These fucking problems keep following me
Maybe I'm the problem

These fucking problems keep following me
Maybe I'm the problem, maybe it's me
Find me at the bottom because that's where I'll be
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle
Yea-yeah, yeah
No one's invincible
I'm stuck in the middle
