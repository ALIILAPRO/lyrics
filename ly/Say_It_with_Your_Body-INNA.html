		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you don't have to move your lips
Baby you, say it with your body
We, we don't have to talk all that
And I knew the second that I saw you

Ever felt like this before?
They don't make it like you no more
Come alive like an animal ooh ooh ooh ooh

Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Shut up, say it with you body

You tell me that I'm all you want
That you knew the second that you saw me
You, you make me want to move my hips
Like you do, I want you to control me

Ever felt like this before?
They don't make it like you no more
Come alive like an animal ooh ooh ooh ooh

Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Shut up, say it with you body

Say it with your body say it with your body

Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Say it with you body
Do do don't, do do don't talk
Shut up, say it with you body
