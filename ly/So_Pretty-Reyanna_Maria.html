		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so shy
Yeah, yeah (Kato on the track b-)

I'm so pretty and he like that (yeah, he do)
When he beat it up
He deep inside that kitty cat

Kitty Kat, losing focus like it's Fetty Wap
Now where he at?
'Cause I'm tryna make a movie stat

I know he don't like it when I talk back
Run my mouth like Forrest Gump
But I like it when he talk back
Make my pussy throb
When he shut me up
Beat it up then beat it up
Neighbors yelling while we pipe it up

Kitty purr
Make that kitty purr
Make it purr
Make that kitty purr

He ain't never met a woman like me
Do a split up on the dick and he might call me wifey
Knock the pussy out cold
Bring it back it's round three
I got the best kitty
You ain't gotta hide me

I need a PHD
That's a pretty huge dick
With the straps on the bed so you get a good grip
Cat emoji in the text so you know what's coming next
And you better come correct
'Cause you fucking with the best
(Keep it going)

Kitty purr
Make that kitty purr (yeah he do)
Make it purr
Make that kitty purr

I'm so pretty and he like that
Pretty and he like that

I'm so pretty and he like that
Pretty and he like that

Kitty purr
Make that kitty purr (yeah he do)
Make it purr
Make that kitty purr
