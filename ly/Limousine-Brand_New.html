		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, its your ride
Get your petals out lay them in the isle
Pretend
Your garden grows its your day to wed
We found your man
He's drinking up he's all American
And he'll drive
He's volunteering a grace to end your life
You tidy up,
Its sad to hope
Leave your shell to us
You explode ,
You firefly and tiny boat with hope
Feather old ,
The world tilts back
And pours and pours and so
You Satellite
You tidal wave
You're a big surprise
And I
One more night
To be your mother

They signal to interrupt
They make frequency not strong enough to remain
My hand and smile
We will miss you
But in time you'll get settled
We will write (breathe in)
So breathe
Yea, you were right about me
Can I get myself out from underneath
This guilt that will crush me
And in the choir
I saw our sad messiah
He was bored and tired of my laments
Said I'd die for you one time but never again
(Never again )

Well I love you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Well I love you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

One I love you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Two I love you so much

But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Three loved you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Four I love you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Five love you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Six I love you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Seven loved you so much
But do me a favor baby don't reply
Because I can dish it out
But I can't take it

Seven loved you so much (never have to be down to earth)
But do me a favor baby don't reply (never have to live together on this piece of dirt)
Because I can dish it out (never have to find my baby in the crowd)
But I can't take it (Well I should be laughing right now)

Seven loved you so much (never have to be down to earth)
But do me a favor baby don't reply (never have to live together on this piece of dirt)
Because I can dish it out (never have to find my baby in the crowd)
But I can't take it (Well I should be laughing right now)

Seven loved you so much (never have to be down to earth)
But do me a favor baby don't reply (never have to live together on this piece of dirt)
Because I can dish it out (never have to find my baby in the crowd)
But I can't take it (Well I should be laughing right now)
