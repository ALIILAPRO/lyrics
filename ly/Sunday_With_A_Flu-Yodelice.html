		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Closed my door, forgot my key
Missed my bus in the pouring rain
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

Burnt my toast and lost your number
Cut my finger, spilled my beer
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

I put your stockings in my purple boots
What if I don't get over you?

Had a chat and left my hat
Ate my dog and walked my cat
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

I put your stockings in my purple boots
What if I don't get over you?

I put your stockings in my purple boots
What if I don't get over you?

Called a cabbage threw the garbage
Asked for help and got some kelp
It's been the usual Sunday with a flu
And I just can't get over you

I put your stockings in my purple boots
What if I don't get over you?
