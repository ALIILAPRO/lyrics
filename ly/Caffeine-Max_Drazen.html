		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe this time it's over
You don't wanna change, and I don't either
It's no good when you're looking for reasons to stay
You think I'm stupid
Hanging out and smoking
While you go out, and work a nine-to-five every day, mmm

But every time we take a break
And you say you needed some space
I say goodbye, you hate the taste, and call me in the morning

I guess I'll just come over
I'm not even sober and I haven't ate a thing, mmm
I'm half sleep
The coffee got colder
While driving over so I've had no caffeine, mmm

Now I, now I
I couldn't think it over 'cause I've had no caffeine

I've got excuses
'Cause my room's a mess
My car's been dispossessed
Had no time to think it through 
A loser
Always been second best
I wear it on my chest
While you say "thank you, next"

But every time we take a break
Those other things take up the space
And I can't find the time to think, so call me in the morning

I guess I'll just come over
I'm not even sober and I haven't ate a thing, mmm
I'm half sleep
The coffee got colder
While driving over, so, I've had no caffeine, mmm

Now I, now I
I couldn't think it over 'cause I've had no caffeine
Now I, now I
I couldn't think it over 'cause I've had no caffeine
