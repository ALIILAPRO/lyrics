		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I, when I was younger
I, I, should have known better
And I can't feel no remorse
And you don't feel nothing back

I, I, got a new girlfriend
She feels like he's on top
And I don't feel no remorse
And you can't see past my blinders

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love

I, I, got a little paycheck
You got big plans and you gotta move
And I don't feel nothing at all
And you can't feel nothing small

Honey, I love you, that's all she wrote

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind girl like a drug
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help a fool who falls in love
