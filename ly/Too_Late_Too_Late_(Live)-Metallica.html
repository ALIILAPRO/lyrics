		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see that nothin's changed
Insist on playing games
Some waste of time you are
And you're so popular
Well this is it you bitch
I've got to make my switch
I'm just another john
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
No! Too late, too late

I thought you was for real
But you're a rip-off deal
Don't give me all that crap
I just escaped your trap
I think you see the joke
But you're just chasin' smoke
You ain't another one
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Hello, too late, too late
Oh!

Get on it!

Misunderstanding me
The way you feel so free
I'm gonna jump the gun
Oh I'm gonna hit an' run
Your credibility
Don't cut no ice with me
Another privilege gone
I know what's goin' on

Your move
What do I have to lose?
Stalemate
Oh oh, too late, too late
Oh, too late, too late
