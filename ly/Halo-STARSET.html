		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see you running, running
Every night from the same darkness
It's coming, coming
But you are not alone
If you just say the word
I'll be there by your side
You make me more
You make me superhuman
And if you need me to
I will save you

Send out the signal
And I'll fly low
If it means the death of me
I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

When your backed against the wall
I could be the one
Who's always there to break your fall
You are not alone
You're the Sun, you're the day
The light that guides me through
Never run, run away
I will save you

Send out the signal
And I'll fly low
If it means the death of me
I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

Send out the signal
And I'll fly low
If it means the death of me
I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo

I won't let go
I won't let go
I won't let go
And if I'm lost in the world's shadows
I'll use the light that comes to me
From your halo
Halo
Your halo
