		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should I offer up my hand
And save a wish for once
For all of us
And should I offer up my hand
And lay the guilt on myself
So it's easier to not stay 
To not stay

[Chorus:]
Because I found you in your corner
I pulled you out of the clouds
You left in such a hurry
Your face is lost in the crowd

Should I open up my eye's or just ignore who you are
And what you could have been
And should I open up my eye's and make believe you will change
So it's easier to not stay, to not stay

[Chorus]

Your face is lost in the crowd
Your face is lost in the crowd
