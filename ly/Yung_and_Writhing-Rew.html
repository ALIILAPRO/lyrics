		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ten whole years
Nihilistic
They say meaning comes from what you care about
I guess it's lost on me
I'm just a little
Tired of my life
Talk to me
Tell me I am fine
I'm just a little
Tired of my life
Talk to me
Tell me I am fine
Suddenly it's late
I realize what I've done
Staring at my hands
Worshipping myself
Now it's time to hate
Myself to little pieces
Fuck do I care
Another night I'll spend
Wallowing alone
Wallowing alone
It's all come down
I'm just a little
Tired of my life
Talk to me
Tell me I am fine
I'm just a little
Tired of my life
Talk to me
Tell me I am fine
I'm just a little
Tired of my life
Talk to me
Tell me I am fine
I'm just a little
Tired of my life
Talk to me
Tell me I am fine
