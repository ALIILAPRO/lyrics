		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [I will give you thanks with all my heart; I will sing your praise before the heavenly beings. I will bow down toward your holy temple and give thanks to your name for your constant love and truth. You have exalted your name and your promise above everything else. On the day I called, you answered me; you increased strength within me.]

He’s been good to me
He’s been so good to me
So good (x2)

So glad that the Lord has set me free
His grace
Have mercy!
Carry me!
He’s been good to me
He’s been so good to me
So good (x2)
