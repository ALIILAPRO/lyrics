		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You control my fire
Baby, you have got it all
You've got my body and my spirit
Winter, spring, summer or fall
You've got me writhing to your rhythm
Even when I'm feeling small
Oh, yeah
You got me rockin' to your rhythm
And you've got me feeling tall

I believe in love again
I believe in love again
Oh, oh-oh, oh
I believe in love again
I believe
I believe in love again
I believe in love again

Tonight
You know that
You're gonna find
What you're looking for
You and I
To feel you're in a dancefloor
Baby, please
C'mon

When I'm uninspired
And I'm down and feeling low
You take me higher, there's no limit
To the places I can go
And when I dive into your river
Where the crystal waters flow
Oh, yeah
That is the moment I'm delivered
Baby, never let me go
Don't let me go

I believe in love again
I believe in love again
Oh, oh-oh, oh
I believe in love again
I believe
I believe in love again
I believe in love again
I believe in
I believe in love again
I believe
I believe in love again
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I believe in love again
I believe
I believe in love again
