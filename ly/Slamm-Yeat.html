		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I-I-I
I-I-I

Slam, I got red bottom
Slam, I got red bottom (I-I-I'm working on dying)
Slam, I be slidin' in a coupe (BNYX)
Slam, I don't care 'bout 'em
Slam, Balenci' on my feet
Slam, just went slammed on 'em
Slam, just slam on 'em
Slam, just slam on 'em

You a bitch and you slow, heard you flamboyant
I got money head to toe, I got diamond Rollie
Diamond Rollie, yeah, roly poly (I-I-I)
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' body got 'em all Corona (I-I-I)
Stack down on these pussies and I'm rich, got 'em sick, Corona
Pull up in that motherfuckin' Tonka, this is no Toyota
Sippin' on that motherfuckin' mud, this green is fuckin' Yoda

I got bucks and don't give fucks and I got big money
Back in the day, I was pill poppin', real junkie
I just jumped up on the game and did a big dunkin'
All my money got obese, my money just got chunky (I-I-I)
Y'all be callin' the police, bitch, y'all not good for nothin' (Yeah, yeah, I-I-I)
My cult just like my fuckin' family
If I jump up off this bridge, my fuckin' fans are jumpin' off with me (yeah, my cult, yeah)
Did you fuckin' hear me?
All the fuckin' money in the world, still not enough for us
I'm slow up on these bands, I'm a fuckin' tortoise
You don't really live this life, you a fuckin' tourist
I left my drink in Sprite and now I'm pouring 4s (yeah)
Pulled up in that Porsche, seven hundred horses
Y'all be doin' anything, yeah, with the whores
Bitch, I'm headin' up, I go and slam, of course (I-I-I)

Slam, I got red bottom
Slam, I got red bottom (I-I-I'm working on dying)
Slam, I be slidin' in a coupe (BNYX)
Slam, I don't care 'bout 'em
Slam, Balenci' on my feet
Slam, just went slammed on 'em
Slam, just slam on 'em
Slam, just slam on 'em

You a bitch and you slow, heard you flamboyant
I got money head to toe, I got diamond Rollie
Diamond Rollie, yeah, roly poly (I-I-I)
Diamonds on my motherfuckin' body got 'em all Corona (I-I-I)
Stack down on these pussies and I'm rich, got 'em sick, Corona
Pull up in that motherfuckin' Tonka, this is no Toyota
Sippin' on that motherfuckin' mud, this green is fuckin' Yoda
