		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my mind
Foreign lands
Followed lines
On my hands
Tasted earth
Touched the skies
Swam the pools
Of my eyes
People talked
In their fear
Rumours always
Whispered here
Where and why
From what shore
Who was I
Searching for

You can call me worshipper
You can call me follower
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover
You can call it foolish
A kind of madness
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover

Pushed and pulled
Through these worlds
Winding roads
I crossed and curled
Pain and love
Hope and fear
In between
All unclear
Drunk on time
Spin my thoughts
States of mind
Turning doors
Ask me now
Who I am
Turn your back
Or take my hand

You can call me worshipper
You can call me follower
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover
You can call it foolish
A kind of madness
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover

There's a fire calling me
Burning me
Leading me
Into ecstasy
There's a fire calling me
Burning me
Leading me
Into ecstasy

You can call me worshipper
You can call me follower
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover
You can call it foolish
A kind of madness
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover

You can call me worshipper
You can call me follower
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover
You can call it foolish
A kind of madness
But I'm just a wanderer
In search of my lover
