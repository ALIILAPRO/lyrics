		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you

Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dreams to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do?

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me

Why are you at my side?
How can I be, any use to you now?
Give me a chance, and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed

Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess, what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me
You must love me
You must love me
