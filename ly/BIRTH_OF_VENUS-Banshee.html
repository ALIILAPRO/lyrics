		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have met my peace between the moon and where I stand
I have found catharsis in every wave that crashes on the cliffs and I

Your secrets were never safe with me
When I scream the sky is listening

Your secrets were never safe with me
When I scream the sea is listening

See what happens when you try to silence me 

I have met my peace between the moon and where I stand
I have found catharsis in every wave that crashes on the cliffs 
and I learned how to breathe underwater while my lungs begged me for air 
I fought my way to the surface and carried myself to land

Your secrets were never safe with me
When I scream the sky is listening

Your secrets were never safe with me
When I scream the sea is listening

See what happens when you try to silence me 

I have met my peace between the moon and where I stand
I have found catharsis in every wave that crashes on the cliffs 
and I learned how to breathe underwater while my lungs begged me for air 
I fought my way to the surface and carried myself to land

See what happens when you try to silence me 
Just see what happens when you try to silence me 

See what happens when you try to silence me 
Just see what happens when you try to silence me
