		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin'
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken

Somebody else
I think you're out there with someone else
Somebody else
I think you might be with someone else

I'm done
I left all the lights on
I been sleepin' with no clothes on
You never came home
Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin' 
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken
You've been dancin' with somebody
On the streets with somebody
Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin' here

Nobody else
You say there's no one but I can tell
All by myself
Why can't you meet me and nothin' else?

I
I left all the lights on, sleepin' with no clothes on
Baby, I
Been staring at a blank phone
You never came home

Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin' 
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken
You've been dancin' with somebody
On the streets with somebody
Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin' 

Two steppin' with two girls on a Tuesday
Who's paid, that's me, oh, yeah
I'm a flirt, you alert, worst curve
When the birds chirp, chirp on my nerves, oh, yeah
Don't be sad, look alive Lykke
Damn right, she gon' dance on my damn Dickies
I mean, when's the last time you danced on me?
Shit, when's the last time you even loved?
'Cause, see, you look like a dummy
You think it's dark, but it's sunny
I feel it all in my tummy
You think it's sweet like a sundae
I'm never bummy or scummy
You're paranoid like a bunny
You're dead to me
You the drug, I'm the junkie
Pretty penny, so I don't know where to start
Tag along, I'm a vagabond to your heart
I mean what can I say?
I'll drive to you, like

Two nights in a row, where'd you go?
I've been smokin'
Two nights in a row, now I know that it's broken
