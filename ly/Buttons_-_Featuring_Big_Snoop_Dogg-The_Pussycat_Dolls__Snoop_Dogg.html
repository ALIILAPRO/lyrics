		  What it do baby boo?

Yeah, lil' mama, you lookin' good
I see you wanna play wit a player from the hood
Come holla at me, you got it like that
Big Snoop Dogg with the lead Pussycat
I show you how it go down, yeah, I wanna throw down
Me and you one-on-one, treat it like a showdown
You look at me and I look at you
I'm reachin' for your shirt, whatchu want me to do?

I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing

Typical, hardly the type I fall for
I like when the physical
Don't leave me asking for more
I'm a sexy mama (mama)
Who knows just how to get what I wanna (wanna)
What I wanna do is spring this on you (on you)
Back up all of the things that I told you (told you)
You been saying all the right things all night along
But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

Baby, can't you see?
How these clothes are fitting on me
And the heat coming from this beat
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know

I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing

You say, you're a big boy but I can't agree
'Cause the love you said you had ain't been put on me
I wonder if I'm just too much for you
Wonder if my kiss don't make you just
Wonder, what I got next for you
What you wanna do? (Do)
Take the chance to recognize that this could be yours
I can see, just like most guys that your game don't please

Baby, can't you see?
How these clothes are fitting on me
And the heat coming from this beat
I'm about to blow, I don't think you know

I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing

Now you can get what you want but I need what I need
Now let me tell you what's crackalackin' 'fore I proceed
I'mma show you where to put it at
Pcd on me, yeah, I thought I saw a pussycat
Now roll with the big dog, all 6 of y'all on me, now tell me how it feel, babydoll
Ashley, Nicole, Carmit, Jessica, Kimberley, Melody, you tellin' me?

Loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Baby won't you loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Come on baby, loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe
Baby won't you loosen up my buttons, babe
Loosen up my buttons, babe

I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you to loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
I'm telling you loosen up my buttons, babe (uh-huh)
But you keep fronting, uh
Saying what you gon' to do to me (uh-huh)
But I ain't seen nothing
