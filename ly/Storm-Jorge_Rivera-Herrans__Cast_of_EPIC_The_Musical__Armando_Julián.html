		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These waves and tides
Have grown in strength and size
Is it nature, or divine
Or a blessing in disguise?
Our home's in sight
This storm's our final fight
There's no time to die, comrades

Brace for a storm storm
The likes of which we've never seen before
Brace for a storm storm
With home so close
We must keep pushing forward
Full speed ahead head towards the island but
Avoid the crashing waves
Tread where the tide is flat and
Then you will be savеd

Captain, we will capsize with thesе waves
Our fleet will fail

Have them follow my ship
I'll ensure that we prevail

Storm

Storm

We're taking too much damage to survive

We'll beat this storm

Storm

At this rate, we won't make it out alive

Captain, look
