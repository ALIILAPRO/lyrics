		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish that I was someone you need now
Wanna know how you'll be happy again
I'm not someone who always speaks out
Now I see our memories through the rain

Night and day
I still wanna dance in your parade
But you change your lane
I know you now

You're lost in your own crowd, it's time to figure out
We sit in silence, I wish you'd say it loud
Are you in or are you out? It's time to tell me now
I can't keep hiding, I just wanna be found

It's time for you to let me go
Please don't ever let me know
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical

I know that I was someone you needed
Feel defeated by who you became
I'm done with living just for weekend
I don't mean it when I say, "I'm okay"

Night and day
I still wanna dance in your parade
But you change your lane
And I know you now

You're lost in your own crowd, it's time to figure out
We sit in silence, I wish you'd say it loud
Are you in or are you out? It's time to tell me now
I can't keep hiding, I just wanna be found

It's time for you to let me go
Please don't ever let me know
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical
You're cynical
So cynical

It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical
So cynical
So cynical

It's time for you to let me go
Please don't ever let me know
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical
