		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up starin' at this, starin' at this empty room
Looked at thousand different pictures that your mother took of you
You see I had this crazy dream last night, this man he talked to me
He told me everything that's good and bad about my history

But he said that you are, you are the future
He said that you are, you are the future
And the future looks good
The future looks good

Oh, call me any time that every time you're losin' it
And tell me anyone and everyone who makes you feel like shit
Because you know anybody, everybody else can lie
But honey I won't see you with a, see you with a broken set of eyes

I swear that you are, you are the future
I swear that you are, you are the future
And the future looks good
Oh, yeah
The future looks good
Oh, yeah

The future looks good
Oh, yeah
The future looks good
Oh, yeah

You, you, you
You, you, you

Woke up starin' at this, starin' at this empty room
Looked at thousand different pictures that your mother took of you
