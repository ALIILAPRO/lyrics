		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I wanna do is see you turn into a giant woman
A giant woman
All I wanna be is someone who gets to see a giant woman

All I wanna do is help you turn into a giant woman
A giant woman
All I wanna be is someone who gets to see a giant woman

Oh, I know it'll be great and I just can't wait
To see the person you are together
If you give it a chance you can do a huge dance
Because you are a giant woman

You might even like being together
And if you don't it won't be forever
But if it were me
I'd really wanna be a giant woman
A giant woman
All I wanna do is see you turn into a giant woman
