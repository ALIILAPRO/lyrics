		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm falling down
Making no sound
Now that I'm gone
Is it all over? (is it all over)
We'll meet again
Don't wake up
Let go (let go)
Baby don't lust away
You know I'm right (you know I'm right)
Maybe we can both make up
And write our wrongs (write our wrongs)
I don't care for wasted time
I can't deny (can't deny)
Maybe you care to love?

You left the keys on the table
You're playing games like I'm the devil
These sort of things they never settle

You left the keys on the table
(Left the keys on the table)
(Left the keys on the table)
(Left the keys)
You're playing games like I'm the devil
These sort of things they never settle
You left the keys on the table

We're playing with fire
These words hitting harder
And I can't feel higher
I'm drowning right now
I'm done feeling hollow
I'm fading away
I'm hiding the smile
I'm sinking into the shallow

Baby don't lust away
You know I'm right
Maybe we can both make up
And write our wrongs
I don't care for wasted time
I can't deny
Maybe you care to love

You left the keys on the table
You're playing games like I'm the devil
These sort of things they never settle

You left the keys on the table
(Left the keys on the table)
(Left the keys on the table)
(Left the keys)
You're playing games like I'm the devil
These sort of things they never settle
You left the keys on the table
