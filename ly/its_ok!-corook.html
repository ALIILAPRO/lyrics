		<p>
		  Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days
Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird

I should get up outta bed 
I should probably drink some water
I should, I should, I should
But I know that I'm not gonna
Do the things statistically that make me feel better
Get outside and out my mind, I know I'll feel better
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling through the videos and pictures
Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling like my eyes are drinking liquor
Feeling overstimulated maybe it's a sign
If I'm here any longer I'll get tan lines from the brightness

Nothing's really wrong yet
Nothing's really wrong yet
Nothing's really wrong

Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days
Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days
You don't have to try to please nobody
You just gotta try to please your own body
Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Okay, okay, okay, I got banana socks on like could I get any cuter?
Grab a cup of tea and I walk to the computer
Oh, you're fucking kidding me another school shooter?
Suddenly I'm startled by the chances of my future
A parade or a concert or a theatre or a school
Can't prove I'm any safer in the comfort of my room
But somewhere in Malaysia there's a plane that disappeared
And no one talks about it and I think that's pretty weird so
What if it was me?
My chances aren't that far
What if the plane I take next week ends up where they are?
This isn't making any sense and now I'm kinda spiraling
Take a deep breathe and keep reminding

Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days
Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days
You don't have to try to please nobody
You just gotta try to please your own body
Hey, hey, it's okay
Everybody feels kinda weird some days

Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Nothing's really wrong yet
Nothing's really wrong yet
Nothing's really wrong (okay, nothing's wrong)
Wrong yet
Nothing's really wrong yet (there's nothing wrong)
Nothing's really wrong yet
Nothing's really wrong (I said, nothing)
