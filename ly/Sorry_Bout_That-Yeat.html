		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Damn, Trgc made that?) Yeah
She eat me up like it's Beni-bachi
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that

A-T-E, she eat me up (sorry 'bout that)
ATV what she ridin' on
Bend the bitch over in Calabasas (yeah)
Tryna be slow now
Bitch, I'ma sip on the Wock' or the Tris (yeah)
Yeah, she said she feel it now, I don't even feel it though
Bitch, I be high on these drugs every day of my life
I don't know at all if I should quit or not
How the fuck did I choose Xanny? This bad for me
But everything goin' up, sad about life
Bitch, I just got off the phone with my jeweler
That brand new Cuban link comin' in with diamonds
Yeah, and they just told me, if I bought the Tesla
I'm helpin' the climate so I'm finna pop a hundred
I'm on the Perc' so I call up my bae like, "What's up with ya?"
She said, "Can I pull up and lay up with ya?"
She said, "I wanna watch a movie if you get the picture" (ha)
She said she need a big ol' booty, called up Bob the Builder (ha)
Black and white diamonds, I'm colorblind
They told me that I murder every beat like Columbine

Sorry 'bout that

Oh, I had to switch the side
All my diamonds flawless and big, look at the size
All your shit is fake, that shit SI's (yeah)
I'm sorry for you, kid, that's just your life (yeah)
The amount of drugs I did today would make you cry
Yeah, I'm finna tell y'all everything, I don't be shy
I'm 'bout to buy a wedding ring for X tonight
Yeah, went and bought the Cayenne just so I could slide
Can you stop the cryin'? It's all a lie (yeah)
She wanna lick my privates all night (let's go)
Just tell me, you gotta tell me the truth 'bout it, all it, yeah
I had to go cut ties with them so I can go ballin'
I had the Issey Miyake jeans with the Arcteryx jacket
Yeah, and my lil' thot say that she addicted to me like some crackhead
Yeah, she pull up, I'm breakin' her backy
These kids, they goofy, they wacky
I'm not a kid, I'm a man like Pacqui
I already made a whole mil' off the rappin'
I used to vacuum seal the Za' and wrap it
Now all I think 'bout is the racks
Now I don't wanna hear about it if it ain't facts
She finna pull up, eat it like it's Beni-bachi
(Pull up, eat it like it's Beni-bachi)
(Damn, TRGC made that?)
She eat me up like it's Beni-bachi

A-T-E, she eat me up (yeah)
ATV, way she ridin' on
Bend the bitch over in Calabasas (yeah)
Tryna be slow now
Bitch, I'ma sip on the Wock' or the Tris (yeah)
Yeah, she said she feel it now, I don't even feel it though
Bitch, I be high on these drugs every day of my life
I don't know at all if I should quit or not
How the fuck did I choose Xanny? This bad for me
But everything goin' up, sad about life
And I just got off the phone with my jeweler
That brand new Cuban link comin' in with diamonds
Yeah, and they just told me, if I bought the Tesla
I'm helpin' the climate so I'm finna pop a hundred
I'm on the Perc' so I call up my bae like, "What's up with ya?"
She said, "Can I pull up and lay up with ya?"
She said, "I wanna watch a movie if you get the picture" (ha)
She said she need a big ol' booty, called up Bob the Builder (ha)
Black and white diamonds, I'm colorblind
They told me that I murder every beat like Columbine

Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
Sorry 'bout that
