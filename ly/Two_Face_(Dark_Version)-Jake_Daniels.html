		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Boo 
Lately I've been talking with a ghost 
He tells me all the places I should go
He makes me paint my face so that I know
That I'm not the only the person in my soul
He tells me that a monster lives inside
And when It gets too angry I should hide
Cause if I were to try and pick a fight
I would barely stand a chance and I'd die

Two face call me Harvey
Never know when it could change
Tried to talk to my reflection but he said he wants my name

Wake up the beast
Bury the bones
Enjoy the feast
Take all control
When I give you my soul

Devils on my shoulder
Got an aching down my spine
Feel like chains are getting heavy
But I don't know which are mine
Can you save me
Am I lost
Is it Time to take me
From all of these thoughts

Wake up the beast
Bury the bones
Enjoy the feast
Take all control
When I give you my soul

Bury the bones
Enjoy the feast
Take all control

Wake up the beast
Bury the Bones
Enjoy the feast
Take all control
When I give you my soul
