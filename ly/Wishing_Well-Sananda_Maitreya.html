		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kissing like a bandit, stealing time, underneath a sycamore tree
Cupid, by the hour, sends Valentines to my sweet lover and me
Slowly, but surely your appetite is more than I knew
Sweetly, softly, I'm falling in love with you

Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile tears sing

Make it funky now, boys

Hugging like a monkey see, monkey do, right beside a riverboat gambler
Erotic images float through my head, say I wanna be your midnight rambler
Quickly, but quickly the blood races through me veins
Quickly, loudly I wanna hear those sugar bells ring

Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears
Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile tears, get up now

On the beat now, uh
Come on now

Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of butterfly tears, come on
Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell
A wishing well of crocodile tears, uh

(Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell)
Hey-hey
I feel like going on, I feel like going on
(Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell)
Come on, come on
Erotic images float through my head
Your midnight rider, my baby
(Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell)
Dig it
For you, anywhere
Don't know, I don't care
(Wish me, love, a wishing well, to kiss and tell)
But all I know is
