		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow me
Follow me now
Once more into the breach
Can you see?
Can you see how this is the way to destiny?

Am I alive?
Am I pretending?
You said I could fly
So go on then
Fill my eyes with fire
I'm a sleeper awakened
I set my sails with desire
And drift to the edge where the fate ends
And fade in

Follow me
Follow me now
Once more into the breach
Can you see?
Can you see how this is the way to destiny?

Crystallized
Under the weight of the nothingness
Calcified
By the end
I am losing hope
We are wonder-made
But we wander the wilderness in violence
I just want to be home with the light again
Take me home

Follow me
Follow me now
Once more into the breach
Can you see?
Can you see how this is the way to destiny?

Follow me
Follow me now
Once more into the breach
Can you see?
Can you see how this is the way to destiny?

Follow me
Follow me now
Once more into the breach
Can you see?
Can you see how this is the way to destiny?

Follow me
Follow me now
Once more into the breach
Can you see?
Can you see how this is the way to destiny?
