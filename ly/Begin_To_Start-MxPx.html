		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say to me "Don't be hangin' on.
If you won't go on, Do I want to?"
I'll pray to see I'll pray to know
Provide for me won't let it go.
Life confuses me (life confuses me) can't find my way
Out of here I think I'd rather stay. (Rather stay)
I think I'd rather stay.
When do I begin to start?
Begin to let you into my heart?
Why so sad when I look at you
'Cause I'm away. I know I feel it too.
Life confuses me (life confuses me) can't find my way
Out of here I think I'd rather stay. (Rather stay)
I think I'd rather stay.
When do I begin to start?
Begin to let you into my heart?
They say to me "Don't be hangin' on.
If you won't go on, Do I want to?"
Life confuses me (life confuses me) I can't find my way
Out of here I think I'd rather stay. (Rather stay)
I think I'd rather stay.
Life confuses me (life confuses me) I can't find my way
Out of here I think I'd rather stay. (Rather stay)
I think I'd rather stay.
