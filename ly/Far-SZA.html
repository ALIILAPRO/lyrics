		  How do I deal with rejection?
I'm dealing with a lot of rejection right now
It makes me feel very small
Well, that's great, if nobody wants you, you're free

Tried to wash all of my shit away
Tried to wash all my emotions
Need a few brews, need a palm tree
I be drinkin' in private, don't call me to party though
Fuck on your nigga for cardio
Too good, he really fell in love right away
I put my feelings on layaway (I'm)

Done being used, done playing stupid
Done faking cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I don't want it)
Done being screwed
Done feeling clueless
That's how you do (do me)
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)

Far
Far, like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far

Lately, I feel less cool as before
(Nobody under my garter belt)
(Nobody out here to tell me I'm special)
Made you check your bullshit at the door
(Got an appetite, hungry to feed my ego, nobody 'round me to be my hero)
Always on my mind, trust is hard to find
Everything reminds me of us
I just want my sanity back
Better than being your enemy
(Better than letting go, scared of that, oh)

Done being used, done playing stupid
Done being cool
(I don't want none of that shit, I ain't goin')
Done getting screwed
Done playing clueless
That's how you do (do me)
(I don't want none of that shit, got me runnin' so)

Far
Far, like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far

I remember when you had me upside down
Stress me out and turn me out, it's all bad now
I remember when I wasn't so burnt out
I'd rather that than be your enemy, ready to let it go
Draggin' me

Far
Far, like I don't recognize me
Far, far 'cause I let you define me
I'm far, far 'cause I can't trust nobody
Far, stay far, so far
