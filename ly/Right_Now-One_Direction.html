		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lights go down, and
The night is calling to me, yeah
I hear voices
Singing songs in the street and I know
That we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
That I won't be on my own, yeah

I love this feeling that right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me

Late night spaces
With all our friends, you and me, yeah
Love these faces
Just like how it used to be
And we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know,
I won't be on my own, on my own

I'm feeling like right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me

And I could do this forever
Whoa, whoa
And let's go crazy together
Whoa, whoa

Lights go down and
I hear you calling to me, yeah

Right now
I wish you were here with me
'Cause right now
Everything is new to me
You know I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now
I wish you were here with me
