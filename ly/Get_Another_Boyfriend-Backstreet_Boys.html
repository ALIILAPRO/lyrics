		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Backstreet
Check it uh
Hey

Let's talk about one, baby
You gotta hear me out
Did you really think I'd be the last to know
What it's all about

Let's talk about you
You say 
He's the essence of your life
But he'll eat you up from inside slow
And then he doesn't want to know

I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside
And then he doesn't want to know

[Chorus]
Listen I mean it
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)
To become your number one
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses
That turn you on
I've seen it before (dont take!)
Anymore, free too
You're through for sure
Just go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life
Stop acting like you've given up

Listen I mean it (I mean it)
There's nothin' that he's worthy of
He's just another player (player)
Playing in the name of love
I've seen enough
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)
Get another boyfriend

All right 
Yeah
Get another boyfriend
Stop
Hey

Hear me out
You must know (you must know)
What it's all about (baby)
That he's just a player in love (love)
This must come to an end
Get another boyfriend

[Chorus: x2]
