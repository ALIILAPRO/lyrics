		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not sure what I was doin' before ya
I quit tryin' to figure it out
Nothin' like having someone for ya
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the take down
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feeling I can't ignore

I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home, to the road, I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable, our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah

Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feeling I can't ignore

I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't want to be in any other place
From my home, to the road, I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable, our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeah
