		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  in the land of plenty, we don't know what the word no means
give it to me, give me all the things I want
make it new and shiny, and make them watch me, make them watch me
turn the power on and wait for light

all the pleasures that you paid for
all the skipped turns that you saved for
all the nights you fell asleep without your gun
a coronation, a beheading
from the funeral to the wedding
do you think they care where the crown goes?

show the crowd you're happy, like a movie, like a movie
what's your story, what's the refund policy?
we want violence, we want blood
we want superhero love, we want all the answers you promised us
we want laughter, we want pain, everyone will know our name
did you know that no two missteps are the same?
