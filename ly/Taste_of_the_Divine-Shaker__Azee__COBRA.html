		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Way she look
Eyes are locked
All or nothing
I'm ready to give it all up
All or nothing
I'll never run out of luck
I'm getting ready to knock
I got a taste of the feeling, now I want it more
Devil knocking on my door
Wanna put you on the floor
I know it's kind of wrong
I'm feeling torn
It's turning me on
Fell in love with the taste
Fell in love with the way
You put it all on me
So wherever you go, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow you tonight
I thought you should know I'm ready, I'm ready
To leave it all behind
Meet me on the low, I'll show you, I'll show you
A taste of the divine
I'm gonna show you that you're all mine
I'll get you screaming my name all night
Oh all night
It's all an act
Keeping my heart at a distance
Never showing them enough
I'm playing the part of a villain
When all I want is to be loved
All I want is to be touched
Let me show you how ready I am to let all of you in
Pull me in by the waist now
Make me forget how to breathe
Reaching under my lace now
Biting engraving your place
It's too late to save me from Grace
I need to know how you taste
Give it all to me
So wherever you go, I'll follow, I'll follow
I'll follow you tonight
I thought you should know I'm ready, I'm ready
To leave it all behind
Meet me on the low, I'll show you, I'll show you
A taste of the divine
I'm gonna show you that you're all mine
I'll get you screaming my name all night
Oh all night
