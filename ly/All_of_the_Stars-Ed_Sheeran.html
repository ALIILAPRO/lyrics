		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side as the skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder, "Do you see them too?"

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing, "Chasing Cars", and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand, back through lamp-lit streets I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to

So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And, oh
And you know
And, oh

I can see the stars from America
