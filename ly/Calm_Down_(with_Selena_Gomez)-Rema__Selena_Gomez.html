(Oh, no)
Another banger

Baby, calm down, calm down

For lockdown, oh, lockdown

You got me like whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, hmm

I see this fine girl, for my party, she wear yellow
Every other girl they dey do too much, but this girl mellow
Naim I dey find situation I go use take tell am hello
Finally, I find way to talk to the girl but she no wan' follow

Who you come dey form for? (Uhum)
Why you no wan' conform? (Uhum)
Then I start to feel her bum-bum, whoa (uhum)
But she dey gimme small-small, whoa
I know say she sabi pass that one (uhum)
But she feeling insecure
'Cause her friends go dey gum her like chewing gum (uhum)
Go dey gum her like chewing gum

Yeah, I know I look shy but for you I get down, oh, woah
And my hips make you cry when I'm moving around you (yeah)
Do it once, do it twice (do it twice)
I push back, you hold me tight
Get a taste for a night

Baby, show me you can calm down, calm down
Dance with me and take the lead now, lead now (lead now)
Got you so high that you can't come down, come down
Don't you ask, you know you're allowed, allowed (oh no)
When it's you I can't say no-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Baby, gimme lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
You got me like whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, hmm

As I reach my house I say make I rest small (make I rest small)
As me I wake up na she dey my mind o (na she dey my mind o)
Day one, day two, I no fit focus (I no fit focus)
Na so me I call am, say make we link up (say make we link up)
Got my hand on your heart now, I can feel it race
If I leave then you say you can never love again
Wanna give you it all but can't promise that I'll stay
And that's the risk you take (you take)

Baby, calm down, calm down
Girl, this your body e put my heart for lockdown
For lockdown, oh, lockdown
Girl, you sweet like Fanta o
Fanta o
If I tell you say, "I love you" 
No dey form yanga o, oh, yanga o
No tell me no, no, no, no
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (your love, your love)

Baby, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love
You got me like whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa
Shawty, come gimme your lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-love, hmm (oh, whoa)
