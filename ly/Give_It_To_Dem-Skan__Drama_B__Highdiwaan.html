		  (See dem gonna die)

Anywhere mi go mi fifty kalimba
Come bun dem up call me Lucifer yo dem a go
Dead and implore your God
See dem a gwaan don't give a damn
Elm dem bun dem clan
Mi a go burn your kingdom, yeah

Give it to dem
Dem can't escape they'll run away like goats
Give it to dem you'll keep da shame on you

We shall not retreat till we get the glory
Never back down they gon' hear the story
Let â€˜em tell the story
Pass it down to generations it's
Gon' keep our soul free

Never show mercy ain't no soldier worthy
Can't no weapon hurt me y'all
Gon' have to curse me
Marching with a thousand feet all
My soldiers serve me
Ain't no effort when we stepping
No treaties concern me

We will not retreat till we get the glory
Till we get the glory they
Gon' see our soul bleed
We will not retreat till we get the glory
Till we make their soul bleed
We gon' give it to them all

We gon' give it to them all
We gon' give it to them all
We gon' give it to them all

Line em up, line em up
You with me you standing up
Till the death no giving up
Y'all down to get it
Follow missions, orders and that's a must
Let 'em hear the battle cries our
Line lets build it up that energy fill it up

Hey, they can stand their ground
We gon' knock em down
Like dominoes and tell their leader vamanos
The armor soaked with blood yeah
It's time to go
When they go we go we bust down every door
Till we get that victory
From enemies that energy
It better be "You Can't Finish Me"
And lets show that we stronger
If we die then we die with honor so lets

Give it to dem
Dem can't escape they'll run away like goats
Give it to dem you'll keep da shame on you

We shall not retreat till we get the glory
Never back down they gon' hear the story
Let em tell the story
Pass it down to generations it's
Gon' keep our soul free

Never show mercy ain't no soldier worthy
Can't no weapon hurt me y'all
Gon' have to curse me
Marching with a thousand feet all
My soldiers serve me
Ain't no effort when we stepping
No treaties concern me
We will not retreat till we get the glory
Till we get the glory they
Gon' see our soul bleed
We will not retreat till we get the glory
Till we make their soul bleed
We gon' give it to them all

We gon' give it to them all
We gon' give it to them all
We gon' give it to them all
