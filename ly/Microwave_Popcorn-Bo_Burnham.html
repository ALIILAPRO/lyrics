		  Could you turn up my headphones? Turn up my head- or
I'm the only one in here, so, I'm gonna turn up my own headphones
For myself, thank you, you're welcome

Tryna make microwave popcorn
In a microwave
I am on that wave, I am on that wave
Tryna make microwave popcorn

I take the packet out the plastic (takin' out the plastic, brrt)
Reading the directions on the back of the package (ooh)
Orville Redenbacher, you're a savage (you a savage)
So let's get crackin' (tryna make microwave, ayy)
I put the packet on the glass (what glass?)
The little glass dish in the microwave (got it)
I close the door (which door?)
The door to the microwave, what is wrong with you?
You follow all the rules when you're a studious guy (step one)
Insert the packet, set the power to high
Cook for one-and-a-half minutes
To two-and-a-half minutes (mm, kind of a wide range)

Tryna make microwave popcorn (bippity-bippity bop)
In a microwave (brrt)
I am on that wave, I am on that wave
Tryna make microwave popcorn

The popcorn's done (Thank god)
I open up the door, I take it out
Ah, goddamn, that's hot (super hot)
Makes sense (I burnt my fingies)
I open up the packet (the packet)
It smells smoky and the kernels are black, shit (no)
I burned it (no), I burned it (for real?)
Yes, for real
Do you think you're helping by saying all this? (Tryna make microwave)
I'm givin' up (I'm done cookin' popcorn)
I'ma eat a bag of Skinny Pop (it's already popped)
I look back at the microwave, wait a minute
How'd I miss this button? There's a button and the button says

"Popcorn" (oh, no)
On the microwave (there was a button that said popcorn)
I am on that wave, I am on that wave (I shoulda hit that button)
Tryna make microwave popcorn (tryna make microwave) (bippity bippity bop) (Jiffy Pop)
In a microwave (guys, stop) (microwave) (ah, got a kernel in my throat, ah) (brr)
I am on that wave, I am on that wave (everyone's talking at the same time)
Can everyone just shut (Christmas ornaments)
Shut up (movie theatre butter)
Tryna make microwave popcorn
