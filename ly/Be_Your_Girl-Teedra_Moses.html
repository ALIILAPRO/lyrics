		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't know if you got a girl 
Don't mean to disrespect but
Thoughts of you rule my world
I even dream of you, I swear
Visions of you and I

See you all around my way 
Been meaning to say ,"Hi" but
I'm just way too shy 
I gotta make you see this is
More than just a silly crush

(And I) wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)

All alone at night
I harbor feelings for you
Holding my pillow tight
Sometimes I even touch myself
Imagining your pleasure, baby

Next time I see you, I'm 
Gonna walk right up to you and
Say what's on my mind
I gotta make you see, this is
(More) than just a silly crush

(And I) wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
Just wanna be your girl

I wonder if you even notice me and
Ooh, you gotta feel me
I would love you good
(Just wanna be, just wanna be)
(Just wanna be) your girl

(And I) wonder if you even notice me and
(Oh) you gotta feel me
(And I) would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl)
Ooh

(And I) I wonder, I wonder
(And oh) you gotta feel me, yeah
(And I) I would love you good
(Just wanna be your girl) wanna be your girl
Ooh
Mm
Oh oh, I
(Just wanna be, just wanna be, just wanna be)
(Your girl)
