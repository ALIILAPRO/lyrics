		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out of the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I will leave with every part of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire burning in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they keep me breathless, I can't help thinking

We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn, woah
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
It keeps me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love keep me breathless, I can't help thinking

We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
To the beat beat beat beat

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

You know that there ain't no mountain high enough (I'm still in love with you)
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you (There ain't no mountain)

You know that there ain't no mountain high enough (There ain't no mountain)
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough (I'll be there oh baby)
To keep me from getting to you babe (Yes I will)

We could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat (Rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall)
I'm still in love with you, yes I am (Rolling in the deep, you're gonna wish you)
Oh yeah, oh yeah (Rolling in the deep)
Oh come on, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
