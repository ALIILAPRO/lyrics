		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if it kills me? What if living life without you in it 
Is more than I can bear?
What if I'm lonely? What if having half of someone's heart
Is better than nobody there?
What if I know that you're bad for me and there's no way we're right?
But what if I still wish you were holding me at night?
What if I know not being with you is better for my health?
But I get jealous, when you're with someone else?
Oh, but what if I don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't 
Yeah, what if I don't?

What if I don't remember to miss you? What if you never cross my mind?
What if I'm stronger than you let me believe, and I'm sleeping just fine?
It's hard to imagine I won't see you laying on my pillow
When I close my eyes at night and I'm alone
Oh, but what if I don't?

Oh, but what if don't?

What if I see you holding hands with another girl?
Will I wish that that could still be me?
What if I know that you're bad for me and there's no way we're right?
What if I still wish you were holding me at night?
What if I know not being with you is better for my health?
But I get jealous when you're with someone else?
Oh, but what if I don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Yeah, what if I don't?

What if I don't remember to miss you? What if you never cross my mind?
What if I'm stronger than you let me believe, and I'm sleeping just fine?
It's hard to imagine I won't see you laying on my pillow
When I close my eyes at night and I'm alone
Oh, but what if I don't?

Oh, but what if I don't?

What if it kills me? What if living life without you in it
Is more than I can bear?
What if I'm lonely? What if having half of someone's heart
Is better than nobody there?
What if I don't remember to miss you? What if you never cross my mind?
What if I'm stronger than you let me believe, and I'm sleeping just fine?
It's hard to imagine I won't see you laying on my pillow
When I close my eyes at night and I'm alone
Oh, but what if I don't?
