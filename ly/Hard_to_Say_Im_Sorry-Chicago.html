		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Everybody needs a little time away"
I heard her say
From each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away
Just for the day
From your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away
Far away from the one that I love

Hold me now
It's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now
I really wanna tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through
I will make it up to you
I promise to

You're gonna be the lucky one
