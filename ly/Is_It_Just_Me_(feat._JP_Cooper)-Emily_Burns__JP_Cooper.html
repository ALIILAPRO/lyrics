		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been way too long for me to find it this hard
Sitting alone, my fingers picking the sofa apart
An attempt to distract from the fact that I miss you
I wonder if your friends have had to carry you home
And stay for the night because they don't want to leave you alone
Way before it was fun, it's becoming an issue

I know it's cruel
But I kind of hope you're tortured too

Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops?
Like you're stood at the platform when the trains cross
Are you hurting, yeah you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screaming on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you crying in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?

I heard a rumor you've been spending some time
With that blonde girl that you work with and I know she's exactly your type
And my miserable mind's running wild with the picture
Or are you there by yourself, dialing, redialing my number?
And I'm calling your mother, spilling tears on my jumper again
The way I am

I know it's cruel
But I kind of hope you're tortured too

Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops?
Like you're stood at the platform when the trains cross
Are you hurting, yeah you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screaming on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you crying in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?

'Cause this would be one whole lot easier
God, I know that's selfish but it's true
If underneath some calm exterior
You're all fucked up too

Tell me, does your heart stop at the party when my name drops?
Like you're stood at the platform when the trains cross
Are you hurting, yeah you must be
Or is it just me?
Tongue-tied, screaming on the inside
When I say that we broke up and they ask why
Are you crying in the shower like a freak?
With only cigarettes for company?
Are you crying in the shower like a freak?
Or is it just me?
