		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't done chasing you around
I ain't done chasing you around
Just when I had thought
I had you all worked out
I ain't done chasing you around
Oh no, I ain't backin' down
Oh no, I ain't backin' down
If I only knew
What this was all about
I would tell you, I ain't backing down

For what it's worth
The day starts with a morning
For what it's worth
The winters still bring snow
And I'll be there
To do my best to guide you
Cause when you love someone
You gotta let them know

Do you remember when we laughed out loud?
I remember when we laughed out loud
The wrecking ball had done its worst
And we were both worn out
Do you remember when we laughed out loud?
How will I find you when the stars come out?
How will I find you when the stars come out?
If we are both just specks of dust been blown 'round by the clouds
I'll try to find you when the stars come out

For what it's worth
The day starts with a morning
For what it's worth
The winters still bring snow
And I'll be there
To do my best to guide you
Cause when you love someone
You gotta let them know

In my defence you hit me without warning
In my defence into my arms you fell
There ain't no me without you
So know all will be well

For what it's worth
The day starts with a morning
For what it's worth
The winters still bring snow
And I'll be there
To do my best to guide you
Cause when you love someone
You gotta let them know
For what it's worth
The day starts with a morning
For what it's worth
The winters still bring snow
And I'll be there
To do my best to guide you
Cause when you love someone
You gotta let them know
