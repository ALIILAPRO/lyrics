		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sure she got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
Sure she got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive (oh)

You've been waiting for that
Step on up, swing your bat
You see anybody could be bad to you
You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)

She might've let you hold her hand at school
But I'ma show you how to graduate
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk
Just come and show me what your momma gave (oh yeah)
I heard you've gotta big baby, mouth but don't say a thing
See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!) (You know what, girls? let me show you how to do it)

It's Myx Moscato
It's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle, it's oh, oh
Swimming in the grotto
We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the powder blue, four door
Kitten so good
It's dripping on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could
Go, Batman, robbin' it
Bang bang, cockin' it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari
If they test me, they sorry
Ride his uh like a Harley 
Then pull off in his Ferrari
If he hanging we banging
Phone ringing, he slanging
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic 'cause I'm singing

B to the A to the N to the G to the uh
B to the A to the N to the G to the hey
See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind (your mind) (okay)

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Yo, I said bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute 'til you (ah, hey!)
