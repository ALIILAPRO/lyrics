		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How much more do you think it takes?
They're only here to sell you lies
It's no surprise
'Cause every day I've been waiting for some kind of break
Searching for permanence
A place that I can go to make me whole

But the shadows keep whispering to me
But the shadows keep whispering to me

I'm always waiting for the tide to crash through me
I tremble with every wave
Make me whole again

If I let go
Can I still trust you to be better on your own?
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything
You're making me hate a world
So good to me
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything

When even good times are bittersweet
And though at times it seems like a nightmare on repeat
All you have to do is breathe and know that
This is our home now
You and I will never be alone
When you fall down
Take my hand don't let me go
This is our home now
You and I will never be alone
When you fall down
I am yours to hold

I'm always waiting for the tide to crash through me
I tremble with every wave
Make me whole again

If I let go
Could I still trust you to be better on your own?
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything
You're making me hate a world
So good to me
If I let you stay, you will ruin everything

The loneliest dreams appear in open air
With the sun in my face
The loneliest dreams I have appear when I'm awake
With a smile on my face, I live to kill the ache
