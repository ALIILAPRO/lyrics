		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now like a bird
She flew away
To chase her dream
Of books and praise
Still I miss her
Yeah I miss her
Since she's gone

At JFK
Who played the fool?
Self pity sick
Jet fuel perfume
Still I miss her
Yeah I miss her
Since she's gone

Girl I want to die with you
In each other's arms
We'll drown in flame

If this time were the last time
Could I hold you all life long?
Since this time is the last time
Can I hold you all night long?

Lay your head down, for the last time

Hey KLM
AT+T
The UK post system
Do you still love me?
Still I miss her
Yeah I miss her
Since she's gone
