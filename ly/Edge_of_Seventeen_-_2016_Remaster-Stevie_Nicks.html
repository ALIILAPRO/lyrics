		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh ooh ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh

And the days go by
Like a strand in the wind
In the web that is my own
I begin again
Said to my friend, baby
Nothin' else mattered

He was no more than a baby then
Well he seemed broken hearted
Something within him
But the moment that I first laid
Eyes on him all alone
On the edge of seventeen

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh baby, ooh, said ooh

Well, I went today maybe I will go again
Tomorrow
Yeah, yeah
Well the music there, well it was hauntingly
Familiar
When I see you doing
What I tried to do for me
With the words from a poet
And a voice from a choir
And a melody nothing else mattered

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Said ooh baby, ooh, said ooh

The clouds never expect it
When it rains
But the sea changes colors
But the sea
Does not change
So with the slow, graceful flow
Of age
I went forth with an age old
Desire to please
On the edge of seventeen

Ooh

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh

Well then suddenly
There was no one left standing
In the hall yeah, yeah
In a flood of tears
That no one really ever heard fall at all
Well, I went searchin' for an answer
Up the stairs and down the hall
Not to find an answer
Just to hear the call
Of a nightbird singing
Come away, come away

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh

Well I hear you in the morning
And I hear you
At nightfall
Sometimes to be near you
Is to be unable to feel you
My love
I'm a few years older than you, my love

Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh
Just like the white winged dove
Sings a song
Sounds like she's singing
Ooh baby, ooh, said ooh
