		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away
How many nights have you laid here with me feeling like I left?
Waking up in a stranger's bed
Don't know how I got lost
I don't know how to get back
Don't know how you haven't hit the door with your bags all packed
Every morning I hear you pray for the old me instead
Of waking up in a stranger's bed

I'm gonna run straight back to us, baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed

I know I say too little, yeah I'm gone too much
I don't even remember the last time we touched
Every night it's like you're sleeping with someone you've never met
And waking up in a stranger's bed
I remember the words that you haven't heard for so long
You're not gone yet

I'm gonna run straight back to us, baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Oh no, oh woah

I don't say what I mean
I don't mean what I say
It's almost like it ain't me that keeps pushing you away

I'm gonna run straight back to us, baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe you'll save me from myself
Well, I'm gonna run back to us, baby
No more same old someone else
Back to the one you used to love like crazy
Maybe you'll save me from myself
When the sun comes around again
You won't be waking up in a stranger's bed
Ooh
