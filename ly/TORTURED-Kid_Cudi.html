		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God, help me (ooh-ooh), God, help me (ooh-ooh), please (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Do you hear me? (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Do you hear me? (ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

In the dark (yeah), that's a trippy night, I wish the devil would fuck off (fuck 'em)
Had a crazy day, I think I might just go get sauced (saucy)
Jaden gave me acid, then said I was gettin' lost (winners)
My partners tell me "Strap in, this is happenin', we on" (hot, hot)
I've been on my mission, got my people by my side (hot, hot, hot)
My demons there to haunt me, keepin' focused, shit, it sucks, man
I don't give two fuckers what they say about me, own me (yeah)
I'ma stay so focused, do my dirt up on my lonely (yeah)
Niggas is too phony, can't fuck with me, no goalie
I'ma keep it realer, if I see you, I keep rollin'
And strollin', my people, they don't know that
Every single week, I get the lowest, I'm sober

Meanwhile I sleep, dreamin' and all
Demons, they creep on up, bringin' the drugs
They said I pray, smoke, and get drunk (oh-oh-oh)
As I sit and burn, wantin' to the sky (yeah)
They say "Careful, boy," I say "Why?" (Why?)
I'ma stay tortured all my life (Life)
Feelin' like me, I'll be fightin' 'til I die (yeah)
As I sit and burn, wantin' to the sky (yeah)
They say "Careful, boy," I say "Why?" (Why?)
I'ma stay tortured all my life (Life)
Feelin' like me, I'll be fightin' 'til I die (yeah)

What's the cost? (Yeah) Tryna find my way inside this bitch, this shit is hopeless
Countin' down the minutes, playin' tennis with emotion (yeah)
Tryin' different therapists, they sayin' I got problems
Voices in my head, they tryna show me all the solvin' (yeah)
Been thinkin' 'bout my friends and I can't tell them what is wrong
Send 'em all "Okay", then hit the button, I'm keepin' strong
Dealin' with this shit, like ever since I lost my pops, mane
Every day I man-gain, interested in the brain, mane
I'm drownin', I'm crazy and it's timin'
Sittin' in the darkness, scarin' nothin', I'm down bad
This drink that I am downin', she love me but she left me
Master of my madness, so much sadness in the night

Meanwhile I sleep, dreamin' and all
Demons, they creep on up, bringin' the drugs
They said I pray, smoke, and get drunk (oh-oh-oh)
As I sit and burn one to the sky (yeah)
They say "Careful, boy," I say "Why?" (Why?)
I'ma stay tortured all my life (Life)
Feelin' like me, I'll be fightin' 'til I die (yeah)
As I sit and burn, wantin' to the sky (yeah)
They say "Careful, boy," I say "Why?" (Why?)
I'ma stay tortured all my life (Life)
Feelin' like me, I'll be fightin' 'til I die (yeah)

Yeah, whoa-oh, yeah, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Feelin' like me, I'll be fightin' 'til I die
