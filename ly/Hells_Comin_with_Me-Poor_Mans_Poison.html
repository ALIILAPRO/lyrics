		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They all laughed as he turned around slow
They said you ain't welcome 'round here anymore
You just might as well go
He wiped the blood from his face as he slowly came to his knees
He said, I'll be back when you least expect it
And hell's coming with me
Hell's coming with me

There is a hill at the bottom of the valley
Where all the poor souls go when they die
And if you listen real close
You can hear em' like a ghost
Saying you're never gonna make it out alive
There is a town at the bottom of that hill
They got a secret that they keep like a slave
They got a black magic preacher (ooh)
We'd do well to let him teach her
You'll be heading up that hill to the grave

And it is well, with my soul
You line your pockets full of money that you steal from the poor
And on your way down to hell, you hear me ring that bell
I'd pay the devil twice as much to keep your soul

There was a drifter passing through that little valley
See he had promised he was coming back to town (coming back to town)
They didn't know him by his face, or by the gun around his waist (ooh)
But he come back to burn that town to the ground

First there was fire, then there was smoke
Then that preacher man was hangin' by a rope
Then they all fell to their knees and begged that drifter
Begged him please, as he raised his fist before he spoke

I am the righteous hand of God
And I am the devil that you forgot
And I told you one day you will see
That I'll be back I guarantee
And that hell's coming, hell's coming
Hell, hell's coming with me

And it is well, with my soul
You line your pockets full of money that you steal from the poor
And on your way down to hell, you hear me ring that bell
And I said, hell's coming with me (hell's coming with me)
