		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see a trail there, leadin' back through centuries
I feel connections, like the roots below the trees
Whatever tells me I know you from before
It feels like dyin' was just another door

I never cared for the stories they tell
I never thought about heaven and hell
I just remember a life in the past
A life that I lost

(It's like a) Reincarnation, saved from the dead
(It's like a) Reincarnation, life takes us back
(Remember) We'll be forever, endless as time
(It's like a) Reincarnation, my soul won't die

Watch me fly
(My soul up to the sky)
Watch me fly
(It's not my time to die)
Watch me fly
(The dark you see will fade)
(It's like a) Reincarnation, my soul won't die

I'm full of memories from a time I wasn't born
My life, a fraction of a unity that's torn
It all reminds me that there is more than this
Signs over time now that I just can't dismiss

I never cared for the stories they tell
I never thought about heaven and hell
I just remember a life in the past
A life that I lost

(It's like a) Reincarnation, saved from the dead
(It's like a) Reincarnation, life takes us back
(Remember) We'll be forever, endless as time
(It's like a) Reincarnation
My soul won't die

I never cared for the stories they tell
I never thought about heaven and hell
I just remember a life in the past
A life that I lost

(It's like a) Reincarnation, saved from the dead
(It's like a) Reincarnation, life takes us back
(Remember) We'll be forever, endless as time
(It's like a) Reincarnation, my soul won't die

Watch me fly
(My soul up to the sky)
Watch me fly
(It's not my time to die)
Watch me fly
(The dark you see will fade)
(It's like a) Reincarnation, my soul won't die
