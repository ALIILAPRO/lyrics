		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the sun beats down   And burns the tar up on the roof   And your shoes get so hot   You wish your tired feet were fireproof     Under the boardwalk   Down by the sea   On a blanket with my baby   Is where I'll be     (Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun   (Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun   (Under the boardwalk) People walking above   (Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love   (Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)     From the sand you'll hear   The happy sound of a carousel   You can almost taste the hot dogs   And French fries they sell     Under the boardwalk   Down by the sea, yeah   On a blanket with my baby   Is where I'll be     (Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun   (Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun   (Under the boardwalk) People walking above   (Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love   (Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)     Oh, under the boardwalk   Down by the sea   On a blanket with my baby   Is where I'll be     (Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun   (Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun   (Under the boardwalk) People walking above   (Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love   (Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)
