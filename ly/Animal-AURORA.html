		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the victim
The victim of my love
I dangle up on rooftops
Before I push you off
I stand at the headlights
Looking for a corner where I can't be found
With a goddess in my right eye
Watching every lover on the battleground

You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

Isolation makes me hungry
Will you stay here till I sleep?
You'll return home in the morning
But you never really leave
I keep the memories alive
The weight upon my shoulders felt so divine
With a goddess in my right eye
Watching every step I take before I die

You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal

Let me become an animal
Let me become an animal
'Cause when you are an animal
You lose control

You're hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle
If I am alone
Make me a stranger
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
Hunting for love
Killing for pleasure
Lost in a concrete jungle (He-lay)

I'm an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal
I become an animal, animal
Hunting for an animal, animal (Ho, ho)
