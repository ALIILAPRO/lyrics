		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your T-shirt on
And go sit on the bed because I know that you want to
You've got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong
And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
And go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was they're too strong, too strong
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is

Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had, cleanin' up
He got good with his fours and his twos
Community service was the best job he ever had, cleanin' up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes

Oh, and she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy'll be alright

Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is

Yeah, well, she said, "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright?"
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy'll be alright

Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is, city is
Yeah, you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
