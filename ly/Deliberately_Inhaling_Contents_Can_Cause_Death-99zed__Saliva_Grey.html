		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Z-E-D on that beat
Boy he murdered it
Menacing up in your city
We returning then
Stacking bodies for the motherfuckin furnishing
Lurking in your lil brain
You gon' need some surgery
Lil bitch boy I’m gon stomp that
Recoil when I pop that
Ain’t fond of that combat
But I'll fuck you up when you talk back
And I cock that
Unload
Coming straight from that 8-0
4 tho war zone
Bodies all in my floorboard and I
Ride through the river city with my fucking gang uhh
I be licking on that blood I like the taste
I don’t want no pussy if that bitch is not insane
Get that brain from a slain bitch she taking off her lace
Coogi down to my socks like I’m Fergy Ferg
ASAP with the Rock I feel it burn and burn
Got K in my nose I’m feeling swerve and slurred
Fall back in the earth I’m smoking all this dirt
I’m gonna flip the fuck out this pack
Ripping the bag inhaling that gas
Zipping it back and send with a tax
Counting them racks weighing my stacks
I done got rash all in my eyes
I done made slash with all of my ties
Fuck your life fuck your lies
I’m bout to send you right up in the sky
N-I-N-E-T-Y
N-I-N-E got it plenty
If you want a feature then its gonna cost a pretty penny
I don't want no drama but I think I'm feeling kind of petty
Imma up the pocket rocket have it busting like confetti
Rollin up with Saliva fat duchess burn my lungs
Thinking I'm ready to take a trip put the gel up on my tongue
Zed he be steadily making the flip getting the bag stacking the funds
Imma skull fuck your bitch until I see the sun
Zorro eating good with his golden Smith & Wesson
Milo stay running the block better go and get protection
That's my pistol stupid bitch imma catch a 187
I be handing out these fades like 99 working concession
Inhale
Exhale
I'm high as fuck like David Blaine
From the River City 99 coming to bring the pain
Grip the AK imma shred your fucking brain
Wiggling like a slug while I'm stomping on your face
For the one time imma sniff a line
Now that's a lie
Now I'm sniffing two lines I'm seeing twice
My brain is fried
And my mouth is hella dry I'm dead inside no I won't cry
Masked up like I'm shy you finna die we ride tonight bitch
