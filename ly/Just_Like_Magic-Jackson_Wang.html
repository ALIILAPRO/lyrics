		<p>
		  (Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)
(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)

Calling me foolish
I'm over the moon, yeah, I want your love
A spell of confusion inside an illusion
I won't wake up

I hold you in my arms five days of the week
Then you disappear on the weekend
You wrap me in chains and you tie up my feet
Then drop me off in the deep end

I-i-i think I need her
I-i-i gotta have it all
I-i-i wanna see her
Ooh, it's just like

(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)
(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)

Build us up just to tear it down
We both know how the cards fall
So much smoke when you're not around
Did you see it in your crystal ball?

I hold you in my arms five days of the week
Then you disappear on the weekend
You wrap me in chains and you tie up my feet
Then drop me off in the deep end

I-i-i think I need her
I-i-i gotta have it all
I-i-i wanna see her
Ooh, it's just like

I-i-i think I need her
I-i-i gotta have it all
I-i-i wanna see her
Ooh, it's just like

(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)
(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)

(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)
(Ooh-ooh, it's just like magic)
