		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby I got love for thee
So deep inside of me I don't know where to start
I love you more than anything
But the words cant even touch what's in my heart

When I try to explain it I be sounding insane
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling

And I say baby, baby
Baby (baby I)
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it

Baby, baby (ooh oh)

Baby I'm so down for you
No matter what you do (real talk) I'll be around
Oh baby, see baby I been feelin' you
Before I even knew what feelings were about
Oh baby

When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy
The words don't ever come out right
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)
I can't explain what I'm feeling

And I say baby, baby
Baby (baby I)
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it

Baby, baby
Baby, baby

Straight up, you got me
All in, how could I not be
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)
If it's even possible, I love you more
Than word love can say it
It's better not explaining that's why I keep saying baby I

Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated

Baby, baby (baby)
Baby, baby (baby I)
Ooh baby oh baby oh baby (baby I)
Oh baby
(Baby I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated

Baby, baby
Baby, baby
