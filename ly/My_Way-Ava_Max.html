		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My momma use to say
"Baby make me proud
You've got such a pretty face
But such a dirty mouth"
But how come when I tell you
What's on my mind like men do
I'm called crazy?
Crazy

This is not a love song
This is not a sing along
But ladies, are you with me?
I know that you're with me

Add a little sugar, they say
Be a little sweeter, they say
Gotta give and take, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way
Be a little proper, they say
Speak a little softer, they say
Gotta be a lady, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way
(My way, my way, my way)

This time it's my way, ah, my way
(My way, my way, my way)
This time it's my way, ah, my way

I'll do me
You do you
I don't need nobody's permission
I won't back down
Win or lose
Oh yeah, one and only limited edition (yeah)

This is not a love song
This is not a sing along
But ladies, are you with me?
I know that you're with me

Add a little sugar, they say
Be a little sweeter, they say
Gotta give and take, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way
Be a little proper, they say
Speak a little softer, they say
Gotta be a lady, but I say
This time it's my way, ah, my way

This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way
This time it's my way, ah, my way
