		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah

Let me catch a vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind, and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine
Let's take it easy

Damn, we so fire, babe
We been through the 305 highway
Love it how you ride in the fast lane
Make me wanna say, "That's my bae" (Yeah)
Dani gotta behave
Gotta be chill like a Sunday
Never wanna look too thirsty
But your drip got me feeling wavy

Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feeling so lovely, lovely
Make me wanna love me, love me
Make me feel lucky, lucky

Let me catch a vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind, and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine
Let's take it easy, yeah
Let's take it easy

Never gotta O.D.
I just wanna love you like a homie
Make you feel love like that OG
It could feel just like the old days
Okay, let's just be real
I can tell you like how this feels
Ain't no stress, no mistakes
Put in that work, you gon' miss me

Make you feel lucky, lucky
Make you wanna love me, love me
Baby, when you with me, with me
Got no worries, worries
I love it when you touch me, touch me
Feeling so lovely, lovely
Make me wanna love me, love me
Make me feel lucky, lucky

Let me catch a vibe, let's just take our time
Just relax your mind, and take it easy
Don't have to decide, you do, I do, I
Don't have to be mine
Let's take it easy, yeah
Let's take it easy
Let's take it easy
Let's take it easy
