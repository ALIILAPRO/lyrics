		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What would a man not do?
What would a man not say?
What would a man not agree to?
What would he not betray?

Where would a man fear to trespass?
Where would a man not stray?
What crime would a man not admit to?
What price would a man not pay?

(For her love)
He's got no money but his head's up in the stars
(For her love)
He'll spray her name across a streetcar
(For her love)
If he can't read between the lines up there on Mars
(For her love)
He'll find some meaning in a street light

What would a man not consent to?
What would a man not face?
What would a man not agree to?
What lies would a man not embrace?

(For her love)
He'll find a job, he'll work his fingers to the bone
(For her love)
She's safely sleeping in the moonlight
(For her love)
He'll save his money, buy a place to call their own
(For her love)
And he will be the one she loves

By the stretch of my fingers (For her love)
By the strength in my hands (For her love)
By the blood that flows in my veins (For her love)
By the pulse of my beating heart (For her love)
By the sun up in heaven, by the moon and the stars (for her love)
By the circling planets
And the lines on the surface, the surface of Mars

What would a man not do
What would a man not say
For her love?
