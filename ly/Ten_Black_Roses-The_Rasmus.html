		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is like a boat in the bottle
Try to sail, You can't with no air
Day by day it only gets harder
Try to scream but nobody cares

Through the glass you see the same faces
Hear the voices play fade a drum
When your life's a boat in a bottle
You're surrounded, drifting alone

Don't leave me now
Stay another day
With me

[Chorus:]
When you're sad, and no one knows it
I'll send you black roses
When your heart's dark and frozen
I'll send you black roses

Far away we wait for each other
I'm still on that road to nowhere
Kiss yourself for me in the mirror
Tie a black rose into your hair

Don't lose your faith
Share another night
With me

[Chorus]

Ten black roses
Ten black roses

Life is like a boat in the bottle
Try to sail, you can't with no air
Day by day it only gets harder
Try to scream but nobody cares

[Chorus]

Ten black roses
Ten black roses
