		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Destiny, destiny protect me from the world 
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world 
Here we are, with our running and confusion 
And I don't see no confusion anywhere 

And if the world does turn 
And if London burns 
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar 
I want to be in a band 
When I get to heaven 
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore 

Grow my hair, grow my hair I am Jim Morrison 
Grow my hair, I want to be want to be want to be Jim Morrison 

Here we are, with our running and confusion 
And I don't see no confusion anywhere 

As if the world does turn 
And if London burns 
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar 
I want to be in a band 
When I get to heaven 
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore
