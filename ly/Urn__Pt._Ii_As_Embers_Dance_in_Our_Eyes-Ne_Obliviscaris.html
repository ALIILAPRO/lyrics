		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beneath aqueducts, anointed we transfigure
Within the void we are breathless
We are delivered

Before the flame, we transcend
Bearing light in hues of sunrise
With devil'ed wings as wind torn shrouds
Faithless decadence

Together, forever of all
Tomorrow, we dream no more
Our gods lay in quiescence
The end, true freedom
Baroque'n forms 'neath mourningstars
Where the moon will wither
Here, we are of the sun we become the earth

Wounds of earth
Purging fireâ€¦ burning bloodstreams
Bereft of pulse and light
Crimson, gold, a new sun empyreal
Crimson, gold, one last sun to ember

Dead seas of life dead seas of life

In shades of faceless grey, unto ashes
Our dying memories, our faded lives
Within this urn inversed, pain released
We are the ones that were, what once was

We are the ones that were, what once was
