		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lemme hear ya say yeah (wow) 
Lemme hear ya say yeah (wow) 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit 

No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high 
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want and we do it with pride 

Lemme hear ya say yeah (wow) 

Hard to the core, I feel the floor
When I'm on stage, yo, you ask for more 
I'm on the edge, I know the ledge 
I work real hard to collect my cash 
Tick tick ticka tick take your time 
When I'm goin' I'm goin' for mine
Open your ears and you will hear it
I tell you this 'cause there's no limit

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no there's no limit 

No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high 
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want and we do it with pride 

Ow, hey yay, yeah hey hey 
Now, now, no no
Hey yay, yeah hey hey 
Now, now, no no, hoo 

No limits allowed, 'cause there's much crowd
Microphone check as I choose my route
I'm playing on the road, I've got no fear
The sound from my mouth is the record you hear
There never will be no mountain too high 
Reach the top, touch the sky
They tried to diss me 'cause I sell out
I'm making techno and I am proud

No, no limits, we'll reach for the sky
No valley too deep, no mountain too high 
No, no limits, won't give up the fight
We do what we want and we do it with pride
