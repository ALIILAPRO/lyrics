		  10 in the morning and I don't really care
I don't really care
10 in the morning and I don't really care
If it's half night the start of your day
Let me figure out

Let me figure out, let me figure out
Let me figure out, let me f-
Let me figure out
(Let me figure out)

10 in the morning and I don't really care
If it's half night the start of your day
Let me figure out

I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday

10 in the morning and I don't really care
I don't really care
10 in the morning and I don't really care
If it's half night the start of your day
Let me figure out

I could but I don't, I could but I don't
I could but I don't, I could but I don't
But I don't, but I don't, but I don't
But I don't, but I don't, but I don't
But I don't, but I don't, but I don't
But I don't, but I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't) 
But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't

10 in the morning and I don't really care
If it's half night the start of your day
Let me figure out

I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday

10 in the morning and I don't really care
(I don't really care)
10 in the morning and I don't really care
If it's half night the start of your day
Let me figure out

I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be back like yesterday
I'll be 

(She'll be back like yesterday, she'll be back li-)

But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't)
But I don't (but I don't)
