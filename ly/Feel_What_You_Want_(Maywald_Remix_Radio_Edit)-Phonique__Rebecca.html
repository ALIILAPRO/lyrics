		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  you feel what you want it to be
you feel what you want it to be

the sun rises at nine
departs at five
ain`t doing overtime no more
because in this world of colour
the brightest picture
is plugged right into your wall

you think a little love is all you need
but love is such a small thing
can`t you see
I think you find it sits in the book and
changes the words that you read

you just feel what you want it to be what you want it to feel
what you want it to be
you just feel what you want it to be what you want it to feel
what you want it to be

the sun rises at nine departs at five
ain`t doing overtime no more
because in this world of colour
the brightest picture
is plugged right into your wall

you think a little love is all you need
but love is such a small thing can`t you see
I think you find it sits in the book and
changes the words that you read

you just feel what you want it to be what you want it to feel
what you want it to be
you just feel what you want it to be what you want it to feel
what you want it to be

the man in the moon has a cold in the back of his head today
so dark is the river as the old bridge of lovers
finds it is getting washed all away
there are three wise men in the darkness of the desert
still trying to be finding their way
the tables have been layed and the food has been served
but the cost of eating is too much for most to pay

you just feel what you want it to be what you want it to feel
what you want it to be
you just feel what you want it to be what you want it to feel
what you want it to be

you think a little love is all you need
