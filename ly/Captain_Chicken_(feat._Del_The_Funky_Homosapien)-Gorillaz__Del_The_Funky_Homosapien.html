		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Captain Chicken, the master of the cluckers
When I knock on your door, you know it's a customer
Scary as hell, I be hella uncomfortable
I can't comfort you cause I'm trying to run from you (I'm out)
Always urging
Spooked, you could probably call
Dodging is my hobby y'all
I have several bodyguards (help)
I throw stones breaking through glass houses
Damn broke, never put my money where my mouth is

Captain Chicken, thanks a lot
You're my daily, you're my car
Captain Chicken, oh, my God
You look jolly, you look high

Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken

Captain Chicken, are you there?
Wrapped in plastic, got no head
On the shelf, might look at you
You look tasty, I want you

Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken (Chicken)
Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken
Captain Chicken

I come out in a major way
Singing to the cops everyday
I'm like Babyface
Obviously, I'm kin folk with Dobalina
I say a lot of things
But I'm a chicken
I don't mean it
I'ma see you, I'ma duck
'Cause I'm afraid of you
And all the words of sitting ducks
I'm perpetrating too
Captain Chicken, the foulest of the fouls
Two is not allowed in the game
I'm outta bounds (Captain Chicken)
