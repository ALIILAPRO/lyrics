		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, yeah, come on

Please me, baby
Turn around and just tease me, baby
You got what I want and what I need, baby
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please
Please me, baby
Turn around and just tease me, baby
You got what I want and what I need, baby
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please (woo)

Lollipoppin' (poppin'), twerkin' in some J's (ooh)
On the dance floor (uh-huh), no panties in the way (nope)
I take my time with it (ow), bring you close to me (ow)
Don't want no young dumb shit
Better fuck me like we listenin' to Jodeci
I was tryna lay low (low), takin' it slow (slow)
When I'm fuckin' again (ayy)
Gotta celebrate, if you're man look good, better put him away
If you can't sweat the weave out, you shouldn't even be out
Dinner reservations like the pussy, you gon' eat out

I'm gonna ride it, do it just how you like it
Tonight and after that
Let's do it one more time
Girl, I ain't one for beggin', but now you got me beggin'

Please me, baby
Turn around and just tease me, baby
You got what I want and what I need, baby
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please (woo)
Please me, baby
Turn around and just tease me, baby
You got what I want and what I need, baby
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please (woo)

Booty so round (round), booty so soft (soft)
Bet you wanna smack it again (ayy)
Let me demonstrate
Hit it one time, make it levitate
Titties out like blaka (blaka)
Broke bitches watch out now (watch out)
Your pussy basura (basura)
My pussy horchata (oh)

I'm gonna ride it, do it just how you like it
Tonight and after that (ooh)
Let's do it one more time
Girl, I ain't one for beggin', but now you got me beggin'

Please me, baby
Turn around and just tease me, baby
You got what I want and what I need, baby
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please (woo)

Come on
Come on, back it up for me
Come on
Ooh, twerk it on me slowly
Come on
Girl, let me put this lovin' on you
You better say that shit (uh)
Cardi don't play that shit (yeah)
Do my back like I do these records, break that shit

Please me, baby (uh)
Turn around and just tease me, baby (uh, ooh)
You got what I want and need, baby (yes)
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please (woo)
Please me, baby
Turn around and tease me, baby
You got what I want and need, baby
(Let me hear you say)
Please
(Let me hear you say)
Please (woo)
