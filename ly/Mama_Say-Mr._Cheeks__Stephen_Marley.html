		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus: Stephen Marley]
And hey!
And I see you passing by my way, again
And I'm wondering if we can be good friends
And I see you passing by my way, again, yeah
And I'm wondering if we can be good friends
Can't you get along?

Mama say, mama say, mama say, mama say
Got to get along
Papa say, papa say, papa say, papa say
(This is where you belong)
Mama say, mama say, mama say, mama say
And papa say, papa say, papa say, papa say
(This is where you belong)

[Mr. Cheeks]
Eh, excuse me dime piece,
Where you headed off to with that chip up on ya shoulder
Lemme help get that off you (Yeah)
Walking around like you lost and from out of town
Who got you down, yo shit, you too hot to frown
I see you time to time whenever you creep through
You know my cousin D2, yea that's my people
I always ask about you, I guess I spoke you up
I swear if you was trees, I'd roll, light, and smoke you up (Yeah)
And I'm not kidding with you, for real a nigga dig ya
But can we hang out, spend some time, that's what I'm trying figure
Live alone, got a style all your own
Cinnamon complexion skin tone, I know you been grown
The mouth is statured with a work, for real it got me hurting
Of course a nigga flirting, come from behind that curtain
I got some more deliveries but yet I be back
And when I get back I want to see that (see that)
Matter-a fact gimme that number lemme hit you on the arm
By the time I get back you be gone (be gone)
Yeah, I got that number from her, 'cause after work she outtie
Headed back to the crib where she can live and get it clouty
At eight o'clock, we meet up at that after-work spot (Yeah)
If no one told ya today, yo that shirt is skirr-hot
You keep ya nails painted, always got ya hair done
Tonight's the night me and you go out and share one

[Chorus]

Mama say, mama say, mama say, mama say..Eh
And papa say, papa say, papa say, papa say
(This is where you belong)
Mama say, mama say, mama say, mama say, what you say?
And papa say, papa say, papa say, papa say
(This is where you belong)

[Mr. Cheeks]
Yeah, hey yo,
We meet in front the jazz spot, she looking right as ever
Boosting master gloves, them gloves that master leather
Smile when she see me, I guess I'm looking comfy
She grabbed my hand and walked in front me, man I think she want me
Got a table for two in the rear
Cause over there, you's allowed to throw something in the air
Music sounding good, we hopped up out our chairs
I'm close up on them smells, we're burning L's and bears
We had a few drinks, we ate a meal and all
This night and her cousin, for real I feel it all
She got me wide open, I guess she wide too
Cause she done told me anytime I want to slide through
That I can slide through, I take you on that offer
I had to warn her, laughed and joked a bit, now I'm back up on her
Not tonight but give me some time, I'ma bag you
And make you my permanent Ragu

[Chorus]

Mama say, mama say, mama say, mama say
Papa say, papa say, papa say, papa say
(This is where you belong)
