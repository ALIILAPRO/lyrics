		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me
Over time
Like a riverbed
Starting low
Going deep down
Into the sand
See we grow
When it rains
Every tear we shed
You and me over time
Like a riverbed
They say it's dangerous
That we would lose control
I think it's fabulous
And we enjoy it all
You and me over time
Like a riverbed
Like a riverbed
Go pack your bags
We need to leave
See the river's drying up
And there's no time to grieve
Safe all your tears
Safe them for me
On oceans floor we'll end up free
They say it's dangerous
That we would lose control
I think it's fabulous
And we enjoy it all
You and me over time
Like a riverbed
Up and Down
Float around
Sinkin till we hit the ground yeah
Tell me what
Tell me how
I will it do it darling I swear
Don't forget
What we have
When the waters getting wilder
Every storm
Somehow ends
And the sky will come back brighter
You and me
Over time
Like a riverbed
Starting low
Going deep down
Into the sand
See we grow
When it rains
Every tear we shed
