		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before me there stands an opportunity
There for the taking in this moment, this exact moment 
I shall prepare myself 
To face a monster of which only I may conquer
Conjure the power bestowed upon our souls
Conjure the power

Align the stones to form a message in the sand
I will never relinquish
It is written in the sand 

Which lies below me 
Staring back at a helpless man 
I've done all I can 
It lies in the hands of those who seek a voice soaring above the rest 
Built from the ground 
Forming scratches upon the surface 
We survive in wretched of times 
We survive in wretched of times 
Conjure the power 
We survive in wretched of times
And we thrive in the most wretched of times

Align the stones to form a message in the sand
I will never relinquish
It is written in the sand 

Which lies below me 
Staring back at a helpless man
