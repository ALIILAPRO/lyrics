		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been feeling crazy I just wanna play
Been tryna get to zero gravity 
We're goin high so light it up with me 
I'll take you to another galaxy 

They don't know we weren't invited 
We don't even need to hide it 
Move your body catch a vibe and 

Rock with me 
Rock with me  
With me 
Oh oh ya rock with me 

Rock with me 
Rock with me  
With me 
Oh oh ya rock with me 

I see that smile growing on your face 
This type of feeling you just can't replace 
We know what's good up here in outer space 
cnd I just keep goin back for another taste 

They don't know until they try it  
We don't even need to hide it 
Move your body catch a vibe and 

Rock with me 
Rock with me  
With me 
Oh oh ya rock with me 

Rock with me 
Rock with me  
With me 
Oh oh ya rock with me 

Put your body 
Next to somebody 
cnd just keep on movin ya 
Keep on movin 

Put your body 
Next to somebody 
cnd just keep on movin 
Ooooh yaa 

Rock with me 
Rock with me  
With me 
Oh oh ya rock with me 

Rock with me 
Rock with me  
With me 
Oh oh ya rock with me
