		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I must be out of my mind, 
I must be out of my mind,
I must be out of my mind,
I'll just keep falling behind.
There was no reason or rhyme.
Only a matter of time.
I must be out of it.
This melody is messin' me up,
Everything I do, it's never enough.
Just bring me down,
Right here and now.
I've gone insane,
I lost my brain,
And I'll never win the game.
All the while, they all forget my name. 
And maybe I'm too young, too young to sing the blues,
See the yellow sun while I'm on the darkest moon.
I don't know the reason why
My life is strung up in a lie, no no.
I cannot break away,
I cannot break away, way,
No way to say.
I must be out of my mind, 
I must be out of my mind,
I must be out of my mind,
I'll just keep falling behind.
There was no reason or rhyme.
Only a matter of time.
I must be out of it.

How can a flower bloom in a hurricane?
Tell me it's not bad, but either way,
I drink the cup.
Running out of love for the maniac,
My heart attack,
And I'm never coming back.
No, I'm never ever ever coming back!

And maybe I'm too young, too young to sing the blues,
See the yellow sun while I'm on the darkest moon.
I don't know the reason why
My life is strung up in a lie, no no.
I cannot break away,
I cannot break away, way,
No way to say.

I must be out of my mind, 
I must be out of my mind,
I must be out of my mind,
I'll just keep falling behind.
There was no reason or rhyme.
Only a matter of time.
I must be out of it.

I must be out of my mind, 
I must be out of my mind,
I must be out of my mind,
I'll just keep falling behind.
There was no reason or rhyme.
Only a matter of time.
I must be out of it.
