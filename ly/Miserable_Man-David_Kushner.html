		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's pack our stuff now
And run away
We can't be all we want in this small town
Our life was rough so
Let's make our days what we want
And I'll give you my last name
We'll take our chances after all these letdowns
Let's keep our patience until ourselves are found
Oh

All we wanted
Was a place to feel like home
That's why we parted
From our ways to heal our souls
I'm a small town miserable man
That does what he can
I'm a small town miserable man
That does what he can
I'm a miserable man

It's been some years now
And we're okay
We have some kids
And built our dream house
We're eating dinner so we're saying grace
Without the light, we wouldn't find our way
How are we standing
From misery to this now?
'Cause we've been stranded
To screaming this out loud

All we wanted
Was a place to feel like home
That's why we parted
From our ways to heal our souls
I'm a small town miserable man
That does what he can
I'm a small town miserable man
That does what he can
I'm a miserable man

(I'm a miserable man)
(I'm a miserable man)
(I'm a miserable man)
I'm a miserable man
