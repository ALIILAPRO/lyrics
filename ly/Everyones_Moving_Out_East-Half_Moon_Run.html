		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it's one thing after another
As one friend tried to explain
As one friend went down to take a lover
One friend went down and just stayed

Everyone
Everyone's moving out east
I love you
I love you don't you steal away from me
From me
It's not me

Well one friend went down to seek the Jordan
But wound up drinking from the sea
And another went to take a powder
One friend said they'd come back someday

Everyone
Everyone's moving out east
I love you
I love you don't you steal away from me

Everyone 
I know everyone's moving out east
But I love you
I love you don't you steal away from me
From me
From me
