		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You give your hand to me
And then you say hello
And I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so

And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
Well, you don't know me, mm

No, you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night
And longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight

Ooh whoa, I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been
'Cause you don't know me

For I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you

Afraid and shy
I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me, too

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy

Ooh, you'll never know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me

For I never knew
The art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you

Afraid and shy
I let my chance go by
A chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me
And then you say goodbye
I watch you walk away
Beside the lucky guy

Oh, you'll never know
The one who loves you so
You don't know me, mm

You'll never know
The one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me
