		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Oh, no, no, no

I, I, I, I
I just, I just can't start again
You make things way too obvious
And your perfume's scent on my cardigan
I, I, I, I
If you walk out, girl, don't call again
Same time, same place, we can start again
My place, same time, we can start again

We can start again
Yeah, girl, what's left of it?
Don't play so innocent, uh
Relapse, reload, I'm back, I'm gone
I'm high, I'm stoned, live life alone
On edge, I'm good, I'm hot and cold
Pop enough to the face, I can feel it, you know

I guess I'm a bad guy, I guess I'm a bad liar
I can't solve your problems, baby, pass them to the next guy
A lot of bad habits that I gotta kick
But it's the same habits, girl, that made me rich, ooh

I, I, I, I
I just, I just can't start again
You make things way too obvious
And your perfume's scent on my cardigan
I, I, I, I
If you walk out, girl, don't call again
Same time, same place, we can start again
My place, same time, we can start again

Start again, start again, start again
I guess it's all love, I guess it's all love, I guess it's all love, ooh
I guess it's all you, I guess it's all you, I guess it's all you, ooh

I, I, I, I
I just, I just can't start again
You make things way too obvious
And your perfume's scent on my cardigan
I, I, I, I
If you walk out, girl, don't call again
Same time, same place, we can start again
My place, same time, we can start again
