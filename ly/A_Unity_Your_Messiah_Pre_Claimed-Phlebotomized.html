		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Insinuations
Mentally constructed
Empathy deficits
Never ending lies!

I may be the one wearing a mask but I can see through yours just as clearly 
I may be the one wearing a mask...

Trying to hide of what you are
Trying to mislead it all 
The decision was made 
Do not try to blame everyone 

For the actions you have committed 
There is no turning back!
You cannot return 
You have chosen this way of life

Mislead, concealment of evil 
You have seen it all
Monstrosity, you closed your eyes 
In the name of what you call a religion

Do not try to blame others lives
For the morbid decisions you have made
Morality, it is all a facade
There is no turning back!

A unity your Messiah pre claimed?
A unity your Messiah pre claimed?
A unity your Messiah pre claimed?

Mentally constructed
The peace was short lived
Insalubrious to the environment
Impenetrable, impassible, disconnected

Disconnected, disconnected

Mentally abducted
The peace was short lived
Insalubrious to the environment
Impenetrable, impassible, disconnected

A unity your Messiah pre claimed?
A unity your Messiah pre claimed?
A unity your Messiah pre claimed?

It's a test case, tighten the noose
It's a test phase, divided once again

I may be the one wearing a mask
I may be the one wearing a mask
I may be the one wearing a mask

But I can see through yours just as clearly! 

Just as clearly... Just as clearly...
