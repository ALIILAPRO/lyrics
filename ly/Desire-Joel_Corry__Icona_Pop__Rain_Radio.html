		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
Close your eyes and kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Close your eyes, don't fight it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
Close your eyes and kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Close your eyes, don't fight it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
Close your eyes and kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Close your eyes, don't fight it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

So, we run
Run 'til we see the light
Holdin' on
Yeah, I'll make you feel tonight

Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
Close your eyes and kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Close your eyes, don't fight it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
Close your eyes and kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Close your eyes, don't fight it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

Get into the, to the, to the, darkest of desire
Eyes and kiss me, kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Follow me, we ride it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

I need you alone, I need you alone
I need you
I need you alone
I need you alone, I need you alone
I need you
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
Close your eyes and kiss me while we're walking on the wire
Follow me, we ride it
Close your eyes, don't fight it
Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire

Follow me into the deepest, darkest of desire
