		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What color is death?
The shade of an ice pick sinking into flesh
Sex-n-sex-n-sex-n-death
I don't want you

I want your flesh
Close my eyes and dream of death
Slip away and take a breath
Rivers running dark and cool

How can nothingness be cruel?
What color is death?
The shade of an ice pick sinking into flesh
Sex-n-sex-n-sex-n-death

I don't want you
I want your flesh
Close my eyes and dream of death
Slip away and take a breath

Rivers running dark and cool
How can nothingness be cruel?
Trip with me and meet the sun
Orgasm of light

Suck the world inside yourself
Spitting forth the night
Douse their minds in gasoline
Drop the burning match

Angel alien love
I wait for them to 
I listen to the trees
They hum and hold hands with the moon

Insects whisper sweet nothings
The solar system blooms
The skulls of babies grow within
The garden of the soul

Where the girls run barefoot and all life lives uncontrolled
Come on baby let's kick back and bleed with me awhile
Never mind the cold black truth
That stains the kitchen tile

Come on baby let's kick back and bleed with me awhile
Never mind the cold black truth
That stains the kitchen tile
