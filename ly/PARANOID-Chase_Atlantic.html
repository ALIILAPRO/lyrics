		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cold eyes, all my demons dance through the motherfuckin' night time
Said I wouldn't sniff it, took a whole line
Poison in my brain, feel it creepin' through on both sides, oh my
I'm three pills down and wide the fuck awake
In three more hours, been up for seven days
I can see the moon in the trees, take a deep breath in, hyperventilate

Talkin' paparazzi doin' flex (let's go)
Uh, brand new Massaratti with the tint
Got a twenty-inch blade, God forgive me if I sin (brr)
Did it once, I might do it again, yeah, yeah

Devil lookin' at me sideways
Got seven eyes staring through the driveway
Whoa, seven cowboys hittin' highways
Open up your eyes, let 'em dilate, yeah, yeah

Now I'm lyin' here awake
Sippin' Hennesy to wash away the pain 
'Cause I'm paranoid
I'm paranoid, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Take the gun right out the safe
Put it up against my head and blow my brains
'Cause I'm paranoid
I'm paranoid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, I'ma go
She just hid the gun and now she's lyin' on the floor
Whoa
Blood is drippin' down my throat
I can hear them knockin'
I got demons at my door
Just, just promise me you won't let them inside
Yeah, I don't deal with situations lightly 
I've never been the type to run and hide
So I'ma let these bullets fly if you try me, I've been

Lyin' here awake
Sippin' Hennesy to wash away the pain 
'Cause I'm paranoid
I'm paranoid, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
I'll take the gun right out the safe
Put it up against my head and blow my brains
'Cause I'm paranoid
I'm paranoid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now I'm lyin' here awake
Sippin' Hennesy to drown out the pain
'Cause I'm paranoid
I'm paranoid, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
I'll take the gun right out the safe
Put it up against my head and blow my brains
'Cause I'm paranoid
I've been so fuckin' paranoid
I'm paranoid

Shit, I'm paranoid
Paranoid, ooh-ooh

Lyin' here awake
Sippin' Hennesy to wash away the pain 
paranoid
I'm paranoid
Oh 
I'll take the gun right out the safe
Put it up against my head and blow my brains
'Cause I'm paranoid
