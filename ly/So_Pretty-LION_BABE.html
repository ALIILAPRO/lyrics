		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know sometimes 
I walk up to the mirror
And I take a look in the mirror
Checkin out the person I see
And I say oh my, oh my
Look at you
Ooo baby

You're so pretty, oh baby
You're so pretty, oh baby

Oh, I'm feelin' nice
Such a delight
Don't gotta check it twice
Oh no no no

And yeah I'm feelin you 
Which means I'm feelin me
Give them a lot to see 
Wanna watch you go go go go 

You're so pretty, oh baby
You're so pretty, oh baby 

Oh, come on and take a look now honey
I feel like lots'a money
And they all want some from me
(Take that, take that)

And nothing can stop whats mine
Out on the work and grind
You know i shine every time 
(Gimme that, gimme that)

And you know when I'm walking down the street
And the boys eyeing me, and the girls eyeing me
All the people eyeing me
And I know they thinkin to themselves
Look at her, look it at her, 
Oh my, oh baby

You're so pretty, oh baby
You're so pretty, oh baby 

Platform boots and my new eyeliner
Yeah these dudes never seen none finer
Movin' real cute, wanna rewind her
Back it up back it up, wine and dine her 

Tyra Banksy when she's posing
Mona lisa yea she's chosen
Work of art it's pure devotion
Back it up, class it up, keep it going 

Must confess, oh so blessed
No time or space for all that stress
Appreciation in my chest
And I'm lookin my best, best, best, yes

Pretty boys look left 
(Look left)
Pretty women hang tight 
(Hang to tight)
Walk to the floor
(Walk, walk)
Turn it out all night
(All night)

Pretty boys look left
(Look left)
Pretty women hang tight 
(Hang to tight)
Walk to the floor
(Walk it out)
Turn it out all night

You're so pretty, oh baby
You're so pretty, oh baby
