		  Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Bravehearts, Bravehearts

Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts

Uh
Fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide, death row
Ridin' slow-mo in a four door with no hoes
Kickin' it toe to toe with the po-po
All of the smoke that I blow
I'll become a no-show
Oddy Nuff da $now Leopard got your
Hoe froze in a snow globe
Leave 'em hollering, "Oh no!"
More so when I pour up
When I glow up, don't show up
You know what? Don't throw
Up the motherfucking set
59 on the grey, place a bet
Slit wrist same color as the 'Vette, uh
Cigarette smoke etiquette
Forget the Old Testament
I'm more reckless than the
Almighty Heaven sent
Yeah, we never fuckin' met again
Snake skin belt cuttin' off my blood flow
Check the motherfuckin' severance
Jacket full of bullets
Check the motherfucking letterman

Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high

Ticky-ticky time
That's why it's $uicide 'til
The fucking afterlife
Keepin' a fucking knife right
Next to the seat
Thinkin' you wanna die when you
Move close to me
Nosebleeds for the dope fiends
Sleepin' next to me
Hopefully, I'ma just be in a bad dream
But it seems that the codeine turned
Me into a dope fiend
Now Iâ€™m ridin' in a nightmare
As my mind screams
For that mo' money, mo' murder
Mo' junkies, mo' servin', mo' runnin'
No turnin', no swervin' on an ice-cold road
Yung $carecrow be lookin' like death row
Blood-colored bathrobe with an ice-cold ho
Ya know? Fifty-nine grey killers lookin' for
A fucking homicide

Life's a bitch, and then you die
That's why we get high
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
Bravehearts, Bravehearts
