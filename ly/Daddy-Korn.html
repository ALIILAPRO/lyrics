		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mother, please forgive me
I just had to get out all my pain and suffering
Now that I am done
Remember I will always love you
I'm your son

Little child
Looking so pretty
Come out and play
I'll be your daddy

Innocent child
Looking so sweet
I'll rape your mind 
And now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child

I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy why your own child?

Little child
Looking so pretty
Come out and play
I'll be your daddy

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child

I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why?

It's alright

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child

I weep, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, no one hit me
And raped your own child

I'm sick, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
You fucked your own child

I speak, no one hears me
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, no one hears me
Mommy, why your own child?

I didn't touch you there
Mommy said she didn't care
I didn't touch you there
That's why mommy stopped and stared

Little child
Looking so sweet
I rape your mind
And now your flesh I reap

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, as a child
Tied down, "That's a good boy"
And fuck, your own child

I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why your own child?

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watching
Daddy, why your own child?

Yeah, I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why your own child?

You raped, I feel dirty
It hurt, not a liar
My God, saw you watching
Mommy, why your own child?

I scream, no one hears me
It hurt, I'm not a liar
My God, saw you watch
Mommy, why?

I fuckin' hate you
Oh, you fucker
Motherfucker, I fuckin' hate you 
Fuck you, you son of a bitch
You fuckin' ruined my life
I wanted to die
I'm sick of it, motherfucker
You fuckin' bitch
I hate you
I fuckin' hate you
I hate you
Piece of shit
Why?

When I awake I'll see Thy face
When I awake I will see Thy light
When I awake I'll see Thy face
When I awake I will see Thy light

Mother, awake me from my dreams
Mother, awake me in Thy light
Hand in hand we are dancing together
Dancing together in Thy Light

When I awake I'll see Thy face
When I awake I will see Thy light
When I awake I'll see Thy face
When I awake I will see Thy light

Mother, awake me from my dreams
Mother, awake me in Thy light
Hand in hand
