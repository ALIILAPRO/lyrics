		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was alone 
I just couldn't be found
I want my life to be ordinary 
I was alone, I just couldn't be found
No more
No more 

I was alone 
I just couldn't be found
I want my life to be ordinary 
I was alone, I just couldn't be found
No more
No more

I was alone 
I just couldn't be found
I want my life to be ordinary 
I was alone, I just couldn't be found
No more
No more 

I was alone 
I just couldn't be found
I want my life to be ordinary 
I was alone, I just couldn't be found
No more
No more 

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah (I was alone, I just couldn't be found)
Hey, hey (I want my life to be ordinary)
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah (I was alone, I just couldn't be found)
Hey, ooh (no more, no more)

I was alone 
I just couldn't be found
I want my life to be ordinary 
I was alone, I just couldn't be found
No more
No more 

I was alone 
I just couldn't be found
I want my life to be ordinary 
I was alone, I just couldn't be found
No more
No more
