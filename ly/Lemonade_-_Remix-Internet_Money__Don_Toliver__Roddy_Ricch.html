		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag (ooh)
College girls, give a nigga head in my Rafs (ooh)
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey

Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (yeah)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

Why? (Yeah-yeah-yeah) why?
Why you wanna waste my time?
I can tell you really hate your life
Bitch, your watch the same as mine
(Oh, yeah) I can't relate
Designer frames, I'm blind today
(Oh, oh) I'm never late
The money callin', you needed space

Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag (ooh)
College girls, give a nigga head in my Rafs (ooh)
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
These bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey

Off the juice (juice), codeine got me trippin' (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (ooh)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

Yeah, this codeine got me trippin' (codeine got me trippin')
Wish it was over, I've been rollin' for a minute
I got the broad, she want the m√©nage inside the pla-a-ace
Sixty-eight charger, duckin' the laws, I might do the race
I like to ride in my new bag and I got a new bitch in my lap
Counting up the blue strips with two straps, yeah, yeah
Huh, slide in the Lambo', I slide in the Porsches
Check my garage, I got too many choices (too many)
Walk around, got a couple mills stuffed in my bag
Stripper hoes all in my Rolls, shakin' they ass (huh)
We just ran a tab up at Nobu
You said that you never got high, I'ma show you

Xanny bars, suicide door, brand new bag
College girls, give a nigga head in my Rafs (ooh)
Rockstar life, so much money it'll make you laugh, hey
The bitches, they hate, and you can't miss what you never had, hey, hey

Off the juice (juice), codeine got me tripping (juice)
Copped the coupe (coupe), woke up, roof is missin' (ooh)
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'
Ice (ice), lemonade, my neck was drippin'

Hey, yeah, yeah
