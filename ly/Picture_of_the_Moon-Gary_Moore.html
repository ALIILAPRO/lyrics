		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picture of the moon 
You gave to me that night. 
The stars were out to play, 
The moon was shining bright. 
If only I had known 
That it would end so soon. 
I was left with a picture of the moon. 

The sound of soft guitars 
Beneath the Spanish skies. 
Across the candle lights 
The sadness in your eyes. 
If only I had known 
That it would end so soon. 
I was left with a picture of the moon. 

Picture of the moon 
You gave to me that night. 
The stars were out to play, 
The moon was shining bright. 
However could I know 
That it would end so soon? 
I was left with a picture of the moon. 
I was left with a picture of the moon. 
All that's left is a picture of the moon.
