		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, baby, baby
From the day I saw you
I really, really wanted to catch your eye
Somethin' special 'bout you
I must really like you
'Cause not a lot of guys are worth my time, oh
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
It's getting kind of crazy
'Cause you are taking over my mind

And it feels like, ooh
You don't know my name
I swear, it feels like, ooh
You don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

Oh, baby, baby, baby
I see us on our first date
You're doing everything that makes me smile
And when we had our first kiss
It happened on a Thursday
Ooh, it set my soul on fire
Ooh, baby, baby, baby
I can't wait for the first time
My imagination's running wild

It feels like, ooh
You don't know my name
And I swear it, baby, it feels like, ooh
You don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)

I'm sayin', he don't even know what he's doin' to me
Got me feelin' all crazy inside
I'm feelin' like, oh
Doing more than I've ever done
For anyone's attention
Take notice of what's in front of you
'Cause did I mention (oh) 
You bout' to miss a good thing?
And you'll never know how good it feels
To have all of my affection
And you'll never get a chance to experience my lovin' (oh)
'Cause my lovin' feels like

Ooh
You don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go)
And I swear (will you ever know?) 
It feels like
Ooh
You don't my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go) oh
(Will you ever know?) 

Will you ever know it?
No, no, no, no, no
No, no
Will you ever know it?

Well, I'ma have to just go 'head and call this boy
Hello? 
Can I speak to, to Michael?
Oh hey, how you doing?
Uh, I feel kinda silly doing this, but, uh
This is the waitress from the coffee house on 39th and Lennox
You know, the one with the braids?
Yeah, well, I see you on Wednesdays all the time
You come in every Wednesday on your lunch break, I think
And you always order the special with the hot chocolate
My manager be tripping and stuff
Talking 'bout we gotta use water but
I always use some milk and cream for you 'cause
I think you're kinda sweet
Anyway, you always got on some fly blue suit
And your cuff links are shining all bright
So, what you do? Oh, word? Yeah, that's interesting
Look, man, I mean, I don't wanna waste your time, but
I know girls don't usually do this
But I was wondering if maybe we could get together
Outside the restaurant one day?
You know 'cause I do look a lot different outside my work clothes and
I mean, we could just go across the street to the park right here
Wait, hold up, my, my cell phone breaking up, hold up
Can you hear me now? Yeah
So, what day did you say?
Oh, yeah, Thursday's perfect, man

And it feels like ooh
You don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go) baby 
(Will you ever know?) Baby, I swear, it's like, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?) No, no, no
And it feels like, ooh
But you don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
And I swear on my mother and father it feels like, ooh
You don't know my name
('Round and 'round and 'round we go, will you ever know?)
