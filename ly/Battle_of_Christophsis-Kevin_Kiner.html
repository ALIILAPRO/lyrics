		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world was on fire
No one could save me but you
It's strange what desire
Will make foolish people do
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you

No I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
And I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)

What a wicked game to play
To make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do
To let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you

And I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you

The World was on fire
No one could save me but you
It's strange what desire
Will make foolish people do
No I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I never dreamed
That I'd lose somebody like you

No I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
No I don't want to fall in love
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
With you
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)

No I (This girl is only gonna break your heart)
(This girl is only gonna break your heart)
Nobody loves no one
