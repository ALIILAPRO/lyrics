		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Metro Boomin want some more nigga

I used to hate going back to class in the same clothes
Now, I don't wear shit twice 'cause popping tags is all I know
She said, "You've been gone for too long, I know that you been fucking hoes"
But I been in the studio 'cause chasing bags is all I know
Me and Metro popping addys, been up for four nights in a row
All you gotta do is text the addy and I'mma fill this bitch with dope
Everytime I show off I want a hundred or better for a show
Used to have one pair of Jordan's
Now I wear designer on my toes
Remember that bitch ain't wanna fuck me
Now I got a phone that be filled up with hoes
I used to have to wear the same shirt
Now I got a closet full of clothes
Most my homies still doing dirt and they on the road selling dope
Body can't even cross over the border, said he wanna join me on the road

All this money got you in your feelings
I just copped a coupe to cop the ceiling, oh yeah
When you leave town, your bitch can't wait to see me
You know everything about me, you wanna be me, oh yeah

I blew a check, you know
I bought a whip, you know
I fucked your bitch, you know
I'm getting rich, you know
Bought a ice chain, you know
Bought designer frames and you know
I pop and I sip, you know
Get the bag and I dip, you know

He don't know what to do with it
Heard he only go two minutes
You been acting brand new with it
Bitch you know I know who hit it
Girl I'mma fuck you 'til the room spinning
Block hot, you was cool with it
New crib with the pool in it
Shit ain't the same without you in it
Always knew you would switch on me
Thought my mind was playing tricks on me
For the Rolls and the big Rollies
I was big homies' big homie
Cage me up, I turn Mick Foley
15 with the bricks on me
Millionaire with the stick on me
Got the sauce, got the drip on me
Versace sweater, Gucci link on it
Mink rugs, spilling drinks on it
I was broke just the other day
This type of shit make you think, don't it
I made a list of all the hoes I hit
Stoner shit just so I don't forget
Once I really get a hold of it
I ain't ever letting go of it (No!)

All this money got you in your feelings
I just copped a coupe to cop the ceiling, oh yeah
When you leave town, your bitch can't wait to see me
You know everything about me, you wanna be me, oh yeah

I blew a check, you know
I bought a whip, you know
I fucked your bitch, you know
I'm getting rich, you know
Bought a ice chain, you know
Bought designer frames and you know
I pop and I sip, you know
Get the bag and I dip, you know
