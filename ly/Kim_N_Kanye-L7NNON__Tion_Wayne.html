		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, CZR, you did a mazza still
Gotcha
Grrt, ayy, mh-mm, ayy, ayy, uh, yo

Like my wap back filled to the brim? (mm)
Shake that back, rah, you been in the gym?
We don't need money like Kanye
Becah we still take Kim
Body look cute (sei bem)
Look at that view (nós tem)
Who's that yute? (Ninguém)
Put him on mute (mh-mm)

Pelos acesso, palmeando tudo
Correndo de Nike, fazendo dinheiro
Eu quase não peço, mano, eu tenho tudo
Pergunta quem manda no Rio de Janeiro
Subi sem porte, sem Glock
Sem G3, Fal, sem AK
Nunca foi sorte, medo da morta
Aqui nós não tem, manda tentar
Barulho de tiro, sirene
Cachorro latindo, não deve, não teme
Bigode fino, madame treme
Blusa de time, sempre de Kenner

Mh-mm, you know it's only millis in my bank account (In my bank account)
RJ city, criminal (criminal)
Tion Wayne (Tion Wayne), L7 (L7)
Like a AK-47, bow, bow, bow
Son of City of God, man (of God, man)
Yo, don't touch my fam (my fam)
Don't touch my fam (my fam)
You don't know my gang

Like my wap back filled to the brim? (mm)
Shake that back, rah, you been in the gym?
We don't need money like Kanye
Becah we still take Kim
Body look cute (sei bem)
Look at that view (nós tem)
Who's that yute? (Ninguém)
Put him on mute (mh-mm)

Why everybody hate like Chris? (mh-mm)
Becah my rocks are messy (baow)
My young boy tucked with a Smith (boom-boom)
Becah he just wan' slap it
Even though I'm rich, man, I just done a shavin' (woo)
Where'd you think I got bad habits? (woo)
If she got bum and the breasts, that's package
Swear that I need a gyal from Paris (glah, glah)
Where're you from? What's your ends? (ayy)
Don't pretend, back the skeng (baow)
I got Brazilian girls sayin', Peng (boom)
And when they come, better bring some friends (friends)
If she got a big back, I rate
If money make you move your arse, then shake
Better mind out that your heart don't break
T-Wayne, you know my name hold weight
Saw a guy that I robbed in prison (mh-mm)
But still I'm good (ayy)
Really at a bond like double-0-7 (baow)
'Til they shit got took
All these million records I'm sellin', but I really ain't left my hood (boom, boom)
Even though I got rich off this music, still we will get 'em shook (glah, glah)
Yo, fifteen bags for some trainers
Fifty bag for the day-date
Can't believe I went jail doing basic (ayy)
Hundred plus for the spaceship (spaceship)
I can't risk my status, so we show the 'matic upgraded (ayy)
Pree the way batty just shake, outrageous (baow)
She know gyal with the big back, my favorite

Like my wap back filled to the brim? (mm)
Shake that back, rah, you been in the gym?
We don't need money like Kanye
Becah we still take Kim
Body look cute (sei bem)
Look at that view (nós tem)
Who's that yute? (Ninguém)
Put him on mute (mh-mm)
Like my wap back filled to the brim? (mm)
Shake that back, rah, you been in the gym?
We don't need money like Kanye
Becah we still take Kim

Ayy, CZR, you did a mazza still
Gotcha
