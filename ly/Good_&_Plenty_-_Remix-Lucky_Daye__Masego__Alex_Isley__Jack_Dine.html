		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good and plenty like a Georgia peach tree
Picking sweet Tweet
Behind the scenes running down your knees
Water flooding in, feel the feeling up to my tee
I looked over to the left
I think we should let it rain tonight
Know I love it when we slip and slide
Don't stop loving got a love supply
Sleep wake up and repeat

You'll get every little bit
You ain't never seen a drip like this
Heaven at your fingertips
Don't you let a minute slip just

Say you'll have me
Oh, taste and see
Hope you don't sleep on me
I've got good and plenty

Inhabit all the spaces in-between
It's magic when I taste your inner being
An average day is spent all in the sheets
Emphatic when I tell you what you mean to me

Chemistry
Intimate memories
Every time I give you all my
Energy
Emphasis never sleep

I seen all this before in my mind
All I ask is take your sweet time
Roam around and see what you find
Long as I can call it mine
Oh I can give you everything you dream about
Let me be the one to reassure that you'll never run out
Just

Say you'll have me
Oh, taste and see
Hope you don't sleep on me
I've got good and plenty
