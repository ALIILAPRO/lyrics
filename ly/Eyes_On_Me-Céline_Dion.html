		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that once in love
You don't think of the devil who's inside
And maybe it'll come one day
When you'll feel safe and I won't have the time

You hear what you wanna hear
Blink once, I could disappear
Some rules to the game won't make it
Right for both of us

Just say what you wanna say
I've got it to give away
We both want to make it last
So keep your eyes on me, your eyes on me

It's not an illusion that you're the one
And I have fallen deep
I said it from the start, when we're apart
You must only think of me

Temptation is all around
Take good care of what you found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep

You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine, so you better say yeah

No matter what you think I need
No, it doesn't really matter what you once believed
Say, yeah
I wanna be the air you breathe
Yeah, you better be everything you said you'd be
So you better say, yeah

I've gotta be your only one or we can't go on
No matter what you think I need
You better keep your eyes on me

And say that you want me
Open up your heart even if it's hard
Say that you need me
Better let him know, baby, don't put on a show

You say that you need me
Tell him how you feel, let him know it's real
And if you love me
Never turn your back (never turn your back), gonna keep my eyes on us

Temptation is all around (oh, no)
Take good care of what you found
That's why when I turn around
You better keep

You better keep your eyes on me
No matter what you think I need
No matter what you once believed
If you're mine, so you better say yeah

No matter what you think I need
No, it doesn't really matter what you once believed
Say, yeah
I wanna be the air you breathe
Yeah, you better be everything you said you'd be
Better keep

I've gotta be your only one or we can't go on (better keep)
No matter what you think I need (your eyes on me)
Better keep your eyes on me
Your eyes on me, your eyes on me
