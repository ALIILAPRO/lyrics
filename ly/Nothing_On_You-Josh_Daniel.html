		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing on you
A better way for me to say
That my smile just ain't the same anymore
Nothing on you
A feeling that's so hard to find
A love that drove us crazy
A hundred times

I wish that I could see that smile again
This emptiness is starting to make sense
I just can't love no-one, as hard, as strong, as true
'Cause all the world have nothing on you

I wish that we could dance the way we danced
Remember when we laughed until we cried
I just can't love no-one, as hard, as strong, as true
'Cause all the world have nothing on you

But maybe there's still time
And maybe there's still a chance
For us to love again
I want to love again

I wish that we could dance the way we danced
Remember when we laughed until we cried
I just can't love no-one, as hard, as strong, as true
'Cause all the world have nothing
Oh, all the world have nothing on you
