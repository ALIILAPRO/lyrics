		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1: 

Got introduced to you by a friend 

You were cute and all that  baby you set the trend 

Yes you did oh 

The next thing I know we're down at the cinema 

We're sitting there  you said you love me 

What's that about? 



Verse 2: 

You're moving too fast  I don't understand you 

I'm not ready yet  baby I can't pretend 

No I can't 

The best I can do is tell you to talk to me 

It's possible  eventual 

Love will find a way 

Love will find a way... 



CHORUS: 

Don't say you love me 

You don't even know me 

If you really want me 

Then give me some time 

Don't go there baby 

Not before I'm ready 

Don't say your heart's in a hurry 

It's not like we're gonna get married 

Give me, give me some time 



Verse 3: 

Here's how I play, here's where you stand 

Here's what to prove to get any further than where it's been 

I'll make it clear, not gonna tell you twice 

Take it slow, you keep pushing me 

You're pushing me away 

Pushing me away... 



CHORUS 



BRIDGE: 

oooo, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 

na, na, na, na, na, na 

oooo, na, na, na, na, na, na, na 

na, na, na, na, na, na, na 



Don't say you love me 

You don't even know me baby... 



Baby don't say love me, baby 

Give me some time... 



CHORUS (repeat until fade out)
