		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke to see 
The flames all bearing down on me 
These walls they will be 
Utterly destroyed with me 

Let free 
To burn inside my head 
They won't let go 
And put all its pain inside my head 
At rest oh 

Can you see them 
They cut a desperate figure through my heart 
Oh can't you see 
They're taking over 
Tearing every trace of us apart 
So let them be 
Just leave them 

As far as I can see 
They're all laid bare and bearing down on me 
I know how it has to be 
Just lie down and let them come to me 
And put all this pain inside my head 
At rest oh 

Can you see them 
They cut a desperate figure through my heart 
Oh can't you see 
They're taking over 
Tearing every trace of us apart 
So let them be 

Can you see them 
They cut a desperate figure through my heart 
Oh can't you see 
They're taking over 
Tearing every trace of us apart 
So leave them be
