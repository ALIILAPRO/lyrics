		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said you'd spend two weeks at my place
And it turned into a month
It's kinda weird (it's kinda weird)
You're still here (you're still here)
Runnin' out of ways to tell you
I'm not who I was when we first met
Two years (two years)
Ago

I'm exhausted running on exhaust
It's getting really toxic being yours
I'm so nauseous and it's hard to be cautious
Baby, we're a moshpit, oh

If I take an elbow to the face
One more time, I think I'll break
I'm not saying I'm a saint, but you're hell
If I take a kick right to the chest
One more time then you'll be dead to me
I can't be your life anymore

Oh
I can't be your life anymore

I don't know how many more times
I can come home to your mess
And not freak out
Oh

I'm exhausted running on exhaust
It's getting really toxic being yours
I'm so nauseous and it's hard to be cautious
Baby, we're a moshpit, oh

If I take an elbow to the face
One more time, I think I'll break
I'm not saying I'm a saint, but you're hell
If I take a kick right to the chest
One more time then you'll be dead to me
I can't be your life anymore (I can't be your life anymore)

Stop this moshpit
I wanna get out
'Cause if I'm honest, I'm just
Sick of falling down
So won't you stop this moshpit?
I'm not having fun anymore, oh

Oh
I can't be your life anymore

If I take an elbow to the face
One more time, I think I'll break (oh)
I'm not saying I'm a saint, but you're hell (but you're hell)
If I take a kick right to the chest (to the chest)
One more time then you'll be dead to me (hey, hey)
I can't be your life anymore (I can't be your life anymore)

Stop this moshpit
I wanna get out
'Cause if I'm honest, I'm just
Sick of falling down
So won't you stop this moshpit?
I'm not having fun anymore, oh
