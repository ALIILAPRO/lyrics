		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hot in
So hot in here
So hot in
(Ah)
Oh

Come on, shake that monkey (uh)
Put dick in your life if you're lonely (mm-hmm)
Bring your friend 'cause I know that you want me (uh)
Uh, give it to her 'til the mornin'
I love when you do that there
Pretty face, small waist with your feet in the air
Like, uh, love when they stop and stare
All the ugly bitches lookin', like, "That ain't fair"
Like, uh, hood bitches swing they hair
Grip the sheets with them long-ass fingernails
Like, uh, hold up, uh, give it to 'em
Uh, uh, uh, uh (oh)

It's getting hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Get naked, bitch, shake it (ayy)
Bring big mama if she can take it
I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Ring around the rosie, touch her toes and put it on me
Peter Piper, pick a pickle dinner when she hungry
Long, long comer, nigga, man, it's been a whole week
I ain't scared that he gon' put that iron on me
Uh-oh, get hit with the Glockie (boom, bop)
He ain't see it, it come from out the pocket
I've been waiting to shoot this nigga for so long
Uh, get a little, ah, ah
When the Glock go, pa-pa (oh)
I feel like bustin' loose
Red bottoms on, fuckin' her outta her shoes (oh)

It's getting hot in here (so hot)
So take off all your clothes
I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off
Get naked, bitch, shake it (yeah)
Bring big mama if she can take it (come here)
I am getting so hot, I wanna take my clothes off

Uh, get a little, ah, ah
When that Glock go, pa-pa (let it hang all out, so hot)
Get a little, ah, ah
When that Glock go, pa-pa (let it just fall out)
Get a little, ah, ah
When that Glock go, pa-pa (let it hang all out, so hot)
Get a little, ah, ah
When that Glock go, pa-pa (Oh)
