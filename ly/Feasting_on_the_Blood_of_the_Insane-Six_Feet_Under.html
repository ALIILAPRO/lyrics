		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark of the night I search for
The mindless wretches of society
To drink of their blood and feast upon their flesh
Time to break cause you'll never take this

Lots of stiffs and blood, what a sickening mess
Feasting on the blood of the insane
Here's another tale of the fucking deranged
Psychotic, violent another one dead, blood clotted

Lust for blood a need for insanity
Die in the slaughter, time to tap an artery
Brain withered another empty thought
I will kill again and never be caught

Face to face with the monster of hate
Another victim, another piece of meat
Time to kill no one gets out alive
Another scream, another mother fucker dies

First I kill and then I feed, can't deny my blood lust need
A son of a bitch 3rd generation
Schooled in the art of human strangulation
Only one thing will control my pain

That's to drink the blood of the insane
My need for blood, drives me to kill
Another dying, bleeding for my lust
Feed on the dead, feed on the dead, feed on the dead

I've got to get the blood flowing
Just a bit of guts and gore
Indulgence in the blood of freaks
Take another dose of the bloodlust

To rip apart and shred the dead
Teeth stuck in, another victim
Blood bath, I'm gonna kill again
I am the walking dead

Concentrated hate and fear and pain
Inside of me the same
It's gonna go on and on and on
A new life is born

Broken bodies start now rotting
No way to stop the feeding
Only one way to control my pain
Feasting on the blood of the insane

My need for blood, drives me to kill
Another dying, bleeding for my lust
Feed on the dead, feed on the dead, feed on the dead
