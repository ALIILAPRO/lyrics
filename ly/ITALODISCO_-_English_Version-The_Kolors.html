		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try to answer my desires
And then stay up late with synthesisers
In the studio
But something's missing in the wires
It's like the music's lost the fire
Had it all, let it go
When you were here, I never feared
Everything could disappear
I would sit alone in silence (silence)
I need to get back to the sound
That can lift me off the ground
I pray the speakers give my guidance (guidance)

I trust you more than words can say
More than life, more than any DJ

Let's go, I can't resist-o
Italodisco, I must insist-o
Maybe we could start just by taking it slow
Then up the tempo under the moon's glow
Like moving shadows
I know it's not Ibiza
Four on the floor with my Señorita
Got me looking high and low, I can't see her
But every time I think, I do or I think of you
I hear Italodisco

I'm so distracted, overthinking
So many questions in my head
Why'd you leave?
Where'd you go?
I'm on the dance floor, but it's sinking
And I don't think my heart will float
When you were here I had no fear
But always music in my ears
You made my heart beat like no others

I miss you more than words can say
More than life, more than any DJ

Let's go, I can't resist-o
Italodisco, I must insist-o
Maybe we could start just by taking it slow
Then up the tempo under the moon's glow
Like moving shadows
I know it's not Ibiza
Four on the floor with my Señorita
Got me looking high and low, I can't see her
But every time I think, I do or I think of you
I hear Italodisco

Disco
Suona Italodisco
Disco
Suona Italodisco

Tonight
We're gonna dance till the sunrise
Moroder is in my blood
And my heart beats to the rhythm of the Disco
Italodisco

I know it's not Ibiza
Four on the floor with my Señorita
Got me looking high and low, I can't see her
But every time I think, I do or I think of you
I hear Italodisco

I hear Italodisco

But every time I think, I do or I think of you
I hear Italodisco
