		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Watching you from the front porch playing
Bundled up under snowflakes falling
It takes me back to when I was a kid
Sliding down the driveway on a trash can lid
When the only thing that matter was counting the days
Til' Santa came

I'm seeing Christmas through your eyes
Yeah, its been a while
The joy and wonder of your smile
Such a precious child
Suddenly I'm drifting back in time
Seeing Christmas through your eyes

Everyone in their reindeer jammies
Cuddled up watching homemade movies
You look up and ask, "Is that one you?"
"Yeah that was me, back in '92"
And I still remember how hard it was to fall asleep 
On Christmas eve

I'm seeing Christmas through your eyes
Yeah, its been a while
The joy and wonder of your smile
Such a precious child
Suddenly I'm drifting back in time
Seeing Christmas through your eyes

This year there is an innocence you helped me to find
Oh, I'm 
I'm seeing Christmas through your eyes
Yeah, its been a while
The joy and wonder of your smile
Such a precious child
And suddenly I'm drifting back in time
Seeing Christmas through your eyes

Ooh, Christmas through your eyes
Mmhm
