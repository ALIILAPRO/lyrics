		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say everything can be replaced
But every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man that put me here

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall

Say, I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any way now
I shall be released

Oh yeah
But you know, whoa
Ooh yeah

They're standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud
Crying out he has been framed

I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any way now
I shall be released

Everybody say with me

I see my light come shining
What about west or east
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
