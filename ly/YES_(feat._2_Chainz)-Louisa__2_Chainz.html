		  2 Chainz

Yeah whatever it is, you been thinking 'bout me
I ain't playing 'round no more
And I guess you found out that I ain't that innocent
Ah, but what you waiting for?
Hey girls, what's up?
She bad, hands up
Yo boys, uh uh
Ease back, show love

Feeling so hot, wear a little less
Got a little something I'ma get off my chest
Blame it on my body, got you obsessed
Do it all night, better give me respect
We're 20 deep up on this floor
We getting wild, yeah, we getting raw
No one can breathe, still want some more
If you a freak like me one time, lemme hear you say yes

Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup
We about to get this started
(Yes)
If you know you can't stop and you know you won't stop
Take it to the after party
(Yes)
Now we getting all wet
Love it when I feel sweat dripping all over my body
(Yes)
(Yes)

(Yes) I don't care what it is, you been thinking 'bout me
I'ma get it on this floor
Girls, if you're tired of being so damn innocent
Tell me, what you waiting for? Oh
Hey girls, what's up?
She bad, hands up
Yo boys, uh uh
Ease back, show love

Feeling so hot, wear a little less
Got a little (uh) I'ma get off my chest
Blame it on my body, got you obsessed
Do it all night, better give me respect
We're 20 deep up on this floor
We getting wild, yeah, we getting raw
No one can breathe, still want some more
If you a freak like me one time, lemme hear you say yes

Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup
We about to get this started

If you know you can't stop and you know you won't stop

(Yes) 2 Chainz
Yo, did that grown man talk
Tryna get kicking so I brought my own phone
Real kamasutra, wearing Comme des Gar√ßons
This a Hurricane Maria doing songs of reggaeton
I am beyond
I am the truth, shawty I am the one
Tattoos of bible verses on my arm
Yeah baby, you the bomb
Somebody ring the alarm

Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup
We about to get this started
If you know you can't stop and you know you won't stop
Take it to the after party
(Yes)
Now we getting all wet
Love it when I feel sweat dripping all over my body
(Yes)
(Yes)

Come on, put your hands up
Here with all my friends, yup

If you know you can't stop and you know you won't stop

Now we getting all wet
Love it when I feel sweat dripping all over my body
(Yes)
(Yes)
