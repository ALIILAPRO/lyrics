		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I see her, PX

Swear I'm gone, gettin' gone with my niggas (yeah)
We hit the club, niggas cups full of jealous (yeah)
We in the back and we muggin' to T.I. (you know it)
And I'm with a bad bitch and I got an idea (oh yeah)

I'll still say, this bitch looks like Lindsay Lohan (Lindsay Lohan)
She gets down just like Lindsay Lohan (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Round the block, she's not showin' nothin'
That bitch bad, watch her blow a whole band

She gets her way (way, way, way)
(It's like every time)
(Like any time of day)
(In every single way) girl, when she gets her way (way, way, way)
(Yeah, that's just how she ball)
(That's just how she hustles)
(No clue how she does it)
She gets her way, way

Shawty said she wanna roll with the Sauga City come up (ride with the come up)
She wasn't on a roll, now she roll with a winner (rollin' marijuana, ooh, yeah)
See them dark-skin girls in them light-skin crews
Yeah, we see you (see you, baby)
But she the light-skin girl in a light-skin crew (yeah)
She don't know what to do

I'll still say, this bitch looks like Lindsay Lohan (Lindsay Lohan)
She gets down just like Lindsay Lohan (just like Lindsay Lo')
Round the block, she's not showin' nothin' (not showin' nothin)
That bitch bad, watch her blow a whole band

She gets her way (way, way, way)
(It's like every time)
(Like any time of day)
(In every single way) girl, when she gets her way (way, way, way)
(Yeah, that's just how she ball)
(That's just how she hustles)
(No clue how she does it)
She gets her way, way (she gets her way)

She just turned twenty-five
But she wanna roll with young niggas like
Roll with the clique, oh, roll with the clique
Now she say
Gone, gettin' gone with them niggas (gone with them niggas)
Swear I just saw her say
We in the back and we muggin' to T.I (and you know it)
Swear I just saw her say
Gone, gettin' gone with them niggas
If this what she want to be gone gettin' gone (gettin' gone)
Gone, she can have her way
Oh, no, no, ooh (gone, gone, gone, baby, gone)
Yeah-yeah, yeah
No, baby
Oh, you could have your way
No, no, ooh-ooh

She gets her way (way, way, way)
(It's like every time)
(Like any time of day)
(In every single way)
Girl, when she gets her way (she gets her way, way, way)
(That's just how she ball)
(That's just how she hustles)
(No clue how she does it)
She gets her way, way
She gets her way, way 
(Party)
