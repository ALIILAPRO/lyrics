		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't help but ask,
I can't help but wonder—
Where do you lie as I watch street lights?
I can't help but ask,
I can't help but wonder—
Where do you lie as I watch street lights?
Baby it's 3am I'm coming back down,
I've been in your home town,
Looking, hearing for a sound.
Baby it's 3am I'm coming back down,
I've been in your home town,
Looking, hearing for a sound.
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me in the dark?
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me in the dark?
I can't help but ask,
I can't help but wonder—
Where do you lie as I watch street lights?
I can't help but ask,
I can't help but wonder—
Where do you lie as I watch street lights?
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me in the dark?
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me
Do you ever miss me in the dark?
