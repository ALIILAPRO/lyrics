		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Early morning, I cut my sleep as I wake in sweat
My nails run deep in the palm of my hands or they tear through the sheet, yeah
Night terrors make me jump out of bed
Memories putting my life on the fritz
They're taking me down, with no people around
Like a deer, I duck and then I'm gone, ah

Life ain't what it seem to be
Can't believe what happened to me
These scars they'll make you beautiful
Mirror mirror just give me some time
Can't stand to look at me now
These scars will fade and freaks will grow

But I'm feeling good today
Not gonna let the tears bring me down
You're cool, you are, you right
You're probably gonna start up a fight
But I'm feeling good today
I got my lipstick on, yeah
I'm a freak, so let's be freaks
Nobody's gonna, gonna, gonna bring me

Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

Life ain't what it seem to be
Can't believe what happened to me
These scars they'll make you beautiful
Mirror mirror just give me some time
Can't stand to look at me now
These scars will fade and freaks will grow

I'm casting away the years left with pain
It's leaving me here to be
The struggles they hurt, the struggles be gone
I'm free, oh
But where did the time go
Dissociate, I lay awake, well
So I shove it down your throat
Good luck trying to breath
Good things will come to me
No more shit, don't you see, don't you see
Yeah, yeah, don't you see
Don't you see

Life ain't what it seem to be
Can't believe what happened to me
These scars they'll make you beautiful
Mirror mirror just give me some time
Can't stand to look at me now

Life ain't what it seem to be
Can't believe what happened to me
These scars they'll make you beautiful
Mirror mirror just give me some time
Can't stand to look at me now
These scars will fade and freaks will grow
