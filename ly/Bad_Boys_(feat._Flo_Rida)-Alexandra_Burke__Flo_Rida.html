		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Bad boys, bad boys)
Alexandra, girl, I know what you like
(Bad boys, bad boys)
Oh, oh (bad boys, bad boys)
Hey, yeah (bad boys, bad boys)

Some people call them players
But I'm far from terrified
'Cause somehow I'm drawn to danger
And have been all of my life
It feels my heart divided
Halfway between wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't know why

Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wha)
Ooh, bad boys

Some think it's complicated
But they're straight-up fun for me
I don't need no explanation
It's nothing more than what you see here
My heart still feels divided
Halfway between wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't know why

Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wha)

I know you want me shawty 'cause I'm a (bad boy)
Hey shawty can't help it, she so so addicted to them rougher fellas
With even the alphabet she only sings the crooked letters
Let mama take all the risks
For that chemistry she like them tougher than leather
?
By any means necessary, girl
She likes them ruthless, that's my world
It's not the news, it's what I heard
To get them more the merrier
It's not a big surprise
I know them bad boys catch your eyes
Look at her walk when I go in disguise
You'll have them shawty, don't worry, you fly

Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
Yeah, the bad boys are always spinning my mind
(Ooh way, ooh wha)
I said the bad boys are always catching my eye
(Ooh way, ooh way, ooh wha)
Bad boys, bad boys
