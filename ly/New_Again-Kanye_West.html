		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I hit you with a "W-Y-D?"
You better not hit me with a "H-E-Y"
It better be like "Hiiii" with a bunch of I's
Or "Heyyy" with a bunch of Y's
I, I lived a hundred lives, uh
So, that mean I had a hundred wives
And I am just simply high off life for the hundredth time

Never let nobody curve me that don't deserve me
Should I really have bought the Burberry last Thursday?
Wear a different color jersey every Thursday
'Posed to meet in Malibu, you postin' pics in Jersey
Is to lay me or play me, a bigger flex though
'Cause you know you'd never live up to my ex, though
If we dive, it's the deep end, baby, let's go
I'll be gone by the weekend, baby, XO

Most insane out of body experience
And I repent for everything I'ma do again (I accept Him)
And I repent for everything I'ma do again

Thank You, thank You, thank You for Your mercy, make me new
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
I repent for everything that I'ma do again
Make me new again, make me new again, make me new again
Last night don't count, this mornin' don't count

If you take the ride, please don't close your eyes, uh
In a den of thieves, every man disguise, uh
Keep your mask on, keep it hanitized, uh
It's a rollercoaster, keep your hands inside, uh
Wanna bring your pain, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, uh
Did it for the fame, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
He gon' part the tides, He gon' part the skies, huh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh
When they start to lie, 'member this advice, uh
What they vandalize, He'll evangelize, uh

Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
Make me new again, make me new again
