		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll make you forget all the pain, babe
We'll get away from the sounds of sirens
In a week long, we'll be fading
Lighting the cigarette, hands on the wheel
We'll go faster than we need
Hold your breath, hold it for me
And we'll put those fancy clothes on
Our coconut oil type skin

I wanna reach the nirvana
First our hotel in my pajamas
I'd like to climb the Mt. Fujiyama
Circle around the island driving a Yamaha

Gotta leave France, I guess we had a good time
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
I'm spending, I wanna fly
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
Oh whoa
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
Oh
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction

We'll book a table in the classiest place we can find
And have all the flavors you've ever dreamt about
No need to drive with a helmet on
It's satisfaction, we're just banging the town
We'll back to our mothers and our friends
Just to make sure that everyone is safe
I wanna get even
Break the ceiling that hung over your head

Gotta leave France, I guess we had a good time
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
I'm spending, I wanna fly
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
Oh whoa
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
Oh
It's satisfaction, it's satisfaction
Oh
