		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking in the mirror, I don't like the one I see
I can't help it these days, that's just how I feel
Lately all the easy things seem so damn hard for me
And the worry in my chest won't ever leave

Is it getting better? 
Are you happier than me?
Maybe I don't need to know
Are you sleeping easy? 
Do your friends talk shit 'bout me?
Maybe I don't need to know

Ooh, I'm, I'm falling
What if I don't know myself without you?
And ooh, I'm falling, falling hard
And I thought I'd find myself without you
Now I know nothing at all, mmh
Now I know nothing at all

Last year was a mess for many, things got out of hand
Don't expect you to forgive or understand
But why is it so easy to see clearly when it ends
When it's too late to turn back and make amends?
And the summer sadness really gets me down
And the city's way too quiet, mmh
I've been things that only hurt me in the end
And I don't know why I do them

Ooh, I'm falling
What if I don't know myself without you?
And ooh, I'm falling, falling hard
And I thought I'd find myself without you
But now I know nothing at all
Now I know nothing at all
Now I know nothing at all
Now I know nothing at all

Ooh, I'm falling
What if I don't know myself without you?
And ooh, I'm falling, falling hard
And I thought I'd find myself without you
