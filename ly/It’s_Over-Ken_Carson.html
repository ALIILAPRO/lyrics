		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (8-808)
(Star boy, you're my hero)

Got my pants fallin', hundred racks in my britches, huh
Got my pants fallin', these racks in my britches, yeah
Got my pants fallin', these racks in my britches, yeah
They got my pants fallin'
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
I'm four pockets full, but I'm not Lil' Baby
Fuck that bitch, off the X pill, she thought I was gon' save her
I put Forgiato's on the wheels of my new Mercedes
I'll pull up to yo' moshpit for a hundred K
I beat the trap out like an 808
I beat the pack out like an 808
I beat her back out like an 808, yeah, yeah
I just switched the color of my hair
Blonde shit, I got this blonde bitch tryna suck me
She go blonde, yeah, she goin' dumb, yeah, this bitch goin' Legally Blonde, yeah
We havin' fun, yeah
I'm 'bout to pass her to my bro, yeah
I unfold the Kel-Tec and it'll fold ya
I'm dressed in all black, yeah, just like Folgers
I'm a real rockstar, these niggas be posers
I crack the seal of Wock', and pour the eighth in the soda

And it's over
Yeah, it's over, yeah, it's over, yeah, it's over
Yeah, it's over, yeah, it's over, yeah, it's over
Yeah, it's over, yeah, it's over, yeah, it's over

No cap, yeah
