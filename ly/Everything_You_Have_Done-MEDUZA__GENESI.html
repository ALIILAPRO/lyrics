		  (I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one)
(I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one)
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
Better than anything and everything you have done

Now dip
(On a mad)
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
Better than anything and everything you have done
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
Better than anything and everything you have done
I chop it, I chop it, I chop it, I chop it
I chop it, I chop it, I chop it up like Mike
I chop it, I chop it, I chop it, I chop it
Better than anything and everything you have done

I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
I chop it up like Mike Myers on a mad one
Better than anything and everything you have done

Oops
(Mike My-)
Better than anything and everything you have done
