		  Charlie Maxine is alright
It ain't no worse that the violence of, say Jesus like
At least old Charlie took the blame
For all the violence we committed in his name

I've got to hell boy
And don't I know it just for thinking that it's
Fucked up, we almost always blame the victim
And we hate you for acting violent to someone else
Hell boy, just as long as it sells

Hell boy, I never learned anything else
Hell boy, well someone profits from my hell
Hell boy, I guess I need to take the blame
Hell boy, for my American brain

Sometimes I feel so powerless
I point my shooter at the sun
And make my trigger finger click
It's clear to everyone I'm sick
But they don't tell the motherfucking poison in my sink, oh

Hell boy, for shooting children while they play
They hate you
Die, fire is paid for by the NRA
They wanna thank you for such a glorious display
My little hell boy, for which my tax dollars I'll pay

Hell boy, I never learned anything else
Hell boy, well someone profits from my hell
Hell boy, I guess I need to take the blame
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, my American brain
Help this boy

Hell boy, I never learned anything else
Hell boy, well someone profits from my hell
Hell boy, I guess I need to take the blame
Hell boy, for my American brain
Hell boy, hell boy, hell boy
