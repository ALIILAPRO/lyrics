		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fall off in the spot
All you niggas do is run your jaw (Metro!)
Pull up with no top
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

Yo I'm me, I'm Barbie drippin', DB9, Barbie whippin'
If he say he don't want me back, he be lyin'
Bitch I'm the sauce, Barbie dippin', I'm the boss, Barbie sippin'
They keep tellin' work it, I ain't got no choice
I'm all yours, Barbie kissin', call the stores, Barbie shippin'
Out or indoors, baby I'ma floss
Wet, why of course, Barbie tippin', I endorse, Barbie strippin'
Mink carpet, but I ain't got no flaws
Doors look like rings, Barbie sittin', bad-da-bing, Barbie trippin'
Curve niggas like they arms in a sling
Hot off the swing, Barbie swingin', to the ring, Barbie blingin'
Good box, so he called Don a King
Who the fuck gon' party with them dollies
No I never do them mollys, if I hit you then you probably gon' sew
Who the fuck gon' come through with the body
Always thinkin' like a hottie, always saying what someone won't do
Who the fuck gonna pull up in your city
Looking every bit pretty, with the itty bitty titty bitch crew
Who the fuck gon' beat him with a .22
If he don't lose the attitude, and run off with his credit cards too

Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

Thousand dollar massage
I don't ever miss my mark
Anything I like goes in the cart
I might spend it all to prove a point
Rolling west coast, Arnold Schwarz
If she lick her lips then I'ma join
Indo I'ma spark
When I cash out that's her favorite part

They deliver my Lambo', all white with a tan bow
My body is a work of art, he eatin' this Van Gogh
I'm not in the bando, I'm Pablo Sandals
White beaches, candles, we sexin', anglo
Wh-wh-what you think all the niggas wanna cuff for?
A lot of Bloods, what you think they in the cut for?
Yeah it's the sweep, I ain't talkin' when the dust fall
My winnin' streak still hasn't peaked, you little dust ball
Bitch I'm a star-ar, me and Swae Lee, yah, yah
G-Force flights, Chun-way on the runway, yah, yah
Riccardo Tisci in Milan, you see me modelin', ah
Dinner with Kar-ar, dinner with Karl lagerfeld yah
Yeah this that Steven Klein, Mert & Marcus, yah, yah
You're used to taking pictures, I go raise the bar far
I'm bitchy, yah, yah, really bitchy, yah, hay
America's Next Top Model, call me, Yaya
Everytime I score she gon' hear them swishes, ah
Tell that bitch I'm in the league, she still play for Wichita
I piss hits broad, call me the swish God
The swish, swish God? Yup the swish God?

Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Hanging on my necklace, this ain't no ski resort
Fall off in the spot, every girl coming like a shark
Put that thing in park, I'ma let my fit pick you apart
Glowing in the dark, pretty young girls on board
Running with the marksmen, everything on point like, "En garde"

Mhm, shout out Giovanni
For doing that Barbie Tingz video, uh-huh
Nina Garcia, Stephen Gan, Elle mag yuh, uh-huh
I'm still on my Naomi shit
Wilhelmina Models tip
Weezy, Mack, Baby, Slim
Gee I see you, Jean, Tezz, El, Shawn Gee
Monte, Avery, Roppo, Joe, Katina, Mike, Dave, Garry, Josh
Rap, Sheika, Ken, Wiz, Hillary, Philly, Biggs

You're in the middle of Queen right now, thinkin'

This bitch is really the fucking Queen
I love my fans, I love you so much
