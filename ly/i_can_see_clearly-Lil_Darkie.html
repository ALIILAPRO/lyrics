		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let us begin
Once upon a time, Darkie was camping in the forest
Probably having a really nice dream
And, um, the sun started to rise and he woke up to the sight of a beam of light coming through his tent
And uh, he couldn't wait to see what was outside

I wish you saw me like you see you (See you, oh, oh, oh)
I wish you saw me like you see you, see me, see you
(And this is what he thought about)

I wish you could see that I'm a person too
I wish you could see that I am hurting too
On the attack, the ignorant see me and they see food
But I'll see them yack if it truly the last thing that I do
And they want that back, the power to place someone under rule
But all of that's crap, mm, but all of that's crap to me
And all of that's crap
I can't see your face through all the shit you're talkin' to me
Let's sit down and mix perspectives up and sip that smoothie
Hate will bring you down or bring you up if you move smoothly
I may get around and act a clown but you can't fool me

I wish you saw me like you see you (Oh, oh, oh)
I wish you saw me like you see you, see me, see you

I wish you saw me
I wish you saw me at all
Saw us both the same
I wish you saw me the same

Ooh, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na
I am outside right now and I see a hummingbird in the tree, oh
It flies away, how beautiful
