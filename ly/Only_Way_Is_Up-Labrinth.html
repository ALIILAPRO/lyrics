		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is no earth left here to dig
Laying at the bottom of the pit, you and I
Remembering when we were queens and kings, and emperors
Now they're wondering how the fuck we both made it out alive

But you know the stones don't, they don't bleed (bleed)
And you know the zombies, they don't breathe (breathe)
And you know that you and me are concrete ('crete)
Nothing else that we need

So what can they take from us
When we're already living on ground-zero
Right below basement
Where the only way is up, you know
The only way is up
The only way is up, oh-oh, oh-oh
The only way is up
When you hit rock bottom
The only way is up
From a broken heart

We'll scratch our way back to the surface
Standing on top of the world soon enough
We're gonna come with guns blazing, rocket launcher
Put all the heartbreakers to shame and we'll light 'em up

'Cause you know the stones don't, don't bleed (bleed)
And know the zombies, they don't need breathe (breathe)
And you know that you and me are concrete (-'rete)
Nothing else that we need

So what can they take from us?
When we're already living on ground-zero
Right below basement, whoa
Where the only way is up, you know
The only way is up
The only way is up, oh-oh, oh
The only way is up
When you hit rock bottom
The only way is up
From a broken heart
