		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  walking round
the streets at night
the dead of night feels like home
looking for a way to cease
anxiety in me

come around
i won't hurt you
you won't feel it too
come around
i will show you
pure snow 
it feels
like
oh

confidence
is the defense
to use me as much as you like
you looked for me
i'm no angel
i slipped under your no
ses
i don't know 
what you've been told
i am easy to be sold
but you can't get rid of me
can't get rid of me

come around
i won't hurt you
you won't feel it too
come around
i will show you
pure snow 
it feels
like
oh

it's been 4 months already
i've been lonely for too long
it's a seed in your head
it's for minds that are empty
what happened to your rendez-vous
your friends used to love me too
i think i'll find someone new
a new wind to pollute

come around
i won't hurt you
you won't feel it too
come around
i will show you
pure snow 
it feels
like
