		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fine place for a day full of breakdowns
Takes more than a meltdown to show us how
Throw a tack on the road stop the meat plow
Got a bullet but it ain't mine

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah, to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and she shows me how
To understand, yeah, to understand
I got a brother and, well, he shows me how
To make amends, yeah, to make amends with it

Take a break from the mousetrap we call home
Takes more than a message to make me smile
I can feel when she kisses me sleeping
But not when the news is on

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah, to break me down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and she shows me how
To understand, yeah, to understand
I got a brother and, well, he shows me how
To make amends, yeah, to make amends with it

They got these pictures of everything
To break us down, yeah, to break us down
They make us hate and we make it bleed

But I got a lover and she shows me how
To understand, yeah, to understand
I got a brother and, yeah, he shows me how
To make amends, yeah, to make amends with it
