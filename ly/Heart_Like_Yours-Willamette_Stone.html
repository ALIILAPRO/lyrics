		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe deep, breathe clear
Know that I'm here
Know that I'm here
Waitin'

Stay strong, stay gold
You don't have to fear
You don't have to fear
Waitin'

I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon

How could a heart like yours
Ever love a heart like mine?
How could I live before?
How could I have been so blind?

You opened up my eyes
You opened up my eyes

Sleep sound, sleep tight
Here in my mind
Here in my mind
Waitin'

Come close, my dear
You don't have to fear
You don't have to fear
Waitin'

I'll see you soon
I'll see you soon

How could a heart like yours
Ever love a heart like mine?
How could I live before?
How could I have been so blind?

You opened up my eyes
You opened up my eyes

Hold fast hope
All your love is all I've ever known

Hold fast hope
All your love is all I've ever known

How could a heart like yours
Ever love a heart like mine?
How could I live before?
How could I have been so blind?

You opened up my eyes
You opened up my eyes

You opened up my eyes
You opened up my eyes
