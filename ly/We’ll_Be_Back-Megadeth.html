		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The timing is right to exact my revenge
Spilling enemy blood, I will fight to the end
No more lying-in wait, just to even the score
There's a price to be paid, now it's time for war

I'm a soldier of fortune, of torture and pain
I bash in your skull until no teeth remain
A most-deadly weapon, pulverizing your head
With each crushing blow, how you wish you were dead

Just when you think it's safe, I attack
We'll be back
When you least expect your fate, I attack
We'll be back
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake
We'll be back
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack
I'll be back

No use screaming for mercy, no use makin' a sound
Still you step right up and get smacked back down
In the heat of battle, blood congeals on the floor
Another life-force bleeds out, another soul out the door

Antisocial, sadistic, the deity of war
I stuff body bags and I'm packing the morgue
No time for remorse over unclaimed remains
It's just flotsam and jetsam, and it's circling the drain

Just when you think it's safe, I attack
We'll be back
When you least expect your fate, I attack
We'll be back
A kick to your face, one move, big mistake
We'll be back
Let down your guard, full-on frontal attack
I'll be back
