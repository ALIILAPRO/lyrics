		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit me hard where I am soft
Should my heart reveal itself to be
More than a muscle
Or a fist covered in blood
However much it feels to bleed
It's only temporary

We're good people and we both deserve peace
(Peace)

My God, it's a lot
(I build some type of skin)
(I've got to build some type of skin)
My God, it's a lot
(I build some type of skin)
(I've got to build some type of skin)

I guess I should build some type of skin
And let breath be air
And love the things I know might disappear
And the last light of the sun (sun)
I let it slow me down
I'll crawl where everybody runs

We're good people
And we deserve peace
It's difficult, it seems

My God, it's a lot
(I build some type of skin)
(I've got to build some type of skin)
My God, it's a lot
(I build some type of skin)
My God (I've got to build some type of skin)
My God, it's a lot
(I build some type of skin)
(I've got to build some type of skin)
My God, it's a lot
(I build some type of skin)
My God, my God (I've got to build some type of skin)

It's a lot
It's a lot
My God, it's a lot
It's a lot, a lot to me
To me
