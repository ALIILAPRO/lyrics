		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you niggas lack depth, where the fuck's your mind at?
Party, drinking, bitches, drugs, I would never buy that
Your lifestyle ain't shit, I already tried it
I been silent, I can't be quiet
All you niggas lack depth, where the fuck's your mind at?
Party, drinking, bitches, drugs, I would never buy that
Your lifestyle ain't shit, I already tried it
I been silent, I can't be quiet
No, I can't be quiet
I'm more surprised that you niggas ain't die yet
Bet your brains look like I deep fried it
You see a bag, LV, and get excited, never have I liked it
LV ain't shit without a price tag
The way you people fiend makes my mind gag
Ape shit for a brand, man that shit's sad
All I gotta say is, that shit's wack
I wouldn't wipe my ass with that cheap shit
Like SpongeBob, all you niggas need it
You need a bag just so you can feel conceited?
You niggas ain't shit, even in your dreams bitch
Even in your dreams, you won't be shit
But a fucking hype beast
Gucci bag, eyes light up like some high beams
It's no wonder why you niggas walk blindly
All you niggas lack depth, where the fuck's your mind at?
Party, drinking, bitches, drugs, I would never buy that
Your lifestyle ain't shit, I already tried it
I been silent, I can't be quiet
All you niggas lack depth, where the fuck's your mind at?
Party, drinking, bitches, drugs, I would never buy that
Your lifestyle ain't shit, I already tried it
I been silent, I can't be quiet
