		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (one, two, three) yeah

Let's get this money, get that dough (that paper)
Let's get this money, get that dough (cash)
Let's get this money, get that dough (crypto)
Let's get this money, get that dough (ayy, check please)

Ice on my neck, make my neck freeze
You know I run the wave, no jetski's
New bitch on me so sexy
Got me kind of glad that my ex-wife left me
You know I ball hard, you can catch me at the Espy's
Sliding on my goals like I'm motherfucking Gretzky
ayy, you know it's on and popping like Pepsi
ayy, you know it's on and popping like, popping like

Uh, gra-ta-ta-ta, bitch, I don't give a fuck
Yeah, I'm sliding on this bitch, I never get stuck
Yeah, I got it on tuck
Going dumb like that Knuck If You Buck
I pull up in a Maybach and pull up the truck
Huh, you ain't shit, you a cuck
I stay with ice, I might need me a puck
Bitch I got racks like my bank account Nordstrom
We talking houses, with them I got four of 'em
More of 'em coming
They talking that shit leave 'em done
And I'm stunting, I'm running this shit like a marathon
Used to hit the soup kitchen on Tuesdays now I be shopping at Erwehon
Yeah, I shine like a flare gun
Feeling fresh like I just got my hair done
Like I just got my hair did, boy, don't sleep on my heritage (what's that?)
Black man, black man, running from the police
Know we gotta make it out, never had a doubt
But the route wasn't clear, needed somebody to show me
Who I am, what I be, life is in front of me
I don't know how I do this shit every day, it come to me
Really if it come to that, chain around my neck, that's a hundred racks
Acting like you got it, bitch, you really need to run it back (ah, yeah)
ayy, how the fuck you finna buy a Rolex, but you ain't paid yo' taxes?
No less, man, you got me so stressed
Young motherfuckers, want 'em all to win
Guess they know a lot more
Why you think the boy tryna reach 'em right now, fo?
Know you wanna flex, maybe paying all your debts 
might help you in the long run
Locked up for evasion, that's a long one
(No, I can't take this shit no more, let's go, let's, let's)

Let's get this money, get that dough (that paper)
Let's get this money, get that dough (cash)
Let's get this money, get that dough (crypto)
Let's get this money, get that dough (check please)
