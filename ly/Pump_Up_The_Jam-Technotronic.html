		  Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you do that

I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day

Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead, the crowd are jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you do that

I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day

Make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my, make my, make
Make my day

Yo, pump up the jam, pump it up
A-pump it up, yo, pump it
Pump up the jam, pump it up
A-pump it up, yo, pump it
Pump up the jam, pump it up

Pump up the jam, pump it up
A-pump it, pump it, pump it
Pump up the jam

Pump up the jam, pump it
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump

Pump up the jam, pump it up
While your feet are stompin'
And the jam is pumpin'
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'
Pump it up a little more
Get the party going on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'll find out if you do that

I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want a place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
