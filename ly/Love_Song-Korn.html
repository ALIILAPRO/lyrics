		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mother
You're holding my heart, screaming
Motherfucker
They left me broken, bleeding

Son of
The man you loved and left for
The son of a bitch
Who tried to show me death's door

Ah-ah-ah
Everything's eliminated, everything is dedicated
Ah-ah-ah
Tried to leave this life I hated, living it was overrated

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill 
Or flowers to steal?

Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here

Ash and
Obituaries rain down
And suddenly
We're lying naked face down

Ah-ah-ah
What's it like decapitated? Can't you see me fascinated?
Ah-ah-ah
You're the only thing I've damaged, only death can be mismanaged

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill 
Or flowers to steal?

Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here

Don't bring me Daffodils, bring a bouquet of pills
Seeds of Geranium, cracked to the cranium
Protect me when you can
Respect me when I am dying

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill 
Or flowers to steal?

Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here

Love song for the dear departed
Head stone for the broken hearted
Arms to kill 
Or flowers to steal?

Head trip for the mortal earthbound
One sip of the blood that I found
Lying here
I'm dying here
