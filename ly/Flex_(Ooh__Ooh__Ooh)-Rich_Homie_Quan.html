		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, oh, there it is, there it is, there it is
There it is, there it is (Rich Homie, baby!)

Walked in 30,000 in my pocket
Had them niggas just like ooohh
15,000 Dollars on your bitch wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like ooohh
'Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
Ain't gotta flex but I got it, ooohh
Give that ho some X, she gone wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like ooohh (How much you made?)

Made some million dollars, of a mixtape
And I'm fuckin' like, ooohh
They try to drop me with a case but you know I had to skate it
I was singing like, oooohh (That's right nigga)
Boy I know my role and I play it
If you heard that I'm talking then I said it (I see)
(Quan where you at?) At the top of the loft nigga, I stay
I'm a bad boy but I don't wear big clothes like Ma$e
In the club and a nigga get it boppin'
And that ho, she want a free drink, tell the bitch to get up off it
I'm the nigga to get it poppin', her hair short like Dennis Rodman
At the Clearport nigga, we flying, when I landed boy I

Walked in 30,000 in my pocket
Had them niggas just like ooohh
15,000 Dollars on your bitch wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like ooohh
'Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
Ain't gotta flex but I got it, ooohh
Give that ho some X, she gone wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like ooohh

(How much you made?) $100,000 just in two days
I don't fuck with niggas 'cause they two faced
I only fuck with bitches for that toupee
These Givencheys, I ain't worried about no new taste
Know that be true, got a set and she always got my back
So I love that shit the most
I'm her big dog and she my cat and she love it from the back
Call her green 'cause she on goose
I wear glasses 'cause I know these niggas watchin'
They mad 'cause they cannot stop me
Boy stopping is not a option, I can't help it 'cause I got it
Don't waste time, I got shit watchin'
Talkin' Rollex, yeah, I bought 'em
Now I'm at the top, started from the bottom, then I

Walked in 30,000 in my pocket
Had them niggas just like ooohh
15,000 Dollars on your bitch wanna fuck me
Got her screamin' like ooohh
'Cause I got a check, nigga wanna flex
Ain't gotta flex but I got it, ooohh
Give that ho some X, she gone wanna sex every nigga in the set
And now she screamin' like ooohh

(How much you made) a $100,000
(How much, how much you made) a $100,000
(How much, how much you made)
Made some million dollars of a mixtape and I fuck like ooohhh
Aye, get at me
