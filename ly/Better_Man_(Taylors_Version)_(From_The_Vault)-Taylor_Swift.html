		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standin' in the mirror
Sayin' to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needin' a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
Hopin' they might turn sweet again, like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talkin' down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that

I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love if you were a better man
(But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man
