		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My praise is going to new levels
My faith is going to new levels
I will give like I have never given before
Until I see what we have never seen before

We're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're gonna praise Him
You come and fill our hearts
With all Your power and love
Take us a level up you're so amazing
You're so amazing

You're so amazing you're so amazing

We're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're gonna praise Him
You come and fill our hearts
With all Your power and love
Take us a level up you're so amazing
You're so amazing we're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're gonna praise Him
You come and fill our hearts
With all Your power and love
Take us a level up you're so amazing
You're so amazing

My praise is going to new levels
My faith is going to new levels
I will give like I have never given before
Until I see what we have never seen before

We're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're lifting Jesus up
We're gonna praise Him
You come and fill our hearts
With all Your power and love
Take us a level up you're so amazing
You're so amazing

You're so amazing you're so amazing
You're so amazing
