		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of those beautiful people say, "Hey"
All of those beautiful people stay high
All of those beautiful people say, "Yeah"
I'm tellin' you why

Time I've been gone
I've been strugglin' alone
Keepin' all of my demons to myself
I'm savin' my grace for that heavenly place
To the sun, I will sing you my song

Na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, never comin' back down
Na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, never comin' back down

All of those beautiful people say, "Hey"
All of those beautiful people stay high
All of those beautiful people say, "Yeah"
I'm tellin' you why

Hard as it's been to begin once again
Just a friend on the wind seekin' shelter
There's a crack in the sky and a light from on high
I get higher and higher when I'm with her

Na, na na, na na
Na, na na, na na, never comin' back down

All of those beautiful people say, "Hey"
All of those beautiful people stay high
All of those beautiful people say, "Yeah"
I'm tellin' you why
All of those beautiful people say, "Hey"
All of those beautiful people stay high
All of those beautiful people say, "Yeah"
I'm tellin' you why (I'm never comin' back down)

Na, na na, na na, never comin' back down

All of those beautiful people say, "Hey"
All of those beautiful people stay high
All of those beautiful people say, "Yeah"
I'm tellin' you why (I'm never comin' back down)
All of those beautiful people say, "Hey"
All of those beautiful people stay high
All of those beautiful people say, "Yeah"
I'm tellin' you why (I'm never comin' back down)
