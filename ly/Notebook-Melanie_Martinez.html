		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Write this down, baby)

I'm not physically fulfilled
You've never held it down all night
And you're selfish 'cause you always think your ass is always right
And you never see the lesson when it's right in front your eyes
Are you writing this shit down?
'Cause baby boy I think it's time

Time you learned a thing or two
'Bout how to keep a girl like me with you
Time you learned how to switch it up
I'm tired of running to you, just give up
'Cause I didn't sign up for this
Had to make it ten times more than you, boy
When I sacrificed blood for you
I sacrificed blood

Write this shit in your notebook, baby
Since you never wrote love letters to me, to me
Don't forget all the things I've taught you
You'll need it for someone who isn't me, ain't me

What's the point in your "I love you"s
When they don't hold any weight?
You touch your computer much more
Than you have ever touched me
Every night you come back home then you just go back to sleep
Laying next to just a friend who occasionally fucks me

Time you know just how I feel
Since you told me you'll wait forever
Time you start growing up
Age is nothing if you're not evolved
Yeah, I didn't have time for this but I still gave you my all
I sacrificed blood for you
I sacrificed blood

Write this shit in your notebook, baby
Since you never wrote love letters to me, to me
Don't forget all the things I've taught you
You'll need it for someone who isn't me, ain't me
