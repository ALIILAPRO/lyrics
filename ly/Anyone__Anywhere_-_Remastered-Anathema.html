		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one seems to care anymore
I wander through this night all alone
No one feels the pain I have inside
Looking at this world through my eyes

No one really cares where I go
Searching to feel warmth forever more
The wheels of life they turn without me
Now you are gone eternally

No
Don't leave me here
The dream carries on
Inside (inside, inside, inside)
I know
It's not too late
Lost moments blown away
Tonight

Mankind, with your heresy
Can't you see that this is killing me
There's no one in this life
To be here with me at my side
