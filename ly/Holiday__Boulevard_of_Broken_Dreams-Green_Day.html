		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say hey
Cha

Hear the sound of the falling rain
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (hey)
The shame, the ones who died without a name

Hear the dogs howling out of key
To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (hey)
And bleed, the company lost the war today

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday

Hear the drum pounding out of time
Another protester has crossed the line (hey)
To find, the money's on the other side

Can I get another Amen? (Amen)
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (hey)
A gag, a plastic bag on a monument

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
On holiday
(Hey)

(Three, four)

(The representative from California has the floor)
"Sieg Heil" to the president Gasman
Bombs away is your punishment
Pulverize the Eiffel towers
Who criticize your government
Bang-bang goes the broken glass and
Kill all the fags that don't agree
Trials by fire, setting fire
Is not a way that's meant for me
Just 'cause (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Just 'cause, because we're outlaws yeah

I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives
This is our lives on holiday

I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines, what's fucked up when everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I walk alone, I walk a-

I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me 
'Til then I walk alone
