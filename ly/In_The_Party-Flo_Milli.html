Flo Milli shit 
(La, la, la, la, la, la)
Bitch I'm from Alabama
(La, la, la, la, la la)
Yeah, bitch, I got your man 
Since you bad, hoe, come catch him if you can (la, la, la, la, la, la)

Flo Milli shit, hoe
Flo Milli shit

Yeah, dicks up when I step up in the party (hey)
Yo main dude wanna feel on my body (he do)
And if take I him, bitch, I won't say I'm sorry (hell nah)
I do what I want
Don't report to nobody (huh)
I'm a bad bitch
Don't let 'em tell you that I'm average (what?) 
Ex dude mad 'cause he can't have it (yeah, yeah, yeah)
He think I miss him, don't want him a tad bit (fuck him)
If he take a hit of this I know he addicted (hello)
I'm a boss so he ain't no assistance
I think he like the fact that I'm gifted
I just do me, I don't need no permission (I do what I want)
A bad bitch with no morals (yeah)
I'm sinnin' (yeah)
Lord forgive me you know my intentions (please)
Family don't like the way that I'm livin'
But they didn't raise me so fuck they opinions
Yeah, he gon' off the Perc' now he raisin' his meat
I don't think that's a nigga that you wanna keep (huh? what?)
'Cause he give me brain like every other week (he do)
I smoked all his weed and I told him to leave (goodbye)
Use him for his money that's all that I need (yeah)
When I see him in public, I don't even speak (yeah yeah)
And if he ask to fuck I'ma charge him a fee 
Baby, you outta luck if he comin' with me (money)

Yeah, bitch, I got your man (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Since you bad, hoe, come catch him if you can, haha (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Yeah, bitch, I got your man (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Since you bad, hoe, come catch him if you can (yeah, yeah, yeah) (la, la, la, la, la, la)

Flo Milli shit, hoe
Flo Milli shit

I-i-it's a bad bitch with a tat
Her ass fat throw it back (go, go)
They be like Flo Milli who is that (what?)
I mean who else gone come with it back to back (nobody)
Makin' hits in my sleep like a heart attack (yeah)
Yeah, lil' hoe get into that
I just woke up and I broke the internet (oh my God)
I won't beef with you hoes on the internet
Pass the gun to my bro, he gon' handle that
Shoot at the crib where you mammy at
We fuck around leave her handicap
Play with my dog I'ma interact (yeah)
You niggas pussy like kitty cat (bye)
And we don't give a damn if you tryin' to hit back
I could make you madder, you need to relax
I'm a dog but I treat a nigga like my pet
He gon' doggy paddle 'cause he know I get wet
And he trip 'cause I never respond to his text (huh)
That nigga ain't good for nothin' but some head (bitch)
It's a whole lotta dicks in this party
Ak-47 'bout to catch a body, yeah
He got two dicks in the party
My nigga 'bout to catch a body, yeah

Flo Milli shit, hoe
Flo Milli shit

Yeah, bitch, I got your man (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Since you bad, hoe, come catch him if you can, haha (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Yeah, bitch, I got your man (la, la, la, la, la, la)
Since you bad, hoe, come catch him if you can, haha (la, la, la, la, la, la)
