		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Ayy, somebody uh, call somebody to get some molly
I need some, some good sauce, clean sauce

Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign 
Purple reign, purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple- 
Purple reign, purple reign
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need purple

And I keep a pint of cup of purple like Whoopi
And I keep the stainless steel on me like shoes
They got me going way harder now we can't lose
I had the conversation cause these niggas ain't true
I know you credit card fraud gangs bustin' some moves
I hope you're stacking money to the ceiling out the roof
I hope you ain't catchin' feelings for no bitch who fucked the crew
You know I'm independent, get the rental, bust a jug
You know that purple reign had them hitters on foot
I see you acting strange, I can tell this ain't love
That brand new Mulsanne, had to get it out the mud
Purple reign, purple reign is understood

Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign 
Purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-

I just need my girl, I just need my girlfriend
I bought a couple Hublots like I'm pushing heroin
I bought a couple coupes, I bought a couple Panameras
I'm acting like a Freeband Gang terrorist
Red cup of lean, don't approach me like a junkie
Take a pledge to the team, we gon' kill and get money
International, we taking over all the countries
Any nationality they coming, baby, coming
Ride shotgun in the foreign, that's a Rover
Until you gun down, we gon' never have closure
Got real estate downtown, investing all over
I heard you're trying to talk down like I ain't focused
I know you tryna play around like I ain't got soldiers
Big cup of syrup washing down all my doja
Wearing Louis loafers like they old penny loafers
Started off local, got the cribs bi-coastal
I don't want no words with you 'cause you mad bogus
I'm just tryna motivate the hoods all over
I'm just tryna teach you how to get these whips loaded
I'm just tryna show you how to get a few Rollies

Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign 
Purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple- 
Purple reign, purple reign
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need

Hope I didn't come at you the wrong way, that wasn't planned
Hope you see the path that I made, I took a chance
I just put my passion and drive into this
Two cups of that dirty, take a dab, blow kush and
We ain't gonna talk about it, cut you off if you keep pushing
Since I got the fame, can't forget I was crooked
They wanna see me make the wrong move, bite the bullet
See me whip up in that new school just like a bullet

Purple reign, purple-
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-
Purple reign, purple reign, purple reign, purple-
Purple reign, purple reign
I just need my girlfriend
I just need my girlfriend
I just need-

Purple reign, purple reign is understood
Purple reign, purple reign
