		  Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it (ready?)
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Move, move, move with it

Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it

Full steam when she comin' with her team
Pocket full to the brim fat cat
Pon route to the rave with the girl ya
What you think about that? (What you think about that?)
Dance, shake, move it
They wanna know, yeah, who that gyal?
She be tay, tay, tay, tay, tay-tay, tay
Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay-tay, tay

Dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Like an earthquake, quake, quake, quake
Quake, quake, quake, quake

Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Move with it, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it

At the dance, got the boys in a trance
When they see me shake the ting like that (like that)
Who's that pon the track, your boy Mason
Turn it up, pull it back
Dance, shake, move it
They wanna know, yeah, who that gyal?
She be tay, tay, tay, tay, tay-tay, tay
Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay-tay, tay

Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Like an earthquake, quake, quake, quake
Quake, quake, quake, quake (here we go, here we go)

Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Move with it, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it
Dance, shake, move with it

Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
Gonna dance, gonna shake
Gonna hit ya like an earthquake
She be tay, tay, tay, tay, tay-tay, tay
Tay, tay, tay, tay, tay-tay, tay
