		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only see you whenever I dream
Where did you go, babe? I miss our routine

I double take when I hear your name
Leave my towels on the floor
I'm scared as hell sleepin' by myself
So I always lock the door

Wake up alone in an empty bed
It's quiet in the livin' room
Go for a drive like we always did
In the middle of the afternoon
Havin' a drink at our favorite place
Like we always used to do
This is my new normal without you

Pacin' the kitchen again and again
Wait for a phone call I'll never get

I double take when I hear your name
Leave my towels on the floor
I'm scared as hell sleepin' by myself
So I always lock the door

Wake up alone in an empty bed
It's quiet in the livin' room
Go for a drive like we always did
In the middle of the afternoon
Havin' a drink at our favorite place
Like we always used to do
This is my new normal without you

Without you
Without you
This is my new normal without you

Wake up alone in an empty bed
It's quiet in the livin' room
Go for a drive like we always did
In the middle of the afternoon
Havin' a drink at our favorite place
Like we always used to do
This is my new normal without you
Mm, mm
