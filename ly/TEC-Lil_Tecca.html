		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't regret, but I receive
She call me Tec, she call me T (oh, oh, oh)
Bitch, I been blessed wherever I be
This shit Armageddon if you with me
We gettin' checks, yeah, we gettin' fees
Had to finesse and keep the receipts (for real)
We playin' catch with thirty at least (yeah)
I keep a hundred, that's on me

Playin' them games, don't D-I-E (D-I-E)
Yeah, eye for an E-Y-E (E-Y-E)
On your head like it's D-Y-E (D-Y-E)
They want a piece of the P-I-E
Playin' them games, don't D-I-E (D-I-E)
Yeah, eye for an E-Y-E (E-Y-E)
On your head like it's D-Y-E (D-Y-E)
They want a piece of the P-I-E

I know you checkin' on me, yeah (yeah)
I know there's nothin' to see, yeah (nothin' to see)
I know I fucked up a lot in the past (oh)
I got some places to be, yeah (yeah)
I don't need someone I need, yeah (someone I-)
I don't need someone like me, yeah (someone like-)
I know she bad, but I want her friend
So we were just better off being friends
Ayy, brand new pent', ayy, yes, got out the nest, ayy, yes
Don't do chest, you don't need a vest
Prepare for the worst and pray for the best
She want less, it come with a catch, ayy
Pull up, it come with a check, ayy
Pull up, I come with a TEC, ayy
I know I got 'em obsessed

Yeah, show you the one (ayy)
Think everyone knowin' you some' (ayy)
You think that they know you or some'? (Ayy)
I can't even tell you what's up
With them trust issues you got
I used to fuck with you, but nah
Insecure 'bout the way I live
But you can't say I ain't try

I don't regret, but I receive
She call me Tec, she call me T
Bitch, I been blessed wherever I be
This shit Armageddon if you with me
We gettin' checks, yeah, we gettin' fees (oh, oh, oh)
Had to finesse and keep the receipts (for real)
We playin' catch with thirty at least (yeah)
I keep a hundred, that's on me

Playin' them games, don't D-I-E
Yeah, eye for an E-Y-E
On your head like it's D-Y-E
They want a piece of the P-I-E
Playin' them games, don't D-I-E
Yeah, eye for an E-Y-E
On your head like it's D-Y-E
They want a piece of the P-I-E
