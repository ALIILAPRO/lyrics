		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Luck runs out

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction feel it burn

Still life, incarnation
Still life, infamy

Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah

Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

Luck runs out

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound

Still life, immolation
Still life, infamy

Hallucination
Heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah

Luck runs out
You crawl back in, but your luck runs out

One, two, three, four

Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never to return
This is your confession

Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long

Luck runs out

You crawl back in, but your luck runs out
Your luck runs out
