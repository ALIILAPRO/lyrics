		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the thing you least expected
When I got back up and the world neglected me
Well, I got the best of them
Ladies, I'm now the main event

Take a hint from me
This is not what you came to see
This is only a minor threat
Ladies and gentleman, place your bets!

Hold your breath, and shut your mouth the
Scene will be the death of us
I told ya so! Hey!
Told ya so! Hey!
Everyone's out to get me!

Nothing left to prove to you well
No one's gonna stop what I do
Told ya so! Hey!
Told ya so! Hey!
'Cause everyone's out to get me!

Say hello to the brand new me
I gave out all apologies
I am not kissing ass again
Say goodbye to all my faced friends
Goodbye!
I'm the one your parents tell you not to hang around
At any moment I could snap and then choke you out
They need an enemy,
Who better than me?

Hold your breath, and shut your mouth the
Scene will be the death of us
I told ya so! Hey!
Told ya so! Hey!
Everyone's out to get me!

Nothing left to prove to you well
No one's gonna stop what I do
Told ya so! Hey!
Told ya so! Hey!
'Cause everyone's out to get me!
Everyone's out to get

Ha, ha, ha!
Welcome to the shit show
Introducing yours truly!

I'm dependable, predictable at watching others fall
Expect the least you'll get the best I'm sure you're seen it all
So confident and comfortable they call me "unforgetable"
Refined at times, I never hide and always so presentable

Hold your breath, and shut your mouth the
Scene will be the death of us
I told ya so! Hey!
Told ya so! Hey!
Everyone's out to get me!

Nothing left to prove to you well
no one's gonna stop what I do
Told ya so! Hey!
Told ya so! Hey!
'Cause everyone's out to get me!
Everyone's out to get me!
