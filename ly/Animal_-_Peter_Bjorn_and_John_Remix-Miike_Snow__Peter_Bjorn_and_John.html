		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a time when my world was filled with darkness, darkness, darkness
And I stopped dreaming now
I'm supposed to fill it up with something, something , something
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody I knew before long long long ago
But I'm still trying to make my mind up
Am I free or am I tied up

I change shapes just to hide in this place but I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip yeah I slip
I'm still an animal

There is a hole and I tried to fill up with money, money , money
But it gets bigger 'til your hopes is always
Running, running, running
In your eyes I see the eyes of somebody of who could be strong
Tell me if I'm wrong
And now I'm pulling your disguise up
Are you free or are you tied up

I change shapes just to hide in this place but I'm still I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip
I'm still an animal

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip, yeah I slip
I'm still an animal

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip, yeah I slip
I'm still an animal

I change shapes just to hide in this place
But I'm still, I'm still an animal
Nobody knows it but me when I slip, yeah I slip
I'm still an animal
