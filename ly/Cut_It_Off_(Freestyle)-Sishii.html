		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m getting tired of the texts
You don’t send my way no no, just
The only time that you call's
When you call my name
No no no
You say it’s not that deep
Just hit me up, and you’ll see
I ain’t tryna deliver that shit
Through UberEats, yeah
It don’t make sense to me
That nigga you ain’t over
Don’t compare to me
You know that that’s
A sentimental recipe for disaster
Mmmh
I’m just tryna get up
Up off of them streets
But you pull me back
By the cuff of my sleeve
The second that we’re done
You want me out, and I feel it
Mmmh
Never thought
I’d be the type of nigga on call
I just give you everything you want
And that’s all good
I guess it's all good
We just gotta
Cut it off
I’m getting tired of the texts
You don’t send my way no no, just
Cut it off
The only time that you call's
When you call my name
No no no
Cut it off
I knew what I signed up for
If this is my game
What am I losing for
Cut it off
Cut it off
I’m outchea thinking that we connected
And now I’m thinking
We should’ve just left it
And I ain’t tryna
Give you all my blessings, yeah
I ain’t tryna flex no more
No more
Everything I do
I fall short
Keep them feels
It's all yours
I just think that
Maybe we should just
Cut it off
I’m getting tired of the texts
You don’t send my way no no, just
Cut it off
The only time that you call's
When you call my name
No no no
Cut it off
I knew what I signed up for
If this is my game
What am I losing for
Cut it off
Cut it off
