		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is not a tactic to expose you babe
I'm just trying to see you in your moment baby
No this is not a tactic to expose you babe
I'm just, I'm just trying to see you

I could be down on it
You could be all we need
I could be down on it
You could be all we need

I was thinking you and I could
Skip the part where we small talk each other
Turn the beat up, turn it real loud
Turn the beat up, turn it real loud

Hold me to my word this time
I'm gonna take another ride
Call me on my bitter side
Call me on my cell at night
Take it to the limit babe
Don't ask me to commit a thing
If no one gets hurt, what was it worth
What was it worth, what was it worth

I could be down on it
You could be all we need
I could be down on it
You could be all we need

Just wanna fast forward
Just wanna fast forward
Just give me the damn controller

Just wanna fast forward
