		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a world full of heartbreak drive-bys
We've seen our fair share of hard nights
Looked right into the face of a goodbye
While we walked on the edge of the dark side
After all this time, yeah

We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, whoa

Just when these four walls try to cave in
And the ground underneath starts shaking
It's a world full of heartbreak drive-bys
We've seen our fair share of hard nights
Looked right into the face of a goodbye
While we walked on the edge of the dark side
After all this time, yeah

We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, whoa

Just when these four walls try to cave in
And the ground underneath starts shaking
It's the hope in your eyes that I cling to
And I hope to God it never leaves you
After all this time, yeah

[Repeat x2]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, whoa

Even if they come for us
Everything can turn to dust
You and I are never going down
The bullets and the bombs of love
Go ahead and fire at us
We will never give it up
Oh, oh

[Repeat x3]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, whoa

And I hope to God it never leaves you
After all this time, yeah

[Repeat x2]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, whoa

Even if they come for us
Everything can turn to dust
You and I are never going down
The bullets and the bombs of love
Go ahead and fire at us
We will never give it up
Oh, oh

[Repeat x3]
We're not gonna fall now
We're not gonna bleed out
Never gonna break down
No, whoa
