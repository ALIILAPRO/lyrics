		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't life strange? Ain't it funny?
Nothing matters much but love and money
Things don't work out the way you reckoned
Money comes first, and the love comes second

Cigarettes make the sun come up
Whiskey makes the sun go down and in between
We do a lot of standing around
It's all I can do to make it through the day
She wrapped it all in darkness
And I can't find my way

And I'm walking down the sidewalks of LA
Wishing I had a warmer jacket
And the leaves are falling down
I'm just another man
With an empty handed heart
In an empty hearted town

It started out alright ended up all wrong
Shoulda done, shoulda done that's my song
Now the night is falling hard and fast
All dressed up for the masquerade
And the lights of the city stretch as
Far as the eye can see
Look what wonders man has made
Look what wonders man has made

I'm walking down the sidewalks of LA
Wishing I had a warmer jacket
And the leaves are falling down
I'm just another man
With an empty handed heart
In an empty hearted town

I'm walking down the sidewalks of LA
Wishing I had a warmer jacket
And something more to say
