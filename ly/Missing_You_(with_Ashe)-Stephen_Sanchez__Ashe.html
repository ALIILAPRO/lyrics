		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if the windows flew off all the buildings
And I could not see you again?
It'd be as if the sun decided to stop shining
And I could not breathe you in
What if the winter takes off with the leaves
And they don't grow back in spring?
That'd be the feeling of my heartbeat fleeting
'Cause' I know it's you I needed

We're getting caught in the static
Our love's wreaking havoc
It don't have to be tragic
I still wanna have it
There's no going back to
The life that I knew
After one heart is made up from two
I'm so in love that it's painful
I think you're an angel
With the face of my children
I don't wanna miss it
My whole life through
I was missing you

What if the stars lost of their glitter
And they fell down from the sky?
That'd be like finding you, choosing you
Loving you, losing you
After searching all my life

We're getting caught in the static
Our love's wreaking havoc
It don't have to be tragic
I still wanna have it
There's no going back to
The life that I knew
After one heart is made up from two
I'm so in love that it's painful
I think you're an angel
With the face of my children
I don't wanna miss it
My whole life through
I was missing you

If love is incarnate
And not just a feeling
Then I'm staring right at it
And not at the ceiling
I said something stupid
Instead of "I love you"
I guess, I was nervous
What I'm falling into
Into you, and out my mind
I want this before, I'm out of time
Into your arms from out of my chest
I give you my heart and all of the rest

We're getting caught in the static
Our love's wreaking havoc
It don't have to be tragic
I still wanna have it
There's no going back to
The life that I knew
After one heart is made up from two
I'm so in love that it's painful
I think you're an angel
With the face of my children
I don't wanna miss it
My whole life through
I was missing you (I was missing you)

My whole life through (my whole life through)
I was missing you (I was missing you)
My whole life through (my whole life through)
I was missing you (I was missing you)
My whole life through
