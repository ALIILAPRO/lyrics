		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make way for Prince Ali
Say hey! It's Prince Ali

Hey! Clear the way in the old bazaar
Hey you! Let us through! It's a brand new star!
Oh come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!

Make way! Here he comes!
Ring bells! Bang the drums!
You're gonna love this guy!

Prince Ali! Fabulous he! Ali Ababwa
Show some respect, Genuflect, down on one knee
Now, try your best to stay calm
Brush up your Friday salaam
Then come and meet his spectacular coterie

Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa
Strong as ten regular men, definitely!
He faced the galloping hordes
A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords? Why, Prince Ali

Fellas he's got (seventy-five golden camels) woo! Uh-huh
Now the ladies, what he got? (Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Everybody help me out!
(He's got a zoo, I'm telling you)
(It's a world-class menagerie)

Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
That physique! How can I speak, weak in my knees, yummy boy!
So get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali

(He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys)
He got some monkeys, a bunch of monkeys
(And to view them he charges no fee)
(He's generous, so generous)
(He's got ten-thousand servants and flunkies)
(Proud to work for him!)
(They bow to his whim love serving him)
(They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!)

Prince A- we're waiting for you!
We're not going 'til you go
You can do it!
There it is!

Prince Ali, amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was hot! Where is she?
And that, good people, is why
he got all cute and dropped by
With (sixty elephants, llamas galore) for real?
(With his bears and lions, a brass band and more) what?
(With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers)
(His birds that warble on key)
Make way for Prince Ali!
