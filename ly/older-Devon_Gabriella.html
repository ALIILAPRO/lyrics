		  VERSE 
You’re not s’pposed to hear your mother cry 
Walls get thinner late at night 
Knew not to ask, so I kept quiet 
Hmm 
Shouldn’t understand it, but I did 
‘Cause life don’t care about your innocence 
Treading water ever since 

PRE
Oh i’d like to say i’ve changed 
But nothing’s really different 
I’m feeling twice my age
hmmm
 
HOOK:
i didn’t ask to get older
i was pushed through the door and 
air has started getting colder
i’ve been fighting to      get       back       in 
oh i wonder where the time goes 
I just float where the wind blows       
All this weight upon my shoulders 
didn’t ask to get older 

POST:
ohhhh
didn’t ask to get older
ohhhh
didn’t ask to get older 

VERSE 2
Was a teenage dreamer acting 21  
Running double time around the sun 
Thought these years were gonna be more fun 

PRE
Oh i’d like to say i’ve changed 
But nothing’s really different 
I’m feeling twice my age
hmmm
 
HOOK:
i didn’t ask to geeet older
i was pushed through the door and

air has started getting colder
i’ve been fighting to      get       back       in 
oh i wonder where the time goes 
I just float where the wind blows       
All this weight upon my shoulders 
didn’t ask to get older 

POST:
ohhhh
didn’t ask to get older
ohhhh
didn’t ask to get older 

Tried to tell them i was just a kid
But life don’t care about your innocence
