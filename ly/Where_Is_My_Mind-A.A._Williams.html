		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With your feet on the air and
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
But there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

Where is my mind? Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'

I was swimming in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except a little fish
Bumped into me, I swear he was
Trying to talk to me, koi-koi

Where is my mind? Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Mm, way out in the water, see it swimmin'

With your feet on the air and
Your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your hеad'll collapse
But there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yoursеlf

Where is my mind? Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, see it swimmin'
