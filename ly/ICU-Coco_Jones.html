		<p>
		  (Welcome to the camp)

Something 'bout your hands on my body
Feels better than any man I ever met
Something 'bout the way you just get me
I try and I
Don't 'cause I
Can't forget

You got a feel and a soul
That I need in my life
(Yeah-yeah) oh-oh
And though we may grow
I don't know why we don't grow apart

Maybe I need you
I breathe you
Turning my heart blue
Maybe I need you
When I leave you
I see you

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah

First we agree that we better as friends
I delete every message that we sent
Try to move on with somebody less like you
I don't know how we end up in the red
Find myself reading your comments again
And then we end up in each other's heads
It all makes sense because

You've got a feel and a soul
That I need in my life, babe
Oh, oh-whoa
And though we may grow
I don't know why we don't grow apart, babe
Baby

Maybe I need you
I breathe you
Turning my heart blue
Maybe I need you
When I leave you
I see you

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah

Maybe I just feel lost without you
Maybe I'm just pissed off without you
Baby, my life's just off without you
Maybe your worth it all to me, baby
Maybe, maybe, just maybe
