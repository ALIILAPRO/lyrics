		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La, la
La, la
La, la
La, la

You gotta watch for the shot, beware the ricochet
Dance, dance motherfucker 'til the fat bitch sings
You get one for the chamber, two for good health
Know a little 'bout evil and a lot about hell
Playin' ring around the daisies with a shotgun shell
If you're gonna take a life better keep it to yourself
Seems every time I think there's just a little bit of hope
Someone comes out swinging with a dead man's rope

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Damned if I will and damned if I won't
Doomed if I try, doomed if I fail
Damn you all to hell

I'm no angel, I'm no savior and I've never been a saint
Well, I know I'm not the devil 'cause I still can feel the pain
I walked through fire and through brimstone and there were no pearly gates
I'll be sure to ask about it on my final Judgement Day
Judgement Day

Two tears in a bucket, one down the drain
Dance, dance motherfucker 'til the war drums play
I know a little 'bout death, a lot about pain
I ain't ever seen a storm that don't end in rain
Gotta pay the pied piper, every dog'll have his day
I don't stress the mess 'cause it's all so cliche
You can run around in circles, but it always ends the same
You'll be swinging from the end of a dead man's chain

Doomed if I do, doomed if I don't
Doomed if I will, doomed if I won't
Damned if I try, damned if I fail
Goddamn you all to hell

I'm no angel, I'm no savior and I've never been a saint
Well, I know I'm not the devil 'cause I still can feel the pain
I walked through fire and through brimstone and there were no pearly gates
I'll be sure to ask about it on my final Judgement Day
Judgement Day

La, la
La, la
My final Judgement Day
La, la
La, la

Watch for the shot
Watch for the sh-sh-shot (motherfucker)
Watch for the shot (beware the ricochet)
Watch for the shot

I'm no angel, I'm no savior and I've never been a saint
Well, I know I'm not the devil 'cause I still can feel the pain
I walked through fire and through brimstone and there were no pearly gates
I'll be sure to ask about it on my final Judgement Day
In my final resting place, when I finally found my grace
I'll be sure to ask about it on my final Judgement Day
My final Judgement Day

La, la
La, la
My final Judgement Day
La, la
La, la
My final Judgement Day
La, la
La, la
My final Judgement Day
