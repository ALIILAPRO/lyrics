		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I took a little journey to the unknown
And I come back changed, I can feel it in my bones
I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see
Now the darkness got a hold on me
Holy darkness got a hold on me

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

How long, baby, have I been away?
Oh, it feels like ages though you say it's only days
There ain't language for the things I've seen, yeah
And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
The truth is stranger than in all my dreams
Holy darkness got a hold on me

I have seen what the darkness does
(Say goodbye to who I was)
I ain't never been away so long
(Don't look back, them days are gone)
Follow me into the endless night
(I can bring your fears to life)
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
(Meet me in the woods tonight)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Yeah, the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
Holy darkness got a hold on me

I have seen what the darkness does
(Say goodbye to who I was)
I ain't never been away so long
(Don't look back, them days are gone)
Follow me into the endless night
(I can bring your fears to life)
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
(Meet me in the woods tonight)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
