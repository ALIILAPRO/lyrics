		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The strong, the mighty
The forces of evil can never destroy
The power of the Wonderman
And though the most formidable journey lies ahead
Only one will prevail
Wonder, Wonder, Wonderman

These haters couldn't get to where I am with a full tank of petrol, uh
My uncle used to drink a can of kestrel when life got stressful, uh
What kinda person should you be when wanna make people accept you, uh
What does it really mean when you dream of being famous and successful
When you were born to be special,

Uh yeah and I went from the kid in class
Text some radio DJs so they could bring me up
To the young rapper everybody's ringing up
Got em looking for a sprinkle of that pixie dust

Mad thoughts in my head when its blowin' up
Like, are you really big enough?
I traded friends for fans, cement for sand
Raise your hand the Wonderman

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one they're calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, the Wonderman

Bored of being nameless
Bored of feeling awkward
When you walk up in the mall
And cant afford a pair of trainers
Imagine when it changes
Imagine satisfaction when you make it

Its more than being famous
More then the applause and more than any form of status
More than the performances in 20 foreign places
Benidorm, Vegas, many more praises
Amen hallelujah 'Tinie look what's happened to ya?
Yeah they love that attitude brand new and improved, yeah

And when the fans start grabbing you
Show gratitude with a little brag or two
Amen, hallelujah Tinie look what's happened to ya
Who can say they ran through all the obstacles I ran, look
I traded friends for fans, cement for sand
Raise your hand, the Wonderman

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one they're calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, the Wonderman

Come on come on the stars are where you belong
Come on come on follow your heart is gonna take you home
Come on come on the stars are where you belong
There's no turning back from here

See the bright lights shine in your face
I'm counting on you to take it all away (the Wonderman)
I saw the chosen one they're calling your name
Are you you
Are you you, the Wonderman

From this day on the world will never be the same
