		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me and my girlies
We gon' party 'til it's early
Got me feeling otherworldly tonight
Caught in some traffic
But the radio is blastin'
Drop a red light and we'll sing it goodbye

Ooh
By the mornin', feel like magic
I got all I need, you know, nothin' else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancin' with my girls
Perfect energy, yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free
There's no better feelin' in the whole wide world

Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowin' up my line
I'd care at 11:59
But nothin' counts after midnight

Come and take a ride with me
I got a credit card and some good company
Some come through
Make the fit real good
Why you still stuck on loadin'?
Waitin' on you, babe

Ooh
Night to mornin', live slow motion
I got all I need, you know, nothin' else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancin' with my girls
Perfect energy, yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free
There's no better feeling in the whole wide world

Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowin' up my line
I'd care at 11:59
But nothin' counts after midnight

(Oh)
(Oh, oh)

Ooh
By the mornin', feel like magic
I got all I need, you know, nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancin' with my girls
Perfect energy, yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free
There's no better feelin' in the whole wide world

Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowin' up my line
I'd care at 11:59
Don't start blowin' up my line
