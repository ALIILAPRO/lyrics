		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's debonair with the tall silk hat?
Muffler of wool and a tummy that's fat?
King for a day, and he loves the road
With a broomstick cane and a heart of gold

That's Frosty the Snowman
He's a jolly happy soul
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal

Frosty the Snowman
Is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow
But the children know
How he came to life one day

There must have been some magic in
That old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around (Charleston, Charleston)

Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say
He could laugh and play
Just the same as you and me

Oh, Frosty the Snowman
Knew the sun was hot that day
So he said let's run
And we'll have some fun
Now before I melt away

So down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there, all around the square
Saying catch me if you can

He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler, "Stop"

For Frosty the Snowman
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye
Saying, "Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day" (hey, listen)

Thumppity, thump thump
Thumppity, thump thump
Look at Frosty go (hey, look at him)
Thumppity, thump thump
Thumppity, thump thump
Over the hills of snow
