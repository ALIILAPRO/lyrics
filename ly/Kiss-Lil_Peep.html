		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spoken words were meant to last
But the picture faded fast
The words, "I love you" meant so much
Now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and
Think about our first kiss by the tree
And how it meant so much to

Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to
And I think I'm getting through to you
But, all that shit I put you through ain't right
And I know that I'm barely ever home
But I think of you on the road
You know, I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you
Said, "I hate you" 'cause I knew that you would never love me too

got one more chance at a night like this, yeah, yeah

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
You got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
You got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick

And that's real shit (real), we keep it real, bitch (real)
I'm a goth boy, kinda like my whole clique
You a bad one (true), we should have fun
Let's fuck in the all-black Benz truck (skrr, skrr)
Six racks on (Peep), six packs gone (sheesh)
I'm a bad boy, we ain't gonna last long (nah)
I could make you (damn), I could break you (yeah)
Baby, think of all the places I can take you

What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'ma die young, I'ma get killed
What's your age, boo? I'm a jit still
I'ma die young, baby, I'ma get killed, ayy

One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
You got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
One more chance, baby, gimme a kiss
You got one more chance at a night like this
You could hold my hand in the back of the whip
But saw the plug at the club, came back with a brick
