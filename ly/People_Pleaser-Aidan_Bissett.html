		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you see that girl called people pleaser
Don't trust her eyes when you get what you needed
She'll eat you alive
All in one bite
Alright

Well, I tried
Till my sorry's ran dry
And then you cut me off like curtain calls and cigarettes
What a crime
I'm fine
Some days I get a bit of a bitter taste
And then you wrap me up and kill my buzz like a rattlesnake
What a waste
For a beautiful face

I know you said it gets better, doesn't it?
I know you said it gets better

If you see that girl, she's a people pleaser
Don't trust her eyes when you get what you're needing
She'll eat you alive
All in one bite
Alright

Well, I cried
And I'm not a sentimental type
I watch you lick it up like paper cuts and cabernet
Right to my face
What a waste

I know you said it gets better, doesn't it?
I know you said it gets better

But if you see that girl, she's a people pleaser
Don't trust her eyes when you get what you're needing
She'll eat you alive
All in one bite
Alright

She's the call back queen and nobody believes you
She'll love you like hell in the garden of Eden
She'll eat you alive
Take you all in one bite
Alright

Heaven knows I tried
But it didn't work this time
I'm with you all over and over and over
Till I empty out my mind
