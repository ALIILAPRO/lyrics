		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look perfect when you wake up
I'm the lucky man in your bed
You wastin' time puttin' on makeup
Don't know how it got in your head
Things you think you need to change
Things that keep us runnin' late
Girl, that ain't what makes you a ten
Your curls, your curves, your smile, your eyes
Told you 'bout a million times
But I'm 'bout to say it again

You look amazing
You look amazing
Don't matter what you wear or what you do
You turnin' heads in every room
Don't know why you act so surprised
You look amazing, every time

You make me wanna pick a handful of wildflowers
They remind me of you
Natural beauty don't come from you spending hours
God just gave it to you

You look amazing
You look amazing
No matter what you wear or what you do
You turnin' heads in every room
Don't know why you act so surprised
You look amazing, every time

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Those pretty eyes lookin' back at me
Ooh, ooh-ooh
If they could only see what I see

You look amazing
You look amazing
No matter what you wear or what you do
You turnin' heads in every room
Don't know why you act so surprised
You look amazing, every time
