		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the end, it's stronger than I know how to be
And I can't just spend my whole lifetime wondering
I fell in love with the sound of my heels on the wooden floor
I don't want my footsteps to be silent anymore

Want them to be in the moment
Storm clouds are closin'

In the end, it's coming, there's nothing left to do
But I'm still not certain just how I'm gonna feel

I'll only know in the moment
Anticipation growing

It's getting closer
Ooh, it's getting closer
It's getting closer (I'm not ready yet)
Ooh, it's getting closer (I need a little more time)

It's getting closer (closer, every day)
(Don't cry, we'll be okay)
Ooh, it's getting closer (closer, wall of the dam)
(Hold on and breathe if you can)
It's getting closer (closer, I'm not ready yet)
Ooh, it's getting closer (closer, I need a little more time)
(Breathe if you can)
It's getting closer (closer, I'm not ready yet)
Ooh, it's getting closer (closer, I need a little more time)

(It's getting closer)
(Ooh, it's getting closer)
