		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still recall the taste of your tears 
Echoing your voice just like the ringing in my ears 
My favorite dreams of you still wash ashore 
Scraping through my head 'till I don't want to sleep anymore 

You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing, and I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how
Back then I couldn't do the things that I can do now 
This thing is slowly take me apart 
Grey would be the color if I had a heart 

Come on and tell me, you make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing, and I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make this all go away
I just want something
I just want something I can never have

In this place it seems like such a shame 
Though it all looks different now, 
I know it's still the same 
Everywhere I look you're all I see 
Just a fading fucking reminder of who I used to be 

Come on tell me you make this all go away
You make this all go away
I'm down to just one thing, and I'm starting to scare myself
You make this all go away
You make it all go away
I just want something,
I just want something I can never have
I just want something I can never have
