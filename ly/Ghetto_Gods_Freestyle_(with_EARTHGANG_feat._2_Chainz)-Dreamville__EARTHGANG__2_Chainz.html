		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
A lot of talk about what's Atlanta and what's not (uh)
(Feel me, that my voice anyway)
And we say, "Yeah"
You wanna see what Atlanta is? (Uh)
You know what I mean? Reassurance
Too easy
Pop your shit, now (Gangsta Grizzillz)
EARTHGANG, home worldwide
Home certified, gon' testify (hold on, hold on, hold on)
Price for a feature gon' cost your life (hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on)
Where you goin'? Where you goin'? Hold on
Bruh (who me?), Hold on
Fuck that shit (Mr. Thanksgiving)

Bitch, it's EARTHGANG, home worldwide
Home certified, gon' testify
Price for a feature, that'll cost your life
Fuck your top ten, what your top five?
You in the presence of the most high
Speak with the tongue of the most fly
A couple of stars in the roof, it's true
I'm really a star, my nigga, the proof
I father the youth, I taught them the truth
I show them the lies, I open they eyes
The real niggas rise, it's diamonds inside
Okay, it's my turn, the turn of the tides
I pray up to God
Don't fuck with the schools or government laws 
Or none of they rules
The media lie every day on the tube
Tupac with a billi' (yeah), my everyday move (get 'em)

Fuckin' money up, hit my baby mama up
Who you with? Fuck that shit, I'm pullin' up
Threw a brick through a nigga Uber-Lyft
Knew he was a bitch, knew he'd try to dip
I be lyin', say I do it for the kid
I just really fuck with doin' stupid shit
White crowds like I'm Hootie and the Fish
Fuckin' on a freaky, moody, lil' bitch
I don't ever stick around to shoot the shit
Facetime nine times out of ten
I be in the whip, droppin' off the jit
Droppin' off some dick
Sand bars with me like I'm Michael Vick
Chopper ate a nigga up, Kyle Pitts
Sandlot, big dog, I'm a beast
Same time niggas populate the pics

Pinky ring fleek
Pinky ring pink
Pussy real pink
(Talk your shit, Tit) sink, okay
I'm on my way, want me get in there
Been a real nigga turned a millionaire
Why you sittin' there?
I'll make a million dollars by the time 
You been got up and did your hair
Far as Louis Vuitton, I got sixty pair
You could pick a pair
In a fruit fight, you can pick a pear
Some might say a grammatical error
My granddad had a Chrysler LeBaron
Then my dad caught prison time
Mom start cryin', fucked up her mascara
My trap house had a long-ass line
Twelve for the shit, it's porcupine, stuck like truck
Fuck them fines, fuck that court
Young, Black nigga, I ain't tryna be broke
Young, Black nigga, I ain't tryna be broke
Rolled them dice, then re-buck (mh)
Take the dough, then re-up (mh)
My new crib like my ego
'Cause that shit is big as fuck, Toni

Let me explain something
Every time you hear my voice
I'm thinkin' Mount Rushmore
And there's only a couple spots available
What's a king to a God? (Hey)
What's a God to a non-believer?
In this case, only the legacy we leave behind
Just make sure you quote me when I'm gone
(Gangsta Grizzillz)
