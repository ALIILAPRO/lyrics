		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a thousand-mile-deep hole in my chest
My lungs can't take these weeks of holdin' my breath
Waitin' for you to come back around
And love me again, mm-mm
I'm in a haze, a walkin' cloud of distress (yeah, yeah)
And I ain't safe from my own brain, I'm a mess
Waitin' for you to come back around
And love me again, mm-mm

Oh, I been callin' you
Just to justify my love, just to justify my love
Oh, I been callin' you
Tryna justify my love, just to testify
That I sleep in this sorrow
If only tomorrow
You love me again

I wonder who that nigga that's keepin' you warm
I wonder if you still feel me in your core
Or are you just frontin' to even the score?
Like you don't love me no more (hmm)

(Oh, I) 
Oh, I been callin' you (you, yeah)
Just to justify my love, just to justify my love
Oh, I been callin' you
Tryna justify my love, just to testify
That I sleep in this sorrow
If only tomorrow
You love me again

Oh, I been callin' you
Just to justify my love, just to justify my love
Oh, I been callin' you, ooh
Tryna justify my love, just to testify
I sleep in this sorrow
If only tomorrow
You love me again
