		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please

Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh, me so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

Oh, there daddy, daddy didn't bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we betta slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gon' make it to this club

Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kind of girl you like (girl you like)
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like (girl you like)
The kinda girl you like is right here with me

Right here with me, right here with me
Right here with me, right here with me

Right here with me, right here with me
Right here with me, right here with me
Right here with me, right here with me
Right here with me, right here with me (Hello)
Right here with me, right here with me
Right here with me, right here with me
Hello
