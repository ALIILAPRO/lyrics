		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no sound
But the engines drone
Our minds set free
To roam

Time (shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

Our minds bend
And our fingers fold
Entwined, we dream
Unknown

Time (shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me

We slow down
As the engines stall
Our eyes catch sync
Explode

Time (shift)
We discover the entry
To other planes
Time (shift)
As we collide with the energy
In other ways

Stay with me
As we cross the empty skies
Come sail with me

We play in dreams
As we cross through space and time
Just stay with me
