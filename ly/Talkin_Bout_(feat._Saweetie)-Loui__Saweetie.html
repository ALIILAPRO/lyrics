		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a PSA for my big booty bitches

Listen up, I'll treat her like a soldier (like a soldier)
I hit it from the back, I pull her hair, fuck up her closure (let's go)

Now rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock, hey)
Rock (rock), rock (rock), rock, yeah
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? (Just play wit' it)
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? (Just play wit' it)
Come and shake that ass, let me see what that- (play wit' it)
Let me see what that shit-

I make a nigga hot stop
Big titties in my crop top
Do the brains in the Bentley (yeah)
He pullin' up for that slop top (he is)
Might do it with the pop rocks
Toes curl, he pop lock
Milly racks in the lockbox
White toes in my Croc-Crocs (ayy), let's get it
Bad lil' bitch from the west side, ooh (mm-hmm)
Pretty and she rap like Left Eye
It's Saweetie on the bill and the check right
Bitch, you sleepin' on me? It's bedtime
Show my booty and thong on FaceTime
Abs on period pooh, no waistline, hmm
Saweetie that pretty in real life
Runnin' through Louis, like daddy it's playtime

What's your sign? (What it is?) I'm a Cancer (that's right)
Body built (like what?), like a dancer (okay)
Shake that ass (shake it, shake it), for the camera (clap, clap)
If he a dirty bitch, then throw him in the hamper, look

Now rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock, hey)
Rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), yeah
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? 
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? 
Come and shake that ass, let me see what that shit talkin' 'bout, ha

She got me hard, I got a boner (let's go, a boner)
If she smoke some gas, I fire her up, bitch, I'm a stoner (smoke that gas, yeah)
Told that bitch to listen up, I'll treat her like a soldier (like a soldier)
I hit it from the back, I pull her hair, fuck up her closure (yeah, let's go)

Now rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock)
Rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), yeah
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? 
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? 
Come and shake that ass, let me see what that shit talkin' 'bout, ha (oh)

Ass hangin' out your shorts 'bout to make me whip my cock out
Then I am gon' rock out, K.O. bitch, that is a knock out (let's go)

Now rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock)
Rock (rock), rock (rock), rock (rock), yeah
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? 
Yeah, bitch, what that shit talkin' 'bout? 
Come and shake that ass, let me see what that shit talkin' 'bout, ha (oh)
(What that shit talkin' 'bout)
