		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna be the bottle that keeps a ship from sea
Don't wanna be a cage that keeps a bird from being free
Don't wanna keep a singer from a melody
Yeah, baby, that was you and me

I wish I was heartless and kept you as mine
I wish it were my hands that held you at night
But all of the love that you wanted for us
You found it in someone new
So I'm not happy, but I'm happy for you

Just look at that smile, it's one I've never seen
You laugh a lot more than you did with me
Half of me knows were not a perfect match
Half me let you go, half me wants you back
Oh, I feel so stupid, sitting here losing you when

I could've been heartless and kept you as mine
I wish it were my hands that held you at night
But all of the love that you wanted for us
You found it in someone new
Well I'm not happy, but I'm happy for you

Moving on, finding somebody else
Maybe I'll find somebody else too
Baby, I only want the best for you

But I wish I was heartless and kept you as mine
I wish it were my hands that held you at night
But all of the love that you wanted for us
You found it in someone new
So I'm not happy, but I'm happy for you
No, I'm not happy, but I'm happy for you
