		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's going on in our lives
How did it come to this
We've been lost for so long
How did we end up here
There must have been something that
We both did wrong

Ask yourself before it's gone, it won't be long

There must be a reason why
Why we're stuck inside this place
Always going back to it
There must be a reason why
Why we can't decide our fate
Always choosing something that don't fit

There must be a reason why
Why we're stuck inside this place
Always going back to it
Stuck inside this place

There must be a reason why
Why we're stuck inside this place
Always going back to it
Stuck inside this place

Why we're stuck inside this place

There must be a reason why
Why we're stuck inside this place
Always going back to it
There must be a reason why
Why we can't decide our fate
Always choosing something that don't fit
