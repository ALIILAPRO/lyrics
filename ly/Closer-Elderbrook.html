		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never been closer to lovin' gone right
Like weight on the boulder, never been this high
Like a gold rush, ooh, mama

A single light
Never been closer to a love gone right

No, I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
No, I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
You're a real good lover, lover, lover
I love that I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close

Never seen something as beautiful and good
You're the place that I run to
Anytime I want (always shinning)
Like a silvery angel, you've left me blind
And I've never been closer to a love gone right

No, I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
No, I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
You're a real good lover, lover, lover
I love that I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close

No, I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
No, I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
You're a real good lover, lover, lover
I love that I've never been closer, closer, closer
I'm close
