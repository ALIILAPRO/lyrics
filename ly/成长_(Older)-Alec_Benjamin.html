		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not prepared for the future
So many things that I just don't know, I
Cut my hair, bought a new shirt
New pair of shoes and
It's time to go, I
Finally found an apartment
Signed a lease on a car this month, I
Can't go back to the start now
Time doesn't slow down
I'm on my own

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm telling all my friends we'll get together next October
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum

Never thought I'd be twenty
Now thirty don't seem so far away
I know I gotta make a little money then maybe find somebody
To call my own
Mm, I'm not ready but I
Can't go back in time, I
Know it's all out my control
Now I know

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm telling all my friends we'll get together next October
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum

Guess my childhood is over
One day I'll be buying posters for my kids
Just like my parents did for me, it's never over
They'll grow up and soon enough
They'll wish that time would just move slower
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Guess my childhood is over
Now I'm taking down my posters
And I'm putting all my things inside a box next to a toaster
That's my closest thing to closure
I can't stop this rollercoaster
I'm not ready to get older, I'm not ready to get older

Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum
Bum-ba-da-da-da-dum-dum-dum

I'm not prepared for the future
So many things that I just don't know, I
Cut my hair, bought a new shirt
New pair of shoes and
It's time to go
