		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the light of the day
In the dark of the night
When you're raring to go
When you're tired from the fight
When you're losing your mind
Let me give you a thought
I'm gonna be right your side no matter what

In the dark of the night (in the dark of the night)
In the light of the day (in the light of the day)
When you're rising to shine (when you're rising to shine)
When you're hitting the hay (when you're hitting the hay)
I'll be hanging around (I'll be hanging around)
If you like it or not (if you like it or not)
I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what!

No matter what (no matter what)
No matter what (no matter what)
No matter what (no matter what)
No matter what (no matter what)
Oh, I'm gonna be (oh, I'm gonna be)
Right by your side (right by your side)
I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what

In the dark of the night
In the light of the day
When you're rising to shine
When you're hitting the hay
Just remember this song
How's it go? I forgot
I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what

Through whoever you've been (through whoever you've been)
Through whoever you'll be (through whoever you'll be)
Through whatever you lose (through whatever you lose)
You will always have me (you will always have me)
At the end of your road (at the end of your road)
I'll be holding you taut (I'll be holding you taut)
I'm gonna be right by your side no matter what
Be right by your side, Be right by your side
Be right by your side no matter what
