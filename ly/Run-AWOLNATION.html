		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am a human being, capable of doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of doing terrible things

There's lightning striking all over the world
There's lightning striking all over the world
There's lightning striking all over the world
There's lightning striking all over the world

Ooh
I am a human being, capable of doing terrible things
I am a human being, capable of doing terrible things

Run

Oh oh oh
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey

You people are mistaken if you think that
I'm awake and celebrating anything that I've become
You people are mistaken if you think that
I'm awake and celebrating anything that I've become
