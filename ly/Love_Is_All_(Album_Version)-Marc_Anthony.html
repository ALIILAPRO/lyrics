		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey yeah
Na ha, ah-ah ha
Ah ha

When you hold me like this
So many memories fill my eyes
The first time we kissed
The times we nearly said good-bye
But still here we are
Tested and tried and still true
And stronger than we ever knew

Love is all
The laughter and the tears that fall
The mundane and the magical
Love is all
All is love
The careless word, the healing touch
The getting and the giving of
All is love

There's a me you've always known
The me that's a stranger still
The you that feels like home
And the you that never will
But still here we lie
Tender and trusting and true
With everything that we've been through

Love is all
The laughter and the tears that fall
The mundane and the magical
Oh, love is all
All is love
The careless word, the healing touch
The getting and the giving of
All is love

All the glory
All the pain
All the passion
That turns to ashes
Only to rise again

Love is all
The laughter and the tears that fall
The mundane and the miracle
Love is all
All is love
The careless word, the healing touch
The getting and the giving of
All is love
