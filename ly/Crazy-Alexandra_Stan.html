		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One is for power
Two is for energy
Three is for droid

Pull a little bit of energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy
Fill me up with your energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy

You know I feel so good
When you make me lose control
And I think, I think I'm about to
Yeah, I'm about to dance
I know you give me the power
So I don't wanna waste my time
And I said, I said I'm about to
Yeah, I'm about to dance

Pull a little bit of energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy
Fill me up with your energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy

Pull a little bit of energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy
Fill me up with your energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy

One is for power
Two is for energy
Three is for droid

I know you give me the power
So I don't wanna waste my time
And I said I said I'm about to
Yeah, I'm about to dance
You know I feel so good
When you make me lose control
And I think, I think I'm about to
Yeah, I'm about to dance

Pull a little bit of energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy
Fill me up with your energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy

Pull a little bit of energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy
Fill me up with your energy
Yeah, you know
You turn me on
I think I go crazy

Pull a little bit of energy
(One is for power)
Fill me up with your energy
(Two is for energy)
Pull a little bit of energy
(Three is for droid)
