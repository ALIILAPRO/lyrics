		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was made for lovin' you, baby
You were made for lovin' me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

Made for love
It's what I'm made for
I can't get enough

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me?

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me (I want it all)
And I can give it all to you, baby
Can you give it all to me? (Oh, all)

I can't get enough

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

I was made for loving you
(Can't get enough)
I was made for love
(Can't get enough)
I can't get enough of you
I can't get enough

I was made for loving you, baby
You were made for loving me (you were made for loving me)
And I can't get enough of you, baby
Can you get enough of me? (Can you get enough)

I was made for loving you, baby (made for love)
You were made for loving me
And I can give it all to you, baby (I want it all)
Can you give it all to me?
