		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you stay up for the weekend
And blame God for looking too old?
Can we find all that you stand for
Has been replaced with mountains of gold?

You cannot dream yourself to notice
To feel pain and swallow fear
But can you stay up for the weekend
'Til next year?

God, I can't do this any more
Though I'll be laid down on the floor
As many feet walk through the door
I'm not alone

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone?

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone? No

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone?

If I see a light flashing
Could this mean that I'm coming home?
If I see a man waving
Does this mean that I'm not alone? No
