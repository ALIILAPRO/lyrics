		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know my uses
I have my pride
But my heart is still untamed
I learned my lessons
I've conquered death
I go on and I'm unashamed
I'll paint your bones to match my eyes
They're the darkest I have ever seen
Until I'm lucid, I can't be told
I know my voices
They tell me to believe

Another fucking accident out of control
All the attitudes will never change
My imitations are leading the way
I can't accept that I still don't find this strange

In light of my ability to feel denial
I walk away from everything with just a smile
The agony of coming home has gone away
It's everywhere
It's everyone
It's every day

Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life

I beg your pardon
I'm out of the way
A new conspiracy has taken my place
So over and over, I smell the decay
Believe what you want to, the cycle stays the same

In light of my ability to undermine
I walk away from apathy, I'm feeling fine
The agony of cynicism beckons me
It's everywhere, it's everyone, it's everything

Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life

Let's, pretend, we're not at the end
Pretend, that we have nothing left
Let's, pretend, we're not at the end
Pretend, that we have nothing left
Let's, pretend, we're not at the end
Pretend, that we have nothing left
Let's, pretend, we're not at the end
Pretend, that we have nothing left

Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life
Are you ready for the time of your life

Let's, pretend, we're not at the end
Pretend, that we have nothing left
Let's, pretend, we're not at the end
Pretend, that we have nothing left
