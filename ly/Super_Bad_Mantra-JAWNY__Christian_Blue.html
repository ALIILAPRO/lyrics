		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She is super bad
Heart under attack
She is super bad
She got me feeling easy, she's my mantra

She is super bad
Heart under attack
She is super bad
She got me feeling easy, she's my mantra

You got me
In a headlock and I like it baby
He's not me
He get by but girl I buy it we got chemistry
We get intimate she's into me my energy
We get in the crib too bright for me so
Lights out
She's so super bad I wanna pipe she tell me pipe down
Soon as we get home I told my queen take off your tights now
Knew just what she want I'm sending signals like a lighthouse
She know I don't bite she want a piece I told her bite down

She is super bad
Heart under attack
She is super bad
She got me feeling easy, she's my mantra

She is super bad
Heart under attack
She is super bad
She got me feeling easy, she's my mantra

Game on ten when I walk in the spot
All white kicks with the bright blue socks
She wanna salsa, tomato
She got too hot, jalapeno
The shoes came off
Her tube top missing
Now the room thang locked
The girl start kissin' on my ooh thang mwuah
She gone put me in a headlock and I like it
I might wife that
You could be the end of the night
No bluffin', won't sike, no cappin' my night cap
I got the keys to the whip
You can bring all of yo friends to the night sack
She wanna swim in the light
No clubbin', no lie, more lovin' let's light that
I got the green in the spliff
She wanna piece of the kid told her bite that

She is super bad
Heart under attack
She is super bad
She got me feeling easy, she's my mantra

She is super bad
Heart under attack
She is super bad
She got me feeling easy, she's my mantra
