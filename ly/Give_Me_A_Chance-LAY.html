Girl I can't get away

Yeah, yeah
I'm searching for your love, like everywhere
Yeah but 
Baby tell me that there something is there
'Cause I be 'round like, lookin' like

One or two, three
Where you at? 
Can you come and take me?
To a place where it's just you and me
And it goes like fine
I know what you're 
Lookin' for
And I can be this 
Love and more
We just gotta know that
We just gotta go

'Cause I
I've been on you
Let you know how I feelin'

I'm runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' out
Runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' down

For you, yeah

Uh, it's like I found my angel
Uh, perfect at every angle
Yeah, and she's straight up out a dream
Turns out my baby was everything I need

Do you know, do you know that I love that?
When you're here, when you're here, on the runway
If I go, if I go, then you know that 
I'm on my way

'Cause I
I've been on you
Let you know how I feelin'

Runnin' runnin' runnin' runnin' down
