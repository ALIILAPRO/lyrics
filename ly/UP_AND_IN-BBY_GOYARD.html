		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down and out I'm so up and in
Air drop she gets shared with the friends
Banana peels on the floor don't slip
BBY Go 10k on the hip

I'm seeing the lights Las Vegas Strip
Thom Browne jacket I feel like a prip
I'm barely here I look like a myth
I'm talkin that shit cause I'm really here

Stop in the coupe I know what it is
Highrise on the 45th
I popped me a blooper oops
Yea I just did it again
Valentino Swans swims
Goyard bitch the designer on him
Exotic labs like the walls too thin
Puttin the halo ontop of the AM heaven Sent

Activities paranormal
Ghost in this house make somе dead
Parade floats in this house
Shе give throat in this house
I'm high as fuck I feel like
A shoe was my house
Gettin lost in my own house
She like BBY you just made a new sound
It go UHHH huhhh like I'm falling down

Maltese seats pullin teeth out
Nitemare, I'm so nightmare I'm
Pullin dreams out mixing green whatchu need
I just riding clouds
The 3rd wall wasn't enough I'm
Tryna break the 4TH down
