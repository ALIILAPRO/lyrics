		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never hit me when you're sober, it's already over
I'm already off that, it's alright
You never hit me when you're sober, too late to come over
Sick of sayin' sorry for last night (yeah)

You lose my number, you're such a mess
You wake up hungover, now you're depressed
Tryin' too hard, don't hit me up
Tryna sell me somethin', give it up

Now you're all alone
And the ones that you don't love
Are closer than the ones that you do
Blowin' up my phone, it's like we're startin' all over

You never hit me when you're sober, it's already over
I'm already off that, it's alright
You never hit me when you're sober, too late to come over
Sick of sayin' sorry for last night (yeah)

Go back to hell, go find yourself
You fucked me over too many times that I can help
I'm burnin' our pictures so I don't remember
Every single time you only thought of yourself

Now you're all alone
And the ones that you don't love
Are closer than the ones that you do
Blowin' up my phone, it's like we're startin' all over

You never hit me when you're sober, it's already over
I'm already off that, it's alright
You never hit me when you're sober, too late to come over
Sick of sayin' sorry for last night

You lose my number, you're such a mess
You wake up hungover, now you're depressed
You're tryin' too hard, don't hit me up
Tryna sell me somethin', give it up (one, two)

You never hit me when you're sober, it's already over
I'm already off that, it's alright
You never hit me when you're sober, too late to come over
Sick of sayin' sorry for last night

You're never, you're never sober (sorry) 
You're never sober (sorry)
You're never sorry for last night (sorry for last night)
You're never sober (sorry) 
You're never sober (sorry)
You're never sorry for last night (yeah)
