		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ty Beats)

I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected, plus I'm well connected
With this Coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowin' blunts, rollin' doobies up, smokin' sections
Groupies rush, hold they boobies up in my direction
Quit with all the frontin', you ain't 'round my click for nothin'
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessin'

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause everyday we on our pesos (pesos)
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause everyday we on our pesos (pesos)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
'Cause everyday we on our pesos

Yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot, if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showin' off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'ma G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breath
Inhale, exhale, cocaine, X pills
Import, export, Harlem catching rec still (uh)
So, mami, show me how that neck feel (feel)
Later show me how the rest feel, for now just chill

This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause everyday we on our pesos 
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause everyday we on our pesos
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
(Gun cock, gunshot, gun a likkle bwoy)
'Cause everyday we on our pesos

'Cause everyday we on our pesos
'Cause everyday we on our pesos
