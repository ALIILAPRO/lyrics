		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love to do just what I want
Do it when you say I won't
Now come and watch me move it
I promise I'ma make you lose it

Looking at me
Naw come get it
Like what you see then you got good vision
Boy this beat
Hit so different
Let me show you what you been missing

If you love to party
Then the parties in the place
Got the boom, got the bass
I'ma shake it in your face
Yeah I love to party
And I love to make it rain
Got the boom, got the bang
You can take that to the bank

Going dum deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Watch the drum go dum
Deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Watch the drum go dum

I just wanna be free
Ain't no way you stopping me
Said I wanted to fly
So I went and got some wings

And I don't
Don't need you
To act like you gone hold me down
'Cause I won't believe you
No one can touch me now

Feeling like I run it
Checked my pulse over one hundred
Got no peak
I got no summit
I'm not average, I don't sum it
That's from sun up and from sun down
Shining like the sun out
Think you mirror image but you looking like a fun house

Looking at me
Naw come get it
Like what you see then you got good vision
Boy this beat
Hit so different
Let me show you what you been missing

If you love to party
Then the parties in the place
Got the boom, got the bass
I'ma shake it in your face
Yeah I love to party
And I love to make it rain
Got the boom, got the bang
You can take that to the bank

Going dum, deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Watch the drum go dum
Deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Deedumdumdum
Watch the drum go dum

Going yeah, going yeah yeah, going going yeah

Going dum, dumdudeedumdum
Dumdudeedumdum
Dumdudeedumdum
Dumdududumdum
Dumdudeedumdum
Dumdudeedumdum yeah
Watch the drum go dum

Bang bang bang boom
Bang bang bang boom
Bang bang bang boom
Bang bang 
Dududumdumdum

I just wanna be free
Ain't no way you stopping me
Said I wanted to fly
So I went and got some wings
And I don't
Don't need you
To act like you gone hold me down
'Cause I won't believe you
No one can touch me now

Watch the drum go dum
Watch the drum go dum
Watch the drum go dum
