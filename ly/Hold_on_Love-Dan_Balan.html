		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It sleeps more than often

Why?
Inner fights
I won't ignore
Them anymore
My crime is human kind
I'd bare it all
To change my world

It sleeps slips more than often
It sleeps slips more than often
Free my hidden laughter
Free the wild man
Hold
Hold on love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there
Hold (hold, hold)
Hold on love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there

Time
Blindful eyes
My sins are raw
Now and before
All night
My instincts fight
These deepest wrongs
Divided worlds

It sleeps more than often
It sleeps more than often
Free my hidden laughter
Free the wild man
Hold
Hold on love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there
Hold
Hold on love
All the love is there
Just find the reason
Just give me a reason

Hold on love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there
Hold (hold, hold)
Hold on love
All the love is there
Love is there
All the love is there
