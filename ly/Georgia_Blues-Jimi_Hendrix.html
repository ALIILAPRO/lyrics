		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born in George 27 years ago
Yes I was
I was born down in Georgia
People let me tell you, 27 years ago
Augusta Georgia, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
I've had heartaches and misery
And I ain't got no place to go
Have you ever seen a man
With tears rolling down his face
Good God, all-mighty, you know what I'm talking about
Have you ever seen a man
With tears rolling down his face
You know what I'm talking about
They say that a man, a man ain't supposed to cry
But somebody tell me what else can I do?
But my little girl just walked out on me
Mama, ooh mama mama
Can you hear your little boy calling your name
Yeah yeah
Ooh mama mama mama 
Can you hear your little boy calling your name

The blues has got me
And I'm in so much misery and pain
Somebody, somebody listen to what I got to say
I need a little help, I need a little help right now
Lord I need I need a helping hand
Good God all-mighty
I said I need a little help right now
Lord I need a helping hand
My life, my life just ain't no good
And I'm living in the world, without a helping hand
Somebody come on and help me out here
Come on, come on and help me out right now

So long, everybody
Lord I don't see no reason to stay around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me say it again
I said so long, goodbye everybody
Lord I don't see no reason to stay around
Well now, the little girl that I love has gone and left me
And all my friends, all my friends have put me down
All my friends have put me down
