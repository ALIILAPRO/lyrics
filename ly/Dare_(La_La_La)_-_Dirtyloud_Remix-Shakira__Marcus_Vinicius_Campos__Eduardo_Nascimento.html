		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Olá, olá)

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
I dare you

Leggo
Leggo
Leggo
Leggo

All of my life, too late
'Till you showed up with perfect timing
Now, here we are, you rock it
Our fingers are stuck in the socket
It's just the nature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la (truth or dare on the dance floor)
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (oh, oh, oh, oh)
La, la, la, la, la, la
I dare you

Leggo
Leggo

Of all the millions on the planet
You're the one who's keeping me on it
You know I like you, like nobody's business
And your blue Spanish eyes are my witness
It's just the nature, a game
Get ready, we'll do it again
Let's not recover from the hangover
When your eyes got me drunk I was sober

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare on the dance floor

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la (truth or dare on the dance floor)
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la (oh, oh, oh, oh)
La, la, la, la, la, la
I dare you

Is it true that you love me?
I dare you to kiss me
I dare you to touch me (olá, olá)
It's truth or dare on the dance floor 

Dance floor, dance floor (olá, olá)
Dance, dance, dance, dance (olá, olá)
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (olá, olá)
(Olá, olá)

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la 
La, la, la, la, la, la
I dare you

Leggo
Leggo
Leggo
