		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back
Space Cowboy just play that track
Gaga in the room
So starstruck
Cherry-cherry-cherry Cherry Boom Boom

Rollin' up to the club on the weekend
Styling out to the beat that you're freakin'
Fantasize, I'm the track that you're tweakin'
Blow my heart up

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Queue me up, I'm the 12 on your table
I'm so starstruck

I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up 

Baby, now that we're alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Wanna scratch me back and forth back and forth? Uh-huh

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus to the verse
Reverse

I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up 

Hey, lil mamma, like really, really is that him?
I done seen you before
What you got on them big rims?
Enter that cash flow
I'm like, baby, you don't trip
So shawty, say hand over your signature right here
Like adjust the dotted line, and I'm supposed to sign
How she at it, a fanatic and I think it's goin' down
She so starstruck, the gal all stuck
I shoulda had an overdose, too many Starbucks
Ain't never seen a balla, paper that stack taller
Stunners who let the top back on the Chevy Impala
Hummers and all that, fully loaded with two spoilers
What did you call that when you showed up with two dollars?
But that's another chapter, son of a bachelor
All on me, just spotted a baby actor
Complete swagger, there go the dagger
Got what she wants, shawty happily ever after

I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up 

Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track
Groove, slam, work it back
Filter that
Baby, bump that track

Baby, now that we're alone, got a request
Would you make me number one on your playlist?
Got your Dre headphones with the left side on
Want to scratch me back and forth back and forth, uh-huh

Put your hands on my waist, pull the fader
Run it back with original flavor
Get the breakdown first
Up until the chorus to the verse
I'm so, I'm so

Starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
I'm so starstruck
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up (I'm so starstruck)
Baby, 'cause you blow my heart up
