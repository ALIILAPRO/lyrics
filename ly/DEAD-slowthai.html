		<p>
		  Take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

See me posted up with a bimbo
Easy, life's been fucked and that's my window
It's just me, my friends and my kinfolk
We just laid a bet and it come in so
B just bought a round, we watch the football
We don't take kindly to no insults
We all aim at you plain and simple
Achoo, no bless you, I gotta get you

Take away my loved ones, you will never take the light
That shines inside my heart and makes me real by design
When it's ugly change for money, see that they ain't got no spine
People change for money, what's money with no time?
Say it once, say it once, yeah
Everybody dies
Say it once, said it once (yeah)
Everybody dies
My vida loca, true I lead this crazy life
Tune banging in the motor, gun-fingers to the sky

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

What don't kill you, fam, makes you stronger
I take liberties, try and I prosper
With no Nicotine, Ty is a monster
You snake slithering, I'm Harry Potter
Leave a sentiment, steeped in vodka
No one here ever can knock my posture
I stand tall, you ball, curl up and sob, brah
I carve my name into each and every log

When we go (where?)
Where the flowers grow
Let me know
How it goes
I dare say it's rare for me to care 
I stare at thin air imagining what could be there
I visualize and see to your surprise
My demise could never be (yeah)
On G-O-D (God)
You can take away my time, you can't take away my mind
My legend will live for eternity (I'm forever, blood)

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time

They can take away my flesh
But they'll never take my mind
I am dead, I am God
I am here 'til the end of time
