		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a mallwhore and my Pradas look like Tom Ford's
Black leather gl- gloves on, they hardcore
Actually bro, excuse me, you got these in silver? Yeah, yeah
No, like shit

I'm a mallwhore and my Pradas look like Tom Ford
Black gloves on, yeah, I'm lookin' hardcore
Hitman, yeah, I'm rockin' with the dark lord
If you all for me, baby, then I'm all yours
Sometimes I don't understand what it's all for
But I understand when they see me, then they all sore
Death knockin' on my door, that's the front door
Dip out of the back door, hop into the black Porsche
Hop into the black Porsche, she say I should talk more
I can't even talk more, you should check the scoreboard
Mallwhore, and my Pradas look like Tom Ford
Black gloves on, yeah, I'm lookin' hardcore
Walk in Neiman, yeah, walk in Saks, yeah
Yeah, spend that rack, yeah
P-P-Prada backpack in the Fendi store, yeah
And you know we smell like weed in the Prada store
And you know we gettin' free shit in Fendi stores, yeah
Prada backpackin' in the Louis store
My girl said she need some shit too, I hit Dior
Boing!
I'm still in the night, yeah, I'm out, yeah
I'm still in the night, yeah, I'm out, yeah
I know you see me winnin', allow it, uh
This Drain life, I'm about it
I'm the founder, yeah, I found it
Play the game, yeah, I foul it
Foul
