		<p>
		  Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Said, baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked? (Ah)

I don't think 'bout anybody
But being beside your body, baby
You can leave open windows
Don't care who see me out my clothes, baby
Yeah, I like bananas and peaches
And some might say it's indecent
That's just crazy (that's just crazy)
Can we start out at mine and then to yours?
Heels on, waiting at your door
I don't wanna play no more
Leave everything on the floor

You don't need a pole to see me strip
Only thing I want 'cept your lips
Take it to the top, boy, skinny dip
(So hot, your body on mine, your body on)
I don't even wanna get a grip
I just like it when you grab my hips
Can you feel it through your fingertips?

(How do I)
How do I keep these on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell when you lock the door
Just what was going on

Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?
When can we take off all our clothes?

Baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Said, baby, you're so anxious
You can't take it
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked?
Can we take this off and get naked? (Ah)

Follow me to my dressing room
Let me know if you ain't bout that NSFW
Now it's safe to finish what we started
First impression of you is you really like to party
Swirling all up on ya 'cause I know you wanna dance
Let me cordially invite you to this party in my pants
How you got me sprung and don't say sorry in advance?
Show me all your tatts not just the ones that's on your hands
Who's your designer?
Is that birthday suit one of a kind? Uh
Everything about you like it's on purpose
God was working, probably took some extra time though
Ay, you all up in my curves like a puzzle piece, mh
Jigsaw, let me see your muscleces, mh
After we fuck, I'ma wanna cuddle
We could take it to the kitchen
I'll be on the island, come and eat, mh

How do I keep these on?
How do I let you know?
Boy, you deserve a show
Deserve to get comfortable
It's only natural
I could tell when you lock the door
Just what was going on

Boy, can we take off all our clothes?
(Anxious, you can't take it)
(Can we take this off and get naked?) When can we take off all our clothes?
(Can we take this off and get naked?) 
(Can we take this off and get naked?) When can we take off all our clothes?
(Said baby, anxious, you can't take it)
(Can we take this off and get naked?) When can we take off all our clothes?
(Can we take this off and get naked?) 
(Can we take this off and get naked? Ah)

Touch, touch my body
Just touch, touch my body
Just touch me
Ay, touch my body, just
(Touch me, touch me) yeah
Touch, touch my body
Just touch, touch my body
Just touch me
Uh, touch my body, yeah
Touch me, baby

(Touch, touch my body)
(Just touch me, touch me, baby)
(I'll touch you)
(Touch my body, just, uh)
