		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gentleman, screwing in moderation, screwing is such a bore
None of that time is wasted I do that shit on tour

Oh ya, all right, oh yea, all right
I wanna make some babies, I wanna get it up
I wanna make you horny, but I can't get it up
I wanna make some money, but I don't want no job
I wanna make you horny, but I can't get it up
Get it up get it up get it up, get it up
(Why can't you get it up?)

It must be your face, or your body
If it ain't your body then it must be your face

Screwing in moderation, screwing is such a bore
None of my time is wasted, ill do that shit on tour

Oh ya, all right, oh yea, all right
I wanna make some babies, I wanna get it up
I wanna make you horny, but I can't get it up
I wanna make some money, but I don't want no job
I wanna make you horny, but I can't get it up
Get it up get it up get it up, get it up
(Why can't you get it up?)

Uh, Jesus, ha, I've never had this problem before
It's just, hold on a second ah give it a minute
Give it a minute, alright just give it a minute uh
Do something sexy, I don't care do something sexy
Just whatever you do
Don't talk about your fucking boyfriend while we're having sex
How about that?

Oh ya, all right, oh yea, all right
I wanna make some babies, I wanna get it up
I wanna make you horny, but I can't get it up
I wanna make some money, but I don't want no job
I wanna make you horny, but I can't get it up
Get it up get it up get it up, get it up
(Why can't you get it up?)
