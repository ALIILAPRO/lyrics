		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the farm, every Friday
On the farm, it's rabbit pie day
So ev'ry friday, that ever comes along
I get up early, and sing this little song

Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run 
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
Bang, bang, bang, bang! Goes the farmer's gun
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run, run 

Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun
He'll get by without his rabbit pie
So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run

Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run 
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
Bang, bang, bang, bang! Goes the farmer's gun
Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run, run 

Run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
Don't give the farmer his fun, fun, fun
He'll get by without his rabbit pie
So run, rabbit, run, rabbit, run, run, run
