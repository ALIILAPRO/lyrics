		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All aboard the disco train
Alright now, oh, yeah, oh, yeah

Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk
I'm a woman's man, no time to talk
Music's loud and women warm
I've been kicked around since I've been born

It's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everyone is shakin'
And stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

Everybody on the dance floor, darlin's
We're goin' to dance with the Devil

Well, I get low and I get high
And if I can't get either, I really try
Got the wings of Heaven on my shoes
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose

Now, it's all right, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Feel the city breakin' and everyone is shakin'
They're stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive
Ha, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive

It's all right, it's okay
And you may look the other way
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

It's all right, it's okay
I'll live to see another day
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man

Are you ready, Disco Man
Oh, yeah, all right now
I'm back
