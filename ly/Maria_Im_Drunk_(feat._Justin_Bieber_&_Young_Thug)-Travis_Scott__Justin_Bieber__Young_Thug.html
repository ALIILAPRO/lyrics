		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Made it to LA, yeah
Finally in LA, yeah
Lookin' for the weed though
Tryna make my own dough
Callin' for Maria
Lost without Maria
Might dive in the marina

So trust me, baby trust me
Trust me, baby trust me
Trust me, baby trust me
I don't mind
Trust me, baby trust me
Trust me, baby trust me
Trust me, baby trust me
I don't mind
(Trust me)
(Trust me)
(Trust me)
(Trust me)
(Trust me)
(Trust me)
Yeah I don't mind

Travi$ Scott
Thugger Thugger, nigga

Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk

Twelve more hours left for us in a day (call your friends and let's get drunk)
I've been drinkin' all day, I've been floatin' all day (call your friends and let's get drunk)
Bring your ass over here now
You know where, how I stay
I've been gone for some time now
I just want a lil' taste
Mix it, mix it, pour (Lean, lean)
(Call your friends and let's get drunk)
Drinkin', sippin', slow
(Call your friends and let's get drunk)
Drink so cold now, froze, froze, froze
Come on over, get drunk

Damn girl, I'll be up late
If you want you can meet me at the studio
Yeah, I've been drinkin' all night
Take a shot, all we got is Don Julio
I'm guessin' this is new to you
Thinkin' 'bout all the things that I would do to you
Them lips on fire and them hips don't lie
Girl I just wanna see what that booty do
Let's lose each other's mind
Let's make each other's night
Take advantage of time
While we're both intertwined
Girl I want you on the rocks, no chaser
Be sure to drink it all, won't waste ya
I know you stay sober
I'm sure a few drinks won't phase you

Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk

Caress lil' mama for weed
And she did it for free (call your friends and lets get drunk)
Yeah, that thing wet, baby, I need skis (call your friends let's get drunk)
Yeah I need to skeet
Run it back from the track
Then I'mma speed race in that
Lil' mama still got my back
Pull down your pants, I want crack
I'm growing weed, this ain't trees (bitch)
My bitch brown like Hennessy (bitch)
Big blood like Freddy in dreams (bitch)
Dressed in a tie like the Dean (bitch)
Drunk and in love with my baby
Baby do not go fast, go slow, wait
Tell me, tell me information I got rank (tell me)
Let's take a shot together and then lay up like planks
Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady
Patr√≥n down, back down, they got a plan 'fore that boy wake
Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)
Every time I try to stick it in all the way
Baby girl be like "ay ay, ay ay"

Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends, let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk

Call your friends and let's get drunk
Call your friends and let's get drunk
