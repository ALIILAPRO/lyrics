		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went to see the doctor
He said you're pretty sick
You got some real bad habits
You'd better stop right quick

I said doctor that's real bad news
Don't know what I'm gonna do

Doctor
There's nothin' wrong with me
Doctor doctor
Can't you see
Doctor
I ain't gonna die
Just write me an alibi

I went to see a shaman
He said you'll be alright
Just keep doin' what you love
Every single night

I said that's what I need to hear
? my childish fears

Doctor
?
Doctor doctor
My oh my
Doctor
You're the one for me
That's the mojo that I need

Don't you know that I feel alright
Doin' what I do
I ain't gonna tow the line
Not till' I turn blue
All I got is one short life
That's what people say
And I ain't gonna waste a second
Doin' what you say

I won't be the one you like
I won't be the boy next door
I won't be the chosen one
That's not what I'm here for
I don't like the way you are
I despise what you hold dear
Don't you try to make me change
I'll haunt you for a thousand years

Doctor
Don't you ?
Doctor
Don't you ?
Doctor
Stay away from me
Sick is what I'd rather be
Doctor
Doctor doctor death
Doctor
Doctor out of breath
Doctor
I ain't gonna die
Just write me an alibi
