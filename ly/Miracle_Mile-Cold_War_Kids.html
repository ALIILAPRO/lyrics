		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was supposed to do great things
I'd know the rule's law
But I wasn't raised to shoot for fame
I had the safety on
I cut my ties, I sold my rings
I wanted none of this
If you start from scratch and have to sing
Just for the fun of it

I'll be alright, if I could just see you
Come up for air, come up for air
A miracle mile where does it lead to?
Come up for air, come up for air

I feel the air upon my face, forget the mess I'm in
Hold me again, don't count mistakes, I lost track of them

I'll be alright, if I could just see you
Come up for air, come up for air
A miracle mile where does it lead to?
Come up for air, come up for air

I was in the mud, I was in the dirt
Went underground and I thought what I was worth
All alone and I know I can't stay, but
We're walking up and down the streets to stay awake

Come up for air, come up for air, come up
Come up for air, come up for air, come up
Come up for air, come up for air, come up
Come up for air, come up for air, come up

Get outside, get out over the world
A little love, what you can return
Adrenaline and let me push some
But you and breathe one breath a time

Come up for air, come up for air, come up
Come up for air, come up for air, come up
Come up for air, come up for air, come up

I'll be alright, if I could just see you
Come up for air, come up for air
A miracle mile where does it lead to?
Come up for air, come up for air

I'll be alright, if I could just see you
A miracle mile where does it lead to?
