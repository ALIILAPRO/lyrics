		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even know the time
When I saw you baby
When I took my single chance
With my heart and lost it 

And you were more than pretty lover
And it was more to be forgotten
U didn't have any rules
And now I know what it means 

 So long, I don't need nobody
So long, Ever since I loved u
So long, I don't need nobody
So long, Ever since I loved u 

 I keep having my same dream
That one day youâ€™ll call me
And I'll take my second chance
With my heart and I'll win it 

Cuz you were more than just a number
And it was more to be so far from
But u were running from me
And now I know what it means 

 So long, I don't need nobody
So long, Ever since I loved u
So long, I don't need nobody
So long, Ever since I loved u
