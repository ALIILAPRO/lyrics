		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Murder I am, you know it was me
I was the one, that you didn't see
I was the cut, down to your bone
I put you there under that stone 

I, I am the blade
I am the dream of the brave
I, I am the knife
I bring grief to your wife
I, I am the sword
I am the word of the Lord

Do what you will, I bring you the edge 
I am the one to sever your head
I cut so deep, I can cut straight
It all depends on the move you make

I, I am the blade
I am the promise unmade
I, I am the knife
I bring death to your life
I, I am the ax
To stop you dead in your tracks
I, I am the sword
I bring the fear of the Lord

Centuries pass, dust in the wind
I shall remain, shining in sin
The metal I am, the iron you feel
The song of the dead, the chorus of steel

I, I am the blade
I break the oath that you made
I, I am the mace
I am the blow in the face
I, I am the ax
To cut down heroes like rats
I, I am the sword
I do the work of the Lord
