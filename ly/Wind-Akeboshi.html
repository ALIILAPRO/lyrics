		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cultivate your hunger
Before you idealize
Motivate your anger
To make them all realize
Climbing the mountain 
never coming down
Break into the contents
Never falling down

My knee is still shaking
Like I was 12
Sneaking out the classroom
By the back door
A man rallied at me twice though
But I didn't care
Waiting is waisting for people like me

Don't try 
To live so wise
Don't cry
'Cause your so right
Don't dry
With fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

Don't try 
To live so wise
Don't cry
'Cause your so right
Don't dry
With fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

You say
Dreams are dreams
I ain't 
Gonna play the fool
Anymore
You say
'Cause I still got my soul

Take your time baby
Your blood need slowin' down
Breach your soul to reach yourself
Before you gloom
Reflection of fear 
makes shadows of nothing
Shadows of nothing

Don't try 
To look so wise
Don't cry
'Cause your so right
Don't dry 
With fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

Your still blind 
If you see a winding road
Cause there's always 
a straight way 
to the point you see

Don't try 
To look so wise
Don't cry
'Cause your so right
Don't dry
With fakes or fears
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end

'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end
