		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On a rooftop in Brooklyn
At one in the morning
Watching the lights flash
In Manhattan

I see five bridges
The Empire State Building
And you said something
That I've never forgotten

We lean against railings
Describing the colors
And the smells of our homelands
Acting like lovers

How did we get here?
To this point of living?
I held my breath
And you said something

And I'm doing nothing wrong
Riding in your car
The radio playing
We sing up to the eighth floor
A rooftop, Manhattan
At one in the morning
And you said something
That I've never forgotten

You said something
You said something
You said something
That was really important
