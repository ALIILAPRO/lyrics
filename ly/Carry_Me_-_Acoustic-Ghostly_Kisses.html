		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Half asleep
My heart is heavy
Running on empty
Why won't you talk to me?
Just need you to give me
If only a small piece
Of your love
 
So, I know,
it won't fade away (And I just want you to know)
my love
no games
I miss you every day (And I just want you to know)
my love
no games
I miss you everyday
 
When I close my eyes
Can't say goodbye
I see you hiding even now
Between the scars
Left on my heart
It's like you carry me somehow
Carry me somehow
I see you hiding even now
 
Can't you see?
I need you to reach me
If only to find peace
Why won't you won't talk to me?
Just need you to give me
If only a small piece
From above
 
So, I know,
it won't fade away (And I just want you to know)
my love
no games
I miss you everyday
 
When I close my eyes
Can't say goodbye
I swear I feel you even now
Between the scars
Left on my heart
It's like you carry me somehow
Carry me somehow
I swear I feel you even now
 
I don't know if I can say goodbye
Don't want to play around no more
I don't know if I can say goodbye
Don't want to play around no more
 
Carry me somehow
I swear I feel you even now
