		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love, here I stand before you
I am yours now from this moment on
Take my hand, only you can stop me shaking
We'll share forever, this I promise you

(chorus 1)
And when I look in your eyes
All of my life is before me
And I'm not running anymore
‘Cause I already know I'm home
With every beat of my heart
I'll give you my love completely
My darling, this I promise you

My love, I can feel your heartbeat
As we dance now closer than before
Don't let go, ‘cause I could almost cry now
This is forever, I make this vow to you

(chorus 2)
And when I look in your eyes
All of my life is before me
And I'm not running anymore
‘Cause I already know I'm home
With every beat of my heart
I'll give you my love completely
My darling, this I promise you
My darling, this I promise you
My darling, this I promise you
