		  Maybe
Woah if I could pray and I try, dear
You might come back home, home to me

Maybe
Whoa, if I could ever hold your little hand
Ooh you might understand
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah

Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe dear
I guess I might have done something wrong
Honey I'd be glad to admit it
Ooh, come on home to me
Honey maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe yeah

Well I know that it just doesn't ever seem to matter, baby
Woah honey, when I go out or what I'm trying to do
'Cause you see I'm still left here
And I'm all alone and needing you

Please, please, please, please
Oh won't you reconsider babe
Now come on, I said come back
Won't you come back to me

Maybe dear, oh maybe, maybe, maybe
Let me help you show me how
Honey, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah
Maybe, maybe, maybe, yeah
Ooh
