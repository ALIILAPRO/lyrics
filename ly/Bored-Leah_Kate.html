		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lookin' through your phone 'cause I'm so insecure
So, so, so insecure, so, so insecure
I might just start a fight in the middle of the store
Mi-mi-middle of the store, mi-middle of the store

Samantha was perfect
And Rachel was worth it
But I know you prefer this
Crazy kinda love I give

I'm nothing like the girls that you've been with before
Be-be-been with before, be-been with before
If you don't call me right back, I'ma kick down the door
But at least with me you'll never be bored
I'm nothing like the girls that you've been with before
Be-be-been with before, be-been with before
Yeah, we break up, make up, wake up with our clothes on the floor
But at least with me you'll never be bored

Promise me you're mine and I'll maybe be yours
May-may-maybe be yours, may-maybe be yours
Wait until you call then I'm hitting ignore
Hi-hi-hitting ignore, hi-hitting ignore (not right now)

Sarah was no angel
Losin' Maddie was so painful
But I'm still here, so be grateful
For this crazy kinda love I give (crazy kinda love I give)

I'm nothing like the girls that you've been with before
Be-be-been with before, be-been with before
If you don't call me right back, I'ma kick down the door
But at least with me you'll never be bored
I'm nothing like the girls that you've been with before
Be-be-been with before, be-been with before
Yeah, we break up, make up, wake up with our clothes on the floor
But at least with me you'll never be bored

Samantha was perfect
And Rachel was worth it
But I know you prefer this
Crazy kinda love I give

I'm nothing like the girls that you've been with before
Be-be-been with before, be-been with before
If you don't call me right back, I'ma kick down the door
But at least with me you'll never be bored
I'm nothing like the girls that you've been with before
Be-be-been with before, be-been with before
Yeah, we break up, make up, wake up with our clothes on the floor
But at least with me you'll never be bored

I'm nothing like the girls, nothing like the girls
Nothing like the girls, nothing like the girls
Nothing like the girls, nothing like the girls
But at least with me you'll never be bored
