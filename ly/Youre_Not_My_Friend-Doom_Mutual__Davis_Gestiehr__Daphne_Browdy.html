		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through the backdoor of my fucked up brain where the chemicals don't help
Swimming inside of this private hell where I only race myself
Please forgive me this is learned not taught can't be borrowed can be bought
Then again I'm just a victim of the life I live
You're not my friend
You're not my friend
You're not my friend
Then again there's no controlling what goes on within
Pay attention but I can't sit still if I'm following the rules
At my discretion, I won't pay the price for assembling the fools
Please forgive me but I'm not to blame for my cowardice and shame
Then again I'm just a victim of the life I live
You're not my friend
You're not my friend
You're not my friend
Then again there's no controlling what goes on within
I'll never be the same again
Fight for the means to see the end
I teach the class to play pretend
I'll stop the jokes when I am dead
You're not my friend
You're not my friend
You're not my friend
Then again I'm just a victim of the life I live
