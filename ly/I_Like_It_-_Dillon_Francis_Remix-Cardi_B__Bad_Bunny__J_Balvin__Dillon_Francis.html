		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said I like it like that 
You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like that 
You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like that 
You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like– 

Now I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like stunting, I like shining 
I like million dollar deals, where's my pen? Bitch I'm signin' (signin') 
I like those Balenciagas, the ones that look like socks 
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch (cha-ching) 
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance (what?) 
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't (she can't) 
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale 
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari 
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe (coupe) 
Big Dipper on top of the roof 
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can 
Eating halal, driving the Lam' 
Told that bitch I'm sorry though (sorry) 
'Bout my coins like Mario (Mario) 
Yeah, they call me Cardi B 
I run this shit like cardio

I said I like it like
I said I like it like
I said I like it like
I said I like it like that 

Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching 
Beat it up like piñatas 
Tell the driver, close the curtains 
Bad bitch make you nervous 

Chambean, chambean, pero no jalan (¡jalan!) 
Tú compras to'a las Jordan, bo', a mí me las regalan (hehe-he) 
I spend in the club (wouh), what you have in the bank (yeh) 
This is the new religion, bang, it's Latino gang, gang, yeh 

Bad Bunny, be, be, be, be, be, be 
The Latino, the latino, the latino, the latino 
Bad Bunny, be, be, be, be, be, be 
The Latino, the latino, the latino, the latino 
The Latino, the latino, the latino, the latino gang, gang, yeh 
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang 
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang 
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang 
Latino gang (baby) 
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang

I said it like it like that
Como Celia Cruz tengo el azúcar (azúca') 
Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka (ah) 
Te vamos tumbar la peluca 
Y arranca pal' carajo, cabrón, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah (hookah, hookah) 
Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada (wouh) 
Pa-pa-pa-parazzi, like I'm Lady Gaga (wouh) 
Y no te me hagas 
Que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara 
No salgo de tu mente 
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado "Mi Gente" 

I said I like it like that 
I said I like it like that (rrr) 
I said I like it like that 
I said I like it like that, that, that, that
I said I like it like that 

I said I like it like (woo) 
I said I like it like (woo) 
I said I like it like (woo) 
I said I like it like that 

You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like that 
You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like that 
You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like that 
You gotta believe me when I tell you 
I said I like it like that
