		  Kesha's here
Let's go, baby

Ay, my girl is bangin'
She's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne poppin' entertainment

Take her to Wendy's
Can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty

But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (aye, aye, aye)

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street Steak with the Oreo Shake
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you

Bougie like Natty in the Styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin in the truck bed all the way home
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland Delight (hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh, yeah

Oh, I don't need no Bentley, to impress me
I'll ride a bull into the party like a jet ski
Boy, put that Dom down, take me to Waffle House (hey)
Give me those cheap thrills, chillin' in the Deep South

But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade

Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (that's right)
Got that Bourbon Street Steak with the Oreo Shake (hey)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too (got that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (girl, I got you)

Bougie like Natty in the Styrofoam (styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (all the way home)
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland Delight (hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like

My new, clean blue jeans, without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without the Skoal in 'em (oh, we fancy like, ooh)
Yeah, she probably gon' be keeping some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline but she don't need it (oh, we fancy like, ooh)
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine and her up-do goes down

Ay, yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (date night)
Got that Bourbon Street Steak with the Oreo Shake (hey)
Get some whipped cream on the top, too
Two straws one check, girl, I got you

Bougie like Natty in the Styrofoam (styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (all the way home)
Some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland Delight (hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like
