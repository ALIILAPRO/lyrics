		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Daffodils, then the summer comes
My distress when it comes for you
You look peaceful dancing in the sun
Love is thirsting when it's true
Daffodils, then the summer comes
My distress when it comes for you
You look peaceful dancing in the sun
Love is thirsting when it's true

I work so late i need the sunshine on me
You called my name
I won't come right back, darling
I ran, escaped and felt the deep sea save me
Don't search, don't chase
Just let the sunshine on you

Let it bathe let it stay, I
Wanna lay wanna fade out
Let it break let it play on
See it's made when the day is fading

Daffodils, then the summer comes
My distress when it comes for you
You look peaceful dancing in the sun
Love is thirsting when it's true
Daffodils, then the summer comes
My distress when it comes for you
You look peaceful dancing in the sun
Love is thirsting when it's true
