		  Yo

Ain't nothin' to it
I came from the sewers, got busy and made me change
Spray up the booth and look great when I do it
I swear they don't make 'em the same (yeah)
Bae in the coupe, twenty K in the boot
Hittin' pace like I'm takin' a chase (skrrt, skrrt)
Drive in the winter, I'm takin' the goose
In the summer, I take off the brain (woo)

She likes a man that holds it down, spend racks in Louis Vuitton
But he had chain before his first house, baby, he's doin' it wrong
I love the block, but can't wait to leave, it's deep
Miss you when I'm gone
House full of thots, new gyal every week
But I still miss you in that thong

Brothers are mad at me, I've never met 'em
So fuck 'em, it is what is it
If we're talkin' salaries, I'm out the question
I ain't tryna piss on your chips
I'm up in Canada, life is a blessin'
I might buy a crib in the Six
Blondie like Pamela, lightie like Megan
I can't decide which ones to pick (woo)
Fuck up the climate, now everyone's signin'
No less than a million quid
They see how I'm ridin', now they're tryna bite it
Stop lyin' and give me my shit (give me that)
Smoke Cali, I'm flying, I'm lit 
While I'm drivin', ain't trying still stiggin' the whip (skrrt)
Mask for the virus, bro got one for slidin'
It's all kinda similar shit
Bro pullin' over for pigs, if his phones in the whip
Then we're takin' a charge
They got the pics on the ANPR
Takin' the piss, said they're taking the car
Black out the Wraith but came with the starts
Back in the place, but I stay in the dark
Manny I lay, but I stay in the charts (woo)

Ain't nothin' to it
I came from the sewers, got busy and made me change (yeah)
Spray up the booth and look great when I do it
I swear they don't make 'em the same (no way)
Bae in the coupe, twenty K in the boot
Hittin' pace like I'm takin' a chase (skrrt, skrrt)
Drive in the winter, I'm takin' the goose
In the summer, I take off the brain (ah)

She likes a man that holds it down, spend racks in Louis Vuitton
But he had chain before his first house, baby, he's doin' it wrong
I love the block, but can't wait to leave, it's deep
Miss you when I'm gone
House full of thots, new gyal every week
But I still miss you in that thong

Hidin' my face, can't show no love
Get too many photos took
Lyin' on Aitch, but they don't know much
Man couldn't give a solo fuck
Slide to the place in a rollers truck
Bet the owner knows it's us
Now my guys in the rave full of coats and hoods
Got weed, I'ma roll some up
Look, I ain't been home in weeks
Head hot, but my heart done froze, it's peak
Did show, hit the road and skeet
Made my roses gold as the doughs increased
Sometimes wanna ghost and leave
Then I look to the shelf, all the trophy's clean
Best talk to the G.O.A.T. with ease
If them man want war, they can hold some heat
Worked too hard, man step with my chest out
Ain't nothin' stress 'bout
Made some members along the way
True say, met couple of let downs
I set the pace, don't get in my way
Gang hop out the Cullinan jet bound
Make some cake, back to the estate
Then go buy mummy a next house

Can't take your call now, just leave your message after the tone
Hi, Mr. Armstrong, just a quick call to tell you
That all of your payments have been received
And everything is being finalized
You can come and collet your keys when you're ready
Congratulations

I love the block, but can't wait to leave, it's deep
Miss you when I'm gone
House full of thots, new gyal every week
But I still miss you in that thong

Loads of great nights out, you know?
Involving sex, drugs, fuckin' you name it, what
The great thing is, I can never remember
