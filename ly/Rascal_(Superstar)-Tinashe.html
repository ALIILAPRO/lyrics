		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my bitches look like money in the bank (ah-ah)
When they see us, they got nothing left to say (ah-ah)
Out the bottle, sippin' on some Dom Perignon (ah-ah)
I look forward to the shit you'll never know

I'm a superstar, bitch (ah-ah)
I just poured a cup, bitch (ah-ah)
Flight out in the morning (ah-ah)
I'ma be exhausted (ah-ah)
You could see it when I'm breathing (ayy)
I'm a cold bitch, can't believe it (ayy)
You can see it when I'm breathing (ayy)
I'm so cold, you just can't believe it

Money, cash, clothes, fast cars
Fast lane dash, playin' with the Nascars
Money, cash, clothes, fast cars
I'm in the valet chillin' with a bad broad

Money, cash, clothes, fast cars (uh-huh, ayy, ayy)
I'm finna pass y'all, mask on, mask off (ah)
Money, cash, clothes, fast cars (fast cars)
Better ask 'em, I'm a little rascal

Ayy, you better ask 'em
You better ask somebody, ayy, uh

I can't save you if you just ain't on the wave (ah-ah)
They should pay me how they copy what I say (ah-ah)
They don't know the road that we've been on (they don't know)
Bitch, that ain't a joke, I'm a villain
I'm in first place, need a ribbon
They don't understand that I'm the shit

I'm a superstar, bitch (ah-ah)
I just poured a cup, bitch (ah-ah, I just poured a cup, bitch)
Flight out in the morning (ah-ah, flight out in the morning)
I'ma be exhausted (ah-ah, I'ma be exhausted)
You could see it when I'm breathing (ayy, when I'm breathin')
I'm a cold bitch, can't believe it (ayy, can't believe it)
You can see it when I'm breathing (ayy)
I'm so cold, you just can't believe it

Money, cash, clothes, fast cars (fast cars)
Fast lane dash, playin' with the Nascars (Nascars)
Money, cash, clothes, fast cars
I'm in the valet chillin' with a bad broad

Money, cash, clothes, fast cars (ayy, ayy)
I'm finna pass y'all, mask on, mask off (ayy)
Money, cash, clothes, fast cars
Better ask 'em, I'm a little rascal

I'm a little rascal
Get that money, hoe
Ah, ah, ah, ah
I'm finna pass y'all, mask on, mask off
Ayy, ayy
