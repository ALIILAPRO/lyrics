		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you've learned about it 
Now you'll just have to bear 
There's something it for everyone
Just pick up what you please 
'Cause you know sometimes it seems 
Things could go so much better 
And I can't help it, I'd really like to see 
The day when no one* gets jealous, greedy, cruel 
Or unhappy, bored fucked up or ruined, wimpy, 
Sad, mislead or fooled 
We've got to face it, it's 

Time to grow, time to know 
Time to see in what we believe 
As the time goes by, we'll know that it was on our side 
But come to understand (stand under?) the time 
And you'll realize it's in your mind 

One day we're all gonna laugh about it 
About how easy we are to rule 
To take our innerselves away from us 
And knock, knock, knocking it on up there 
Where we are, blinded with faith in something called "the only truth !?" 
No, I can't buy it, I mean how can I believe 
When I see people get jealous, greedy, cruel and 
Unhappy, bored, fucked up and ruined, wimpy, sad, 
Mislead and fooled 

We've got to face it
