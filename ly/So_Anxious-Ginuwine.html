		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nine o'clock (nine o'clock), home alone (home alone)
Paging you (paging you)
Wishing you'd come over, my place (my place)
After while (after while), let me know (let me know)
We can just keep talking 'bout the last time (last time)
You were here (you were here)
What we did (what we did)
(No sleep 'til morning)
Only bubble baths (bubble baths)
And back rubs (and back rubs)
Hit me back (hit me back)
Girl, I hope you hurry 'cause

I'm so anxious, so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way you're talkin' dirty, said, I'm
So anxious, girl, could you quit this stallin'?
You know I'm a sexaholic, said, I'm
So anxious, so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way you're talkin' dirty, said, I'm
So anxious, girl, could you quit this stallin'?
You know I'm a sexaholic, said, I'm

It's 10:10 (10:10)
Where you been? (Where you been?)
Did you get my message? (Did you get my message?)
(Your expression is tellin' me that you've been thinkin' the same thang)
The same thang I've been thinkin' (I've been thinkin')
You say you're workin' (say you're workin')
Well, hit me just as soon as you're shift is over (over)
And I'll be waitin' (I'll be waitin')
'Cause I can't sleep (I can't sleep)
For reminiscin'
Reminiscin' about you (about you)
And what we do (and what we do)
Hit me back (hit me back)
And I hope you hurry

So anxious, so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way you're talkin' dirty, said, I'm
So anxious, girl, could you quit this stallin'?
You know I'm a sexaholic, said, I'm
So anxious, so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way you're talkin' dirty, said, I'm
So anxious, girl, could you quit this stallin'?

Said as soon as you hit the door
I'ma pull you down on the floor
And before we get to touch the bed
Baby, back up every word you said
And before we get to hit the lights
And before we start the candlelight
Baby girl, I want to bump and grind
This is something that is on my mind

So anxious, so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way you're talkin' dirty, said, I'm
So anxious, girl, could you quit this stallin'
You know I'm a sexaholic, said, I'm
So anxious, so meet me at eleven-thirty
I love the way you're talkin' dirty, said, I'm
So anxious
