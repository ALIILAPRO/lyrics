		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  high on the smell of pouring rain 
im getting by on you but baby 
two can play that game 
why do the things that strengthen me make you weak 
why do you always give yourself away to me for free 

I left the devil on display
I let em out so I could see if you still treat me this way
why do I test you just to see if you’ll stay
why do you complicate my perfect plan to push you away

painted world in black and white and winnin or loosin 
why am I afraid of talk and matching tattoos 

Bones and baggage
shifting into automatic 

oh feigning panic 
addicted to the vain in manic 

its old and static 
i’m wearing out the too dramatic 

had a dream that I was running fast and 
gotta a lotta catching up to do 

for free (x2)
