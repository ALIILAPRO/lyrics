		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stand and look out on the dark plains
Where the moon is rising
And the hydrofoils are coming back in
From the past in silence

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end

Where the pearly gates remain open
And welcome me home
'Cause the time I came to California I died
At the hands of the ghostly queen

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end evermore

Should I ask you? (Should I ask you?)
For forgiveness? (Forgiveness?)
And open my heart?
If I say these words will you listen
Or leave me here in the dark?

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end

Where things they don't exist
And we're all in this together 'til the end
'Til the end
