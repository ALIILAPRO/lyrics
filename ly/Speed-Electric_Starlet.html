		  Speed, speedin'
Speed, speedin'

I just need to get away, its to wild in the streets of L.A,
Took to long and I couldn't wait, it's a long road when you're running
Away from home. Foot on the gas; hold it down, fuck the world, grip the wheel, on the edge,
Flip a bitch, switch gears, switch gears
Foot on the gas; hold it down, fuck the world, grip the wheel, on the edge,
Flip a bitch, switch gears, switch gears

Drive, 'til I can't see the horizon, I'm alive, drive
I'll let the wind blow in my hair, I take the high road anywhere, just
Drive 'til I can't see the horizon

I just need to get away, ain't got time, get the fuck out my way, I need
Space to accelerate , now I see an open road, I'mma charge that shit alone
Come on, let's go
I know you really needed me to stay, but it's an open road and I'm going,
I'm going gone

Foot on the gas hold it down, fuck the world, grip the wheel, on the edge,
Flip a bitch, switch gears, switch gears
Foot on the gas hold it down, fuck the world, grip the wheel, on the edge,
Flip a bitch, switch the gears, switch the gears

Drive, 'til I can't see the horizon, I'm alive, drive
I'll let the wind blow in my hair, I take the high road anywhere, just
Drive 'til I can't see the horizon

Foot on the gas hold it down, fuck the world, grip the wheel, on the edge,
Flip a bitch, switch gears, switch gears
Foot on the gas hold it down, fuck the world, grip the wheel, on the edge,
Flip a bitch, switch the gears, switch the gears

Drive, 'til i can't see the horizon, I'm alive, drive
I'll let the wind blow in my hair, I take the high road anywhere, just
Drive 'til I can't see the horizon
