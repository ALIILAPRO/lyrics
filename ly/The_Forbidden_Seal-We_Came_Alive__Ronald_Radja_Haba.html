		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The mark of the death

I sold my soul to the devil !

Death is something to believe in
Remember you are not forever

Day in day out a hundred times I let myself sink into the lowest ground
But still I am trapped inside my own sin

Let me dig my own grave,
Let the fire inside my heart
Burning like a mighty flames
Let me hold my heart
So set me free

Let me carry you home
Let me bless your freedom
Let me take you back to where it should be begin
The path that you choose
Has nowhere to go
So set me free

The path that I choose has nowhere to go
The life that I live has nothing but rough
The path that I choose has nowhere to go
So set me free

Set me free

Let me carry you home
Let me bless your freedom
Let me take you back to where it should be begin
The path that you choose
Has nowhere to go
So set me free

Life that you’ve choose has been drew in the picture of the seal, the vision that you’ve seen was the worst burden of your own sin.

Memorizing time, chasing the shadows behind the vision you’ve seen nor the souls that you’ve sold

“Memento mori “

Life that you’ve choose has been drew in the picture of the seal, the vision that you’ve seen was the worst burden of your own sin.
