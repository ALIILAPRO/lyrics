		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't play that (nah)
I fuck that bitch with a latex (huh? What?)
I did a drill with a face mask (boom)
I wash my hand with the Ajax
I don't (huh?) play that (what?)
I don't play that (nah)
I don't play that (nah, nah)
I don't, uh, play that
Hold on, hold on (huh?)

Lay down (yeah)
I like that girl from the waist down (uh, uh)
I don't think that we should waste time (nah, nah)
I heard it was good through the grapevine (yeah, yeah)
Huh? What? (What?)
I heard it was good through the grapevine (yeah, yeah)
I heard that you got a great mind (what?)
I don't think that we need to waste time (gang)
She fell in love with a shooter (boom)
I caught that girl playin' with my Glock (damn, damn)
She askin' me what is Tooka (what?)
Just know that we smoke him a lot
I take off my shirt when I'm hot (hot)
I'm quick to spray down your block (boom, boom)
Can't stop 'cause 12 too hot (nah, nah)
I'll spin back when they not (uh-huh)

I don't play that (nah)
I fuck that bitch with a latex (huh? What?)
I did a drill with a face mask (boom)
I wash my hand with the Ajax
I don't (huh?) play that (what?)
I don't play that (nah)
I don't play that (nah, nah)
I don't, uh, play that 
Hold on, hold on

She caught me fuckin' her friend (21)
I hit that bitch with the peace sign (on God)
Why you keep callin' me, twin? (Pussy)
You know that you pussy, you feline (pussy)
She fell in love with a stepper (21)
I caught her playin' with my Js (on God)
I fell in love with the gun smoke
She caught me playin' with my K (on God)
Creep up, get out (21)
I'm in your hood with my stick out (21)
You don't catch a body, you kicked out (pussy)
Swap hoes with my brothers, we switch out (pussy)
In a opp bitch mouth with my dick out (pussy)
I squeeze the Glock 'til the clip out (pussy)
I don't make diss songs, I flip out (pussy)
Whenever we see him, it's a blick out (21)

I don't play that (pussy)
I fuck that bitch with a latex (on God)
I did a drill with a face mask (on God, boom)
I wash my hand with the Ajax (21)
I don't play that (straight up)
I don't play that (straight up)
I don't play that (on God)
I don't, uh, play that (on God)
Hold on, hold on

Fast car, uh
Jaguar, uh
NASCAR, uh
AP off, uh
