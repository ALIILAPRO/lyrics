		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking

Tell me what's going on
Can you take me there
Before the morning comes?
Can you make me care?
Tell me what's going on
Help me fade into flashing lights
Yeah, I've been working overtime

'Cause all my friends, they know
Been making messes out of silence
If we're the same, let me let go
Somebody save me from the madness

All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear

Come watch us rise again
Out of the fever
Life will never be the same
I'm a believer
Don't call us another name
We were born to the same sunrise
It's getting brighter all the time

'Cause all my friends, they know
Been making messes out of silence
If we're the same, let me let go
Somebody save me from the madness (right)

All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh)

'Cause all my friends, they know
Been making messes out of silence
If we're the same, let me let go
Somebody save me from the madness (madness, madness)
(Mad, mad, mad)

All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking
All my friends are watching, I can hear them talking

(Right)
