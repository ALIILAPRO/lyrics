		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so again you know we're on it
Don't even bother try to tell we stop it
I'll take them straight to the hanging tree
This is the sound that makes me nasty
No body ramp with this sound quality
Believing in the rockers and the
Riddim that's in me
We come to rock your spot bring the energy

Why you wouldn't try this DJ dem supply
This everybody taste this ruff neck sound
Turn up the volume make the speakers dem blow
Life on track not turning back
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
The volume the volume the volume the volume
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
The volume the volume the volume the volume

So me say broke up broke
Upmake the people jump up
Queue way down the road and
Make the people line up
Gal ah wine up to the metal
Do the dirty wine slut
And the dance nah done until
The speaker dem fucked

Why you would try this DJ dem supply
This everybody taste this ruff neck sound
Do not touch it do not touch
It do not touch the dial
Turn up the volume make the speakers dem blow
Life on track not turning back
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
The volume the volume the volume the volume
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
The volume the volume the volume the volume

Keep it down keep it down keep it down
Keep it down keep it down shh no
Play your music every day
Woop gotta keep it loud now
Play your sound and feel no way
Woop woop gotta keep it loud now
Play your music every day
Woop gotta keep it loud now
Play your sound and feel no way
Woop woop gotta keep it loud now
I can't keep it down I can't keep it down
I can't keep it down I can't keep it down

Life on track not turning back
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
And never let it go grow
Life on track not turning back
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
The volume the volume the volume the volume
Keep turning it up the volume the volume
The volume the volume the volume the volume
