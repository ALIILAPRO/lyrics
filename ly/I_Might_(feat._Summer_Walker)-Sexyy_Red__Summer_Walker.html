		  Sexyy
(I might)

He like, "Sexyy, where you at? Come and put it on me"
I know I got the wettest coochie, my shit's macaroni
C-Call him when I'm bored 'cause a bad bitch get lonely
I need a nigga that keep it real 'cause my last nigga was phony (Loser)
That's my lil' partner, yeah, that's my lil' boo (gang, gang)
We be boolin', we be jammin', me and him, we hella cool (on God)
You got a bitch, I got a nigga, but, we gon' stick to the rules
And, don't ever think shit sweet, 'cause my nigga keep that tool

But I might call that phone when my nigga actin' up
I might send you the location and let you pull up
I might, you just better not tell my baby daddy
I might, 'cause he gon' leave you leakin' in a alley

I might hit you with that, "Where you at?"
I might kiss it in a Cadillac
I might, might just keep you comin' every weekend
Might just get you geekin', I
Hit you with that, "You up?" text
I might give you, like, the greatest sex (what's up?)
I might just keep you comin' every weekend
I pull up when you need it (Sexyy)
I might

I ain't never felt like this before
He do whatever I want, he got me real spoiled (that's my nigga)
Fresh out the shower, rub my body down with oil
After we fuck, I always tell him, "Give me more" (yeah, yeah)
Lingerie got me lookin' cute, come and take these panties off (ugh, ugh)
Chanel perfume, and you know I got my wig done (Sexyy)
I don't give a fuck what time it is, nigga, pick up that phone
Put a hit on him, now, the nigga swear I did him wrong

But, I might call that phone when my nigga actin' up
I might send you the location and let you pull up
I might, you just better not tell my baby daddy
I might, 'cause he gon' leave you leakin' in a alley

I might hit you with that, "Where you at?"
I might kiss it in a Cadillac
I might, might just keep you comin' every weekend (oh)
Might just get you geekin', I
Hit you with that, "You up?" text
I might give you, like, the greatest sex
I might, might just keep it comin' every weekend
I pull up when you need it
I might

I might cuss you out, sayin' things I don't mean
Then turn around and come and put it on me
Then hit your phone when I know you're lonely (oh, give me whatever you need)
What you creepin' for? Baby, I'ma keep you fed
I'ma make your necklace into my legs
You know what it's givin', what it's givin' when the mood right
But, maybe on the late night

I might hit you with that, "Where you at?"
I might kiss it in a Cadillac
I might, might just keep you comin' every weekend (oh)
Might just get you geekin', I
Hit you with that, "You up?" text
I might give you, like, the greatest sex
I might, might just keep it comin' every weekend
I pull up when you need it
I might

But I might call that phone when my nigga actin' up
I might send you the location and let you pull up
I might, you just better not tell my baby daddy
I might, 'cause he gon' leave you leakin' in a alley (Sexyy)
