		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes of brown
Beautiful and she's so warm to just be around
My heart, it pounds
That she is more than a pretty face lost in the crowd

Won't you lie next to me, oh Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, oh Kayla?
Okay

Rose like cheeks
You'll tell me I'm wrong and that's just because you don't like what you see
Just know I do and
All of the time, you're on my mind making me blind

Won't you lie next to me, oh Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh Kayla?
Won't you lie next to me, oh Kayla?
Won't you lie, oh, next to me, okay love
Okay
Okay love, okay
