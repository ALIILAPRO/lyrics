		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've walked down every street
Dragged both feet
ccross most all the land
Bathed on every beach
So I know each grain of sand
But the one thing that I love
c velvet sky above an angry sea
When the raven flies no more
cnd you're headed toward the shore
To follow me
Please don't tell em
Where that I went free
I drink wine from a bottle each day
Prayin I won't end up
Just like the one who ran away
If in fear is where I'm livin
For the most
From the valley to the coast
cway from all this wretched sin
Just remember
That the one thing that I love
Velvet skies above an angry sea
Where a sail
Finds a friend in the wind
cnd all your thoughts begin
With the raising tide
Pay me no mind
cnd please don't tell em
Where that I went free
