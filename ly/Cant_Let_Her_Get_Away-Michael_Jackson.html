		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I breakdown when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie?
Ah, is it just a lie?

I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this thing come true
Ah, make a dream come true

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying every day
Knowing the girl that got away

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away (no)

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I tried to mastermind it
By saying let it be
But every time I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye
Still you said goodbye

If I let her get away
Then the world'll have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who set you free

I can't let
I can't let her get away
I can't let
I can't let her get away

I can't let
I can't let her get away (no)
I can't let
I can't let her get away, woo

Woo

I got the feeling, that trouble's gotta stop
I got the feeling, she's never gonna drop
I got the feeling, she's never gonna stop
I got the feeling that she's never gonna go
I got the feeling, that she's gonna like it
I got the feeling but she's never gonna take a break
I got the feeling, huh, that she won't fight it
I got the feeling, that's she's never gonna let go

Can't let go (oh)
I gotta get her, oh
I gotta get her 'cause you're never gonna let me go
Can't let go
Gotta see her, how you gonna stop me?
I got a feeling that your never gonna leave
I got a feeling that she's gonna hurt me
I got a feeling that your never gonna wanna leave

I can't let
I can't let her get away (no, no)
I can't let (she won't)
I can't let her get away (she won't, she, she won't do it)

I can't let
I can't let her get away (I won't do it)
I can't let (no, no)
I can't let her get away (no, no, no, no)

I can't let (get away)
I can't let
(She won't, she won't, she won't do it)
I can't let (woo, woo, woo, woo)
I can't let (no, no)
(She's never gonna, never gonna, man, I tell you)

I can't let (she won't, wanna)
I can't let her get away (oh no)
I can't let (she won't)
I can't let her get away (oh my)

I can't let (oh no)
I can't let her get away (she won't, she won't)
I can't let (she won't, she won't)
I can't let her get away (she won't, she won't)

I can't let (oh, oh I'm never gonna, be with me)
(I'm never gonna, on with Riley, try to step to me)
I'm never gonna, never gonna stop (I can't let)
I'm never gonna stop it, no, no
Gonna stop, thought you gonna stop me (I can't let)
I'm never gonna stop, don't ever try to knock me (I can't let her get away)
I'm never gonna, uh, she gonna l- (I can't let)
I'm never gonna stop, ah, ah, I'm never gonna be (I can't let her get away)
Gonna be
