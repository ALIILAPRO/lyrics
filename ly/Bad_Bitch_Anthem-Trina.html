		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  L-l-l-live from the 305, bitch it's lookin' [?]
I'm that bitch and he know, just keep it on the D-low!
A bunch of bad bitches, yeah, ridin' through the city
Big asses and nice titties, this shit ain't for TV!
I'm the muthafuckin' baddest, thoroughbred and savage
They know I be killin' 'em, cold-case casket
This my cashier, so you know I'm in my bag, bitch
Chante, you slay, I be the one to drag shit
Boss bitch, I ain't never hard to find
I pop out when I feel like it and kill it every time
Shit, I'm doin' fine and you bitches should get in line
I'm the one they really watchin', you bitches is out of time
Saw a bitch that owe me money, and I put that on my moms
Put a clip to that bitch head 'cause she was out of mind
Nothin' but big bills, look around me, I'm paid
305, muhfucka, from the county of Dade!

This a bad bitch anthem, get your fuckin' hands up
Get your hands up, get your fuckin' hands up

B-b-b-b-bad bitch, a couple grand in the duffel
Good pussy costs, bitch, you hoes ain't got no hustle!
I raise the bar, and you bitches ain't got no muscle
I let you hoes rock, but now you hoes are trouble
I mean, your nigga sexy, he be blowin' up my messages
I told him not to text me but he bought me VVS's
I am the Diamond Princess so I'm lovin' every second
Baptize him in my pussy, he said I'm such a blessin'
I'm the shit and I'm that bitch without a muthafuckin' doubt
Tryin' to come up off my name, you gets no muthafuckin' clout
I could even make it rain or cause a muthafuckin' drought
Cut the check and show respect and keep my name from out ya mouth, bitch!

Bad bitch anthem, get your fuckin' hands up
Get your hands up, get your fuckin' hands up
Bad bitch anthem, get your fuckin' hands up
Get your hands up, get your fuckin' hands up
Bad bitch anthem, get your fuckin' hands up
Get your fuckin' hands up, g-g-get your hands up!
