		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get yourself together
Let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath
Pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?

Down is the new up
Is the new up

Won't you be my girl?
Won't you be my girl?

Your services
Are not required
Your future's bleak
You're so last week

Ladies and gentlemen
Without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate
I shall now contort

Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?

Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Is the new up

You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us

All on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town

Shake your pockets out
Pass it on
Pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
