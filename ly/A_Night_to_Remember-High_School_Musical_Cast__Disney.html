		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess now it's official
Can't back out, can't back out (no)
Getting ready for the night of nights
The night of nights, alright
Don't panic (panic)

Now do we have to dress up for the prom?
Dude I don't think we have the choice
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Gotta look just right
Dressing to impress the boys

Do I want classic or vintage or plaid?
Where's the mirror?
I think this tux is too baggy
Too tight, it makes me look weird

Should I go movie star glamorous, sassy, or sweet?
Don't know, but no one better wear the same dress as me
It's the night of our nightmares
It's the night of our dreams
It's too late to back out of it
Hey, makeovers, massages
Don't know what a corsage is
Been waiting all our lives for this

It's gonna be a night (can't wait)
To remember (aww man)
Come on now, big fun (alright)
It's gonna be the night (I guess)
To last forever (lucky us)
We'll never ever ever forget

Gettin' ready, get getting ready
Gettin' ready, get getting ready
(Hey you been in there an hour man)
So what should I do with my hair?
Where's my shaver?
Ooh, I love it
I look like a waiter
Should I fluff it?
It's getting later, already should be there

Her mother opens the door, I'm shakin' inside
He's here, it's time, the hour's arrived 
Don't know why, her father's staring me down
Where's my purse? Lip gloss?
Now I'm really freaking out
Then something changes my world
The most beautiful girl right in front of my eyes

It's gonna be a night (oh yeah)
To remember (that's for sure)
Come on now, big fun (alright)
It's gonna be the night (yeah tonight)
To last forever (forever more)
We'll never ever ever forget

Who's that girl? (she's so fine)
Who's that guy? (I don't recognize)
Who's that girl? (she looks so good, yeah)
You'll never really notice, but you probably should

Big fun, on the night of nights (alright)
The night of nights, tonight
Let's dance
On the night of nights
You know we're gonna do it right

It's gonna be a night to remember
It's gonna be the night to last forever
It's gonna be a night to remember
It's gonna be the night to last forever
It's gonna be our night (you know it)
To remember (all time)
Come on now, big fun (big fun)
It's gonna be the night (love it)
To last forever (the rest of our lives)
We'll never ever ever forget

It's gonna be our night (oh yeah)
All together (say it loud)
Come on now, everyone (that's right)
It's gonna be a night (yeah tonight)
To remember (hear the crowd)
And never ever ever never ever ever never ever ever never ever ever forget!
