		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the black and inside the blue
A bone thick spell has washed away
It took some time but I realized
The obstacle is the only way
Under the black and inside the blue
A bone thick spell has washed away
It took some time but I realized
The obstacle is the only way

(The guinea pigs of a generation)
An experiment to be improved on
(A story for them all to tell)
A history of forced intrusion

They pricked me but I didn't bleed
They singed me just to test the smell
They cut me but I didn't feel
I was just too deep in to fail

You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress
You got it all figured out
Until you're under the skin

(The guinea pigs of a generation)
But now I'm in the lion's den
(A story for them all to tell)
Now I am at the precipice

I'm the one who has to end this
I'm the one that has to win
Bred to self-induced entrapment
I'm the one who lacked the discipline

You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress
You got it all figured out
Until you're under the skin

You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress
You got it all figured out
Until you're under the skin

Underneath retread aesthetic
Underneath your fake respect
Underneath the sales and figures
Will you quit when they don't react?
Underneath the costume changes
Underneath the acceptance
Underneath the online presence
Underneath the influence

(Underneath duress)
(Under the skin)
(Underneath duress)
(Under the skin)
(Underneath duress)
(Under the skin)
(Underneath duress)
(Under the skin)

(Under the wave you've been waiting for)
(There's a truth)
(You got it all figured out)
(Until you're drowning)

You think you know what you want
Until you're inside the nest
You got it all figured out
Until you're drowning in it
You think you know who you are
Until you're under duress
You got it all figured out
Until you're under the skin

You think you know what you want (underneath retread aesthetic)
Until you're inside the nest (underneath your fake respect)
You got it all figured out (underneath the sales and figures)
Until you're drowning in it (will you quit when they don't react)
You think you know who you are (underneath the virtue signal)
Until you're under duress (underneath the thinnest skin)
You got it all figured out (underneath collective conscience)
Until you're under the skin (underneath the consequence)

(Under the wave you've been waiting for)
(There's a truth)
(You got it all figured out)
(Until you're drowning in it)

(Under the wave you've been waiting for)
(There's a truth)
(You got it all figured out)
(Until you're drowning in it)
