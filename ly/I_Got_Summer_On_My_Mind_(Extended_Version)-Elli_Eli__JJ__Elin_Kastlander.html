		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)
(I-I-I)
(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)
(I-I, I-I)
(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)
(I-I, I-I)
(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)

I got summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it

Still they wanna be with me
Still they wanna live with me
Still they wanna feel like me
Still I can't believe it's me

Time you spend on me I spend mine on being free
On a flight to NYC, I see you when you see me

I wonder why?
Why you have to lie?
When you've seen me cry
When you've seen me shy
When you've seen me high
When you will see me die

Where we from, you don't know
You will know where we will go
Yeah I'm here, where are you?
There's nothing we can't do
We up in here with one thing on our mind, let's leave with something
Then we play "Still D.R.E" my way, all day
In Beats by Dre then we go and get buzzed
Get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up (fucked up)

I am S-Y, no lie, at least you get to witness
Kill so many songs, you'd think I have a hitlist
That's Drake, well we love young money business
'Cause we're young and we get money

(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)
(I-I-I)
(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)
(I-I, I-I)
(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)
(I-I, I-I)
(I, I, I-I-I-I-I-I)

I got summer on my mind
Nowhere else though
Lord take me downtown or to you
People show me love but I can't take it
What I said was true real pain, can't fake it
