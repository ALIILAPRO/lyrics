		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands on the wheel
All is straight ahead
Left behind
Second guessing all that I once said
I once said
I once said

My spirit is bent and there's blood on my hands
The more I'm down, the less I understand
Once so found, now so lost
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross

All is black and white
Wouldn't change even if I could
I'll take what I'm handed
Whether it's damned or if it's good
If it's good
If it's good

My spirit is bent and there's blood on my hands
The more I'm down, the less I understand
Once so found, now so lost
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross

My spirit is bent and there's blood on my hands
The more I'm down, the less I understand
Once so found, now so lost
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross
I ask no questions, it's just one more bridge to cross
