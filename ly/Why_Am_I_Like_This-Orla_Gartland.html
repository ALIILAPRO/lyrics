		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I smoked a cigarette
My dad would have been so upset
Then we got tattoos by the coast
And I just stood there like a ghost

Maybe I'm an old soul trapped in a young body
Maybe you don't really want me there at your birthday party
I'll be there in the corner thinking right over
Every single word of the conversation we just had

So, why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?

I saw a girl crying on the train
Gin and tonic from a can to ease the pain
And I never asked if she was okay
She just got up and walked away

Oh, it's like I'm looking down from the ceiling above
Never in the moment, never giving enough
Let's go out and shout the words we never said
I've got my mistakes on loop inside my head, inside my head

So, why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I

Why am I like this?

(Maybe I'm an old soul trapped in a young body)
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this? (maybe you don't really want me there)
Why am I 

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this? (Maybe I'm an old soul trapped in a young body)
Why am I 

Why am I like this?
Why am I like this?
Why am I like this? (maybe you don't really want me there)
Why am I 

Why am I like this?

Maybe I'm an old soul trapped in a young body
Maybe you don't really want me there at your birthday party
I'll be there in the corner thinking right over
Every single word of the conversation we just had
