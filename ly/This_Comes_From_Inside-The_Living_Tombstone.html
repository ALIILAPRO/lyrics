		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How we could have known
That we're stuck in a system?
There was a pre-existing dictum, programmed to do nothing else

Why feel so alone
When we share so much wisdom?
But you set fire to the kingdom, burn it all until it melts
Or else

Now this comes from inside, how long do we have to try?
Now this comes from inside, and stays there until you die
Now this comes from inside, how long do we have to try?
Now this comes from inside, and stays there until you die

Long time ago, it was all for a show
Fill our wounds with a pound of salt
And your reason to justify scars
You can't quantify, lock us inside a vault
Now this is your fault

Everything is a problem
There was a poison in the air, despair is an eternal blight
You're losing it all
You've been blinded by stardom
You think that you're alone, but we are waiting for you every night
You're mine

Now this comes from inside, how long do we have to try?
Now this comes from inside, and stays there until you die
Now this comes from inside, what you have, I want it, it's mine
Now this comes from inside, and stays there until you die
