		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl if I was broke
Would you still love me
If I was down out
Would you still trust me
Girl if I was broke
Would you still love me
If I was down out
Would you still trust me

My skin is as black as God
Made all in her image
Eve than bit the Macintosh
I'm praying for forgiveness
I don't have no idols
My uncle still be crippin
My brother only dress in red and black
Like Scottie Pippen
Let me finish
I was on my way to get this chicken
Smoke pour out the window
Like I'm cooking in the kitchen
Homie push that fentanyl
Hope he don't catch a sentence
Now I'm stacking commas
For all them empty dishes
Surrounded by Obamas
That's business man with vision
My homie got his daughter out the trenches
Who you kidding
Call that excellence
I'm just smoking za that be my preference
We heaven sent
She trying but can't get me out my element

Girl if I was broke
Would you still love me
If I was down out
Would you still trust me
Girl if I was broke
Would you still love me
