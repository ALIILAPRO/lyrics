		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Rakim, what's up?
Yo, I'm doing the knowledge, E., I'm tryna get paid in full
Well, check this out, since Nobry Walters is our agency, right?
True
Cara Lewis is our agent
Word up
Zakia and 4th and Broadway is our record company
Indeed
Okay, so who we rollin' with?
We rollin' with Rush
Of Rushtown Management 
So check this out
Since we talking over this def beat right here that I put together
I wanna hear some of them def rhymes
You know what I'm sayin'? 
And together, we can get paid in full

Thinkin' of a master plan
'Cause ain't nothin' but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
So I dig deeper but still comin' up with lint
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Thinkin' "How could I get some dead presidents?"
I need money, I used to be a stick-up kid
So I think of all the devious things I did
I used to roll up, "This is a hold up, ain't nothin' funny
Stop smilin', be still, don't nothin' move but the money"
But now I learned to earn 'cause I'm righteous
I feel great, so maybe I might just
Search for a 9 to 5, if I strive
Then maybe I'll stay alive
So I walk up the street whistlin' this
Feelin' out of place 'cause, man, do I miss
A pen and a paper, a stereo, a tape of
Me and Eric B, and a nice big plate of
Fish, which is my favorite dish
But without no money, it's still a wish
'Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I dig into the books of the rhymes that I made
So now's a test to see if I got pull
Hit the studio, 'cause I'm paid in full

Rakim, check this out, yo
You go to your girl house and I'll go to mine
'Cause my girl is definitely mad
'Cause it took us too long to do this album
Yo, I hear what you sayin'
So let's just pump the music up
And count our money
Yo, well check this out, yo Eli
Turn the bass down
And just let the beat keep on rockin'
And we outta here
Yo, what happened to peace?
Peace, peace, peace
