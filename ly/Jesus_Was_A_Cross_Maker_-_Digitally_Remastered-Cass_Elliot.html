		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One time I trusted a stranger
'Cause I heard his sweet song
And it was gently enticin' me
Though there was, there was somethin' wrong
But when I turned, he was gone

Blindin' me, his song remains remindin' me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flyin' low for me

He wages war with the devil
A pistol by his side
And though he chases him out windows
And won't give him a, won't give him a place to hide
He keeps his door open wide

Fightin' him he lights a lamp invitin' him
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flyin' low for me

I heard the thunder come rumblin'
The night never looked so dim
I see the junction get nearer
And danger is, is in the wind
And either road's lookin' grim

Hidin' me, I flee, desire dividin' me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Yeah, Jesus was a cross maker

Sweet silver angels over the sea
Please come down flyin' low for me

One time I trusted a stranger
'Cause I heard his sweet song
And it was gently enticin' me
Though there was somethin' wrong
When I turned, he was gone

Blindin' me, his song remains remindin' me
He's a bandit and a heart breaker
Oh, but Jesus was a cross maker
Oh, Jesus was a cross maker
