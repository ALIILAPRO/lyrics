		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you see?
If I escape will I be saved?
Can't estimate when you'll fade
Tell me I can't wait
I'm learning fast, I can't turn back
I died a million times when you left
When you said goodbye
 
What do you see?
Can you speak, will I be saved?
My hearts on ice, can't think twice
Tell me, why, oh, why?
I'm falling fast, stuck in the past
I try and understand, it hurts so bad
How long will it last?
 
I'm flying through the storms
The answer's in the sky
That everything I am is because of you (oh)
But I know I won't die
I'll live without your love
I take back every word
Every woman's tears
 
What do you feel?
Say it loud, speak into my soul
A winter's day never fades
That's what I was told
I lost myself without your help
I fell straight back to hell or is it heaven?
Maybe, I don't know
 
I'm flying through the storms
The answer's in the sky
That everything I am is because of you (oh)
But I know I won't die
I'll live without your love
I take back every word
Every woman's tears
 
I'm flying through the storms
The answer's in the sky
That everything I am is because of you (oh)
But I know I won't die
I'll live without your love
I take back every word
Every woman's tears
 
I'm flying through the storms
The answer's in the sky
That everything I am is because of you (oh)
But I know I won't die
I'll live without your love
I take back every word
Every woman's tears
 
I'm flying through the storms
The answer's in the sky
That everything I am is because of you (oh)
But I know I won't die
I'll live without your love
I take back every word
Every woman's tears
