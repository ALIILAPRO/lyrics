		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know we're not listenin' too well

Woo
Hey, yeah

You used to tell me not to dream away
Go chase the safety not the rush
You say this future is a world away
I think you worry way too much

Whoa, level up
Light glows from my soul and my skeleton
Better work, better play, find some better love
Gotta dive headfirst, can't be scared of love
You shine, you a diamond when pressure come
Yeah, we ain't sweatin' none
We the one proposin' the toast all in the restaurant
When you make it this far, is it ever done?
Good news, the best is yet to come

Big dreams and bright lights
Long days and fast nights
Chasing what I like
Here's to the good life

Baby, have no fear
Now the moment's here
Let's enjoy this crazy ride

Just like before
My spirit coming up
What do you talk for?
You'll never make us stop
Beyond the shore (beyond the shore)
We'll take it to the top
No fear no more
No fear no more

Take it to the top
We'll take it to the top
We'll take it to the top
This one's for me and you

I rise, you rise, we rise together
I fly, you fly, we fly forever
This time we'll win like we knew we would
This one's for me and you

Just like before
My spirit coming up
What do you talk for?
You'll never make us stop
Beyond the shore (beyond the shore)
We'll take it to the top
No fear no more
No fear no more

Just like before
My spirit coming up
What do you talk for?
You'll never make us stop
Beyond the shore
We'll take it to the top
No fear no more
