		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day (dance with me)

Got time, but I don't mind
Just wanna rock you, girl
I'll have whatever you have
Come on let's give it a whirl

See, I've been watchin' you
And I like the way you move
So go 'head, girl, just do it
That ass shakin' thing you do

So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all could meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day (dance with me)

I don't mean no harm
Just wanna rock you, girl
You could move, but be calm
Let's go, let's give it a whirl

See, it appears to me
You like the way I move
I tell you what I'm gon' do
Pull you close and share my groove

So you grab your girls and you grab a couple more
And you all could meet me in the middle of the floor
Said the air is thick, it's smellin' right
So you pass to the left, then you sail to the right

Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day (dance with me)

(Talk to me, boy) no disrespect, I don't mean no harm
(Talk to me, boy) but I can't wait to have you in my arms
(Talk to me, boy) hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long
(Talk to me, boy) bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

So what did you come here for? (I came to dance with you)
When you know that you don't wanna hit the floor (get some romance with you)
Been searchin' for love forevermore (I'll take a chance)
If love is here on the floor, girl

Hey
Dance with me
Yeah
Come on, baby

Don't be so quick to walk away (dance with me)
I wanna rock your body, please stay (dance with me)
You don't have to admit you wanna play (dance with me)
Just let me rock you 'til the break of day (dance with me)

(Talk to me, boy) no disrespect, I don't mean no harm
(Talk to me, boy) I can't wait to have you in my arms
(Talk to me, boy) hurry up 'cause you're takin' too long
(Talk to me, boy) bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song

Don't be so quick to walk away (I was just thinkin' of you)
Don't be so quick to walk away (we could do somethin')
Don't be so quick to walk away (I like the way you look right now)
Don't be so quick to walk away (come over here, baby)

Are you feelin' me?
Let's do somethin'
Let's make a bet
'Cause I-I bet I'll have you naked by the end of this song
