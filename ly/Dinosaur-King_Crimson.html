		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long ago and far away in a different age
When I was a dumb young guy, I
Fossilized photos of my life then
Illustrate what an easy prey I must have been

Standing in the sun, idiot savant
Something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones

Ignorance has always been something I excel in
Followed by naivete and pride
Doesn't take a scientist to see how
Any clever predator could have a piece of me

Standing in the sun, idiot savant
Something like a monument
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur

Ooh, when I look back on the past
It's a wonder I'm not yet extinct
All the mistakes and bad judgments I made
Nearly pushed me to the brink

It doesn't pay to be too nice
It's the one thing I have learned
Still, I made my fossil bed
Now I toss and turn

I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur

I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
I'm a dinosaur
Somebody is digging my bones
