		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You're not the one I want in my bed)
(But I'm gonna be the song stuck in your head)
(Stuck in your head)

Guess what?
For the record you're the broken one
Tried to sing along but we got stuck
So we turned it over and over again
But now, now, now
A thousand scratches on the song we had
A million cuts finally wore it down
Couldn't turn it over and over again
Turn it over and over again

This'll be the last time that I spin our life
Never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
I'm not the song you want in your head
This will be the last time that I'll spend all life
Never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
But I'm gonna be the song stuck in your head
Stuck in your head

Guess what?
Didn't wanna have to write these words
Now you're on the other side, reversed
Never turning over and over again
So now (now, now)
I'll turn it off 'cause it's so damn loud (so damn loud)
All your lies, how they've wore me down (wore me down)
You can skip the track 'cause I'm not coming back

This'll be the last time that I spin our life
Never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
I'm not the song you want in your head
This'll be the last time that I spin our life
Never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
But I'm gonna be the song stuck in your head

You make me sick
Round and round again
So I'm turning you out
And I'm trading you in
Sick, so sick again
Now I'm turning you out
And I'm trading you in

This'll be the last time that I spin our life
Never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
I'm not the song you want in your head
This'll be the last time that I spin our life
Never gonna play again
You're not the one I want in my bed
But I'm gonna be the song stuck in your head
Round and round again
Now I'm turning you off and trading you in
Stuck in your head
Round and round again
Now I'm turning you off and trading you in

This'll be the last time that I spin our life
Never gonna play again (never gonna play again)
You're not the one I want in my bed
But I'm gonna be the song stuck in your head
