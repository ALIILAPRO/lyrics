		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the leaves are brown (All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray (And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk (I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day (On a winter's day)
I'd be safe and warm (I'd be safe and warm)
If I was in L.A. (If I was in L.A.)

California dreaming 
(California dreaming)
On such a winter's day 

Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees 
(Got down on my knees)
And I pretend'd to pray 
(I pretend'd to pray)
You know the preacher likes the cold 
(Preacher likes the cold)
He knows I'm gonna stay 
(Knows I'm gonna stay)

California dreaming 
(California dreaming)
On such a winter's day 

All the leaves are brown 
(All the leaves are brown)
And the sky is gray 
(And the sky is gray)
I've been for a walk 
(I've been for a walk)
On a winter's day 
(On a winter's day)
If I didn't tell her 
(If I didn't tell her)
I could leave today 
(I could leave today)

California dreaming 
(California dreaming)
On such a winter's day 
California dreaming
On such a winter's day 
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
