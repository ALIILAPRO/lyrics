		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a love, I've got a love for you
I've got a place in this old heart for you
I want to tell you that I want you
Any way I can

I want to take you in my arms, I do
I'll light a flame and let it burn for you
And if I ran then I would run to you
Every time

(By my side)
The only place
(By my side)
It's where I want to be
(By my side)
Forevermore

I want to talk, I want to talk with you
I want to tell you anything, I do
And when I go, and when I leave, it's you
On my mind

I want to vanish in the night with you
I want to take you round the town, I do
I'm gonna make some kind of life for you
Any way I can

(By my side)
It's where I want to be
(By my side)
The only place
(By my side)
Forevermore

And I will always try and move you, baby
Forevermore
(By my side)
(By my side)
Forevermore
