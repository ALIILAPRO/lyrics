		  Go, go (what's everyone sayin'?)

Ayy
'Cause we smoking ass niggas
Sippin' ass niggas
Pouring ass niggas
Tripping ass niggas
You ain't smoking, sipping or pouring my nigga
You a boring ass nigga, get the fuck up out of here

'Cause we smoking ass niggas
Sippin' ass niggas
Pouring ass niggas
Tripping ass niggas
You ain't smoking, sipping or pouring my nigga
You a boring ass nigga, get the fuck up out of here

Ayy, we the best around but save that convo for another day
I wanna raise my strap to competition, watch them run away
Skepta call me Donnie, said, "Look up though, there's another way"
"Just hit them 'em with the ball so hard they could not take no holidays"
I take no holidays, unless I'm flying to the Westside
Straight to LAX, where niggas show off, live their best life
But I ain't tryna impress no Uptown girl, just like I'm Westlife
I get no rest time, I save the sleeping for the next life
A life of Charlies, I bring the drugs right to the party
But tell nobody, I bring your bitch for calamari
She love my money
But it's not right that now, it's Octo and it's Smoke
And we'll make you take a toke

I can't go to sleep, my baby keeping me awake
Let me skeet on her back, that's the icing on the cake
Still keep a small circle, boy, I'm still stuck up in my ways
All I need is six niggas to carry me to my grave
I need six figures, man, this life ain't nothing cheap
Posting racks up on your 'Gram, but boy I spent that in a week
Never sleep, it's a party on the top floor in the suite
Caught her taking pictures, told that girl she needs to leave

'Cause we smoking ass niggas
Sippin' ass niggas
Pouring ass niggas
Tripping ass niggas
You ain't smoking, sipping or pouring my nigga
You a boring ass nigga, get the fuck up out of here
'Cause we smoking ass niggas
Sippin' ass niggas
Pouring ass niggas
Tripping ass niggas
You ain't smoking, sipping or pouring my nigga
You a boring ass nigga, get the fuck up out of here

Tell her, "ooh that's so fire" (mmm)
They caught choir (yeah)
You inspire (splash)
She excited 
She like, "Who the hell is he?" (Yeah)
Yeah, it's me (ooh)
Girl just breathe (uh huh)
Way too grease (grease)

I don't need light and I know you see me shinin'
On the Champs-Élysées say, I know you see me slidin'
Oh, you don't fuck with me? Must be too sexy for your liking
Real goon nigga, turn my pain into some diamonds
I walk into the club, if it ain't lit, then we're leaving
My niggas fresh, homie needs a wifey for the evening
Jump in the whip, press the gas and then we breezin'
Push to start, I don't need to put the keys in

'Cause we smoking ass niggas
Sippin' ass niggas
Pouring ass niggas
Tripping ass niggas
You ain't smoking, sipping or pouring my nigga
You a boring ass nigga, get the fuck up out of here
'Cause we smoking ass niggas
Sippin' ass niggas
Pouring ass niggas
Tripping ass niggas
You ain't smoking, sipping or pouring my nigga
You a boring ass nigga, get the fuck up out of here
