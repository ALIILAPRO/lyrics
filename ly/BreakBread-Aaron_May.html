		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I ever did was break bread
They say love get you killed well shit
I should prolly be dead
Still got a lot on the line i done been
In the blind i know if i'm being mislead
Right hand on your heart say you dyin
Behind me dis ain't a regular pledge
Tell me they know what it is
Thinkin they got me but that
Shit ain't sliding around me
Really gone get what you give
I ain't gone lie you believing a
Lie if you doubt me
Stand on the shit that i said
They say you really don't know who you is
'Til you get pushed to the edge

I say you can't ever know what it is
Swear for the days I ain't have nun worth it
Under my name I'ma show em it is
Take care of mine before I take care of
Myself that was part of the plot
Free if you mine if I ever do it
For anyone else I'ma charge em' a lot
No deal signed I get to the bank
Can't be behind, I came outta nothin'
I still smile when I leave the bank
Come outside it's nun but hunnids
This what I grind for what I bled for
Stay treatin' my fam just like my
Body I'm keepin 'em fed uh
Thin line between love and hate step out
It he lay in his bed

All I ever did was break bread
They say love get you killed well shit
I should prolly be dead
Still got a lot on the line I done been
In the blind I know if I'm being mislead
Right hand on your heart say you dyin'
Behind me this ain't a regular pledge
Tell me they know what it is
Thinkin' they got me but that
Shit ain't sliding around me
Really gone get what you give
I ain't gone lie you believing a
Lie if you doubt me
Stand on the shit that I said
They say you really don't know who you is
'Til you get pushed to the edge
