		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me sick
You make me turn my insides out onto the bricks
I could never train a bitch like you
Click click click click (woof)

You like my boots?
I could squash you like a little rotten fruit
On your jugular and leave a pretty bruise
Attitude and the booze won't save you

You fucking loser
Redmeat deadbeat, you fucking tumor
Can't believe I let your hands inside my bloomers
Better count your blessings I got humor
Got a knife too
I call her Tilda, bet your fucking ass that imma use her
Fucking user
Cokehead Cretin
Your life is a blooper
Splinter-looking ass born in a sewer
Suck a dick then I bite I'm a chewer
Go find another bitch to hoover
Count the days until you lose her

I'm mad
You fuck my life up then you say "my bad"
You don't know your way around a pussy call you "Chad"
Throwing temper tantrums every time I got a bag
Kinda sad
Little nads
I'm mad

You make sick
You make me turn my insides out onto the bricks
I could never train a bitch like you
Click click click click (woof)

You like my boots?
I could squash you like a little rotten fruit
On your jugular and leave a pretty bruise
Attitude and the booze won't save you

Hello waitress
I want his head for dinner
Silver plate it
Cut his tongue out first
Let's hear him go and try and say shit
I'm abrasive?
I'm a dragon
Animorph and shapeshift
Fire breathing, break shit
Brain-eating amoeba
Coming for you, I'm contagious
Ruined what was sacred
I was living good before your locusts and your plague hit
I always fucking fake it
Now you're crying and you're shaking?
I'll take your tears and bottle em and use em as a face mist
I'm beautiful

I'm mad
You fuck my life up then you say "my bad"
You don't know your way around a pussy call you "Chad"
Throwing temper tantrums every time I got a bag
Kinda sad
Little nads
I'm mad

You make sick
You make me turn my insides out onto the bricks
I could never train a bitch like you
Click click click click (woof)
