		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of the roads led me to you
Stars on the ceiling in my living room
You're in a white dress bumming a cigarette
That memory's blue

All of these moments laying in ruins
So beautifully broken
Tear out the pages, nothing is wasted
And I wouldn't change it

You make everything bloom
Bloom
Burn my black-and-white world down to the ground
You make everything bloom

We were falling in love, that's so naive
My name on your necklace and your heart on my sleeve
Riding the carousel, caring 'bout nothing else
That memory's green

All of these moments laying in ruins
So beautifully broken
Tear out the pages, nothing is wasted
And I wouldn't change it

You make everything bloom
Bloom
Burn my black-and-white world down to the ground
You make everything bloom

When memories start bleeding and words lose their meaning
You give me a reason
The sweetest reminder, the fuse to my fire
You're all I desire

You make everything bloom
Bloom
Burn my black-and-white world down to the ground
You make everything bloom

Burn my black-and-white world down to the ground
You make everything bloom
