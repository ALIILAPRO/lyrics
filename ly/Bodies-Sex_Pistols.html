		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was a case of insanity
Her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree

She was a no-one who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace

Body, I'm not an animal
Body, I'm not an animal

Dragged on a table in a factory
Illegitimate place to be
In a packet in a lavatory
Die little baby, screaming

Body, screaming fucking bloody mess
Not an animal, it's an abortion

Body, I'm not an animal
Mummy, I'm not an abortion

Throbbing squirm
Gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge
I'm not a loss in protein
I'm not a throbbing squirm

Ah
Fuck this and fuck that
Fuck it all and fuck the fucking brat
She don't want a baby who looks like that
I don't want a baby that looks like that

Body, I'm not an animal
Body, an abortion

Body, I'm not an animal
Body, I'm not an animal
An animal
I'm not an animal
I'm not an animal, an animal, an
I'm not a body
I'm not an animal, an animal
I'm not an animal
Mummy 
Ugh
