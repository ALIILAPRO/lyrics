		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up
Up and up

Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick on your orange field
Up and up
Up and up

See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood
It's in your blood

Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up
Up and up, it's saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Whoa
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up 
Up and up

How come people suffer, how come people part?
How come people struggle
How come people break your heart?
Break your heart, oh

Yes I wanna grow, yes I wanna feel
Yes I wanna know
Show me how to heal it up
Heal it up

Oh, see the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Whoa
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind and take a risk
You can say "It's mine" and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Whoa
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

We're gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Whoa
We're gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up and up and up

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
When you're in pain
When you think you've had enough
Don't ever give up
Don't ever give up
