		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

God's in a coma
Put faith in a life support
Running away won't feel the same
If you reach your metaphysical last resort
Oh, malevolence and purgatory give you pause
It's a miracle you haven't broken any laws
We are not entitled to surviving
So keep your friends and your enemies thriving

(Good for you) What a clich√©
(Just not true) What a giveaway
(What comes now?) Can't be the last one
Falling down

Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you got to see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves there can't be hell if there's no heaven

Once again we got suffocated
In a sick perversion of a spider's web
Crawling over all the spent digested pieces
Celebrate the dead
Here come all the judging eyes
Got to pave the road with your best intentions
I only wish you can picture a future
That doesn't resemble your crazy inventions

(Good on you!) I don't mean it
(Dream come true) I don't need it
(What comes now?) another hollow one
Must come down

Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you got to see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

A mirror only works if you open your eyes
Even then you have to understand what's inside
The easy part is always hardest to see
I know you'll never guess, but darling
You're so critical
Darling, you're so critical
Oh, you're so critical

Oh, this is a cave-in
The weight of the catalyst
Just wait, let the games begin
Going to tell you all about it for the savages

(Good for you) not another one
(Just not true) not another one
(What comes now?) this world is
Falling down

Every time this happens
I'm breaking a promise
I made to a version of me
Why can't I covet
And keep it away
From the leeches who want to deceive?

What is coming has begun
It's something that you got to see
We lie and say that it's too late for some redemption
What is coming has begun
An ending I won't live to see
We tell ourselves it can't be hell if there's no heaven

It's begun

Oh, you're so critical
Yeah
Oh, you're so critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
Critical
