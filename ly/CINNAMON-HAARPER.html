		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Armored tank to the bank, no usher
Uppin my ranks reinforced for the clutter
Nonsense noise all they do is go stutter
Make her drop blouse
Make her heart go flutter
More money, more problems no problem for me
I do this for my kin do it for my family
Get the Benjamins in
You don't want no static go and be frank
This could end up tragic

Black strap, back pack
With a couple grenades
Throw that safety out the window
Sayonara to ya face succubus on my tip
Diligent with the pace
She chokin like it's cinnamon
I'ma sin until I can't

Burn em like sage burn em like mage
Bringing my rage put em in a new age
Bringin new plague defiler gon aid
You boutta get played while I fuck yo dame
She tradin yo chamomile for some kool-aid

My ammo field got me rubies and diamonds
Gon pop a bullet like hymen
Right through ya cranium

Ridin the beamer i seen ya
I tore ya team up like Cena
They couldn't see me like Sia
Charge up my soul with that kiai
I'm goin grizzly
I'm busy makin yo number thin lizzy
They cannot hit me I'm Lee
Boutta drop weights off my fate

Black strap, back pack
With a couple grenades
Throw that safety out the window
Sayonara to ya face succubus on my tip
Diligent with the pace
She chokin like it's cinnamon
I'ma sin until I can't
