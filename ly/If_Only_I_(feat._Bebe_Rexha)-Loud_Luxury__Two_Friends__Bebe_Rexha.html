		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see the sunset
In your eyes, in your eyes
And we ain't even done yet
Don't wanna go home yet
I spent the whole day with you
And we ain't even done yet (oh)

Don't you hate goodbyes?
Rather say "Good morning" than "Goodnight"
No, I can't even pretend
No matter how I try
My body wants you, no, it cannot lie
I don't want this night to end

If only I could stop the sunrise, we could lay here all night
If only I could learn to freeze time, I'd hold you forever
If only I had one more day, I'd love you 25/8
If only I, if only I
If only I could stop the sunrise, we could lay here all night
If only I could learn to freeze time, I'd hold you forever
If only I had one more day, I'd love you 25/8
If only I, if only I

Show me good love and a real time
I'll show you what a real love would feel like
We could turn a second to a lifetime
Slow it down and make a moment
And baby, yeah, you know you're the one
'Cause I can fall in love with you twice
I'll ride all the highs and the lows
Follow wherever you go

Don't you hate goodbyes?
Rather say "Good morning" than "Goodnight"
No, I can't even pretend
No matter how I try
My body wants you, no, it cannot lie
I don't want this night to end

If only I could stop the sunrise, we could lay here all night
If only I could learn to freeze time, I'd hold you forever
If only I had one more day, I'd love you 25/8
If only I, if only I

If only I could stop the sunrise, we could lay here all night
If only I could learn to freeze time, I'd hold you forever
If only I had one more day, I'd love you 25/8
If only I, if only I

If only I, if only I
