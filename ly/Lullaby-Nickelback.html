		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I know the feeling
Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
And there ain't no healing
From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
I'm telling you that, it's never that bad
And take it from someone who's been where you're at
Laid out on the floor
And you're not sure you can take this anymore

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Please let me take you
Out of the darkness and into the light
'Cause I have faith in you
That you're gonna make it through another night
Stop thinking about the easy way out
There's no need to go and blow the candle out
Because you're not done
You're far too young
And the best is yet to come

So just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
So just close your eyes (close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby

Well, everybody's hit the bottom
And everybody's been forgotten
When everybody's tired of being alone
Yeah, everybody's been abandoned
And left a little empty handed
So if you're out there barely hanging on

Just give it one more try to a lullaby
And turn this up on the radio
If you can hear me now, I'm reaching out
To let you know that you're not alone
And you can't tell, I'm scared as hell
'Cause I can't get you on the telephone (oh)
So just close your eyes (close your eyes)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby (oh)
Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby
Your very own lullaby
