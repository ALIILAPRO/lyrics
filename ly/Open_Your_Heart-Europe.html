		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you

I've been waiting for the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin' that everything could be like before

Open your heart and tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if I'm strong
Hey girl, I can't cope anymore

I've been waiting...

Open your heart, let me hear you
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call
Open your heart, want to come near you
Make up your mind, oh girl, before I fall

Maybe the sun will continue to shine
Maybe the rain will continue to fall
Maybe you want to leave me behind
Maybe you'll change and give me a call
