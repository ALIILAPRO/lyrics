		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked myself right into hell
To try and save you
I gave up everything I love
Just to try and help you
And it's done nothing
But tear me apart
I'd set myself on fire
To try and keep your heart
Now I'm burning here alone
In this burning home
You set the match
And then you left me on my own
In this burning home
With the flames that you let grow
In this burning burning home
I watched our memories turn to ashes
I was made of glass
You were made of plastic
Paying the price for loving
Someone who doesn't deserve it
Oh, how did I end up here
Now I'm burning here alone
In this burning home
You set the match
And then you left me on my own
In this burning home
With the flames that you let grow
In this burning, burning home
Burning home burning home
Burning home
