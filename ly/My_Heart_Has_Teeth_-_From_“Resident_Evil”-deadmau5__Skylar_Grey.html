		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've never met someone like me
My heart has teeth
My heart has teeth
And it's looking for something to eat
My heart has teeth
My heart has teeth
Oh, isn't it so bittersweet 
That I love to watch you bleed?
You've never met someone like me
My heart has
My heart has
Because my heart has teeth

You've never met someone like me
My heart has teeth
My heart has teeth
And it's looking for something to eat
My heart has teeth
My heart has teeth
Oh, isn't it so bittersweet 
That I love to watch you bleed?
You've never met someone like me
My heart has
My heart has
Because my heart has teeth

You've never met someone like me
My heart has teeth
My heart has teeth
And it's looking for something to eat
My heart has teeth
My heart has teeth
Oh, isn't it so bittersweet 
That I love to watch you bleed?
You've never met someone like me
My heart has
My heart has
Because my heart has teeth
