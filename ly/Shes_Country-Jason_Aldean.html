		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You boys ever met a real country girl?
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country (uh)

She's a hot little number in her pick-up truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' Cajun, lunatic from Brunswick, juicy Georgia peach
With a thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk, brother she's all

Country (shoot), from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay country
Brother, she's country

A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down 
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the hollerin' Kentucky
Get ya flippin' kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess, crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swingin' walk
Brother she's all

Country (shoot), from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay country
Nothin' but country

(Thick southern drawl)
(Sexy swingin' walk)
(Aw, show 'em how a country girl does it, one time now)

Brother, she's country 
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
Nothin' but country
Yeah, yeah

She's country (shoot), from her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country, from the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised, she ain't afraid to stay, country
Yeah, she's nothin' but country

She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone, she's country
