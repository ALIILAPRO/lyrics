		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something about you
That makes me wanna run
Through a meadow in the sun with you
I wanna adore you
Like nobody before
Can't hide away my feelings no more

I wanna lay you down and watch the sky
And see the clouds in your eyes
I wanna feel you in my atmosphere
And turn my head, to whisper in your ear

Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
If I say how I feel
You're the one
You're the one
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
If we try
Let me love you right

Cause I can love you right
Just let me love you right
I can love you right

I don't wanna fight it
You're pretty like a sunset
And you don't even know it
Wanna make love to you on a flowerbed
And I don't wanna jinx it
But I'm already falling
Since the minute that you walked in

I wanna lay you down and watch the sky
And see the clouds in your eyes
I wanna feel you in my atmosphere
And turn my head, to whisper in your ear

Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
If I say how I feel
You're the one
You're the one
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
If we try
Let me love you right

Cause I can love you right
Just let me love you right
I can love you right

Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
You're the one
You're the one
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
Do you mind
If we try
Let me love you right
