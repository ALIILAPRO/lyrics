		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been forever, my dear
But I can't stop here
'Cause I know where it's goin'
I'm on the road missin' home
Missin' the road while I'm home
But baby, I'm goin'
With my heart on my sleeve
Long nights and no sleep
Rain sunshine and snowin'
I'm on the road missin' home
Missin' the road while I'm home
But baby, I'm goin'

I can't breathe
Baby, I'm dyin'
Why are you cryin'
While I'm tryin' for this love?
I can't believe
You think I'm lyin'
What are you not buyin'?
Is what I'm tryin' not enough?

This town's holdin' time
But what you believe keeps you rollin'
I'm on the road missin' home
Missin' the road while I'm home
But baby, this is my callin'
There's no right lines just lies
That keep this old train rollin'
I'm on the road missin' home
Missin' the road while I'm home
But baby, I'm goin'

I can't breathe
Baby, I'm dyin'
Why are you cryin'
While I'm tryin' for this love?
I can't believe
You think I'm lyin'
What are you not buyin'?
Is what I'm tryin' not enough?

Now this star-painted sky keeps on fallin'
I wish you were me
So you could hear me when I'm callin'
When I'm callin'
When I'm callin'
When I'm callin'

I can't breathe
Baby, I'm dyin'
Why are you cryin'
While I'm fightin' for this love?
I can't believe
You think I'm lyin'
What are you not buyin'?
Is what I'm tryin' not enough?

I can't breathe, I can't breathe
Yeah, yeah
