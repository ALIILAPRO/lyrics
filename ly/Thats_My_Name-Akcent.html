		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my heart
I will keep you
In my heart
Forever
In my heart

And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I lose my voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

All the time I thought about you
I saw your eyes and they were so blue
I could read there just one name
My name, my name, my name

Because of you I'm flying higher
You give me love, you set on fire
You keep me warm when you call my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

In my heart
I will keep you
In my heart
Forever
In my heart

And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I lose my voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

All the time I thought about you
I saw your eyes and they were so blue
I could read there just one name
My name, my name, my name

Because of you I'm flying higher
You give me love, you set on fire
You keep me warm when you call my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

In my heart
I will keep you
In my heart
Forever

And you are the one that lights the fire
I am the one who takes you higher
I lose my voice when you say my name
That's my name, that's my name, that's my name

And you
You will stay in my heart as I knew from the start
And you
You will stay in my heart, never keep you apart
And you
You will stay in my heart as I knew from the start
And you
You will stay in my heart, never keep you apart
