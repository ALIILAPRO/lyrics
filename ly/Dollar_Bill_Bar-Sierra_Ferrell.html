		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We wrote our names on a dollar bill down at the Dollar Bill Bar
Our feelings couldn't reach the ceiling
So we hung it right there on the wall
We were spinning 'round so silly drunk
The green was just like rippling leaves
In a forest full of promises
A hundred thousand broken-down dreams

Guys like you are a dime a dozen
You should count your lucky stars
Honey, if I had a dollar for every single sailor's heart
I could break a hundred down at the Dollar Bill Bar

So don't look too close at the dollar bills down at the Dollar Bill Bar
You may see my name is written there
Then you know I've been here before
You may think that you are special, think that you got what it takes
But I'm standing here to tell you, that was your very first mistake

'Cause guys like you are a dime a dozen
You should count your lucky stars
Honey, if I had a dollar for every single cowboy's heart
Well, honey, I could break a hundred down at the Dollar Bill Bar

Guys like you are a dime a dozen
You should count your lucky stars
Honey, if I had a dollar for every single hopeful heart
Well, honey, I could break a hundred down at the Dollar Bill Bar
Honey, I could break a hundred down at the Dollar Bill Bar

So if I ask you for a dollar bill down at the Dollar Bill Bar
Just think twice before you pull me up
Take me for a twirl on that floor
And if I tell you that I love you
And I tell you that I want to take you home
Just turn around here and leave here
'Cause I'm telling you you're better off alone
