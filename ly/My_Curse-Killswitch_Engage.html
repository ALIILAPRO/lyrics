		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I watched you walk away
Hopeless, with nothing to say
I strained my eyes 
Hoping to see you again

This is my curse (the longing)
This is my curse (time)
This is my curse (the yearning)
This is my curse

There is love 
Burning to find you
Will you wait for me?
Will you be there?

Your silence haunts me
But still I hunger for you

This is my curse (the wanting)
This is my curse (time)
This is my curse (the healing)
This is my curse

There is love 
Burning to find you
Will you wait for me?

Still I want
And still I ache
But still I wait
To see you again

Dying inside these walls
Dying inside these walls

And I see your face
In these tears, in these tears
And I see your face

There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love

There is love
There is love
There is love
There is love
