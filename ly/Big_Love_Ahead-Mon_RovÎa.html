		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And you thought that you didn't deserve it, well you're wrong.
And you've got so much on your shoulders, stay strong.
And you thought that you didn't deserve it, well you're wrong.
And you've got so much on your shoulders, stay strong.

Big love ahead, mountain tops you're scared.
Big love ahead, mountain tops you're scared.

I saw you smile for the first time, 
and I hope it lasts a while now
if you fall I'll catch you.
You've been lost in a canyon.

Big love, big love.
Big love ahead, mountain tops you're scared.
Big love ahead, mountain tops you're scared.
