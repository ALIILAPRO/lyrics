		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think someone lost her unicorn
And now everybody knows
What you did and what did and what you didn't do
They say the unicorn is riding you

On the other side
On the other side of tonight
Holy shit, we're gonna die
On the other side
On the other side of tonight
Holy shit, we're gonna die

You say you sometimes wish you weren't born
But there's shit that you don't know
And we want you-, and we want you to go overboard
Fuck the unicorn, I'll ride you too

On the other side
On the other side of tonight
Holy shit, we're gonna die
On the other side
On the other side of tonight
Holy shit, we're gonna die

Oh, you wanna play hard?

On the other side
On the other side of tonight
Holy shit, we're gonna die
On the other side
On the other side of tonight
Holy shit, we're gonna die
