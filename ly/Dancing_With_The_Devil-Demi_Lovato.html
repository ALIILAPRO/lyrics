		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
It's just a little red wine, I'll be fine
Not like I wanna do this every night
I've been good, don't I deserve it?
I think I earned it, feels like it's worth it
In my mind, mind

Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay but I was lying

I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to heaven, it was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no, when you're dancing with the devil 
Ooh yeah, yeah

It's just a little white line, I'll be fine
But soon that little white line is a little glass pipe
Tinfoil remedy, almost got the best of me
I keep praying I don't reach the end of my lifetime, mm

Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay but I was lying

I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to heaven, it was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no, when you're dancing with the devil

Thought I knew my limit, yeah
I thought that I could quit it, yeah
I thought that I could walk away easily
But here I am falling down on my knees
Praying for better days
To come and wash this pain away
Could you please forgive me?
Lord, I'm sorry for dancing with the devil
Ooh yeah, yeah

Dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to heaven, it was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no, when you're dancing with the devil
Ooh yeah, yeah
