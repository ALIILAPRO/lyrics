		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight, I wanna hold you close
I don't wanna let you go
Loving you is all I know
Yeah

Mm, girl
Look into my eyes and tell me why
You got me tantalized
Yeah, you got me feeling so alive
Ain't no surprises

On our way, on our way, we don't waste time
Grab my hands, lay 'em down on your waistline
Then we get low
If you let me take you for a ride
You'll memorize it

Tonight, I wanna hold you close
I don't wanna let you go
Loving you is all I know
And I don't wanna dance alone
Let the music take control
And all of your problems go
If we never make it home
I don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone

Even if it's only for a night
Make it feel like a lifetime
I can never ever sell you lies
Your touch is righteous

On our way, on our way, we don't waste time
Grab my hands, lay 'em down on your waistline
Then we get low
Even if it's only for a night
Let's make it timeless

Tonight, I wanna hold you close
I don't wanna let you go (Go)
Loving you is all I know (I know)
And I don't wanna dance alone
Let the music take control
And all of your problems go (Go)
If we never make it home
I don't wanna dance alone (don't wanna dance)
Don't wanna dance alone (don't wanna dance)
Don't wanna dance alone

Put your hands all on my body
Once we start it, we can't stop it
Put your hands all on my body
'Cause I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance
(Don't wanna dance alone)
Put your hands all on my body
Once we start it, we can't stop it
Put your hands all on my body
'Cause I don't wanna dance, I don't wanna dance
(Don't wanna dance alone)

Tonight, I wanna hold you close
I don't wanna let you go (go)
Loving you is all I know (I know)
And I don't wanna dance alone
Let the music take control
And all of your problems go (go)
If we never make it home
I don't wanna dance alone (don't wanna dance)
Don't wanna dance alone (don't wanna dance)
Don't wanna dance alone

On our way, on our way, we don't waste time (don't wanna dance alone)
Grab my hands, lay 'em down on your waistline
Don't wanna dance alone
Don't wanna dance alone
