		  Well, now, they often call me Speedo 
But my real name is Mister Earl 
Hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, now, they often call me Speedo 
But my real name is Mister Earl 
Hmm, hmm-hmm

I'm all for meetin' brand new fellas 
And takin' other folks' girl 
Hmm, hmm-hmm 

Well, now, they often call me Speedo
'Cause I don't believe in wastin' time 
Hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, now, they often call me Speedo
'Cause I don't believe in wastin' time 
Hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, I've known some pretty women 
And I've caused them to change their mind 
Hmm, hmm-hmm

Well, now, some may call me Joe 
Some may call me Moe 
Just remember Speedo
He don't never take it slow 

Well, now, they often call me Speedo
But my real name is Mister Earl 
Hmm, hmm-hmm

But my real name is Mister Earl 
Hmm, hmm-hmm 

Well, now, they often call me Speedo
