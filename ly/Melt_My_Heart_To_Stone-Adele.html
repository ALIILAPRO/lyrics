		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right under my feet is air made of bricks
That pulls me down and turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
Then, I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I've turned around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?
You build me up and leave me there

Well, I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love
