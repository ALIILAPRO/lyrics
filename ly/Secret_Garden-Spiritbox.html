		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking back, you're mistaken
Was it drought or euphoria
That could finally make me hopeful in the fault line?
Far from perfect illusion
Wait to walk up the island
Double knot into silence
I could never fall in line
I can feel the rain this time

It flows from the hope spring
Complacent in rare form
You said, "I'll make you leave me"
Is it all that I am?
And it's you that I came for
Two hands are guarding my heart
I never climbed this far

And nobody waits for me but I know
Nobody takes from me what I grow
Secret Garden, disregard my heart
And nobody waits for me but I know
Nobody takes from me but I know
I know

Evidence just to please me
Lie awake, uninspired
It could all be so easy
If I could pull out the stitch
And it's you that I came for
Two hands are guarding my heart
I never climbed this far

And nobody waits for me but I know
Nobody takes from me what I grow
Secret Garden, disregard my heart
And nobody waits for me but I know
Nobody takes from me what I grow
Secret Garden, disregard my heart

Nobody waits for me
Nobody takes from me
Nobody waits for me
Nobody takes from me

Nobody waits for me (I know)
Nobody takes from me (I grow)
Nobody waits for me (I know)
Nobody takes from me (I grow)
