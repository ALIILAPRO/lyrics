		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Open water
Where's the shore gone?
Held, I falter
Open water

I know, the sea
Will bury me
And all I see is
Open water

Open water
Open water

Open water
Where's the shore gone?
Held, I falter
Open water

My love
For we
No use for
Screamin' here
I'll drown with open water

Open water
Open water

Open water
Where's the shore gone?
Held, I falter
Open water

I know the sea
Is all
That I can see
My love
Alone in open water

Open water
Open water

I know something's been lurking
In the depths of murky water
There are ripples and a'boats appearing
Over there a separate ship

And filtering me in my head
I think i'm numb
I think i'm dead
If something pulls my paddling leg
Under

Sweet sea ache
Is more than I can take
There's bodied, tiny salty water in my lungs

A deeper, darker, bluer drifter
The pressures squeezing on my head
The kraken's got the best of me
This time

I know something's been lurking
In the depths of murky water
There are ripples and a'boats appearing
Over there a separate ship

And filtering me in my head
I think i'm numb
I think i'm dead
If something pulls my paddling leg
Under

Sweet sea ache
Is more than I can take
There's bodied, tiny salty water in my lungs

A deeper, darker, bluer drifter
The pressures squeezing on my head
The kraken's got the best of me
This time

Open water
Where's the shore gone?
Held, I falter
Open water
