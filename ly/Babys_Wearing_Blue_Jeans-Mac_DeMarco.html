		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standin' on the corner
Tryna keep it clean
A fine-lookin' woman
In a pair of Lee's
Take her back to my place
Lay her down in bed
Now she starts to strip down
I say, "Leave 'em on instead"

Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans

Later in the evening
Dippin' in the tub
Washin', wearin' Wranglers
I think that I'm in love
Straight leg or a bootcut
Legging, darlin', please
Stay with me forever
Don't take off those jeans

Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans

Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
Baby's wearin' blue jeans
