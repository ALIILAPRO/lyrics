		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who knows what tomorrow will bring
Maybe sunshine, and maybe rain
But as for me I'll wait and see
And maybe it'll bring my love to me

Who knows
Who knows
Who knows it better than I
That it's she who's keeping me alive
Keeping the little girl as my goal
Makes my life worth living alone

Another day
Another day
Just another day
I wanna live
To share the love that only she can give
And if she don't come on home
I pray the Lord will help me carry on
Another day
Another day
Just another day (oh Lord)

Another day
Another day
Just another day
I wanna live
To share the love that only she can give
And if she don't come on home
I pray the Lord will help me carry on

Another day
Another day
Just another day (oh Lord)
For who knows what tomorrow will bring
Maybe sunshine, and maybe rain
But as for me I'll wait and see
