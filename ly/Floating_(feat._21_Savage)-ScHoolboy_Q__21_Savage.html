		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fall in this bitch, transfusion with the drip drop
Sauce everywhere and got broccoli in my Ziploc
Tatted on my face, no role model that's for Kidz Bops
Got it on my waist, let that shit rock, I'm floating

Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating (Aye) 
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating (Aye), floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, bum bitch, yes I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating (Woo), floating, floating (Woo), floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating (Ayy), floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, bum bitch, yes I'm floating (Woo)

Take it off, yeah, going off, yeah
Money been here, the body's in here
I'm ringing up here, the chopper don't fear
The Prada get late, the pussy gon' wait
The money I chase, the 'Rari don't break
You killing my pace, the Carti my face
A mill in my safe, now hand me that tape
Ten toes in the mud, who the plug getting wrapped?
Tan tone yellow pills, selling seals and it's facts (Ayy)
I ain't trying to wife you, too emotional (Emotional)
Now take this in and out like it's supposed to go
Made it out the hood, had to bounce right quick (Bounce right quick)
Wonder how I drop out, learn to count like this (Learn to count like this)
Got a new house and a condo, where I keep my shit (Where I keep my shit)
Got a shoestring 'round the thing thing, man, who built like this (Okay I'm floating, ay)

Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating (Aye) 
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating (Aye), floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, bum bitch, yes I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating (Woo), floating, floating (Woo), floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating (Ayy), floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, bum bitch, yes I'm floating (Woo)

I'm on Percocet floating (Yeah), AR toting (Straight up)
Big blunt smoking ass nigga (21, 21)
In a Maybach, joking (Straight up)
Drive the 'Rari like it's stolen (Yeah)
He a broke Ford Focus ass nigga (Ha)
Pay me for a show, I got a chopper (21)
All this metal, they gon' call the coppers (21)
Can't run the game 'round rappers (Straight up)
'Cause I hang around all robbers (On God)
Little nigga, do you got a problem? (What?)
Little nigga, we'll come and solve it (Straight up)
Cash coming in, can't stop it (21)
I'm running to the money, y'all jogging (Yeah)
Richard Milles represent victories (21)
Still the same, I'm just a richer me (Oh God)
A washed up bitch don't mean shit to me (Nothing)
I'ma let your best friend nibble me (Yeah)
You can't do nothing for me
Unless you leaving hickeys on my dick, bitch (21)
Slaughter Gang, freak hoes get punched, just for trying to kiss me (21, 21)

Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating, floating (Aye) 
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating (Aye), floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, bum bitch, yes I'm floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating (Woo), floating, floating (Woo), floating, floating
Floating, I'm floating, floating, floating, floating (Ayy), floating, floating
Swag on max, got no legs bitch, I'm floating
Might turn into a ghost, bum bitch, yes I'm floating (Woo)
