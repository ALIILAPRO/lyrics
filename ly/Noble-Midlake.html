		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stayed up for hours and hours
Wondering all the while
Wondering how we will get by

Who would want to hear about
The wanderings of my mind?
This wasn't supposed to be my life

You came in
Like a cherubim
Holy in every way life's given

Oh please stay by my side
Your yoke is easy and
Burden light

You can always laugh while I 
Struggle to crack a smile
Struggle to keep it all inside

When I look into your brown eyes
I struggle to pull aside
I'm wanting you more within my life

You came in
Like a cherubim
Holy in every way life's given

Oh please stay by my side
Your yoke is easy and
Burden light

Oh these days I
Try to find the reason underlying
Your yoke is easy and
Burden light

Oh to be noble
Oh to be noble
Oh to be noble
Oh to be noble
