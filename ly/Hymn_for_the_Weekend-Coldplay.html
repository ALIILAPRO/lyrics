		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me, drink from me, drink from me (oh I-)
Shoot across the symphony (oh I-, oh I-)
That we shoot across the sky
Drink from me, drink from me (I-, oh I-, oh I-)
That we shoot across the (I'm feeling drunk and high)
Symphony
(So high, so high)
That we shoot across the s- (drink from)

Oh, angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down, when I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink and love's a drug
Oh, now I think I must be miles up
When I was a river, dried up
You came to rain a flood

You said, "Drink from me, drink from me"
When I was so thirsty
Pour on a symphony
Now I just can't get enough
Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony 
When I'm low, low, low, low

I-, oh I-, oh I-
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)
(Woo)
(Ooh)

Oh, angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink, your love's about
To make the stars come out

Put your wings on me, wings on me
When I was so heavy
Pour on a symphony
When I'm low, low, low, low

I-, oh I-, oh I-
Got me feeling drunk and high
So high, so high (so high)
Oh I-, oh I-, oh I-
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)

I-, oh I-, oh I-
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
So high, so high
I-, oh I-, oh I-
Now I'm feeling drunk and high
So high (so high), so high (so high)

That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the (that we shoot, yeah)
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
That we shoot across the sky
That we shoot across the
