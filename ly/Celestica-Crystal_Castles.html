		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As we fall into sequence
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally

Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

If I'm lost please don't find me
If I jump let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink

When it's cold outside hold me
Don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me
Don't coax me
When it's cold outside hold me
Don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me
Don't coax me

Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

Have they cleansed you with chloride
And scrubbed behind the knees
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze
