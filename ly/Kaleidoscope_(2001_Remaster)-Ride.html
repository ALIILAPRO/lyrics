		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you are thinking of me now,
I can feel it but I don't know how.
When I'm gone you will see so clear,
That I left some words unspoken here.

All these words that I have said,
Float around you, fill your head.
All the times we laughed and cried,
I never thought I'd leave you behind.

I don't want you to understand,
You will never hold me in your hand.
I don't want you to see my face,
When I fade away and leave this place.

All these songs that fill my head,
Dance around you when I'm dead.
All the love I ever knew,
Kaleidoscopes around to you

All these words that I have said,
Float around you, fill your head.
All the times we laughed and cried,
I never thought I'd change your mind.
All these songs that fill my head,
Dance around you when I'm dead.
All the love I ever knew,
Kaleidoscopes around to you.
