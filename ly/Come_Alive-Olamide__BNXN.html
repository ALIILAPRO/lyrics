I'm in yoyour city like, recognize
I'm playing here tonight, feel the vibes?
And maybe after that, where you at?
Call me back, let me meet you at
Oyour favorite spot, by the liquor shop
I ain't in rush, I need a little buzz
Light my glizzy up, middle finger up
Like I don't give a fuck, you know I do too much
You got that killer touch, killer blush
You too fine, you too much
Want to cuddle you up
Me and you in a tub
You need some loving up
Oh yeah I thought as much

So If you wan come alive
Make you call me tonight
Shebi na me dey tonight, I go make you feel alright
So what you want tell me now
She say she want anyhow
But girl if you do anyhow, believe you go see anyhow
She thirsty, ko de fe siddown ko mu omi
The look in the eyes say she want me
E no be water wey fit to quench the fire wey dey burn inside me
She thirsty
Ko de fe siddown ko mu omi
The look in the eyes say she want me
E no be water wey fit to quench the fire wey dey burn inside me

What you want I'm gonna give you on a plata
Real born slata (slaughter)
The Joey going zaza and my Larry going Gaga
Chop err thing weh you carry like masa
That's Aristo flexing baby masa
And when you send me your aza alert go de jam your bank account it go de mazza
Energy level on Kendrick Lamar
Slow jamma, who's badder?
No mama, I'm for real I'm tryna figure who's father
Got it like me I dey hit dem up with am harder
Stop acting like you no know who go dey mend am
Bend am, defend am, dey resuspend am
Nakupenda mi brenda toh slender
Mo gbefun e pata pata omo no contender
It's obvious that I'm so scrupulous
Yapping all around town got nothing do with us

So If you wan come alive
Make you call me tonight
Shebi na me dey tonight I can make you feel alright
So what you want tell me now
She say she want anyhow
Girl if you do anyhow, believe you go see anyhow
She thirsty, ko de fe siddown ko mu omi
The look in the eyes say she want me
E no be water wey fit to quench the fire wey dey burn inside me
She thirsty
Ko de fe siddown ko mu omi
The look in the eyes say she want me
E no be water wey fit to quench the fire wey dey burn inside me

O fe ma fimi gazoh bawo kowapa
What's cracking lil shorty, baby showapa?
Wetin dey shele? What dey happen? What dey pop?
If your nigga too dey flop, you should give me a chance I gat you nothing dey pa
Ma ro e kun Asap Rocky oko Riri
Kumfayakun with a bootie like Ini
Hold on second mami if you got a twinnie
Are you gonna grant my wishes like Genie?
I no go lie omo me I be Oliver Twist
I wo na wo boshen twist
Mo like everything loni double double
If e no go cause trouble mo le lo yin double double (oh Lord)
Can't get enough of you
Don't know if it's an obsession I got for you
Or love I got for you but I what I got for you is beyond reasoning mami I dey fucka for you
