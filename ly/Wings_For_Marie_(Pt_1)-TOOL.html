		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You believed
You believed in movements none could see
You believed in me

A passionate spirit
Uncompromised
Boundless and open
A light in your eyes
Then immobilized

Vacant, broken
Fell at the hands of those moments that I wouldn't see
'Cause it was you who prayed for me so
What have I done to be a son to an angel?
What have I done to be worthy?

Daylight dims leaving cold fluorescence
Difficult to see you in this light
Please forgive this selfish question, but
What am I to say to all these ghouls tonight?

She never told a lie
Well might have told a lie
But never lived one
Didn't have a life
Didn't have a life
But surely saved one
See? I'm alright, now it's time for us to let you go
