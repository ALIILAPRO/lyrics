		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think you ever fully
Recover from your first heartbreak
You sort of just learn to deal with it

Yeah,  love hurts especially when the person
That you love doesn't want to put you first
If I could go reverse
I would pay attention to your actions
And would never pay attention to your words
Bitch, you was a curse
Tricked me into thinking that you
Love me then you
Cut me now I'm bleeding on this verse
I need to go to church
I'm having conversations with the
Devil and I'm
Asking what is life really worth it's Dax

You fucked up my head
And what's crazy is I'd probably
Do it all again at night I sit on my bed
Start praying while I'm looking up at God
And I ask him when the hell
Is this pain gon' end
He acts deaf, been stressed
I remember the texts
Remember the love, phone calls
I remember the sex
I'm still haunted by the day that you left
I wasn't good enough but fuck it
I still gave you my best now I'm sick
Fuck and I don't know what to do
Seven billion but not one like you
Ain't it crazy how we built for
Two years but it took ten
Seconds and a bad decision just to
Break the whole thing loose
I can't sleep, I can't eat
My heart skips beats
Social media don't help
They'll think I'm weak
I've been screaming that I'm cut but
You just watch me bleed
I can't love another woman
'cause the cycle repeats no
So I just write these song
Yeah they help but they don't write wrongs
My life is a museum everybody
Shows up and buys
Tickets but they never wanna stay that long
Man I can't move on
Head spinning like a CD rom
Only woman I can trust is my mom
And don't you fucking try to say
You can relate unless you
Listen to these lyrics and cry
While you singing along fuck, love hurts
In the worst way
Imagine catching someone cheating
On your birthday
And then they cry and say they love
You while they're sitting on his dick
Then bitch why'd the fuck you do
It in the first place?
Did you know you'd hurt me?
Fuck I was just another option on your survey
I could get revenge but that wouldn't
Help my spirit so I
Have to make these songs and
Let these motherfucking words play fuck
Oh now I'm doing too much?
I'm supposed to be a man so
I'm supposed to act tough?
I put all my fucking eggs in one basket
You were my plan A
I didn't ever even think to have a backup
Now I'm stuck
I need a break but I'm in it again
It's all or nothing we can't just be friends
First loves are the worst
Love hurts and I'm stuck
Inside this cycle that's
Gonna end up with you cheating again, fuck

Love hurts
Especially when the person that you love
Doesn't want to put you first
If I could go reverse
I would pay attention to your actions
And would never pay attention to your words
Bitch, you was a curse
Tricked me into thinking that you
Love me then you
Cut me now I'm bleeding on this verse
I need to go to church
I'm having conversations with the
Devil and I'm
Asking what is life really worth it's Dax

Your first love will fuck you up man
We've all been there love hurts
