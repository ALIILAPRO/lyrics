		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah yeah
Wow, wow, wow, wow, yeah
Arthur J. did, indicate that
The boulevard will never be 
So full of life and love again hey
(Aw, say goodbye to your boots, man)

Hot as Hades, early eighties 
Sing another song
Make me feel like I'm in love again, hey
(You gotta lose to win)

Oh yeah 
Oh 
Please don't strip my mind 
Leave something behind 
Please don't strip my mind 

Oh, hey yeah, oh 
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow yeah
All in favor sign the waiver 
Bloody Carolina 
Won't you take another look inside, hey
(Aw, it will make me cry)

Operator, co-creator 
Come on baby Ellie 
Won't you blow another compensator, hey
(Ah, you only get what you bring)

Oh yeah 
Oh 
Please don't strip my mind 
Leave something behind 
Please don't strip my mind 

El Dorado won the lotto 
All the cash and not a clue 
But now you know what I've been through, hey

Oh yeah 
Oh 
Please don't strip my mind 
Leave something behind 
Please don't strip my mind 
Leave something behind
