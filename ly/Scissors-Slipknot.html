		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I play doctor for five minutes flat
Before I cut my heart open
And let the air out
Three bugs, a pound of dust
Some wind spilled before me
In the strangest manner that had
Broke away my tear spout

As I lie there
With my tongue spread wide open
A black widow had offered me
A sweetheart tube as I injected
The candied heart that I selected
She said don't hesitate
Just do what you have to do to me

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red, 'cause I can't feel

It's hard to stay between the lines of skin
Just 'cause I have nerves, don't mean that I can feel
I wasn't very much fun to be with anyway
Just let the blood run red, 'cause I can't feel

Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time

Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time

Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time

Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time until the time is right
Biding my time, it's time

Biding (my time)
Biding (my time)
Biding (my time)
Biding
Yeaa, yeah, yeah

Someone in behind me
Someone inside me
Everyone against me
Everyone beside me
Clawing away the pieces
Scratching away the abscess

One more, two more
Everyone, once more

One more, two more
Everyone, once more

Inside the places that I hide from you
I want to see you splayed before me
You are the only one
That I would rather see before me

You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
You want it, you need it
Don't lie, I die, you lie, I lie, oh why?

I don't want you to pay anyone when I die
I wanna die, I'd rather die, I wanna die
You purge, you burn, you purge
I don't need you anymore
I don't need you

It is time, it is time, it is time
It is time, it is time, it is time
It is time, it is time, it is time
It is time, it is time, it is time
