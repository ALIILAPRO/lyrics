		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh, ooh)

Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet (ooh), where you lay (ooh)
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case

Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control

(Ooh)
Oh, oh, oh
(Ooh)

The taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat (ooh), where you laid (ooh)
I could stay right here and burn in it all day

Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control

Lost my senses
I'm defenseless
Her perfume's holding me ransom
Sweet and sour
Heart devoured
Lying here, I count the hours

Waking up
Beside you, I'm my loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I got no control
No control
Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control
Oh, oh, oh
No control
Oh, oh, oh
No control

Powerless
And I don't care, it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed
No control
