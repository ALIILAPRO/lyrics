		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey nonny ding dong, alang, alang, alang
Boom ba-doh, ba-doo, ba-doodle-ay)

Oh, life could be a dream 
If I could take you up in paradise up above 
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

(Hello, hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again)
Oh, life could be a dream
If only all my precious plans would come true
If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

Now every time I look at you
Something is on my mind (ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we'd be so fine

Oh, life could be a dream 
If I could take you up in paradise up above
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

Sh-boom sh-boom, ya-da-da da-da-da da-da-da da
Sh-boom sh-boom, ya-da-da da-da-da da-da-da da
Sh-boom sh-boom, ya-da-da da-da-da da-da-da da sh-boom

Sh-boom sh-boom, ya-da-da da-da-da da-da-da da
Sh-boom sh-boom, ya-da-da da-da-da da-da-da da
Sh-boom sh-boom, ya-da-da da-da-da da-da-da da sh-boom

Every time I look at you
Somethin' is on my mind
If you do what I want you to
Baby, we'd be so fine

Life could be a dream
If I could take you up in paradise up above
If you would tell me I'm the only one that you love
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

(Hello hello again, sh-boom and hopin' we'll meet again
Boom sh-boom)
Hey nonny ding dong, alang, alang, alang 
Ba-doh, ba-doo, ba-doodle-ay
Life could be a dream
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

Life could be a dream
If only all my precious plans would come true
If you would let me spend my whole life lovin' you
Life could be a dream, sweetheart

Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom, sh-boom
Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom, sh-boom
Do-roo-do-do, sh-boom, sh-boom
Sweetheart
