		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything's going like crazy
Don't even got time to breathe, mm
Lately, I'm needing my baby, mm
To come and take care of me, me, me, me

Please, could you pour my drink? Could you rub my feet?
Would you roll with me? Hey baby, I'm weak
In the knees, yeah
Please, could you pour my drink? 'Cause you know my kink
Would you roll with me? Hey baby, I'm weak
Come fly with me, yeah, yeah

Ooh, you got my heart goin', bae
Think we one and the same
Baby, be my escape
Maybe we could hop on a plane
Hear you callin' my name
Baby, be my escape
Got me feelin' like, ooh
Nah, nah, nah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, whoa
Would be my, be my, be my escape?

Maybe our love is an island
This bed is a private beach, oh yeah
Imagine we shower of diamonds (shower, shower, shower)
Paradise, you and me, me, me

Please, could you pour my drink? Could you rub my feet?
Would you roll with me? Hey baby, I'm weak
In the knees, yeah, yeah
Please, could you pour my drink? 'Cause you know my kink
Would you roll with me? Hey baby, I'm weak
Come fly with me

Ooh, you got my heart goin', bae
Think we one and the same
Baby, be my escape
Maybe we could hop on a plane
Hear you callin' my name
Baby, be my escape
Got me feelin' like, ooh
Nah, nah, nah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, whoa
Would be my, be my, be my escape?

See, it's a private flight
You can take me all the way, anywhere you like
Just don't let me go
Leave all the finer things
When I'm lying next to you, that's enough for me
Just don't let me go

Ooh, you got my heart goin', bae
Think we one and the same
Baby, be my escape
Maybe we could hop on a plane
Hear you callin' my name
Baby, be my escape
Got me feelin' like, ooh
Nah, nah, nah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, oh
(Would you) would be my, be my, be my escape?
Nah, nah, nah, yeah
Nah, nah, nah, oh
Would be my, be my, be my escape?
