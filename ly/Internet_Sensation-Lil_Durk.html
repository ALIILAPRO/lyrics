		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Carl Paul)

This is how I feel, I got your love attached to me
And you know I truly love you, it was never about no pussy
And you told me that them niggas ain't for me, they just want my money
And I like the way you is, you ain't tryna kick it with my buddies
And I got a habit and I like that you don't judge me
And it's so fucked up that I'm glad to be a junkie
To fall in love, I say I been afraid
I'm mixin' lean with Lyrical Lemonade
And we on top, ain't no more public aid
Or callin' your boss to get another raise
I drop some Backwood ashes in the Wraith
Reminiscin' 'bout the older days

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the people don't let the 'net ruin they relationship
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the females who won't listen to another bitch
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the niggas in the trenches turned to gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta tell the truth, this the best relationship I ever been in

Whoever thought that I can make this shit?
Voice of the streets and relationship
And we don't care what the rumor is
Fuck these other hoes 'cause I love my bitch
Alexander McQueen and Rockstar jeans
The prosecutor hatin' 'cause I'm doin' my thing
Six kids plus her daughter, that's what it is (oh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
I seen Rel fall in love, I know that shit crazy
I seen Booka fall in love, I know that shit crazy
Insider, don't let the outside ruin that situation
And it's me and her forever, it's a lit-uation, yeah

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the people don't let the 'net ruin they relationship
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the females who won't listen to another bitch
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the niggas in the trenches turned to gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta tell the truth, this the best relationship I ever been in
