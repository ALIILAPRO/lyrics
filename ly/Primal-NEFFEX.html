		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m alright, yeah
Living in the shadows in the night yeah
Always searching looking for the light yeah
Anything to understand this life yeah
Need someone who can hold me down yeah yeah
Feel buried in the ground yeah yeah
If I could just be found yeah yeah
I don’t know why I’m down yeah yeah
And I’ve been feeling spiteful
Everything has got me in denial
Put me on trial
Waves of emotion like a tidal
I see you and I feel it now yeah yeah
I feel my heart it pounds yeah yeah
Vibrations from the sounds yeah yeah
I wanna feel you now yeah yeah ohhhh
I know
All the dark places where my mind goes
Thoughts spin around like a vinyl
And you got me feeling something primal
It's vital i need something new, a revival
I can feel it spreading like it’s viral
It's something primal

I know
All the dark places where my mind goes
Now I know
How you make me feel is something primal

Shaking bodies in the back
I can see her move
I just wanna piece of that
Everything you do got you lookin' hella bad
Got something to prove with
An attitude like that
With an attitude like that
We can feel the rhythm like it’s tribal
I feel her body next to mine tho
I’m lookin' for a sign ohhh
I feel something inside
Instinct that i can’t hide
Bad thoughts are in my mind
It’s like they got me blind
I’m not in control it’s like I Lost my soul
Nervous and I don’t know
Just where the night will go i know
All the dark places where my mind goes
Thoughts spin around like a vinyl
And you got me feeling something primal
It's vital i need something new, a revival
I can feel it spreading like it’s viral
Its something primal

I know
All the dark places where my mind goes
And now I know
How you make me feel is something primal
