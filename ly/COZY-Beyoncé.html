		<p>
		  (This a reminder)

Damn, I love the burning of the dagger
From the words that you say
Fuck, yeah
Dancing in the mirror, kiss my scars
Because I love what they made
Ooh, yeah

She's a god, she's a hero
She survived all she been through
Confident, damn, she lethal
Might I suggest, you don't fuck with my sis
Ooh, 'cause she comfortable

Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy, cozy
Comfortable in my skin
Feet up above your sins
I love myself, goddamn
Cozy, cozy

I'm cozy, I love me
They hate me because they want me

(I'm dark brown, dark skin, light skin)
(Beige, fluorescent beige, bitch)
(I'm Black) 

Been down, been up
Been broke, broke down, bounced back
Been off, been on
Been back, what you know about that?
Been the light, been dark
Been the truth, been that King Bey energy (rrah)
I been thick, been fine
Still a ten, still here, that's all me
Black like love too deep
Dance to the soles of my feet
Green eyes envy me
Paint the world pussy pink
Blue like the soul I crowned
Purple drank and couture gowns
Gold fangs a shade God made
Blue, black, white and brown
Paint the town red like cinnamon
Yellow diamonds, limoncello glisterin'
Rainbow gelato in the streets
Renaissance, yachtin' in Capri

You're a god (you're a god)
You're a hero (you're a hero)
You survived all you been through
Confident, damn, you're lethal
Might I suggest, you don't fuck with my sis
Ooh, 'cause she comfortable

Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy, cozy
Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
I love myself, god damn
Cozy, cozy (I'm Black)

I'm cozy (I'm cozy)
I'm juicy (I'm juicy)
You hate me (you hate me)
'Cause you want me ('cause you want me)
I'm swaggy (I'm swaggy)
Effortlessly (effortlessly)
Is how God made me (how God made me)
So, bitch, pay me (so pay me)
(I'm Black)

Ching-a-ling, ching, ching
(I'm probably one of the blackest motherfuckers walkin' around here)
Cozy (in this motherfuckin' place)
(I'm probably one of the blackest motherfuckers in this county)
Cozy (black like that)

Comfortable in my skin
Cozy with who I am
I love myself, god damn
Cozy, cozy (I ain't nothin' but that)

(Unique)
(Unique is what you are)
