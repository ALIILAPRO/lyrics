		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your eyes are glazed, reflecting the sparkling in the sky
Transcending the secrets is more than living in a lie
Bad things catch and drag us, leave them all behind
Dry your eyes, a beat so bright and see the road is open wide

Stop making me run away
Stop making me feel this way
Stop making me run
Stop making me run, run, run with loneliness

I've tried loving you, but your heart is as deadly as a gun
Ricochet in your hurt, maybe that's where this all begun
You take all the pills that your therapist said would make you fun
Yeah, maybe winter's got you down, but I can't always be the sun

Stop making me run away
Stop making me feel this way
Stop making me run
Stop making me run, run, run with loneliness
Stop making me run (stop making me run)
Stop making me run (stop making me run)
Stop making me run
Stop making me, stop making me

We face our own selves in the dark and in Hell
Burning down the house
I wanna make it back, saying that I don't know which way we're playing
You've been dragging me down

Stop making me run away
Stop making me feel this way
Stop making me run
Stop making me run, run, run with loneliness
Stop making me run (stop making me run)
Stop making me run (stop making me run)
Stop making me run
Stop making me, stop making me

Every now and then, don't you think about your depression?
My heart beating fast and your heart beating slow
And I know I've tried, but I can't let you go
