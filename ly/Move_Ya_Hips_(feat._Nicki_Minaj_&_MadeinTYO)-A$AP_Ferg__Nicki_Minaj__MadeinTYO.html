		  It's that time again
(Frankie motherfuckin' P)
Fergie, come out and play

Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (skrrt)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay

Diamonds all on my gums (gums, yeah)
Talk all my shit, I got runs (runs)
Hole in my jeans like I'm grunge (grunge)
Fuckin' that bitch in the buns (buns)
She suck on my dick 'til it's numb (yeah, numb)
Pockets is fat like the Klumps (Klumps)
Rappers is lookin' like lunch (lunch)
I'm makin' a meal when I munch (let's go, woo)

Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Got a new loft in Harlem, no, Fergie ain't move to L.A. (woo)
Burberry on my collar (ooh), diamonds, they sit in my face (woo)
You don't want no problems (ooh), Fergie be settin' 'em ablaze (ooh)

Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (skrrt)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay

All of you bitches is food
If you the opps, you gon' be singin' the blues
Feelin' like Bishop in "Juice"
Word to my dude, this Jimmy Choo on my shoes
All of my niggas is makks
This is a fact, this a no cap app
All of my bitches is bad, word to my dad
They know we get to the bag

Move my hips, okay
Tell him to go, then I tell him to stay, hey
Baby, it's okay, I have been having one hell of a day, yay
Saint Laurent all on my shades, then I pull up in a cherry Mercedes, yay
Strawberry shortcake hair, Chinese bangs with my two braids, ayy

Straight from out of Queens, headed to Harlem now
I got the panda mink on and it's growlin' now
Already bodied "Plain Jane" and we mobbin' now
That's 'cause all these fake niggas try to rob my style

Yo, these bitches really be slow, tell 'em I'm Billy the GOAT
I'm getting that dough, my neck and my wrist really glow
My model bitch all up in Vogue
All up in Vogue, put on my Versace robe
Streak in my hair like I'm Rogue
Nigga, you know, you better not tip on your toes
They grippin' the .40 below (ah)

Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (skrrt)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay (ooh)
Move your hips, okay
When I be leaving, she tell me to stay
