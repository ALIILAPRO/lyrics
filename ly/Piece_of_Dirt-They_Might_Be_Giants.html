		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Piece of dirt, that is all I'm standing on today
Piece of dirt, the whole world has slipped away
I would climb the highest mountain just to jump into a fountain
Or to fly, I'd fly away

A woman's voice on the radio can convince you you're in love
A woman's voice on the telephone can convince you you're alone
But I set my sails so long ago they've revoked my sailor's badge
Said I should be content and happy on this ink spot where I stand

Piece of dirt, that is all I'm standing on today
Piece of dirt, the whole world has slipped away
I find myself haunted by a spooky man named me
I wish that I could jump out of my skin
