		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never stop the car on a drive in the dark
Never look for the truth in your mother's eyes
Never trust the sound of rain upon a river 
Rushing through your ears

Arriving somewhere 
But not here

Could you imagine the final sound as a gun
Or the smashing windscreen of a car?
Did you ever imagine the last thing you'd hear as you're fading out
Was a song?

Arriving somewhere 
But not here

All my designs
Simplified
And all of my plans
Compromised
And all of my dreams
Sacrificed

Ever had the feeling you've been here before?
Drinking down the poison the way you were taught
Ever thought from here on in your life begins
And all you knew was wrong?

Arriving somewhere 
But not here

All my designs
Simplified
And all of my plans
Compromised
And all of my dreams

Did you see the redness block your part?
Did the scissors cut a way to your heart?
Did you feel the end before the sons of mothers
Tearing you apart?

Arriving somewhere 
But not here
