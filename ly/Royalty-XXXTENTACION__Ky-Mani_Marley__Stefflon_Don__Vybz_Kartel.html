		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dead soldiers yell on these frontlines
Don't know why, know why but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dead soldiers yell on these frontlines
Don't know why, know why but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined

Yeah, me haffi
Big up, yuh
Big up, yuh, big up, yuh
Like Kiara and Lanthia
Use bad man fi their bread when the mortgage up
Big up, yuh
Big up, yuh, big up, yuh
Gyal, you're my Kingston
Haffi everybody wanna hear me on this one?
Man, what's cool is that the shit change
When you use me for the money and the cars, yeah the big Range
Yeah, it's funny how shit change
Poor shorty wanna young nigga drawers, that shit stains
In a poor house, Biscayne
Now I'm in the coupe with a crib, niggas Chris Pain
Never can forget all the nights it was just pain
Now I'm finna come for the throne, don't forget, mane

Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dead soldiers yell on these frontlines
Don't know why, know why but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined

Nuff tings a get lock off
Iced out rings nah come off
Clean from me born, tell a gyal she fi chuck off
We can't stall, we a rise, we a take off
(We make the boys do wha' dem a do)
'Cause the gyal a set trends
Name just a bubble pon the ends
Tic, me a toc pon the sumtin 'til it bend
We no friend, badman, we no 'fraid of dem (We no 'fraid)
Win, we a win 'til the end

Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dead soldiers yell on these frontlines
Don't know why, know why but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined

His Imperial Majesty, Haile Selassie, so we royal
Triple X crew, so we loyal
Big body, fat pussy, broad gyal
Come here, back it up gyal, buss a whine, mhm
Bend up inna 10 and inna 9, mhm hm
Miami gyal, Caribbean whine
Yardie say, you a real buddy bruka
Yankie say, you a bad muh fucka
Ky-mani, who waan fi war?
We can work the army, war like Irani
Man grimy, crimy, can't style me, parrie
Man Triple X to Tentacion
Pull up on dem ends deh like taxi man
Nah spray cologne, we spray hot metal, cho man!
Real bad man like Sandokan
Real hot gyal badman go pon
Anywhere we walk, the street govern
No fairytale, no Alice, no Peter Pan
Versace style, Louis V pattern
We strike the street hard, no FIFA plan
Kick you from Mobay, Halfway Tree you land
We born fi get dough, no need no man
We life a sort, ask the reader man
We balls a work, we a the breeder and
Nah laugh with it, badman riddim
Smoke high grade and fly like pigeon
Real badman, we no haffi have image
Score like scrimmage inna any gyal village
Fuck dem wicked and squeeze out liquid
Sharp shooter like big lip bigot
Haffi live twice fi do things that they did
TJ, tell dem we're wild and wicked

Royalty, inna mi bloodline
Dead soldiers yell on these frontlines
Don't know why, know why but demons come to test us sometimes
In my scheme from longtime
Defeat where you're confined
