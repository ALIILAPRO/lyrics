		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah more than me (more than me, more than me)
Just like me, everybody wanna be (just like me, just like me)
My next move everybody wanna see (wanna see, wanna see)
Been lonely is making wanna, they tryna be more than me

Yeah I have been coming
And my story be shocking
Went from nothing to something o
Now my phone they be calling o yeah
This shit ain't be funny
Back then when they ignore me
She be acting like she for me
Now my phone she be calling yeah

I have been coming
And my story is shocking
Went from nothing to something o
Now my phone they be calling o yeah
This shit ain't be funny
Back then when they ignore me
She be acting like she for me
Now my phone she be calling yeah

For sure
They tryna be me for sure o
Straight out of Benin for sure o
They gonna feel me for sure o
Put me on repeat for sure o

Feel me for sure they ma feeling me
Plenty enemies wanna killy me
But my eye don see many many things, yeah
Now all them wanna chill with me

All this commotion there tryna cause
You came from dust, and you going back to dust
Nor dey form for me so girl nor dey form
Cause having been going places
Since I was born, ah, since I was born
I be only president from where I come from
So girl nor dey form, so girl nor dey form
Nor go give you less I'ma give you more

More than me (more than me, more than me)
Just like me, everybody wanna be (just like me, just like me)
My next move everybody wanna see (wanna see, wanna see)
Been lonely is making wanna, they tryna be more than me

I have been coming
And my story is shocking
Went from nothing to something o
Now my phone they be calling o yeah
This shit ain't be funny
Back then when they ignore me
She be acting like she for me
Now my phone she be calling yeah

I have been coming
And my story be shocking
Went from nothing to something o
Now my phone they be calling o yeah
