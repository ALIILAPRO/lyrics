Call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, my love

Call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Way too stuck up to be a slut, I need you to call me
I'm too rich, yeah, to give a fuck so I need you to call me
I ain't readin' all these texts, baby, you need to call me
I ain't never thought I'd fall in love and your love surroundin' me
Anytime I think 'bout fuckin' I feel you around me
Every time I see your texts, them words arousin' me (yeah)
We both crazy, baby, I know that you want all of me (let's go)
I gotta take a break from Percs, baby, so you can have all of me

Puttin' my soul inside this song, my demons callin' me
I know you wrapped 'round my finger but I still want company
I gotta go and hit the road, baby, 'cause this money callin' me (callin' me)
To be honest, I don't really wanna do it, but these agents callin' me
Yeah, after I go on tour, are you still gon' love on me?
After I showed you the world, are you still gon' love on me?
I already told you that you my girl, you gotta put your trust in me, baby
I ain't never felt no love like this so I let it control on me, lil' baby
Yeah, I won't pass away
Fell in love tomorrow, yeah, I feel a way
I don't want you to go, baby, need you to stay (stay)
All my demons callin', baby, can we pray?
Yeah, you thought I was here, I'm on a realer state
Yeah, went and bought the Tonka, took it out of state
Yeah, goin' state to state, I'm chillin' with my bae
Yeah, fell in love tomorrow, fell in love today
Yeah, I don't know what to do when we makin' mistakes
Yeah, fell in love with these riches, fell in love with my bitch
I can't trust nobody, put no trust in no snitch
Fell in love with the world, just for the way it is
And I fell in love, I want you to get off all of that
Walked inside the buildin', I can't zip that backpack
You say you fell in love then you can't tell me all of that
Every time that we make love, I know you wantin' all of that
Had to take a break from these Percs, baby, I give you all of that
I can't be wastin' no time, lil' bitch, I give you all of me
All that means is you need to just sit back and call on me (call on me)

Call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Yeah, call me, yeah, you need to call me (call on me)
Way too stuck up to be a slut, I need you to call me
I'm too rich, yeah, to give a fuck so I need you to call me
I ain't readin' all these texts, baby, you need to call me
I ain't never thought I'd fall in love and your love surroundin' me
Anytime I think 'bout fuckin' I feel you around me
Every time I see your texts, them words arousin' me
We both crazy, baby, I know that you want all of me (let's go)
I gotta take a break from Percs, baby, so you can have all of me
