		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never met a woman
who could make me feel the way you do.
'Cause when I look into your eyes,
you don't know what I'm going through.

I was looking for someone to turn to,
something I'd never had before.
And then you came into my life,
now I can open any door.

Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.

I never met a girl before
who could understand a man like me.
'Cause when I hold you in my arms,
I just know that this was meant to be.

I was looking for some understanding,
something I'd never had before.
And then you came into my life,
now I can open any door.

Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.

Once in a lifetime.
Just once in a lifetime.
Once in a lifetime.

I was looking for someone to turn to,
something I'd never had before.
And then you came into my life,
now I can open any door.

Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.
Once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.

Once in a lifetime
that I could ever find someone like you.
Just once in a lifetime
I could ever find someone like you.

Once in a lifetime.
Once in a lifetime.
Once in a lifetime.
Once in a lifetime.
