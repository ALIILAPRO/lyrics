		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes, every weekend, the same party
I never go alone and I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads but they all lead back to you

'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was, we never saw it comin'
Not tryin' to fall in love, but we did like children runnin'
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts

But don't forget about the night out in L.A.
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
"Do you know how much I miss you?"

I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
I miss you like it was the very first night

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

(Take) take me away, (take) take me away
(Take) take me away to you, to you
(Take) take me away, (take) take me away
(Take) take me away to you, to you
