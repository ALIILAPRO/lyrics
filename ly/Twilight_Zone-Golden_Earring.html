		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere in a lonely hotel room there's a guy
Starting to realize that eternal fate has turned its back on him
It's two A.M.

It's two A.M. (It's two A.M.)
Fear is gone (fear is gone)
I'm sitting here waiting
The Gun still warm (the gun still warm)
Maybe my connection is tired of taking chances

Yeah, there's a storm on the loose
Sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cold
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far? (Oh oh oh)

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being alone
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

I'm fallin' down a spiral, destination unknown
Double crossed messenger, all alone
Can't get no connection, can't get through 
Where are you?

Well the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hitman comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says
Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cold
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far? (Oh oh oh)

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being alone
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being cold
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far? (Oh oh oh)

Help, I'm steppin' into the twilight zone
Place is a madhouse, feels like being alone
My beacon's been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go now that I've gone too far?

So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
So you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
When the bullet hits the bone
