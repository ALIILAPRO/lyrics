		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Evening rises, darkness threatens to engulf us all
But there's a moon above it's shining and I think I hear a call
It's just a whisper through the trees, my ears can hardly make it out
But I can hear it in my heart, vibrating strong as if she shouts

Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my head
I came here like you asked, I killed the beast, that part of me is dead
Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my head
If only I'd have listened to you when you offered me that thread

Everything is quiet and I'm not exactly sure
If it really was your voice I heard or maybe it is a door
That's closing up some hero's back on his track to be a man
Can it be that all us heroes have a path, but not a plan?

Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my mind
I wish I had that string, it's so damn dark, I think I'm going blind
Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my mind
For the life of me, I don't remember what I came to find

Now tell me, princess, are you strolling through your sacred grove?
And is the moon still shining? You're the only thing I'm thinking of
The sword you gave me, it was heavy, I just had to lay it down
It's funny how defenseless I can feel here when there's nobody around

Oh Ariadne, I am coming, I just need to work this maze inside my heart
I was blind, I thought you'd bind me, but you offered me a chart
Oh Ariadne, I just need to work this maze inside my heart
If I'd known that you could guide me, I'd have listened from the start

Somewhere up there midnight strikes, I think I hear the fall
Of little drops of water, magnified against the barren wall
It's more a feeling than a substance, but there's nobody around
And when I'm in here all alone, it's just enough to let me drown

Oh Ariadne, I was coming, but I failed you in this labyrinth of my past
Oh Ariadne, let me sing you and we'll make each other last
Oh Ariadne, I have failed you in this labyrinth of my past
Oh Ariadne, let me sing you and we'll make each other last
