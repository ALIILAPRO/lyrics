		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save your breath
Don't you break your neck
I'm seeing signs inside my head
A car crash in the woods
I'm saving things that I think you'll need
On and on until you bleed
Could I be imagining worse things?
Take me for granted and a sin

I'll be in on it, on it, on it, be in on it
Feeling all this energy
Call me up when you feel sick
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

I haven't been eating much this week
Eating's for the strong, sleeps for the weak
Falling in the same routine I see

I'll be in on it, on it, on it, be in on it
Feeling all this energy
Call me up when you feel sick
I'll be in on it, on it, on it

Don't touch me
I feel hurt when you leave
Nobody could understand what this does to me

And I know just what I need
Autumn leaves and fallen trees
To feel the cold beneath my feet

I'll be in on it, on it, on it, I'll be in on it
Feeling all this energy
Call me up when you feel sick
I'll be in on it, on it, on it
On it
On it
On it
