		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The pop wars, temp rises, a hot boy
It's the fat boy, skinny ties
Don't empty mine nigga
Tall ceilings, chandeliers, I'm authentic
Gettin' long money, short winded
Let's go and get it nigga
Bang bang, bitch niggas caught drinkin' chase
Roll that double M, get shot and your finger waves
Twenty chickens watchin' and I still be movin' that base
Gave a job to the children you scared to raise
Chain swangin', name rangin'
Shots fired, same nigga
We movin' weight I'm at a different pace
I'm out in Ha√Øti with my lady screamin' "n'ap boule"
I'm hard to kill, Dade county, Versace Neil
Fourteen for that tattoo worth that dollar bill
Only one man got the combination to the safe
Grammy nominated once, but I'm still moving base

See them plaques on a nigga wall
We still movin' bass
Got them records jumpin' off the store
We still movin' bass
Copper tried to knock us off
We still movin' bass
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door
And we still movin' bass

And we still movin'
And we still movin'
And we still movin' bass

Fallin' from the sky, the money bad the bigger
Angels tatted all on me, pray for a lord sinner
Rolls Royce Corniche, sweepin' me off my feet
New bitches they by the fleet and we do em' all by the week
Taz Angels just wanna chill, jewelers just wanna meet
Weed man expensive, three trips a week
Misses just wanna freak, feds stay up the street
Know they tailin' us close so we leak what we wanna leak
New mob, suit sharp, my suit Farrahkhan
In the house of the lord, my niggas bearin' arms
His eyes wide, nose runny got what he fiendin' for
I'm movin' base, we outta state you know my speakers low
Put the pistol to your mouth now show me to the safe
Grammy nominated once, but I'm still movin' bass

See them plaques on a nigga wall
We still movin' bass
Got them records jumpin' off the store
We still movin' bass
Copper tried to knock us off
We still movin' bass
Haters throwin' shots through a niggas door
And we still movin' bass

And we still movin'
And we still movin'
And we still movin' bass
And we still movin' bass
And we still movin' bass
