		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something pulling me away
Something criminal, but I can't fight it
Won't you tell me what to say?
Or pull me in and keep me nice and quiet

Keep me here
Closer in the clear
Just kill the noise, won't you fill my void?
Give it all up, won't you feed my senses?

You know you love it
You love it when I need you
Do you need me? Yeah
You know I love it
I love it when you feed me
Yet you leave me begging for more

I feel it slowly creeping in
I find desire leaves me frozen, stranded
Waiting between what could've been
Why am I sinking when I'm fully grounded?

Standing still
Go in ior the kill
Just kill the noise, won't you fill my void?
Give it all up, won't you feed my senses?

You know you love it
You love it when I need you
Do you need me? Yeah
You know I love it
I love it when you feed me
Yet you leave me begging for more

(Keep me here)
(In the clear)
I want it and you know it (keep me here)
Starved but never show it (in the clear)
You like it when I'm broken (keep me here)
You like it when I'm broken (in the clear)

You know you love it
You love it when I need you
Do you need me? Yeah
You know you love it
You love it when I need you
Do you need me? Yeah
You know I love it
I love it when you feed me
Yet you leave me begging for more

You know I love it
I love it when you feed me
Yet you leave me begging for more
