		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, welcome to Candy Land
Dance in the mirror, I'm Candy Man
Record that ass, I'm a cameraman
Work that pussy, I'm a handyman
Take two of these, call me in the morning
With YG, so the B's is swarming
Bitch, don't act like you important
She got headline pussy, I'm just supportin'

Ayy, I met her at Coachella (yeah)
I told that bitch whatever (haha)
I told that bitch whatever (yeah)
Yeah, bitch, I'm with whatever (haha)
Ayy, I'm with whatever (I'm is)
Ayy, I get whatever (is)
I can get whatever (is)
I think her friend is better

I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin'
I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', shroomin' (ayy, bitch, I'm with whatever)
I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin'
I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', shroomin' (ayy, I'm with whatever)

I gave that bitch a Perc'
She got naked, had to give her my shirt
I gave that bitch the work
7-Eleven how she gave me-
I met that bitch on MySpace
We still be fuckin', life's great
She played with toys that vibrate
That's that shit that I hate
Goin' up, goin' Scotty
Hundred bad bitches in the hotel lobby
Flat-booty hoes and hoes that got body
We got all types and got molly
Ass up, face down, that's the motto
Ass up, face down, on the low-low
Gave her the shrooms, she goin' loco
The drugs got her in go mode

Ayy, I met her at Coachella (yeah)
I told that bitch whatever (haha)
I told that bitch whatever (yeah)
Yeah, bitch, I'm with whatever (haha)
Ayy, I'm with whatever (I'm is)
Ayy, I get whatever (is)
I can get whatever (is)
I think her friend is better

I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin'
I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', shroomin' (ayy, bitch, I'm with whatever)
I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin'
I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', I'm shroomin', shroomin' (ayy, I'm with whatever)

Ayy, bitch, I'm with whatever
Ayy, I'm with whatever
I met her at Coachella
