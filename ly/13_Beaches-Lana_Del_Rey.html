		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't belong in the world
But that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn
There's something blocking my escape

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally it's mine
With dripping peaches
I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

But I still get lonely
And baby only then
Do I let myself recline?
Can I let go?
And let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying 
For something real
But I've been dying for something real

It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally I'm fine
Past Ventura
And lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

But you can still find me
If you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies
Feeling hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying 
For something real
But I've been dying for something real

It hurts to love you
But I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying
If I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal
