		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me whose side you're on
Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

You have some nerve showing your face here
It had been so long
I thought you disappeared
Why'd you pretend that we're still so close?
It was all too clear
We need love most

But damn girl, since you've come around
Girl, I need to know right now
So won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, felt the chance that maybe
You could become my baby
If you just
Tell me whose side you're on

Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side you're on

It's been so long since I heard your name
I was losing hope, that you felt the same
And it's been so long since I've seen your face
That in my own mind, I had been replaced

But damn girl, since you've come around
Girl, I need to know right now
So won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, felt the chance that maybe
You could become my baby
If you just
(Tell me whose side you're on)

Tell me whose side you're on
You're on, you're on
Tell me whose side

Damn girl, since you've come around
Girl, I need to know right now
So won't you just
Tell me whose side you're on
Lately, felt the chance that maybe
You could become my baby
If you just
Tell me whose side (you're on)
