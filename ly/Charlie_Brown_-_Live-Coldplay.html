		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
I saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smashed my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark
We'll be glowing in the dark

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All that matters that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a-spinning goes

We'll run riot 
We'll be glowing in the dark

Ooh ooh ooh
So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark
