		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Diamond life lover boy
He move in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
When sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo
Love for sale

Face-to-face, each classic case
We shadow box and double cross
Yet need the chase

A license to love, insurance to hold
Melts all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels but his heart is cold

No need to ask, he's a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast to coast, L.A. to Chicago
Western male
Across the North and South, to Key Largo
Love for sale

Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
