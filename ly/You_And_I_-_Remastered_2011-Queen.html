		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering my heart's jittering
Just you and I
Not tonight come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright (sunny and bright)
No no no come tomorrow 'cause then
We'll be waiting in the moonlight

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight
Oh, laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay awhile

Ooh, you know I never could foresee the future years (doo, doo roo, doo, roo, doo, roo, doo, roo)
You know I never could see 
Where life was leading me (doo, doo roo, doo, roo, doo, roo, doo, roo)
But will we be together forever (forever)
What will be my love
Can't you see that I just don't know, don't know (ooh)

No, not tonight, not tomorrow
Everything's gonna be alright (sunny and bright)
Wait and see if tomorrow we'll be
As happy as we're feeling tonight
We'll go walking in the moonlight (we'll be happy)
Walking in the moonlight

Oh, I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where we lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight (just you and I) 
Ooh, just you and I

Just you and I
Can't you see that we've gotta be together
Be together just you and I, just you and I
No more questions just you and I
