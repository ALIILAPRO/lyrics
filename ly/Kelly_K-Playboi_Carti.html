		  And I only fuck with thick hoes
White hoe, let's go, that's my type though
White hoe, let's go, white hoes
And I only fuck with

And I only fuck with rich hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes

She just need a nigga oh with a check though
Moving too slow move to the left hoe

Hurry up, we hoppin' on this jet though
And I only fuck with thick hoe
I'm a skinny nigga you see these tight clothes
Piped up, yeah I'm piped hoe
Come and get piped for the night hoe
Designer drugs and I need some ice hoe
A lot of hoes yeah I need some condoms
Fuckin' with young Carti you'll get high hoe
You riding too slow, are you high hoe
Are you high hoe
Come and sip some drank pop some pills, come get high hoe
We been on a jet, we so high, we on fly mode
I be flexing on these niggas, pop, but they pop mode
With my eyes closed
I'm on Bang Bros
I got hella hoes, I got hella hoes
Got that nasty flow

And I only fuck rich hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes
White hoe, let's go
White hoe, let's go
And I only fuck with thick hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes
Black hoe, let's go
Black hoe, let's go

Hoe I'm flexed up
Lookin' like who next up, called your face up
I just got my check up, got my cash up
You can't get no check 'cause, get your bands up
Face down, ass up
Walk around the club with your hands up
Walk around the club I'm no dancer
Keep that pole on me, I might just blam yah
Keep that pole on me I told the man up
Walk inside that bit I made 'em stand up
I'm a walkin' lick bitch where your camera
She want that whole thing I give her sample
The way I stole that bitch, like where your man go
Fuckin' on this bitch inside the bando
Suckin' on this dick they use no hands though
I just turned this bitch into my main hoe

And I only fuck rich hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes
White hoe, let's go
White hoe, let's go
And I only fuck with thick hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes
Black hoe, let's go
Black hoe, let's go

And I only fuck rich hoes
And I only fuck with thick hoes
White hoe, let's go
White hoe, let's go
And I only fuck with thick hoe
And I only fuck with thick hoes
Black hoe, let's go
Black hoe, let's go

Yeah my main hoe, take that dirty money hoe
To the bank hoe
First you flip a birdy hoe, make a name hoe
I go seven-thirty hoe
On the drank hoe (Ooh, lean)
I'm like what you drank, hoe?
I pour up that pink hoe, Easter Pink though
All up in my Styrofoam, I'm on lean hoe
She say she so lonely doe
Lean on me hoe
I might give your bitch the bone, not no leash, hoe
I just want lil' dome, from a free hoe
I ain't with the cuffin' hoe, that ain't me hoe
I just like to press a hoe, like that me hoe
Feelin' in yo chest hoe, that's OG hoe
Think I need a G4, this for me hoe
Designer shit, no cheap clothes
You a thief hoe
I throw out the bank roll
Let that thang go
(Yah)
