		<p>
		  Want to catch me? Want to catch me?
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Want to catch me? Want to catch me?
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Don't stop, don't stop
PinkPanther, PinkPanther
PinkPanther, PinkPanther
PinkPanther, Pink-PinkPanther, Pink

You got me runnin' 'round the country, I'm tryna find you (want to catch me?)
I need a girl I can relate to and confide to (want to catch me?)
See me dealin' with my mom, will you help me do it? (Go on, go on)
Heads up, stand tough, girl, you made me do it (go on, go on)
I can hide you in the mansion, might lock the bedroom (want to catch me?)
Killstreaks, killstreaks, when I need some leg room (want to catch me?)
Introduce you to the homies, you ain't know 'em (go on, go on)
On the flight back to Paris, I gotta show 'em (go on, go on)

Baby, did I make you proud?
I know I'm hard to handle
I'ma come break you down
Even if you don't do scandals
Pick you up and down (up and down), scandals
Pick you up and down (up and down), scandals

Killstreaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right (want to catch me?)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)
Killstreak, killstreak, night (go on, go on)

Stand tall (don't stop, oh, don't stop)
Stand up (oh)
Say it loud (oh, oh, oh)

Remember when you came to town? (Town)
I'm ready for you to lay it down (down)
On a whole new way to get lost around you ('round)
And I can't get help, I'm so down by myself (baby, yeah)

Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreaks, killstreaks, right
Killstreak, killstreak, night
Killstreak, killstreak, night

Take a look in front of me
Take a look in front of me
Take a look in front of me
Crash my car in front of me
Take a look in front of me
Take a look in front of me
Take a look in front of me
Crash my car in front of me

You ain't gotta buy the time for emotionals (don't stop, no)
You in the books just to see a new perspective, whoa (don't stop, woah)
Me, I spent a lot of time in the gutter, dawg (don't stop, gutter, dawg)
I'm a cutthroat freak, don't hit it, though (don't stop, hit it, though)
Let's take a walk around Fremont Road, dawg (don't stop, road, dawg)
All these niggas out here sellin' they soul, dawg (don't stop, soul, dawg)
Are you really here for me, are you my road dawg? (Don't stop, road dawg)
I don't want another woman, this ain't roll call (don't stop, roll call)
And I see the good relationship with your mama (don't stop)
Educated, Harvard baby and your honored (don't stop)
And I know the good morals on your socials
First Lady, President, you in the Oval
I'm at the O2, I'm goin' postal (don't stop)
You on the side stage, I had to show you (don't stop)
They told you I was next up, what I told you?
I had to fall back just to get to know you

Take a look in front of me (want to catch me?)
Take a look in front of me (want to catch me?)
Take a look in front of me (want to catch me?)
Crash my car in front of me (want to catch me?)
Take a look in front of me (want to catch me?)
Take a look in front of me (want to catch me?)
Take a look in front of me (go on, go on)
Crash my car in front of me (want to catch me?)
