		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "America, America has a problem"

Heard you got that D for me
Pray your love is deep for me
I'ma make you go weak for me
Make you wait a whole week for me (for me)
I see you watchin' (fiendin')
I know you want it (schemin')
I know you need it (drug lord)
You want it on you? (Don't I know)
You need love, I need some too
Do you want this like it wants you?

Know that booty gon' do what it want to
Can't hit it one time, multiple
I know you see these racks, racks, racks on me
Now come and get high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
Twenty-forty-eighty out the trap
Hit it with the rap, put it on the map 
Then we right back (back, back, back)
Call me when you wanna get high-igh-igh-igh
Tony Montana with the racks
Ivy P on my bag, double G's on my dash
Nigga, I'm bad, I'm bad (tell me when you wanna get high-igh-igh-igh)

Boy, you can't get no higher than this
No
'Cause love don't get no higher than this
No, no

Grind (grind)
Boy, you know I grind (grind)
When I pull up these jeans, you're mine 
(When I pull up these jeans, you're mine)
You're mine (you're mine, you're mine)
When I step on the scene they
Can't wait to back it up
Your ex-dealer dope, but it ain't crack enough
I'm supplyin' my man
I'm in demand soon as a I land
Just know I roll with them goons (goons)
In case you start actin' familiar
This kind of love, big business
Whole slab, I kill for

Boy, you can't get no higher than this
No
'Cause love don't get no higher than this
No, no

Grind (grind)
Boy, you know I grind (grind)
When I pull up these jeans, you're mine 
(When I pull up these jeans, you're mine)
You're mine (you're mine, you're mine)
When I step on the scene they
Can't wait to back it up
Your ex-dealer dope, but it ain't crack enough
I'm supplyin' my man
I'm in demand soon as a I land
Just know I roll with them goons (goons)
In case you start actin' familiar
This kind of love, big business
Whole slab, I kill for

Know that booty gon' do what it want to
Can't hit it one time, multiple
I know you see these racks, racks, racks on me
Now come and get high-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh
Twenty-forty-eighty out the trap
Hit it with the rap, put it on the map 
Then we right back (back, back, back)
Call me when you wanna get high-igh-igh-igh
Tony Montana with the racks
Double C's on my bag, double G's on my dash
Nigga, I'm bad, I'm bad (tell me when you wanna get high-igh-igh-igh)
