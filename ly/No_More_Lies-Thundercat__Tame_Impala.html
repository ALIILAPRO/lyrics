		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sorry girl, didn't mean to drag you in my dreams
Baby, no more lies
Feeling free, that's the way it's supposed to be
For you and me
You and I both know it's harder than it seems
Love is a two-way street
I'm letting go because the both of us don't need to drive
Baby, it's one at a time

That's just the way it works or you and I keep getting hurt
We're gonna lose control of the wheel
So put your seatbelt on, I think we're about to crash
In a world of pain
There's so much work to do
So much to unpack
But it's not your fault
I'm just kind of ass

It's lookin' like I won't be home for another year
Long left undone
'Cause I might just drift on out of here
On the run

I'll just be on my own, I'll just be home alone
My troubles are my own, unless she wants to come back
I'll just be on my own (yeah), I'm dancin' on my own
I'll just stay on my own (unless she wants to), unless she wants to come back

Yeah
Yeah

As you go out in the world
Don't look back to move forward, there's no time in our lives
As you know
There's something wrong in your mind (in your mind)
If you think there's no pain in my heart to say goodbye
Please don't cry, I'm letting go

I'll just be on my own, I'll just stay home alone
My troubles are my own, unless she wants to come back
I'll just be on my own (yeah), I'm dancin' on my own
I'll just stay on my own (unless she wants to), unless she wants to come back

I mean, my longest relationship was like, seven years
And she, she was fine (yeah, yeah)
But all you need to know is after one or two years with you
If, either way it goes
My therapist told me that I should tell you the truth
And you're
But you're still angry
So sometimes I'm still like, I still should've lied
I tell you the truth because I care
But I also lie to you because I care
But if I tell you the truth, I guess I can sleep better at night?
But then it looks like I don't care because I'm telling you the truth
I mean, I
I guess I'm just not a
Everybody hates when they get to that part when they realize that
I don't wanna tell you I don't care but if it seems like I don't care
It doesn't mean I don't care, it just looks like I don't care
Because my emotions have been sanded off
I live in LA, sweetie, what do you expect?
