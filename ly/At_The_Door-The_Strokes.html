		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't escape it
Never gonna make it
Out of this in time
I guess that's just fine
I'm not there quite yet
My thoughts, such a mess
Like a little boy
What you running for?

Arrive at the door 
Anyone home?
Have I lost it all?

Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holding out the night
Lonely after light
You begged me not to go
Sinking like a stone
Use me like an oar
And get yourself to shore

Bang at the door
Anyone home?
It's just what they do
Right in front of you
Like a cannonball
Slamming through your wall
In their face I saw
What they're fighting for
I can't escape it
I'm never gonna make it to the end, I guess

Struck me like a chord
I'm an ugly boy
Holdin' out the night
Lonely after light
Banging on the door
I don't want to know
Sinking like a stone
So use me like an oar

Hard to fight what I can't see
Not trying to build no dynasty
I can't see beyond this wall
But we lost this game
So many times before

I been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
I been on a cold road
I'll be waiting, yeah
I'll be waiting from the other side
Waiting for the tide to rise
