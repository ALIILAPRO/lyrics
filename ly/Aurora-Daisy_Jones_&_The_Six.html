		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You found me in flames
It's the daylight of change
Baby, all that stuff is done
You're my morning sun
Aurora, you're, you're my morning sun

When I was away
You called from a fever dream
The crazy ways are done
You're my morning sun
Aurora, you're my morning sun

I kinda think I wanna make it last forever
(Oh, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever)
Mm, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever
(Oh, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever)
Mm, I kinda think I wanna make it last forever
(Oh, I kinda think I wanna make it)

Aurora, I'm here
I won't disappear again
How soon can you come?
Oh, you're my morning sun
Aurora, you are, you're my morning sun
Aurora, you are

Where did you turn (where did you turn)
When you needed tin mints?
When you reached out for my touch (when you reached out for my touch)
And I couldn't give you much?
Of all the time we lost (of all the time we lost)
While I was runnin' from your life (I was running from your life)
To the shadows of the west (to the shadows of the west)
Strung out on the lies (strung out on the lies)
With my tongue out of my mind (tongue out of my mind)
And before they come around (and before they come around)

I kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
(I kinda thought the night was gonna last forever)
Mm, I kinda thought the night was gonna last forever
(I kinda thought the night was gonna last forever)
Mm, I kinda thought the night was gonna last forever
(I kinda thought the night was gonna last forever)
I kinda thought the night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought the night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought that night was gonna last forever
Kinda thought
