		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Ayy, oh yeah

Hope you see
It won't mean a thing to me
I've been doing this too long
Baby girl, I've felt it all (ooh)
So watch out
If you try to play your luck (ooh)
Ain't nobody gonna care enough (ooh)
To catch you fall

So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I swear I'm just a bird
Girl, I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me, oh

God, you tried
You tried to warn me
But, baby, I'm warning you
Girl, I'll show you
This is no game
You'll be falling to a point of no return
No return

Don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love
I'm just a bird (oh)
Girl, I'm just another bird (ooh)
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Nobody needs to fall in love (oh)

I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie
I know it's got a hold on you
I know you're rolling with it, baby, don't you lie, baby
I know you're rolling hard with it, don't lie
I know it's got a hold on you
I know you're rolling with it, baby, don't you lie, baby

So don't you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
'Cause, girl, I'm just a bird (ooh, woah)
Girl, I'm just another bird (ooh, woah)
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me
Like me
