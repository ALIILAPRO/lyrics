		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't ease the pain, it hurts to breathe
Got a rock on my chest, won't let me speak

I'm in a low tide, but I know I'll go up
Tho it might seem, like things don't add up
The night is gone and the sun is up again

Memories replaying in my head
They take me back to words I said
Don't we all deserve a second chance

I burned all the bridges
I burned all the ships
I'm so tainted, so faded, outta the picture, I'm so gone
I'm closer to the stars, I've strayed too far from home

I burned all the bridges
I burned all the ships
I'm so tainted, so faded, outta the picture, I'm so gone
I'm closer to the stars, I've strayed too far from home

I gotta go back to my roots
Now that I've paid all my dues
Don't matter if I win or lose
I gotta find my own, gotta find my own

I gotta go back to my roots
Now that I've paid all my dues
Don't matter if I win or lose
Farkındayım, farkındayım

I can't change my ways to fit the mould
I can't feel warm inside when my world is so cold

I'm in a low tide, but I know I'll go up
Tho it might seem, like things don't add up
The night is gone and the sun is up again

Memories replaying in my head
They take me back to words I said
Don't we all deserve a second chance

I gotta go back to my roots
Now that I've paid all my dues
Don't matter if I win or lose
I gotta find my own, gotta find my own

I gotta go back to my roots
Now that I've paid all my dues
Don't matter if I win or lose
Farkındayım, farkındayım

Kazanmalı kaybetmeliyim
Aşk uğruna harp etmeliyim
Bu kızı yeniden büyütmeliyim
Farkındayım, farkındayım

Kazanmalı kaybetmeliyim
Aşk uğruna harp etmeliyim
Bu kızı yeniden büyütmeliyim
Farkındayım, farkındayım
