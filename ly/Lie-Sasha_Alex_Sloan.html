		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sleep on the couch again
Even though you took it for the weekend
Kiss me like you wanna stay
Even though you're thinking about leaving

Please just fake it
But turn to look when I'm naked
Don't be honest
Promise me that you want this
Say you're lucky
Say you're lucky to love me
Like you used to 
Even if it isn't true
 
I want you to lie, lie
Lie to my face
I want you to put your hands on my waist
Can we just dance 'til the sky's awake
'Cause I really can't get my heart broken tonight
 
I want you to show me there's a future here
Even if we've never really seen it
Tell me when you close your eyes, I'm all you see 
Even if you're not dreamin'
 
Please just fake it
But turn to look when I'm naked
Don't be honest
Promise me that you want this
Say you're lucky
Say you're lucky to love me
Like you used to
Even if it isn't true

I want you to lie, lie
Lie to my face
I want you to put your hands on my waist
Can we just dance 'til the sky's awake
'Cause I really can't get my heart broken tonight
 
I want you to
Touch me like you did in the beginning
Baby, just give me another day
Touch me like there isn't something missing
'Cause even if you don't stay
 
I want you to lie, lie
Lie to my face
I want you to put your hands on my waist
Can we just dance 'til the sky's awake
'Cause I really can't get my heart broken tonight

I want you to lie, lie
Lie to my face
I want you to put your hands on my waist
Can we just dance 'til the sky's awake
'Cause I really can't get my heart broken tonight
 
I want you to
Touch me like you did in the beginning
Baby, just give me another day, hmm, hmm
Touch me like there isn't something missing
'Cause even if you don't stay
 
I want you to, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
