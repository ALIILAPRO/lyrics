		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing
Her father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music
Her father promised her
Her father promised her

You were once my one companion
You were all that mattered
You were once a friend and father
Then my world was shattered

Wishing you were somehow here again
Wishing you were somehow near
Sometimes it seemed, if I just dreamed
Somehow you would be here

Wishing I could hear your voice again
Knowing that I never would
Dreaming of you won't help me to do
All that you dreamed I could

Passing bells and sculpted angels
Cold and monumental
Seem, for you, the wrong companions
You were warm and gentle

Too many years
Fighting back tears
Why can't the past
Just die?

Wishing you were somehow here again
Knowing we must say goodbye
Try to forgive, teach me to live
Give me the strength to try

No more memories, no more silent tears
No more gazing across the wasted years
Help me say goodbye
