		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh 
Yeah, yeah

I'm in the mood for dancin', romancin'
Ooh I'm givin' it all tonight
I'm in the mood for chancin'
I feel like dancin'
Ooh so come on and hold me tight

Dancin', I'm in the mood babe
So let the music play
Ooh I'm dancin', I'm in the groove babe
So get on up and let your body sway

I'm in the mood for dancin', romancin'
You know I shan't ever stop tonight
I'm in the mood for chancin'
I feel like dancin'
Ooh from head to my toes and 
Take me again
And heaven who knows
Just where it will end

So dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
Dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance

I'm in the mood for dancin', romancin'
Ooh I'm givin' it all tonight
I'm in the mood for chancin'
I feel like dancin'
Ooh so come on and hold me tight

Dancin', just feel the beat babe
That's all you've gotta do
I can't stop dancin'
So move your feet babe 
'Cause honey when I get up close to you

I'm in the mood for dancin', romancin'
You know I shan't ever stop tonight
I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood to dance
Yeah let's dance, come on and dance

I'm in the mood, so baby dance 
Yeah let's dance, come on and dance
I'm in the mood to take a chance
Dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
Get on your feet now baby, dance
Dance, yeah let's dance, come on and dance
