		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm happy for you
I'm smiling for you
I'd do anything
For you, for you
It's always for you
And never for me
And I need it to stop
So let me tell you, please

I'm always sad
And I'm always lonely
But I can't tell you
That I'm breaking slowly

Closed doors
Locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden
There is no ease
I need it to stop
And I want to be able
To open up but
My feelings are fatal
My feelings are fatal

How many times must I keep it inside?
I need to let go and I swear that I've tried
But opening up means trusting others
And that's just too much, I don't want to bother
So I'll keep it inside and I'll bury it deep
I know it's not healthy, but you won't hear a peep
Though I'm always sad and I'm always lonely
I could never tell you that I'm breaking slowly

Closed doors
Locked in, no keys
Keeping my feelings hidden
There is no ease
I need it to stop
And I want to be able
To open up but
My feelings are fatal, oh, oh, oh
My feelings are fatal, oh, oh, oh
My feelings are fatal, oh, oh, oh
