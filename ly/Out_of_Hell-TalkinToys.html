		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your lover is dead 
He's empty inside 
Got no love to give 
Got no strength to fight 
Can't do it again 
There's too many lies 
So you better wake up 
There's no you and i

It took me so long 
To forgive myself 
cnd one thousand song 
To get out of hell 

It took me so long 
To forgive myself 
cnd one thousand song 
To get out of hell

I'm breathing again 
I'm closing the doors 
I payed for my sin 
Now you pay for yours
(you pay for yours)

It took me so long 
To forgive myself 
cnd one thousand song 
To get out of hell

Out of hell
Out of hell
Out of hell

I'm Out of hell
Out of hell
Out of hell

It took me so long 
To forgive myself 
cnd one thousand song 
To get out of hell
