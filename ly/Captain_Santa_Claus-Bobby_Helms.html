		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Santa's got a brand new helper, you're the first one to be told.
He wears a hat that's trimmed with fur and his boots are made of gold.
His name is Christy Christmas, he's cute as he can be.
He's made of wood cause Santa carved him from a Christmas tree

Christy Christmas is loading Santa's sleigh
He'll hitch up all the reindeer and will soon be on their way
Christy Christmas is Santa's pride and joy
He picks out all the presents fro each little girl and boy

Perhaps you'll get a toyland playground full of skates and kiddy cars
It has a great big slide for you to ride and swings that hang from stars 
Christy Christmas will make your dreams come true
And you'll love Christy Christmas just as much as he loves you

Christy Christmas will bring you pretty toys
Like talkin dolls for little girls and choo choo trains for boys
Christy Christmas will serve good things to eat
He'll give your little tummy tum a cake and candy treat.

Before you go to bed this Christmas
Better leave a snack or two
There will be someone else with Santa 
When he comes to visit you 
Christy Christmas they'll make into a toy
And all you children soon can play with Santa's little boy.
