		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah (alright), oh
Yeah, yeah, oh (alright)
Yeah, yeah, oh

I don't know if it's you, I could tell the truth
I'm not in the mood, yeah (yeah)
Tell me how you feel, tell me if it's real, but that's nothin' new, yeah, on God
Bring that shit together, I could be the glue, I could be the tool 
Now you tryna run the show, tryna be my main, but you number two, yeah, woah
Every time they went and tried or somethin'
It's a man down, man down, man down
Better not bring your lil' ho around 
'Cause she fanned out, fanned out, fanned out
I don't know where I would be today if I never went and took a chance now
But I know I had it planned out, still goin', we not even here now

Bitch, I be on my own shit
Yeah, bitch, I be on my own time
Oh, that's your shawty? Then how we still linkin'?
How come I hit that shit both times?
Askin' me questions, "Tec, you really want me?"
Keep it a buck, I'm like "No, why?"
Baby, I'm not one of those guys
I need the guap and that soul tied
Yeah, see those, costed me couple Gs
C-notes to see me on the scene
You gettin' taxed if you not on the team
I do the most, but it's showin' a fee
It probably take a lot to tolerate me
It's obvious, they love to change with the seasons
Only one life, I got only one reason
Said I do it, bitch, I'm doin' it, beastin'

I don't know if it's you, I could tell the truth
I'm not in the mood, yeah (yeah)
Tell me how you feel, tell me if it's real, but that's nothin' new, yeah, on God
Bring that shit together, I could be the glue, I could be the tool 
Now you tryna run the show, tryna be my main, but you number two, yeah, woah
Every time they went and tried or somethin'
It's a man down, man down, man down
Better not bring your lil' ho around 
'Cause she fanned out, fanned out, fanned out
I don't know where I would be today if I never went and took a chance now
But I know I had it planned out, still goin', we not even here now

They're 'bout to play my song
They're 'bout to play my song
