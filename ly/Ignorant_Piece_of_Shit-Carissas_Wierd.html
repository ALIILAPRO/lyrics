		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking right around you
And how will i know
When you'll decide to jump
Jump out of a window
Falling faster i can imagine
The way you'd roll your eyes
Before you hit the ground
Telling everyone you know
Maybe i'll be bad for you
Maybe you're too good for me
Everyone is getting screwed
Well if the shoe fits then put it on
Wear it like a crown
I cant believe you called just to say
That you were coming down
I like the way you rolled your eyes
Right before you fall down
On bended knee
Will you marry me
And on November 16
Everything was buried down
