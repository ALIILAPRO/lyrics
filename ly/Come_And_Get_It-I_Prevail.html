		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every single time I turn around, my name is in your mouth
Soon you'll see, you can say what you want, you'll never be me
I'll just bite my tongue, and leave your mouth to run
Soon you'll see, if you want it come get it you know where I'll be
If you want it come get it you know where I'll be
If you want it come get it you know where I'll be

Look at you now
Another face in the crowd
I am, I am the headline
Look in my eyes
And read between the lines
I am, I am the headline
I am, I am, I am the headline
I am, I am, I am the headline

Deep down I love it when you hate me
Keep it up, it's funny that you can't see
This is everything you wanted to be
So give up, give up, feed your hate to me
I'll just bite my tongue and leave your mouth to run
This is everything you wanted to be
So give up, give up, feed your hate to me
Say what you want, you can say what you want
You can say what you want, you'll never be me

Look at you now
Another face in the crowd
I am, I am the headline
Look in my eyes
And read between the lines
I am, I am the headline

Take a look around, tell me what you see
The wolves are out
It's about to get rowdy
GO
Welcome to our stomping grounds
Where the kids throw down and the shit gets loud
This is an invitation to get the fuck out if you can't take it

Look at you now
Another face in the crowd
I am, I am the headline
Look in my eyes
And read between the lines
I am, I am the headline
I am, I am, I am the headline
I am, I am, I am the headline
