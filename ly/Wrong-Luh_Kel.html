		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nah-nah-nah-nah, oh, nah
Yeah, nah, nah, uh

Girl, my mood changed when you walked through the door
Before you came, it was tears on the floor
Girl, you so perfect, I think that its workin'
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs
Girl, I think you the plug, you the one with the best
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (wrong)
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (wrong)
Girl, you did me wrong, you did me wrong (that's right)
You did me wrong, oh, oh, ayy

All by my side, argue, let's talk, I need you by my side
You had my back when the gang used to slide
Now you gon' tell me you done with my time
I thought that I needed you in my life
All of them times that you talked, but you lied
Girl, you was down and you told me you roll like my Rollie
I'm done 'cause you lie with my guys, like nah
The only plan was to ball
'Member them times when we fall, but we got up and fought
I tried to leave, you would stall
Baby, I gave you my all, my all, my all
No car, we road in the backseat
Yeah, you used to ride like a taxi
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea
My heart fell so deep in the Black Sea

Girl, my mood changed when you walked through the door
Before you came, it was tears on the floor
Girl, you so perfect, I think that its workin'
You gave me your love, now I really want more
Girl, you so different, apart from the rest
Cool, I dropped out, I don't really take tests
You gave me your love, I'm addicted like drugs
Girl, I think you the plug, you the one with the best
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (wrong)
You did me wrong, you did me wrong (wrong)
Girl, you did me wrong, you did me wrong
You did me wrong, wrong, wrong, ayy
