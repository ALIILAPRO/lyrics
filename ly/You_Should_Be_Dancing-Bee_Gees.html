		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm

What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

She's juicy and she's trouble
She gets it to me good
My woman gives me power
Goes right down to my blood

What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

My baby moves at midnight
Goes right on till the dawn, yeah
My woman takes me higher
My woman keeps me warm

What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
You should be dancing, yeah
Dancing, yeah

What you doin' on your bed on your back? Ah
