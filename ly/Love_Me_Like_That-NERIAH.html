		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I think about her when
I'm in the shower
Right before we go to sleep
I like the song you showed me
When we left the party
But it wasn't about me
Can't help but get the feeling
That you're not done healing
From the one before me

It feels like you miss her
Do you wish you were with her?

'Cause you loved her first and
That's how it always works
She's the one that got away
I can't ever take her place when it ends
I'll curse your name even though
I'll take the blame
'Cause I saw what you both had and I
Know you'll never love me like that

Love me like that
Love me like that, like that
Love me like that

Can't put my finger on it but it's so ironic
'Cause nothing's really wrong
Except the sinking feeling when
She's the reason that we don't belong

It feels like you miss her do you? 'Cause

You loved her first and that's
How it always works
She's the one that got away
I can't ever take her place when it ends
I'll curse your name even though
I'll take the blame
'Cause I saw what you both had and I
Know you'll never love me like that

Love me like that
Love me like that, like that, oh oh
I know you'll never love me like
Love me like that
Love me like that, like that
I know you'll never love me like that
