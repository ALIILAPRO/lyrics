		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before I die, I'd like to do something nice
Take my hand and I'll take it for a ride
You hit me yesterday because I made you cry
So before we die let me do something nice, ohh

I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (hey)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (huh)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (huh)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And if I had a car, I would trade in my car
If I had a gun, I would trade in my gun
Honey, we ran from the country when we rushed to the city
And now there's nothing to be done, there's nothing to be done
There's nothing to be done, there's nothing to be done, no

I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (hey)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (huh)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (huh)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
I want to buy you something
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

And I wanna buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money
And I want to buy you somethin'
But I don't have any money
No, I don't have any money

Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (hey)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (huh)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh (huh)
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh
Ohh-ohh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
