		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calling my name
I hear you calling my name
Calling me out of my shame
Take it away
You show me I'm not the same
Talkin' bout how you reclaim me
Holding me like I'm a baby
Every daily, ah
Help me with my unbelief
This gonna preach
Say I'm forgiven and free
This is another degree
Who, me?
You really talking to me?
Imma get outta the way
Feeling like running away
But you steady chasing me down now
What was lost, you found
You brought me back around
Love is calling out
Oh, how sweet the sound
Yeah
Calling my name
I hear you calling my name
Calling me out of my shame
Take it away
You show me I'm not the same
Talkin' bout how you reclaim me
Holding me like I'm a baby
Every daily
You say that you will not leave
This is not hide and go seek
Finders keepers!
You are the love when I'm weak
I'm the sheep
And you're the shepherd
Everything is getting better
To your spirit, I am tethered
You remind me of your love forever and ever
What was lost, you found
You brought me back around
Love is calling out
Oh, how sweet the sound
What was lost, you found
You brought me back around
Love is calling out
Oh, how sweet the sound
Yeah
