		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes

I don't want to fight you
And I don't wanna sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line

Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold

Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you

We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright (alright, alright, alright)

(We'll be alright)
(We'll be alright)

We'll be alright
We'll be alright
