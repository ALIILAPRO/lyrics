		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been naturally gifted with a soul I love, oh my lover
If your heart got a price i'll pay in full my love, know that
I'm sold
Yea when you love me i'm sold
I'm sold
yea when you touch me i'm sold


cnd everybody treat me different these days
hard to find somebody you can live for these days
the irony is I would probably go and fucking die for you
plus you independent other men would never try for you
maybe I could give my mom a daughter in law girl
she deserve the world, we've been really through it all girl
you always been a gift that I could vibe to
I've been sold on the idea that I have you
I know that 


You've been naturally gifted with a soul I love, oh my lover
If your heart got a price i'll pay in full my love, know that
I'm sold
Yea when you love me i'm sold
I'm sold
yea when you touch me i'm sold


If I could buy a million roses, I would
just to show them all who owns it
I should be the only one you holding
forever, and ever
If I could write a million love songs, for you
Have a million things to touch on, who knew
I'd be writing all about you
forever, and ever
cus I'm sold
yea when you love me I'm sold
I'm sold
Yea when you touch me I'm sold
(baby you know)


You've been naturally gifted with a soul I love, oh my lover
If your heart got a price i'll pay in full my love, know that
I'm sold
Yea when you love me i'm sold
I'm sold
yea when you touch me i'm sold
