		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time we meet, everything is sweet
Oh, you're so tender, I must surrender
My love is your love, now and forever

You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Baby, you're the one that I love

Keep me in your heart, never let us part
Ooh, never leave me, please don't deceive me
I want you only, you must believe me

You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Baby, you're the one that I love

I adore you, and no one before you, could make me feel this way, yay
Since I met you, I just can't forget you, I love you more each day
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the one (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

There may be some tears through the comin' years
Ooh, all the while I know you'll be smilin'
Your love will guide me through every mile 'cause

You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Baby, you're the one that I love
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You're the one that I long to kiss
Baby, you're the one that I really miss (yeah, yeah, yeah)
You're the one that I'm dreamin' of
Baby, you're the one that I love
Yeah, yeah, yeah
