		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving round town in a 69
Thinking to myself was she really right
Pretty eyes mean pretty lies
Whatcha you gona do when she really tries
To bring you down
Bring you down
She might try to really fuck you up
Understand that this is what she loves
I’m glad that she will see me blowing up
Ohhh I knew the moment that I seen those eyes
That I’d be caught up now I’m racing down the 45
Just to get to you babe
And I seen it coming but I didn’t mind
All the carnage that you brought but now I realize
That I was such a fool for you
Tried to fuck the homie but we steady dogging bitches
Thankful for the real ones that be steady ridding with me
Heard around town you cry at night
But I ain’t pulling up cause of all the times you tired to tear me down
Driving round town in a 69
Thinking to myself was she really right
Pretty eyes mean pretty lies
Whatcha you gona do when she really tries
To bring you down
Bring you down
She might try to really fuck you up
Understand that this is what she loves
I’m glad that she will see me blowing up
I’ve been driving all night just to clear my thoughts
Of the memories left in the past
Not the only one dealing with a broken heart just the only one living in the end
You should know you should know that I’m done and you won’t hurt me again
Don’t try to run try to run from all you’ve done see you can’t escape the past
In the end this was all just a game to you
That I learned how to play so I don’t blame you
And I heard around town you cry at night
But I ain’t pulling up cause of all the times you tired to tear me down
Driving round town in a 69
Thinking to myself was she really right
Pretty eyes mean pretty lies
Whatcha you gona do when she really tries
To bring you down
Bring you down
She might try to really fuck you up
Understand that this is what she loves
I’m glad that she will see me blowing up
