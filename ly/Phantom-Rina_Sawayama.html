		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a time
There was a girl, pleasing the world
Dying to be liked, looking for love
Wanting to trust

Stickers and scented gel pens
Get possessions, get friends
Breaking off pieces, things started to change
I've been trying to find her since, she gave a little too much away

I don't want to do this without you
I don't want to do this if you're just a ghost in the night
I tried everything to fill up the void that you left me with
My phantom (phantom)

Phantom
Phantom

If I could talk to you, I'd tell you not to rush
You're good enough
You don't have to lose, what makes you you
Still got some growing to do

When did we get so estranged
Haunted by the way I've changed
Claiming back the pieces of me that I've lost
Reaching in and hoping you're still, waiting by the windowsill
I'd bring you back to us

I don't want to do this without you
I don't want to do this if you're just a ghost in the night
I tried everything to fill up the void that you left me with
My phantom (phantom)

Ooh, I was wrong to assume, I would ever out grow you
I need you now, I need you close
How do you hold a ghost?
Inner child, come back to me, I want to tell you that I'm sorry
I'm sorry

I don't want to do this without you
I don't want to do this if you're just a ghost in the night
I tried everything to fill up the void that you left me with
My phantom

Don't want to do this without you
Don't want to do this if you're locked away in my mind
I tried everything to fill up the void that you left me with
My phantom (phantom), ooh

Phantom
Phantom
Phantom
Phantom

Once upon a time, there was a girl, ooh
Dying to be liked, looking for love
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, I don't want to do this without you
