		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
Its the franchise, Boy, I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now

In case you forgot, or fell off, I'm still hot, knock your shell off
My money stack fat, plus I can't turn the swell off
The franchise doing big business, I live this
Is automatic I win this so you hear those horns who finish
A soldier and I stay under you fighting
'Cause I'm stormin' on you chumps like thunder and lightning
Ain't no way you breaking me kid, I'm harder than nails
Plus I keep it on lock like I'm part of the jail
I'm slaughtering stale competition
I got the whole block wishing they could run with my division
But, they gone fishing with no bait
Can't your boy hold weight?
I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate
In any weather, I'm never better, your boy is so hot
You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
And if they hate, let 'em hate, I drop their whole clan
Lay your ass down for the three second tan

Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, Boy, I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now (Yeah)

Um, it's gon' be, what it's gon' be
Five pounds of courage buddy, base tan pants with a gold tee
Ugh, it's a war dance and victory step
Of all stances, a gift and you insist it's my rep
John Cena, Trademarc, you'll are so so we talked about the bread you make
But don't know the recipe for dough though
Aiming guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
When this pop your lip lock, your big tocks a blatant no-show
See what happens when the ice age melt
You monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
I rock a time piece by Benny if any
The same reason ya'll can love me is the same reason ya'll condemn me
A man is measured by the way that he thinks
Not clothing lines, ice links, leather, and minks
I spent 20 plus years seeking knowledge of self
So for now Marc records living life for wealth

Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, Boy, I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now

Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
Its the franchise, Boy, I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now
