		  Naked

Vers
All the lights in the city go down and we're all alone
Said you been hurt a couple times now baby got a heart of stone
But you can't feel nobody if you keep your body feelin' numb
Maybe we can take it slow, baby don't be scared of love no no


Pre Chorus
Baby let's get Vulnerable
Body got me Emotional
Leave your clothes lying on the floor
We can strip it all away


Chorus
Let's get naked 
I can't take it no more
Let's just face it
Girl we're better when we're naked 

Let's get naked 
I can't take it no more
Let's just face it
Girl we're better when we're naked 

Girl we're better when we're naked 
Girl we're better when we're naked 

Vers 2
Losing track of time as our bodies intertwine girl it's so natural
Pillow talk is cheap we should let our bodies speak baby let's get physical
Let me let your guard down I wanna see you now
Yeah give me a visual
I need you to blow my mind
So baby swallow all your pride yeah

Pre Chorus
Baby let's get Vulnerable
Body got me Emotional
Leave your clothes lying on the floor
We can strip it all away


Chorus
Let's get naked 
I can't take it no more
Let's just face it
Girl we're better when we're naked 

Let's get naked 
I can't take it no more
Let's just face it
Girl we're better when we're naked 

Girl we're better when we're naked 
Girl we're better when we're naked 

Bridge
Baby let's get Vulnerable
Body got me Emotional
Leave your clothes lying on the floor
We can strip it all away

Outro 

Let's get naked
Girl we're better when we're naked
Let's get naked
Girl we're better when we're naked
Let's get naked
Girl we're better when we're naked
