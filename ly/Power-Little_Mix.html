		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold up, no you didn't bow, bow
I ain't the chick to walk behind you 'round town
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it laying down, baby

Oh, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it (uh-huh)
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down south
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it laying down, baby

You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power?
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
Hold up
My turn

I make this look easy, tick-tick, boom, like gasoline-y
Yeah, they call me Lamborghini, 'cause I know just what I'm worth
Z-Z-Z-Zero to a hundred, b-b-body make' em stutter
Start my engine, push the button, 'cause I'm gon' be coming first (ow)

Yeah, I'm a machine when I do it
I'll be catching fire, gasoline when I do it
Just 'cause you're packin', packin', whoop, down South
That don't mean I'm ever gonna take it lying down, baby 

You're the man, but I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain, but I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel, long as you don't forget

Who got the power?
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the)
Who got the power?
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the)
Who got the power?

Don't be fooled, I got you wrapped up
In the arms of an animal
Got you thinking that I'm all innocent
But wait 'til I get you home
If you don't, baby, you should know
I'm the one who's in control
Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Bike, bike, bike, bike
Bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, whoop

You're the man (the man, the man)
But I got the, I got the, I got the power
You make rain (rain)
But I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control (I'm in control now)
I'll let you come take the wheel
Long as you don't forget (long as you don't forget)

You're the man (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But I got the, I got the, I got the power (woo, oh)
You make rain (you make rain, you make rain)
But I'll make it, I'll make it, I'll make it shower
You should know, I'm the one who's in control
I'll let you come take the wheel
Long as you don't forget (you don't forget)

(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power)
'Cause I got the, I got the, I got the power
(I got the, I got the power)
(I got the, I got the power) (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh-whoa)
Baby, don't forget I got the power, yeah
The power, yeah, yeah, yeah

Motorbike, motorbike, motorbike, motorbike
Bike, bike, bike, bike
Bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, bike, whoop
