		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think about the things that we should have done before
And the way things are going to end is about to fall
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago

Look around and see the warnings close at hand
Already weeds are writing their scriptures in the sand
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago

The morning Sun is rising casting rays across the land
Already nature's calling take heed of the warning
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
We took the wrong step years ago
