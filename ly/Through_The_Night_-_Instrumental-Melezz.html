		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Neon lights in the pouring rain
Lonely souls wander through the dark
Here I am in the coldest night
Can someone fix my heart

I drive through the night
Escaping from my life
Hope that I'll find
Something that
makes me feel alive
That sets my heart on fire
I'm gonna leave this world
Behind

(I drive through the night)
(I'm gonna leave this world behind)

Somehow my life feels like a joke
How can everything go so wrong
I used to have it all, now I'm just fucked up
And I lost all hope

You might say you know the feeling
You know what I'm going through
But you've never even come close
To this emptiness that I know

It feels like nothing matters at all
And my heart doesn't beat anymore

Cause everything that gave me life has left me lone
I have everything I ever dreamed, but there's a void in my soul

So
I drive through the night
Escaping from my life
Hope that I'll find
Something that
makes me feel alive
That sets my heart on fire
I'm gonna leave this world
Behind
