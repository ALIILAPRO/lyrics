		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are my world my darling
What a wonderful world I see
You are the song I'm singing
You're my beautiful Melody

Darling, we better be going
Look at her isn't she glowing
She looks divine, and you look exquisite
But look at the time
Couldn't be is it

The crew is awaiting your orders
We're sailing away from the borders
Steady boy steady
Ahoy there, they're coming
Trumpeters ready, drummers start drumming

Down to the sea we go
Down to a world I know
There's never been
Not ever before
A child born of sea and shore

Down to the sea we go
Down to the world below
A journey to bless
A princess to be
Under the sun, and under the sea

Ariel is coming, Ariel is coming 
Ariel is coming, Ariel is coming 
Ariel is coming, Ariel is coming 
Ariel is coming, Ariel is coming 
Ariel is coming, Ariel is coming 
Ariel is coming, Ariel is coming 
What's all the big commotion
That's spreading through the ocean
From sea to shining sea
There is no hesitating
Today we're celebrating
Ariel's Melody


Today when Triton's daughter
Comes back here to the water
We're gonna have a spree
The boat is nearer now
I think I hear her now
Ariel's Melody

Lad-da-di-da 
Lad-da-di-da 
Lad-da-di-da 

Up from the sea we rise
Up to the world of skies
There's never been
Not ever before
A child born of sea and shore

Up from the sea we rise
Up to the world of skies
Forever to be
Together as one
Under the sea
And under the sun

This is your world my darling
One world the land and sea
My hope for you for always
Is that your heart will part of me
Down to the sea we go
Down to the world we know
Together we come
Forever to be
Under one sun
The land and the sea
