		  (Nigga, I'm the reason)
(Nigga, I'm the reason)
Ayy

Whole spot poppin', nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Can't get in V.I.P., nigga, I'm the reason (reason, yeah)
Bitches twerkin' on the table, nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Got this bitch sold out, yeah, I'm the reason (reason, yeah)
Whole city shut down, it's the winnin' season (season, yeah)
If she single for the night, nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
If she ain't text back, I'm the reason (reason)
The way I took his bitch, it was too easy (easy)

Yeah, bitch go hard or she goin' home (home)
I got diamonds in the bezel and the link chrome (yeah)
Yeah, gotta mix the drink with the honeycomb (yeah)
And if hoein' was a sport, bitch goin' pro (go pro)
And this beat sound like a new ringtone (brrt)
Purple turtle shell in the styrofoam (yeah)
Pay all cash (cash), I don't need a loan (hah)
Give her long dick, now she won't leave me 'lone (bitch)
Yeah, this sound like when the opps drop
Tints on the Phantom, goin' dark in the parking lot (go, go)
Fetty hit me now, big shot, go'n air it out
Take her back to my place, woo, I'ma wear it out (yeah)
This bitch pussy pretty, Mona Lisa
Leanin' like Pisa, she's a maneater
Fly like Peter, pre-roll the reefer
Fly the two-seater, two-fifty feature (yeah)

Whole spot poppin', nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Can't get in V.I.P., nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Bitches twerkin' on the table, nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Got this bitch sold out, yeah, I'm the reason (reason)
Whole city shut down, it's the winnin' season (season, whoa)
If she single for the night, nigga, I'm the reason (reason, yeah)
If she ain't text back, I'm the reason (reason, hah)
The way I took his bitch, it was too easy (easy)

Everybody wearin' red, I'm the reason
Put a bullet in his head just for sneakin'
Swimmin' in that pussy, dove off the deep end
How is this your wifey and I got her freakin'?
Creepin', she's a creep (creep)
Fuck her on her paws with a leash (with a leash)
My nut like a frog, my shit leap (leap)
That pussy seven days, got me weak (got me weak)
Hit her on her period, she bleedin'
Tryna pull her hair out, she got a weave in
She cheatin' with me, tryna get even
You must broke her heart in pieces
I'm in the club like, "Fuck you niggas lookin' at?" (What the fuck?)
I must hit his bitch bareback (I must hit her)
Let my bitch go out, I don't even care to ask (I don't even care)
You track your bitch down with an airtag

Whole spot poppin', nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Can't get in V.I.P., nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
Bitches twerkin' on the table, nigga, I'm the reason (reason, I'm the reason, motherfucker)
Got this bitch sold out, yeah, I'm the reason (reason)
Whole city shut down, it's the winnin' season (bitch, you know we here with the gang, stop playin')
If she single for the night, nigga, I'm the reason (reason)
If she ain't text back, I'm the reason (nigga, fuck you lookin' at, pussy?)
The way I took his bitch, it was too easy (easy)

Yeah, yeah, nigga, I'm the reason
I got hoes for every season
Shooters got stripes like Adidas
Fuck I look like wearin' FILA?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nigga, I'm the reason
I got hoes for every season
Shooters got stripes like Adidas
Fuck I look like?
