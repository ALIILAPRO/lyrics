		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm digging my way
Yes, I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to somethin' better

I'm pushing to stay
Yes, I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with somethin' better

Whoa oh oh oh yeah
Whoa oh yeah
Oh yeah

I'm sowing the seeds
Yes, I'm sowing the seeds I've taken
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted

This thorn in my side
Yes, this thorn in my side is from the tree
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
Ooh, it tears me and I bleed
And I bleed whoa oh oh oh

Caught under wheel's roll
I take the leech, I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
Oh, the bleeding of me, ooh yeah
Of me, whoa oh oh oh
Oh, the bleeding of me

Caught under wheel's roll
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me
I can't stop to save my soul
I take that leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
Ooh, oh, ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheel's roll
Oh, oh, the bleeding of me, oh
Oh, Oh, the bleeding of me

I am the beast that feeds the feast
I am the blood, I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under

Caught under wheel's roll
I take that leech, I'm bleeding me
I can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, ooh oh
Ooh, I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
No, oh, the bleeding of me, no
(Feel it man!)
(Come on, bleed me)

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

I'm digging my way
Yes, I'm digging my way to something
I'm digging my way to somethin' better, yeah

I'm pushing to stay
Yes, I'm pushing to stay with something
I'm pushing to stay with something better, yeah
With somethin' better
