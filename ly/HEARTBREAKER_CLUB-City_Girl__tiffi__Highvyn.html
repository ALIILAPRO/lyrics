		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If i asked you to teach me
Would you tell me your ways
If i asked you to leave me
Wonder what you would say

Overthink every "baby" and "maybe"
Oh lately ive been going insane

Youre a real sweet talker
All girls and the boys
Are wishing that they could be you
Or that they could be yours

And i asked you to help me
You said it was easy
Just turn off your feelings
fuck their heart, you can keep it

So welcome to the heartbreaker club
We got soda and drugs
For you to numb the pain
Don't you wish you could wish it away
All of those tears gone
I hope you had fun
I shoulda known better

My bad, im fucking with you again
So sad, found out im a heart bandit
And you got  that look in ur eyes
End every word with a sigh
I think im making you cry

Some day ill look back on what i told you
And ill regret  itand
Im not usually this way
Im normally quite
Sensitive

I'm overwhelming you
I know
I overestimate myself
But if you wanna know
How i do it
Then youre
Welcome to the Heartbreaker Club
