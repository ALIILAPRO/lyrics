		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can take you to the stars
I can take you to the moon
When I get high think about you (you)
Messages turn green, remember they used to turn just blue (blue)

I can take you to the stars
I can take you to the moon
When I get high think about you (you)
Messages turn green, remember they used to turn just blue (blue)

You might not know you got the wrong one
It wasn't me in your dreams, but a nigga here now, what we doin?
Toxic cause I'm broken, you said you needed space to breathe, why you chokin?
(Blood on the leaves)
Call me like I'm God's son
Check your phone when you leave cause my insecurities tell me not to trust what is open
There's no light goin down this road huh? (yea)
Lovin on you's lost, except when I'm in it
I spent it on you, but the bet ain't definite
My momma said that's the way it goes
I just up and left like I'm irreplaceable (irreplaceable)
Take aways from you
I never hated you
I just spent my days, never get back change in you
From now on, its never what you want
I just move on like you never were at all
Levels levels levels
Layers layers layers
Lovin on you is a curse
I let my demons put me in a hearse
Ain't no mistake how I know you the worst (yea)
Come find me in no mans
Check up on me, trust wherever I be I see
I'm free in my own land
So whatever you need if I left you on read
Don't call me

I can take you to the stars
I can take you to the moon
When I get high think about you (you)
Messages turn green, remember they used to turn just blue (blue)

I can take you to the stars
I can take you to the moon
When I get high think about you (you)
Messages turn green, remember they used to turn just blue (blue)

[Verse: LiL A-LIK]
You so intoxicated, inebriated, I know
I spent long days, long nights, tryna let you go
Notice
My heart so broken
I'm folding under pressure
I'll take you back whenever
It's hard not to remember
Your the one I set my eyes on
Typed a paragraph, bitch get left on read
Can't believe the messages that I sent
Dumb ass bitch you got me (oof)
Spliff gon calm my nerves
Dumb ass hoe get kicked to the curb
You could facetime call, you could text, but for you baby girl I got no words

I can take you to the stars
I can take you to the moon
When I get high think about you (you)
Messages turn green, remember they used to turn just blue (blue)

I can take you to the stars
I can take you to the moon
When I get high think about you (you)
Messages turn green, remember they used to turn just blue (blue)
