		<p>
		  Cook that shit up Quay!

Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm rappin' again (whippin')
Keep on playin' bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (trappin') (woo)
Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it) hey, hey
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again, hey, hey
Big ole forty on me, pack-packin' again (blaow) hey
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (cash, cash)

Quavo
Uh, back at it, back at it, uh
Count up a hundred, throw racks at it, uh
Yeah, my wrist a Titanic, uh
Ice hit the glacier, it do damage (ice)
Uh, yeah your nigga gon' panic
I see through her panties like a panoramic (hey)
Yeah, then get back to whippin'
And get back to trappin' young nigga back at it (woo)
Uh, if it's too crowded might shoot out the roof
And say, "Let them come through" (pow pow)
Keep it one thousand when I'm in the booth
I spent two thousand to step in the shoes (gang)
Gang on gang how you think we gon' lose (gang)
Back to back motorcade, that how we move (woo)
On momma porch was sittin' on the stoop (momma)
When I hopped up I took off to the Moon (ooh)

Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm rappin' again (whippin')
Keep on playin' bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (trappin') (woo)
Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it) hey, hey
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again, hey, hey
Big ole forty on me, pack-packin' again (blaow) hey
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (cash, cash)

My diamonds like Fiji, bitch, I'm Yella Beezy
Iced-out in this freezer, just copped a Luigi
Oh take it easy, you trippin' I'm leavin'
My drank in the freezer, this shit don't come easy
I'm trappin' I mean it, my blood double G me
The Cougar the heater, take la se√±orita
I'll send some shots through a nigga wife-beater
Chopper knock a nigga out on his people
Don't call me, lil' baby, I'm sorry don't need ya
Last month I got shot up, been went up on features
Body for body my niggas some demons
We tit for tat, leave you busted and bleedin'
Stopped in Atlanta in the booth with my Nina
Back in the day used to trap in a Beamer
I'm a true hustler my bitch is a schemer
Skeet in her eyes and that lil' bitch a creamer (aye)

Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm rappin' again (whippin')
Keep on playin' bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (trappin') (woo)
Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it) (uh), hey
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again, hey, hey
Big ole forty on me, pack-packin' again (blaow) hey
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (cash, cash)

Wrist so froze, can't shake hands, I gotta give you a pound
Way my bank account quadrupled, think I'm still slingin' pounds (wow)
Told them castin' my vote for who tryna get this dope 'cross the border
Grew up I'm from East Atlanta, but stand my ground like it's Florida
Fuck the judge, fuck the bailiff, fuck the local reporter
Tell the whole truth to my lawyer, Guwop slicker than oil
Park the Dawn, rode the Wraith to the trap with the Adler
Look like a Rolls Royce dealership, every time I bring out my cars
Fuck the stars, buy the bar, neighborhood superstar (S'Gucci)
Twenty-four K, Bruno Mars, down to the drawers (guwop)
I'm thinking' large, talkin' old money, Chico DeBarge
Lou say I'm 20 futuristic movin' this part (it's Gucci)

Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it)
In the kitchen whippin', I'm rappin' again (whippin')
Keep on playin' bitch, then I'm stabbin' your friend (woo)
I'm in the hood, they think I'm back trappin' again (trappin') (woo)
Oh my gosh, back at it again (back at it) hey, hey
All my grizzy niggas sta-stackin' again, hey, hey
Big ole forty on me, pack-packin' again (blaow) hey
Keep a quarter on me, backpack in the Benz (cash, cash)
