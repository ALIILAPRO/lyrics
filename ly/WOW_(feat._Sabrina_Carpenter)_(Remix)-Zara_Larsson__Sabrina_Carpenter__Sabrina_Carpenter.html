		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

And I feel this way with no chemicals in my system
Babe, it's incredible
When you're touching me, yeah, that says it all
You said it all (Yeah)

Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

Make your jaw drop-drop
Saying, my, drop-drop-drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Saying, my, drop-drop-drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Saying, my, drop-drop-drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion

And you make me feel so fucking pretty
Take loving me to a new extreme
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
I don't want no one
As you make me dance in the middle of the street
On the hardwood floor, we should be asleep
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
I don't want no one, want no one, want no one

Baby, I'm not even in a gown
I'm just in a T-shirt on the couch
The way you want me makes me want you now
The only thing you have to say is (Wow)

Make your jaw drop-drop
Saying, my, drop-drop-drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion
Make your jaw drop-drop
Saying, my, drop-drop-drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
My, drop-drop
Make your jaw drop
Make you say "Oh my god"
And you never felt this type of emotion

Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
Never, never, never, oh
