		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His eyes appear vacant
He'd taken more than his share
Trying hard not to awaken
The voice of regret in his ear
He can't escape the timeline
So much worse than he had feared
Lived every moment
Wishing the past would disappear

He took the long way
On the freeway
He took the long way
On the freeway

She was his all and everything
But her strength, it needed space
Her love was but a haunting
She left but never went away

She took the long way
On the freeway
She took the long way 
On the freeway
She took the long way (long way)
On the freeway
She took the long way (long way)
On the freeway

She took the long way
On the freeway
She took the long way
On the freeway
She took the long way (long way)
On the freeway
She took the long way (long way)
On a freeway
She took the long, long way 

Well, it couldn't be had
What he wanted to hold
Oh, he dared to let go
He should of known

She took the long way (long way)
On the freeway
She took the long way (long way)
On the freeway
