		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I-I-I'm
Remember (remember)
I-I-I'm
I-I'm working on dying
BNYX

Red bottoms on, money gettin' slain
Red bottoms on, hunnid mill' in cash, nun' I'd change, now I got the fame
Hoppin' out the Range, diamonds on, diamonds on my face
Nun' I can say, I-I'on fuck with no lames, take time off, bitch (yeah)
Gettin' head by the chain, muhfuckin' flame
Got a Glock on my side everyday, pussy get sprayed, uh
Every time a muh'fuck play, everybody say that in they face, uh

It was not everyday, turnin' back
Made a mill' everyday, got the cash comin' in big time
Pushin' 200 then I'm whinin', call up big slime, yeah
X all night, yeah, 'boutta boot up
'Boutta fool up, 'boutta tint the crank, baby, 'boutta fool up
I'm just be stayin' to myself, I don't fuck with nobody, at all
None of these muhfuckers love their self, they're cryin' out for help
I don't think that I could feel
I just wish that I could feel (ugh)

Fly (fly), fly (fly), fly (fly), fly (yeah)
I been gettin' fly (fly), fly (fly), fly (fly), get high to the moon
(fly), fly (fly), fly (fly), gettin' high to the moon
Fly, fly, fly (fly), fly (fly, fly-fly-fly)

Red bottoms on, money gettin' slain
Red bottoms on, hunnid mill' in cash, nun' I'd change, now I got the fame
Hoppin' out the Range, diamonds on, diamonds on my face
Nun' I can say, I-I'on fuck with no lames, take time off, bitch (yeah)
Gettin' head by the chain, muhfuckin' flame
Got a Glock on my side everyday, pussy get sprayed, uh
Every time a muh'fuck play, everybody say that in they face, uh

It was not everyday, turnin' back
Made a mill' everyday, got the cash comin' in big time
Pushin' 200 then I'm whinin', call up big slime, yeah
X all night, yeah, 'boutta boot up
'Boutta fool up, 'boutta tint the crank, baby, 'boutta fool up
I'm just be stayin' to myself, I don't fuck with nobody, at all
None of these muhfuckers love their self, they're cryin' out for help
I don't think that I could feel
I just wish that I could feel (ugh)
