		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know?
How was I to know this high came rushing?

We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday

Here I go
Quite a show for a loner in L.A.
I wonder I managed to end up in this place
Where I couldn't get away

On the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speeding by like a train
Like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Gettin' closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun

Here comes the sun

Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
Judy said it's fine
They used to do this all the time in college
(If you and I get comfortable)

And we're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time
Watched it speeding by like a train

Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be known and loved?
Little closer, close enough
I'm a loser, loosen up
Set it free, must be tough
Will I be known and loved?
Is there one that I trust?
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough?
Will I be so in love?
Any closer, close enough
Shout out to what is done
R.I.P. here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
