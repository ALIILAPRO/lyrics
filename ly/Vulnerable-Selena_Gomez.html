		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I gave you every piece of me, I know that you could drop it
Give you the chance, I know that you could take advantage once you got it
If I open up my heart to you, I know that you could lock it
Throw away the key and keep it there forever in your pocket

If I gave the opportunity to you, then would you blow it?
If I was the greatest thing that happened to you, would you know it?
If my love was like a flower, would you plant it, would you grow it?
I might give you all my body, are you strong enough to hold it?

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

If I hand you my emotions, would you even want to take it?
(Would you even want to take it? Yeah)
If I give you all my trust, then would you fumble it and break it?
(Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm)
If I let you cross my finish line, then would you wanna make it?
(Would you wanna make it? Would you wanna make it?) 
I think I'm ready, won't you come and flip the switch and activate it?
(Ooh)

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah
I'll stay vulnerable

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before?
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'll stay vulnerable, yeah (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If I show you all my demons
And we dive into the deep end
Would we crash and burn like every time before? (I'll stay vulnerable)
I would tell you all my secrets
Wrap your arms around my weakness
If the only other option's letting go

I'll stay vulnerable
