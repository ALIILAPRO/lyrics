		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cup of coffee with the sunrise
Got this morning goin' just right
No plans and it's so nice, so nice

Ooh, Lord knows that it's been a long week
Whole world's been leanin' on me
Right here's right where I wanna be

It's gonna be a good day, a good vibe
Order in a little Postmates and Mai Tais
Turn the music up on a long drive
Make a little love in the sunshine
It's gonna be a good day, a good time
As long as I got your hand in mine
Wouldn't wanna live any other way
Wake up every morning, look at you and say
"It's gonna be a good day", da-da, la-da, da-da
"It's gonna be a good day", la-la, la-da, da, la-da, yeah

We should turn off both of our phones
Go anywhere we wanna go
If you want me, I'm yours, baby, just say so

Ooh, Lord knows that it's been a long week (long week)
Whole world's been leanin' on me (on me)
Right here's right where I wanna be

It's gonna be a good day, a good vibe
Order in a little Postmates and Mai Tais
Turn the music up on a long drive
Make a little love in the sunshine
It's gonna be a good day, a good time
As long as I got your hand in mine
Wouldn't wanna live any other way
Wake up every morning, look at you and say
"It's gonna be a good day", da-da, la-da, da-da
"It's gonna be a good day", la-la, la-da, da, la-da, yeah

It's gonna be a good day, a good vibe (a good day)
Order in a little Postmates and Mai Tais (oh)
Turn the music up on a long drive
Make a little love in the sunshine
It's gonna be a good day, a good time
As long as I got your hand in mine (your hand in mine)
Wouldn't wanna live any other way
Wake up every morning, look at you and say
"It's gonna be a good day", da-da, la-da, da-da
"It's gonna be a good day", la-la, la-da, da, la-da, yeah
