		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She says that they're all dead
She says that they're all dead
She says that they're all dead
She says that they're all dead
She says that they're all dead

Get a phone call from the queen with a hundred heads
She says that they're all dead
She tried the last one on
Couldn't speak, fell off
And now she just wanders the halls
Thinking nothing, thinking nothing at all

Once there was a man
Who had a little too much time on his hand
And never stopped to think that he was getting older
But when his night came to an end
He tried to grasp for his last friend and pretend
That he could wish himself health on a four-leaf clover
