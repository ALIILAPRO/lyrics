		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh, hot dog)
Well, I just got into town today 
To find my girl who's gone away 
She took the Greyhound at the general store 
I searched myself I searched the town 
When I finally did sit down 
I find myself no wiser than before 

She said we couldn't do no wrong 
No other love could be so strong 
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer 
Now she took my heart she took my keys 
From in my old blue dungarees 
And I'll never go to Texas anymore 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I took her love at seventeen 
A little late these days it seems 
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for 
I took her word I took it all 
Beneath the sign that said "you-haul" 
She left angels hangin' round for more 

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do 
She took my love and walked right out the door 
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure 
I'm gonna give her something like she never had before 

I thought I had it all sewn up 
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck 
But folks said she was after something more 
I never did quite understand 
All that talk about rockin' bands 
But they just rolled my doll right out the door 
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
