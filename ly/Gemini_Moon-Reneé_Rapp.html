		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never know who you're gonna get
We're in love or we never met
Sour lemons or cinnamon
Every day, I'm different
I talk shit then I bite my tongue
Moving in, then I'm on the run
I exist on a pendulum
Swingin' high or swingin' low

You're the driver, I'm the passenger (ah-ah)
You're so fucking perfect, how come I'm not feeling more?
Hope this doesn't make you insecure (ah-ah)
But yesterday was heaven, now I'm bored

I bet you're sick of it
Believe me, so am I 
Always the problem kid, I could never pick a side (ah-ah)
I bet you're sick of it (ah-ah), I could blame the Gemini moon
But really, I should just be better to you

Memorizing every smile line
Compatibility down to the signs
Breaking beds just to buy some time
To avoid myself (mm)

You're the driver, I'm the passenger (ah-ah)
You're so fucking perfect, how come I'm not feeling more?
Hope this doesn't make you insecure (ah-ah)
But yesterday was heaven, now I'm bored

I bet you're sick of it
Believe me, so am I 
Always the problem kid, I could never pick a side
I bet you're sick of it (ah-ah), I could blame the Gemini moon
But really, I should just be better to you
Mm, but really, I should just be better to you
