		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put my hands on your mouth
Said my name way too loud
Fifty other people in the crowd
Pull your pants down I'll eat you out
Girl, lets head back outside
Sip on a cold ass water with ice
Didn't wanna cum cuz we have all night
So I gave it to her like I owed my life
Every guy wants my bitch
So they come to me they want knowledge
I say all it takes is being honest
Honesty is confidence on some other shit
Girl, why the fuck you always doing that?
Why don't you come outside with that
Why don't you throw your pussy on my lap
Why don't you break your back with that
I just wanna see you at your best
After me you won't settle for less
Let me roll one up so you could shine
When I feel it hit is when you're mine
I could only love you if I'm up
I could never love you if I'm down
But I'll grip your head while we work out
Just to fill a queens void of a crown
Put my hands on your mouth
Said my name way too loud
Fifty other people in the crowd
Pull your pants down I'll eat you out
Girl, lets head back outside
Sip on a cold ass water with ice
Didn't wanna cum cuz we have all night
So I gave it to her like I owed my life
Every guy wants my bitch
So they come to me they want knowledge
I say all it takes is being honest
Honesty is confidence on some other shit
Girl, why the fuck you always doing that?
Why don't you come outside with that
Why don't you throw your pussy on my lap
Why don't you break your back with that
I have other women tryna vibe
They just try too hard cuz they're not from here
Baby girl I've been here all my life
Two years in LA you can't recognize
I just miss the old version of you
Two years in LA you think you're so cool
I just want you to go back home
Figure shit out then come back be a hoe
Put my hands on your mouth
Baby girl you're too loud
Fifty other people in the crowd
Pull your pants down I'll eat you out
Girl, lets head back outside
Sip on a cold ass water with ice
Didn't wanna cum cuz we have all night
