		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (Space Rabbit)
Yeah-yeah (yeah)
Yeah-yeah (Space Rabbit push a space coupe straight out of Monaco, yeah)
I pray the choppa never jam on me, yeah
I pray the Lord puts his hands on me (yeah), yeah-yeah
I pray the choppa never jam

.30-30 in my hands
DEA and detective done got me cuffed on that ambulance
Nigga ain't no solvin' no murders, welcome to Murderland
Send a hit and scratch off a hit, bitch, I'm the murder man
Pray the Lord puts his hands on me
And I know I took a risk with this shit when I put my hands on it
All my enemies watchin', they plot and plan on me
They gon' end up one of them dead homies

'Cause how can a nigga stand on it when it ain't the truth?
Pussy niggas ran on me when it's time to shoot
Motherfuck a friend, got them bitches out my crew
I know you wouldn't fuck with me if I didn't have no loot
'Cause I'm the one that push a hard line
Tell me what niggas know about hard times
Empty stomach get you the heart to go do a homicide
I know some bitch niggas that snitch, niggas on my side
Still a rich nigga with mob ties

'Cause, nigga, we was locked in
Me and six of my niggas in one apartment
We was pushin' that molly, powder and hard ten
Back when bitches, they used to play with my heart then
Police might shoot me and kill me over my dark skin
Man, this game got me dark-hearted
Smoke a chain like a alcoholic, don't get me started
I thought we was gon' thug it out to the end
But I guess that shit just wasn't on the plans
I pray this choppa never jam

.30-30 in my hands
Shoot him if he ain't DOA, we shoot up the ambulance
Nigga ain't no solvin' no murders, welcome to Murderland
Bulletproof my shit, they might hit it, bitch, I'm the murder man
Dead nigga put his hands on me
I might pop another bottle and pour one out for your dead homie
Swear my friends turnin' fed on me (bitch)
Man, they pussy niggas, might take a stand on me

But how can a nigga stand on it when it ain't the truth?
Pussy niggas ran on me when it's time to shoot
She think I'm her man, baby, I'm just knockin' boots
I know you wouldn't fuck with me if I didn't have no loot
'Cause I'm the one that push a hard line
Tell me what bitches know about hard times
Empty stomach get you the heart to go do a homicide
Know some bitch niggas that snitch, niggas on my side
Still a rich nigga with mob ties

'Cause, nigga, we was locked in
Me and six of my niggas in one apartment
We was pushin' that molly, powder and hard ten
Back when bitches, they used to play with my heart then
Police might shoot me and kill me over my dark skin
Man, this game got me dark-hearted
Smoke a chain like a alcoholic, don't get me started
I thought we was gon' thug it out to the end
But I guess that shit just wasn't on the plans
I pray this choppa never jam (uh, yeah-yeah)

I pray this choppa never jam (yeah-yeah)
I pray this choppa never jam on me (yeah-yeah)
I pray the Lord puts his hands on me (yeah-yeah)
I pray this choppa never jam
I pray this choppa never jam (yeah-yeah)
I pray this choppa never jam on me (yeah-yeah)
I pray the Lord puts his hands on me (yeah-yeah)
