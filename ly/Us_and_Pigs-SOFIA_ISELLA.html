		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ate dinner with beasts
Crinkled hands and red cheeks
Looking at my body like it's food 

cnd your breath smells like bacon
You ask, “What's the special occasion?”
Like I dress and dance just for you

Our women are cattle
There's blood on our kids
cre you being paid to not pay attention? 

Does it have to happen to your mother 
To your sister and your daughter 
For you to take it personal

So pump us full of sperm
Put us in a barn
Us and pigs
On a Mississippi farm
In nine months we'll have a kid you won't care about

cnd if the kids not straight, white and male
We guarantee a living hell
Murder in the name of a loving god

Our women are cattle
There's blood on our kids
cre you being paid to not pay attention? 

Does it have to happen to your mother 
To your sister and your daughter
For you to take it personal

So burn the witch alive
Drink our dirty water
Be prepared for the Mississippi slaughter
Your mistress gets a pass, ‘cause your wife can't find out

I guess we were just being a little loud
Shut us up and put apples in our mouth
But pull your own daughter out from the lineup
