		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful.
Every morning she makes me a cup of coffee
With a smile on her face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be so beautiful.
Every morning I wake up and I think of you
With a smile on my face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

Oh baby I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye even if you cry
I'm still by your side
Oh baby I want you to stay in my life
Never say goodbye even if you cry
I'm still by your side

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be
So beautiful.
Every morning she makes me a cup of coffee
With a smile on her face
I'm a man in love
And she glorious

There is one girl in my life
That makes me love again
As pretty as a girl could be so beautiful.
Every morning I wake up and I think of you
With a smile on my face
I'm a man in love
And she's glorious

Every morning she makes me a cup of coffee
With a smile on her face
I'm a man in love and she's glorious

Every morning!
