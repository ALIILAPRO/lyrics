		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sure I've read somewhere His yoke is easy
I've heard it said His burden should be light
Well it seems to me He's gonna have to help me
'Cause right now it seems I'm fighting for my life
Hello, grace
It’s good to see you
I thought I'd have to pray a thousand prayers to reach you
I shouldn't be surprised, you’re right on time
The way you've always been through every chapter of my life
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
Even as I'm staring down this mountain
That I know for sure I'm gonna have to climb
Just knowing that you're here is all that matters
It's all I need to give it one more try
Hello, grace
It’s good to see you
I thought I'd have to pray a thousand prayers to reach you
I shouldn't be surprised, you’re right on time
The way you've always been through every chapter of my life
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
If you'll keep walking with me I'll endure it
If you'll just light the way I'll walk on through it
I'm not asking you to get me through tomorrow
I'm just grateful that you're here with me today
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
It’s good to see you
I thought I'd have to pray a thousand prayers to reach you
I shouldn't be surprised, you’re right on time
The way you've always been through every chapter of my life
The way you've always been through every chapter of my life
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
Hello, grace
