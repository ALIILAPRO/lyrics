		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

Do you remember
When we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember
How it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember
Back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember
Us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time

Do you remember
How we used to talk?
You know
We'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember
All the things we said? 
Like, I love you so, I'll never let you go

Do you remember
Back in the Spring?
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember
Those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

Do you remember the time
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
When we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time (oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time ('cause I remember)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time (oh, I)
When we fell in love?
Do you remember the time
(Remember, my baby)

Remember the time
Woo
Remember the time
Do you remember, girl?
Remember the time
On the phone, you and me
Remember the time?
'Til dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?

Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
In the park, on the beach
Remember the time
You and me in Spain
What about, what about
Remember the time

Remember the time
Ooh, in the park
Remember the time
After dark
Do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Remember the time
Yeah, yeah, woo
Remember the time
