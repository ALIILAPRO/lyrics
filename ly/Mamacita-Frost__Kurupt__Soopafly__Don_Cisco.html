		  It's Friday 

Oye? 

Yeah, yeah, Frost 
Don Cisco, Soopafly, Kurupt

Fred Wreck waz up, boy? (Next Friday) 
This is for the fly senoritas, mamacitas, baby

Smoke something, baby 

You ready for this? Come on. 

Look how we do now, pop champagne with the brunette 
L.A. so hot, I rock ICE just to cool down 
I ride's on spoke dubs in the street 
All the ladies on the front that's loving the heat 
So turn the beat up watcha, shake to the Cha Cha 
Go ahead girl, let the whole world watcha 
You know I want you, yo te quiero 
You can be my gata and I can be your perro 
Game tight, much sharper than a filero 
This can be your ticket out the ghetto 
A huevo, el mero mero, and the Don Cisco 
And the Soopafly, K, get it going on 

To all my Latin ladies, You all know you drive me crazy 
by come give it to me baby 
Chiqui, wha, what?, Que, que? 
I could be your love if you let me 
Recognize a though and respect me 
Morena, Boriquas, Cubanas and Niquas 
Sexy Chicanitas, all you fly mamacitas 
Me gusta, when you start talking my Lingo 
Say she ain't got a Hombre and she love to be single 
That's why she hit the club with the girls tonight 
You want to shine, go ahead is your world tonight 
Shake your thing, break it down, move your body around 
You ain't know? It's a party when my crew hits town 
Now what? 
 
Mamacita 
Sexy Senorita 
You know how a Playa treat ya? 
I only call you when I need ya 
I love to love you than I leave ya 
I give it to you and never cheat ya 
So come on baby, let me teach ya 
Lady you want to follow, let me lead ya 
I'm talking to my Mamacita 

Hey! yo! I make the ladies rock their drop tops and keep it hot 
Lock it in their twat and recite the flows I got 
I chip off rocks so smooth I let them slip off 
Girls be all flocking the stage to watch me get off 
Soopa making a cold manouver, I'm talking to you 
Can you shine this boots I'm knocking and running through you? 
Drop the Boo-ya it's me they running to now 
Who can stop my track? I'm macking them like I'm Dru Down 
The first haters that step get kill and peeled 
Messing with Soopa 
you'll be having your conversation with wilt the steel 
Your eyes reveal, my ladies stay on tilt, 
I re-candle the flame by sticking ah! to each dame 
Like Arriba! Soopa and Frost smooking chiva 
Kurupt, Cisco came through with the drink Eurika 
I saw you take that money, don't make me beat you 
Top greedy and sexy is ready, who that? 

Mamacita 
Sexy Senorita 
You know how a Playa treat ya? 
I only call you when I need ya 
I love to love you than I leave ya 
I give it to you and never cheat ya 
So come on baby, let me teach ya 
Lady you want to follow, let me lead ya 
I'm talking to my Mamacita 

I love freaking, I love freaking, 
I love me a Bon-bon Puerto Rican 
Different skirts different weekends, 
from L.A. to San Juan, Puerto Rico 
I still move Perico, to the chicas and the chicos, Ay! Dios mio! 
Neo, cam, strong, Capone, Stallone, concrete stone is home 
Kurupt and Daz, Soopa Fly, Cisco, Hash 
Frost, Big Fred, Tijuana, Cancun, Blast! 
Smoking Mexicali, Slim Southern California Cali 
OG Russell Simmons with women about a dozen 
All my cousins California living sipping Tequila goosing 
(As soon as we get home from work, ha ha yeah! 
We gonna have to pop and purk, wha what?) 
Cisco, C-note, Big Hash 
Cisco and Hash, baby, no! Tango and Cash

So come on baby, let me teach ya 
Lady you want to follow, let me lead ya 
I'm talking to my Mamacita
