		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Save it for the living 

I see me in my final bed
All dressed up, I guess I'm dead
All of the pain gone
Think I'm a ghost now
I hear your thoughts, a bid farewell
I see you cry, I feel like hell
I want you to be strong
Let the show go on

Don't sacrifice the rest of your life missing me

Wish I could see you happy
Get on with your life without me
Think of me as something beautiful
Not the bitter end
I'm the reason why you're feeling life is broken
So hear me (please hear me)
I don't want your love
Save it for the living

What ghost around will come around
Cause you don't wanna let it go
I hear you calling
Wish I could take it
You parked your mind next to my grave
Like I'm the one you need to save
Look at yourself now
Why do you feel proud?

Don't sacrifice the rest of your life missing me

Wish I could see you happy
Get on with your life without me
Think of me as something beautiful
Not the bitter end
I'm the reason why you're feeling life is broken
So hear me (please hear me)
I don't want your love
Save it for the living

You save it for the living 

I want you to find 
Someone to take my place to fill your emptiness inside while your alive 
so please
Save it for the living
