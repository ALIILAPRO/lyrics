		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have a little love on a little honeymoon
You got a little dish and you got a little spoon
A little bitty house and a little bitty yard
A little bitty dog and a little bitty car

Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

A little bitty baby in a little bitty gown
It'll grow up in a little bitty town
A big yellow bus and little bitty books
It all started with a little bitty look

Well, it's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

Ay-yee

You know you got a job and a little bitty check
Six pack of beer and a television set
Little bitty world goes around and around
Little bit of silence and a little bit of sound

A good ol' boy and a pretty little girl
Start all over in a little bitty world
Little bitty plan and a little bitty dream
It's all part of a little bitty scheme

It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

It's alright to be little bitty
A little hometown or a big old city
Might as well share, might as well smile
Life goes on for a little bitty while

Woo
