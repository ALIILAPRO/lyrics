		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We gon' get it on
We gon' get it on

And we gon get it on
We gon' get it on
I know what you want
I know what you want

Lil' mama want her hair pulled
Legs pushed back
Only like a Rottweiler in the kitty cat
She want it wild, shawty wanna scream
Want it from the front, back, side, and in between
Want it all the time, she a fiend
So good, I see it in my dreams
She wanna arch her back when I hit it
When I do it mama wanna holla, get it she said

Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, time-to-time to get naughty
Take it slow, put it down on me
Baby, jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, l-l-l-lights down low

And we gon' get it on
We gon' get it on
I know what you want
I know what you want

She said I'm goin' too fast, take it slow
So I slapped her on the ass, start pullin' on her hair
She nibbled to my ear like, boy it's good
She love the way I'm tellin' how a nigga keep it hood
Give it to me daddy, that's what she keeps screamin'
give it to me daddy, She love the way I beat it
She wish that I could repeat it
I got her in a trance Man 
I'm even fuckin' friends got 'her blowin' like the wind 
She's shakin', got me impatient
Back and forth pacin', man I need my medication
Lights down low so we gettin' naughty
Makin' fuck faces, she ride me like a Harley

Take it slow, put it down on me
I said jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, time-to-time to get naughty
Take it slow, put it down on me
Baby, jump on it, ride like a pony
Lights down low, time to get naughty
Lights down low, l-l-l-lights down low

And we gon' get it on
We gon' get it on
I know what you want
Yeah, I know what you want
