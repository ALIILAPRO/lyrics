		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the panic somewhere in your eyes
Yeah, in your eyes
I don't wanna tell but it's brought us here tonight
Yeah, back to life

If you're gonna leave me hangin'
Then you're gonna leave me dead
I'm never going home
If you're not there

I wanna give in to your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done? (Oh)
I wanna give in to your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done?

I wanna taste the secrets that you hide
And make 'em mine (ah)
Come take me to the edge of afterlife
And take your time

If you're gonna leave me hangin'
Then you're gonna leave me dead
Oh, I'm never going home
If you're not there, oh

I wanna give in to your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done? (Oh)
I wanna give in to your dark temptation
I wanna touch you like nobody does, oh
People like you and me were born to run
So where we going when the dancing's done?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohh-oh
When the dancing's done
When the dancing's done
