		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today I found a way out of my bed
Yet I'm still stuck inside my head
I grit my crooked teeth to everyone who looks at me
As if it means a thing
I must be too fucked up to notice
Am I too fucked up to notice?
I'm too fucked up to notice
Just how decomposed I am
I'm sick of all the ways I think about myself
The poster child for lack of mental health
I think I deserve to be at peace
I think I deserve to be happy now, don't you think?
I deserve to be...

Is it time to go home yet?
Is it time to go home?
Is it time to go home yet?
When do I get to leave this place?
When do I get to go home?
When do I get to leave this place?
Is it time to go home yet?
Is it?

I've got a frown upside down
I've got a frown upside down
I've got a frown upside down
I've got a frown upside down
I've got a frown upside down
