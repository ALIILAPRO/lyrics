		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  MITO, ah, ah (ah)

I'm in a winterfall
You're the only one I want to ah, ah (ah)
In a winterfall
I'm in a winterfall

Can you get this boulder off me?
No God in me
I fall on my knees
The world will see
The war in me
It's all I need
When you see me loving you

Tell me where I went wrong on the surface
I set my wings ablaze
'Cause I thought you would barely notice

Tell me what you want from me
It's killing me
And I'll still commit
'Cause you fucked with me
Oh, it's mutiny
It's not new to me
That it just came down to

You're the only one I want to ah, ah (ah)
In a winterfall
I'm in a winterfall
You're the only one I want to ah, ah (ah)
In a winterfall
I'm in a winterfall

You got me carelessly
Looking so cautious
You drilled into my brain
Went dead
And I lost you in the process

So tell me why you went for me
It's killing me
And I'll still commit
'Cause you fucked with me
Oh, it's mutiny
It's not new to me
That it just came down to

You're the only one I want to ah, ah (ah)
In a winterfall
I'm in a winterfall
You're the only one I want to ah, ah (ah)
In a winterfall
I'm in a winterfall (you)

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, now I get what you mean
When it hurts you
Now I get what you mean
When you want to feel
Oh, I get it
Now, I get it
I get what you mean
When you wanna see something (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're the only one who made me feel like something
Feel like something

In a winterfall (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
In a winterfall (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
In a winterfall
In a winterfall
In a winterfall
