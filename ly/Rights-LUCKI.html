		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yo, yo
This is a high-quality film, right?
Ayy, ayy, yo, yo

She gon' keep fakin' like she
Don't know what's happening
Woah, ayy, yo, yo, ayy
She gon' keep fakin' like she
Don't know what's happening
I'm not who they capping with
More expensive average shit
That's your mans, you pat him down
Know your ho gon' let her in
I don't want no snakes around me
I come from a savage pit
I got niggas looking for me
Even ones that's not legit
I was stacking dirty hundreds
Re-ing up with counterfeit's
He sip lean, get fat, and quit
I'ma die over this shit
Niggas mugging over pussy
He gon' die over that bitch
Know that I'm gon' get the truth 'cause
You can't lie to me with fear
I won't make no friend of you and
I don't ride when you appear
Spent your last on that lil coupe
Ain't make a dime the whole new year
Told you all these niggas fu, I don't know
Why you brought me here, woah, ayy, ayy
I ain't takin' nothing for granted
No chances
I only want advances and cash on the random
Who they want, ayy, woah
What's the scope, ayy, ayy
Them or me, not even close, huh, huh
Pick a script, ayy, ayy, play a role, uh
I'm busting scripts, I pray they go, ayy
Ayy

All these different scenes
All these wannabes
All these wannabes, they forgot they dream
They just wanna be, that's the funny thing
All these different scenes
They just wanna be

Yo, yo, ayy, ayy, ayy
What they want, different scope
Them or me, not even close
