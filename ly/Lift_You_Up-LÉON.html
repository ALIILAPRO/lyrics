		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear the rain again
Baby, I'm looking down, back at you
Where you goin'?
Tell me, don't you want to see it through?

Oh, it's tearing me apart
When your heart goes into silence
And I just want to hold you
When your spirit breaks in two, mmm-mmm

Hey, baby
I wanna lift you up
Hey, baby
I wanna lift you up
Love lives on forever
The thunder never lasts
So hold on, don't you worry
The sun is coming back
Hey, baby
I wanna lift you up

In the distance
I can see it in your eyes
You're fading out
Head is underwater
Honey, don't you know?
You walk a solid ground
We can head into the dark
And I will follow
Right beside you
And when the night is falling
Won't let it get the best of you

Hey, baby (lift you up, I wanna lift you up, I wanna)
I wanna lift you up (lift you up, I wanna lift you up, I wanna)
Hey, baby (lift you up, I wanna lift you up, I wanna)
I wanna lift you up (lift you up, I wanna lift you up, I wanna)

Love lives on forever (lift you up, I wanna)
Thunder never lasts (lift you up, I wanna)
So hold on, don't you worry (lift you up, I wanna)
The sun is coming back (lift you up, I wanna)

Hey, baby (lift you up, I wanna lift you up, I wanna)
I wanna lift you up (lift you up, I wanna lift you up, I wanna)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)

(Lift you up, I wanna)
The sun is coming back (lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
I wanna lift you, ooh (lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
(Lift you up, I wanna)
