		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shouldn't have to write something for you
We both know it won't represent the truth
The reality is greater than I say
'Cause words cannot express what we create
But even still despite all this, I had to speak of what it is
Everything around must understand

I feel like I'm a bird up in the trees
They communicate with things they cannot see
They talk about the things that they must feel
I hear 'em speak and I know now it is real

And if this is just a mating call, then hear my voice and hear it all
Please understand this feeling within me
'Cause you know that all the words are just for you
I shout my lungs, I beat my drums, yes I do
'Cause I am here to say and sing, that you're my everything, my everything 
Everything

Tattoo rings, tattoo rings
This means more to me than music that I sing
Tattoo rings, tattoo rings
Oh, thank you universe for everything

You love my soul and my soul loves you too
You love my soul and my soul loves you too
You love my soul and my soul, my soul loves you
You love my soul and my soul, my soul loves you

Even in another life I'd hope to see you by my side
So we can get again these tattoo rings
One thing I have certainty
Is that I shall spend eternity
Finding you with a mating call I sing
