		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, fuck
Whoah
Me walking up the stairs and looking through my phone
These messages I will never read them at all
I tried the road
But it got cold
So I just slit my wrists, yeah
Pussy boy watch your tone
Lay me down where the wind goes up
Light a fat blunt while the bitch gets pumped
Sit right next to the cigarette cup
Ash on my jeans and I'm in the head fucked
Aight, bet
See me get wrecked
When I go to bed, covered in cold sweat
Death wish
Devilish grin
Burial foolish
Shed my own skin
I'm taking the plunge, wow
Taking your lunch, damn
Taking whatever I want from the cunt
Gimme, gimme
Bitches and blunts
Juicy, delicious that's what I'm about
Gimme dope I smoke it all
I'm choking on a bag of woe
Gasoline to light me hoe
Natural born a killer crow
I rose from the water blunt puffing
I'm down but these bitches ain't coming
Ain't coming
I came from the bottom got nothing
I'm just trynna die fucking B. she bussin
I'll rise out the crib
From my death bed
Fist gripped round the axe
That's a death threat
Motherfuckers from the hood
Bout to find out
I'm a dead motherfucker with
Blackened lungs, screaming now
Whoah
Me walking up the stairs and looking through my phone
These messages I will never read them at all
I tried the road
But it got cold
So I just slit my wrists, yeah
Pussy boy watch your tone
I'll be in the murky water with the alligators
Swarming all around me
Like I'm Tommy from the Matrix
Catch me sleep walking off a cliff
That's called a glacier
And Imma prolly have to fucking see you bitches later, uh
Ahh
Spider-man, spider web shot
And it landed on my fucking kneecap
Pull up in this bitch like Kermit the Frog
She's sucking the glock
I'm ducking like Bogg
