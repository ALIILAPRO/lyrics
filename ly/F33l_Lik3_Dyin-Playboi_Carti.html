		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life
I was
Ooh, I was in love with the wrong guy (Boy)
Baby, won't you tell me why I feel like dyin'

And I feel like dyin' if you not mine
Shawty front line, yeah, she top of the line
Yeah, she top tier, yeah, she hold it down
We can find out, we can find out, we can find out, yeah
We can find out, we can find out, we can find out, yeah
We can find out, we can find out, we can find out, yeah
Yeah

If you feel like dyin'
If you feel like dyin' for love
If you feel like dyin'

(On a bright fall morning)
I done met different type of girls, yeah (stood a little while within it)
(Man, you have to know)
I've done been all across the world
Now it's time to show 'em what I learned
Now it's time to show 'em what I learned

Before I die
Every day I'm dyin' (woah)
Every day I'm dyin'

Uh, Rockstar shit like I'm Jimi Hendrix
Popstar baby, like I'm Jimi Hendrix, yeah (all my life)
Light my cigarette up like an incense, yeah
Light my cigarette up like an incense (all my life)

And I know I'm dyin' (woah)
This shit got me dyin' (woah)
This shit got me dyin'

(On a bright fall morning)
My mama always knew I was a star (stood a little while within it)
Sacrifices every day, yeah
She gave me the keys to her only car (man, you have to know)
I took that bitch and I went far
I'm one of the greatest like an all-star
I can't fall
Gotta stand tall
Back against the wall
Fuck all of y'all

On a bright fall morning, I'm with it
I stood a little while within it
Man, you have to know
Know the way it goes
I feel like dyin' (woah)
I feel like dyin'
I feel like dyin'
