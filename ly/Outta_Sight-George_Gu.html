		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
(Oh oh)
We gonna live a good life I won't let you down
Drippin' all this water but I'm never gonna drown
Focused on the vision
I don't care about the others yeah I'm different (oh)
I'm trynna put the team on I'm runnin' it down
Spend like twenty bands when all the brothers go out
I got it cuz I'm driven
I'm the only one it's not a competition (oh)
So I'm froze up
Rockin' in a foreign with the doors up
Livin' like the heavens really chose us
Droppin' all these bitches I got not trust (got no trust nah)
It ain't nice yeah
Breakin' all these hearts they trynna fight yeah
VVSs shine without a light yeah
Takin' off in foreigns outta sight yeah (outta sight outta sight outta sight)
Shawty wanted me cuz I never stay down
In another league when I'm runnin' this town
No I don't lose yeah
No I don't lose yeah (no I don't lose yeah)
I got me all these bands cuz I know I work harder
Always gettin' closer all these bitches gettin' farther
It's me and my crew yeah
We makin' the moves yeah (we makin' the moves yeah)
Made it look easy copped a rollie or something
Yeah I'm shootin' all my shots they call me Kobe or something
Got my name on the internet they know me or something (hey)
All these haters in the same place they cozy or something (yeah)
Got a new AP so they now showin' love yeah
Pull up in a foreign I ain't takin' a bus
When I started from the bottom there was no one to trust (no trust)
Only needed all the money never needed a front
So I'm froze up
Rockin' in a foreign with the doors up (doors up)
Livin' like the heavens really chose us
Droppin' all these bitches I got not trust (got no trust nah)
It ain't nice yeah
Breakin' all these hearts they trynna fight yeah
VVSs shine without a light yeah
Takin' off in foreigns outta sight yeah
All my brothers yeah they always got me right yeah
All my brothers yeah they always got me right yeah
