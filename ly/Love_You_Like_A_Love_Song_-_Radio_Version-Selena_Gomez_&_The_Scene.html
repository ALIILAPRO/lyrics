		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been said and done
Every beautiful thought's been already sung
And I guess right now, here's another one
So your melody will play on and on, with the best of 'em
You are beautiful, like a dream come alive, incredible
A centerfold miracle, lyrical
You saved my life again
And I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (oh)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

Constantly, boy you played through my mind like a symphony
There's no way to describe what you do to me
You just do to me, what you do
And it feels like I've been rescued
I've been set free, I am hypnotized by your destiny
You are magical, lyrical, beautiful
You are, and I want you to know, baby

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat (oh)
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you, I love you, like a love song)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat

No one compares
You stand alone, to every record I own
Music to my heart that's what you are
A song that goes on and on

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you, I love you)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (like a love song, like a love song)
And I keep hitting repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat-peat
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you, love song, baby)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you, love song, baby)
I, I love you like a love song, baby (I love you, I love you)
Like a love song
