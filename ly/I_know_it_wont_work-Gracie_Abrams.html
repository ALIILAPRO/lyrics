		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left you here
Heard you keep the extra closet empty
In case this year
I come back and stay throughout my twenties
What if I won't?
How am I supposed to put that gently?
And down the road
You will love me until you resent me
Mm, mm, mm

I've had the thought
Tried to work it out through anxious pacing
What if I'm not
Worth the time and breath I know you're saving?
But it's a lot
All the shine of half a decade fading
The whole facade
Seemed to fall apart, it's complicated
Mm, mm, hmm-mm

And part of me wants to walk away 'til you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try moving on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?

I know it won't work like that

I'll open up
I'm thinking everything you wish I wasn't
The call was tough
But you're better off, I'm being honest
So won't you stop
Holding out for me when I don't want it?
Just brush me off
'Cause I'm your ghost right now, your house is haunted

And part of me wants to walk away 'til you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try moving on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?

(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah) oh, oh
I know it won't work like that, huh?
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah) oh, oh, oh
I know it won't work like that, huh?

And part of me wants to walk away 'til you really listen
I hate to look at your face and know that we're feeling different
'Cause part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
Why won't you try moving on for once? That might make it easy
I know we cut all the ties but you're never really leaving
And part of me wants you back, but
I know it won't work like that, huh?
