		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
And it's the only way to live in cars

Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
And it keeps me stable for days in cars

Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please
If I open my door in cars

Here in my car
I know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right in cars

Here in my car (nothing seems)
Here in my car (nothing seems)
Here in my car (nothing seems)
In cars

Here in my car (nothing seems)
Here in my car (nothing seems)
Here in my car (nothing seems)
In cars
