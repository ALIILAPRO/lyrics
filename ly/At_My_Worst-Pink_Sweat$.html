		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I call you baby?
Can you be my friend?
Can you be my lover up until the very end?
Let me show you love, oh, no pretend
Stick by my side even when the world is caving in (yeah)

Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

If you stay forever, let me hold your hand
I can fill those places in your heart no one else can
Let me show you love, oh, not pretend (yeah)
I'll be right here, baby, you know it's sink or swim

Oh, oh, oh, don't
Don't you worry
I'll be there, whenever you want me

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth (yeah)
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first (you first)
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I need somebody who can love me at my worst
Know I'm not perfect but I hope you see my worth
'Cause it's only you, nobody new, I put you first
And for you, girl, I swear I'd do the worst
