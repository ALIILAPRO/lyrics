		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try to think about tomorrow
But I always think about the past

About the things that didn't last

If I could go to the beginning
Then for sure I would be another way

Make it better for today

If I could go to the beginning
I would be another way

Make it better for today

Remember when we were happy? 
If I'm late can I thank you now? 

I'm gonna try anyhow

I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now

That's all I think about now

I remember we were happy
That's all I think about now

If you have any doubt
I want to thank you anyhow
