		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been there biting my tongue
Tryna hold on to what I'm feeling
'Cause I know that it's safe in my head
You got my heart beating so loud
Wanna scream out my lips are silent
I'm sick of fighting it

I feel the rush rising up to the back of my throat
I can't hide
I can't get enough of the way that you're looking at me
With those eyes

I really wanna say this
I don't wanna lose this thing that we got
I'm just telling you how I feel
'Cause if you walk away and
I don't get to say it
I don't know what would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you

What would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you
What would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you

I swore to myself
There ain't no doubt
We're keeping love out
I wasn't strong enough
I didn't see it coming at all
Letting you in under my skin
Then I give in like a fool in love
But I tried fooling us

Can't lie to myself again
Can feel that we're more than friends
But I choke up every time

I really wanna say this
I don't wanna lose this thing that we got
I'm just telling you how I feel
'Cause if you walk away and
I don't get to say it
I don't know what would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you

What would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you
I don't know what would I, what would I, what would I do?

I really wanna say this
I don't wanna risk this thing that we got
But if you walk away and
I don't get to say it
I don't know what, what I would do
I can't live without you
I can't live without you
I can't live without you

I don't know what would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you
I don't know what would I, what would I, what would I do?
I can't live without you
