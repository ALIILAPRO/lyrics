		  (I-I'm)
(I-I'm)
(I-I'm working on dying)
(Bnyx)
Hmm
Woo-hoo, hmm, woo (hmm)

Man, the devil been watching my ties 
Man, the devil been watching my eyes (woo, look at my chop down, look at my left, ahh)
When I boot up, I go to the sky, when I food up, I go in that lockdown mode
I just hope that I make it, don't die, ah, I just hope that I see twenty five (five)
I'm knowing I had a fit (fit), I'm changing the rules like a ref, hah
I grab on that bitch like a steel, I just clap on this bitch like a fiend, yeah
Pull up on the jet while it land
Pull up to LA with a bag, yeah
Pull up to New York with a stack (yeah)
I just be quiet 'bout shit, I don't brag (yeah)
Pull up in a fast car, Cullinan, bitch, not a Jaguar
Colored Bugatti, this bitch go three hundred, I'm pushing this bitch on the blacktop (yeah, yes)
I dropped five hundred K, bitch, I tweak, made this shit all in my sleep (swerve)
Made it back, two M's, yeah I don't sleep (swerve, swerve)
I'm speeding off bitch, yeah you weak (swerve, swerve)
I know when the world fuck with me, they suckin' my dick in my sleep (swerve)
I run up the muhfuckin' M's, I'm touching a M each week
I hop on this shit and I beat, I turn up I beat on the beat

I told them to shut the fuck up, that all of their shit is so weak
Pull up and stab on they ass, pull up and pull up the grass, huh
I drop a mil' on a tab, but nah, I ain't paying it back, bitch (uh)
I promise, lil' bitch, you'll get stabbed, I put it on your fuckin' back
I blowin' your bae out, I'm callin' your pap, callin' your dad
It's time to collapse, all of my money, all of my swag, I'm takin' it back
Shipping them off, shut the fuck up, I'll show you the trap (I'll show you luh trap)
I was just swervin' that daily, was swervin' that muhfuckin' Cat
You can pull up to my crib, and you gon' end up dead (bop bop)

Man, the devil been watching my ties, man, the devil been watching my eyes
When I boot up, I go to the sky, when I food up, I go in that lockdown mode
I just hope that I make it, don't die, ah, I just hope that I see twenty five (five)
I'm knowing I had a fit, I'm changing the rules like a ref, hah
I grab on that bitch like a steel, I just clap on this bitch like a fiend, yeah
Pull up on the jet while it land
Pull up to LA with a bag
Pull up to New York with a stack
I just be quiet 'bout shit, I don't brag
Pull up in a fast car, Cullinan, bitch, not a Jaguar
Call up Bugatti, this bitch go three hundred, I'm pushing this bitch on the blacktop (yeah, yes)
I dropped five hundred K, bitch, I tweak, made this shit all in my sleep
Made it back, two M's, yeah I don't sleep
I'm speeding off bitch, are you weak
(I know when the world fuck with me, they suckin' my dick in my sleep)
(I run up the muhfuckin' M's, I'm touching the M each week)
(I hop on this shit and I beat, I turn up I beat on the beat)
(Hmm, hmm)
(Hmm)
