		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey old man, where's my old man?
Let me know before, I'm an old man

Cut anybody off, even my own father
Never been rattled since I was a toddler
Not talking 'bout that money, please don't bother
Only time I'm religious is the all mighty dollar
Two routes to go, but one destination
Steady going the wrong way with no hesitation
Just me and my mom, taught myself to be a man
Now I hang around the villains getting, words from a wise man
Getting into shit, start gangs with my friends
Some are in jail, some are buried in the land
All these tattoos, yeah, I'm misunderstood
Haven't spoke to a Thompson, changed my last name to wolf

Hey old man, where's my old man?
Let me know before, I'm an old man
Hey old man, where's my old man?
Let me know before, I'm an old man

Levi's cuffed to show my boots are made of snakes
Rattles start to shake, Grim Reaper with a rake
When I walk up in the place, you stare death in the face
Never looking at mistakes, I'ma do what it takes
Bitch bad like Bettie Page, Ghost Rider like Nick Cage
Clear my room with some sage, Devil talk to me every day
I ain't gotta do shit, but stay Native and keep it slum
Head spinning like a vinyls, while I'm drinking on some rum
Half black and half Choctaw, I'm a motherfuckin' outlaw
All black Johnny Cash, stomping down Crenshaw
Leather on my skin, I was born to fucking sin
Wolves are my kin, I was born in the den

Hey old man, where's my old man?
Let me know before, I'm an old man
Hey old man, where's my old man?
Let me know before, I'm an old man

Forgive me father, but you're goddamn right I sinned
I torched too much land from the banks of your empty hands
Are you hiding from me? I promise I'm not gonna hurt you
The same tears you made when I was ten
Run on now, back where the weak survive
And if you here from me again
Pretend you're not alive
