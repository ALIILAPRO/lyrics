		  Goin' live on my birthday
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane
You can race with us, but it ain't safe
Goin' live on my birthday (birthday)
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
(New chain)
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane (sane)
You can race with us, but it ain't safe (woo)

Ayy, goin' live it's ya birthday (ayy)
You a bad bitch, lemme move you to LA
Heard you fucked a few rappers
Told her it's okay (hmm)
I'ma still fuck the bitch anyways (bi-)
All black Maybach, you can ride it any day (woo)
Bum bitches in my ear
Tell her move out the way
Meet my best friend, Ben Frank
Throw it in ya face (ya)
Blowin' all this cake
I ain't lookin for a soul mate
How can I trust a bitch?
She can't even walk straight (haha)
Hit me on my FaceTime
I ain't tryna see the face
I'm insane, got game like EA
Sportin' all these chains
You ain't gon' find these on eBay
Broke ass niggas

Goin' live on my birthday (ha)
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane
You can race with us, but it ain't safe
Goin' live on my birthday (birthday)
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
(New chain)
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane (sane)
You can race with us, but it ain't safe

Pull up in this bitch with my birthday twin (yeah)
Body's gonna body in a big body Benz (mwah)
I'ma bring my bitches, bring your rich nigga friends
From the jet to the yacht, naked in the south of France
It's my birthday, bitch, these my birthday rules (hey)
I ain't spendin' nothin', all the drinks on you (yeah)
I hope that ain't you nigga, 'cause he tryna get loose (what?)
See me comin' through and a bitch better move (bitch, move)
Lil' brat, I'ma get what I want (that's right)
Eight shots, I'ma act like a ho (okay)
Say the liquor make me nasty, nigga, so? (So, what?)
If you fuckin' up my vibe, you gotta go

Goin' live on my birthday
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane
You can race with us, but it ain't safe
Goin' live on my birthday (birthday)
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
(New chain)
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane (sane)
You can race with us, but it ain't safe

Talk to her crazy, that's her birthday wish
So I told her, "Happy birthday, bitch"
Ass fat, give it a Hershey kiss
Mushrooms while in Turks, a birthday trip
Made it to another year, she thank the Lord
She must be Christian with all this Christian Dior
When she pop out, you know it's on the floor
You model in magazines, she be in the Forbes
Your birthday gift better be pricey
Fuck thoughtful, she rather it icy
Bad bitch, can't buy her no Nikes
For her birthday, I treat her like she wifey

Goin' live on my birthday (4Hunnid)
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane
You can race with us, but it ain't safe
Goin' live on my birthday (birthday)
Spent a hundred racks on a new chain
(New chain)
Bitches goin' dumb, we goin' insane (insane)
You can race with us, but it ain't safe (that's right)

Goin' live on my birthday (birthday)
Goin' live on my birthday
