		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey, woman)
(Hey, woman)

Hey, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (ayy)
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman
Let me be your woman
Woman, woman, woman (ayy)
I can be your woman
Woman, woman, woman

What you need?
She give tenfold, come here, papa, plant your seed
She can grow it from her womb, a family
Provide lovin' overlooked and unappreciated, you see (yeah)
You can reciprocate
I got delicious taste
You need a woman's touch in your place
Just protect her and keep her safe
Baby, worship my hips and waist
So feminine with grace
I touch your soul when you hear me say
"Boy, let me be your woman"

Let me be your woman (daddy)
Woman, woman, woman (I know) (ayy)
I can be your woman (daddy)
Woman, woman, woman (I know)
Let me be your woman (daddy)
Woman, woman, woman (I know) (ayy)
I can be your woman (daddy)
Woman, woman, woman

I can be your lady, I'm a woman
I'm a motherfucker but they got a problem
Put some babies in your life and take away the drama
Put that paper in a picture like a diorama
Gotta face a lot people that are opposite
'Cause the world told me, "We ain't got that common sense"
Gotta prove it to myself that I'm on top of shit
And you will never know a God without a Goddess
As honest as fuckin' honest get
And I could be on everything
I mean I could be the leader, head of all the states
I could smile and jiggle it 'til his pockets empty
I could be the CEO, just look at Robyn Fenty
And I'ma be there for you 'cause you on my team, girl
Don't ever think you ain't hella these niggas dream girl
They wanna pit us against each other when we succeedin' for no reasons
They wanna see us end up like we Regina on Mean Girls
Princess or queen, tomboy or king (yeah)
You've heard a lot, you've never seen (nah)
Mother Earth, Mother Mary rise to the top
Divine feminine, I'm feminine (why?)

Woman (daddy)
Let me be your woman (let me be your)
Woman, woman, woman (I need to be your) (daddy)
I can be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman (daddy)
Let me be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman (daddy)
I can be your woman (I know)
Woman, woman, woman

(Hey, woman)
(Hey, woman) mm-mm
(Hey, woman) mm-mm, mm
(Hey, woman)
