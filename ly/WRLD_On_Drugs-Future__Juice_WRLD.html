		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel like (I'm working on dying)
The world on drugs (The world on drugs)
Drugs
I need a fix

The world on drugs, can you give me some?
I don't feel no pain 'cause this pill got me numb
The world on drugs, the world on drugs
Yeah the world on drugs
The world on drugs, yeah the world on drugs (the world on drugs)

I can hear these voices in my head
If I'm sober, then I might be dead
I can see the devil in my bed (in my bed)
I was born a rebel, I'm not scared (rebel)
You been takin' drugs, and you been hidin' it from me
You been takin' drugs, and you've been lyin' to me (ayy)
I don't believe you
I done popped off, I don't believe you
You a knockoff, I don't believe you
Gon' and pop off

'Cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Ayy, 'cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Ayy, 'cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Ayy, ayy, 'cause the world, 'cause the world
'Cause the world on drugs
'Cause the world on drugs

She on the molly in the party, got your girl on drugs
You don't gotta to pay for none of these Perkys, bitch, the pills on us
You don't gotta pay me for my time, bitch, the thrill's on us
It's all love, it's all love
I can't feel my motherfuckin' face, oh word
I'm a numb nigga
Choppa on me with the drum, nigga
If you run up on me, you a dumb nigga
Shoot shit, ah
Molly in my body, I'ma boot shit, ah
I don't see nobody gettin' high like us

Ay, I don't believe you
I done popped off, I don't believe you
You a knockoff, I don't believe you
Gon' and pop off

'Cause the world on drugs
Ay, 'cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Ayy, 'cause the world on drugs (the world on drugs)
Ayy, ayy, 'cause the world, 'cause the world
'Cause the world, 'cause the world
'Cause the world on drugs

I came in stylin', I don't need a stylist (I don't need a stylist)
Yeah I'm good on deposits, I don't need a wallet
'Bout to go up, call me Scotty
I'm 'bout to go up, you can pass me a water
I pop the pills in the 'Rari
Had lil' mama gone in the passenger
You tryna sneak and get high
You need to come talk with me
I just be actin' shy, poppin' these Mollies
I can't never be sober
I'ma come knockin' at your door like Jehova
Girl, I brought us a pill, let's go take it (let's take it)
I brought us some chronic, ain't gon' lace it
We been in the club, in the matrix
There's not a better feelin', no replacin' it

The world on drugs, can you give me some?
I don't feel no pain 'cause this pill got me numb
The world on drugs, the world on drugs
Yeah the world on drugs, the world on drugs
Yeah the world on drugs (the world on drugs)

I can hear these voices in my head
If I'm sober then I might be dead (might be dead)
I can see the devil in my bed (in my bed)
I was born a rebel I'm not scared (I'm a rebel)
You been takin' drugs, and you been hidin' it from me (hidin')
You been takin' drugs, and you've been lyin' to me (yeah)
Ayy, I don't believe you (I don't believe you)
I done popped off, I don't believe you (I don't believe you)
You a knockoff, I don't believe you (don't believe you)
Gon' and pop off
'Cause the world on drugs
