		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There’s a madness I can’t fight 
And it calls to me at night
Where it whispers of the things I could be
You have nightmares, I have mine
Do yours keep you up at night? 
Cause mine sing me off to sleep 

I was a mistake so you cast me off aside 
Like that’s all I’d ever be - Like it’s all I’d ever be 
But I’m back to take everything that’s rightly mine 
And we all have you to thank
Yeah we all have you to thank 

So when you next hear my name
Know I’m the monster that you made 
That you made - That you - That you made 
Know I’m the monster that you made - That you made
Maybe I - Maybe I - I like it this way (I’m a monster) 

Why be good that doesn’t sound as fun 
Yeah I tried it once and then the high was done 
But lemme tell you there is something bout the dark that really makes me feel alive 
It’s so addicting, I do all I can to have that feeling crawling back again 
It’s like you’re falling but you rise, makes you wanna spread your wings and fly 

You think you’re special but you’re not 
You and your ego can go rot 
‘Cause I’m only the thing you’ve done right, and that’s sayin’ a lot
But don’t let that get to you head, 
‘Cause babe, you’re just as good as dead
I paid the price, but thanks to you this darker side is all mine 

Know I’m the monster that you made 
That you made - That you - That you made (that you made)
Know I’m the monster that you made - That you made
Maybe I - Maybe I - I like it this way 
Know I’m the monster that you made (I’m the monster) 
That you made - That you - That you made (that you made)
Know I’m the monster that you made - That you made
Maybe I - Maybe I - I like it this way
