		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hear the sound of love baby 
I can sing it for you 
Take off your pride tonight and be 
Yourself, I won’t judge you 

I Feel your words on my skin 
Your breath in my ears, I do hmm
In the depth of your eyes, 
A million tiny stars shine through

Float in my dreams 
Drowning in peace 
Yeah this is what you do to me 
Close my eyes, you’re all I see 
Your hands talk with my body
I-i-i don’t want 
Don’t want this moment to fly 
Just like we do right now 
Yeah this is what you do to me
Angels whispering at me 
Heaven is calling me
I just want you


I know you want me baby,
How come you bring me so much light ?
Give me illusions just like time

We’re going higher, holdings hands till the moon
This purple room was just made for me and you 
Biting your lips, like you are craving for food
Losing control, my heart is ready to bloom

Float in my dreams 
Drowning in peace 
Yeah this is what you do to me 
Close my eyes, you’re all I see 
Your hands burning  my body
I-i-i don’t want 
Don’t want this moment to fly 
Just like we do right now 
Yeah this is what you do to me
Angels whispering at me 
Heaven is calling me
I just want you
