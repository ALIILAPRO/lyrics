		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just a cigarette and it cannot be that bad
Honey, don't you love me and you know it makes me sad?
It's just a cigarette, like you always used to do
I was different then, I don't need them to be cool

It's just a cigarette and it harms your pretty lungs
Well, it's only twice a week, so there's not much of a chance
It's just a cigarette, it'll soon be only ten
Honey, can't you trust me when I want to stop I can

It's just a cigarette and it's just a Marlboro Light
Maybe, but is it worth it if we fight?
It's just a cigarette that I got from Jamie-Lee
She's gonna get a smack and I'm gonna give you three

It's just a cigarette and I only did it once
It's only twice a week so there's not much of a chance
It's just a cigarette and I'm sorry that I did it
Honey, can't you trust me when I want to stop I can

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
