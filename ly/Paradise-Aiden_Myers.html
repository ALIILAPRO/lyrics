		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been feeling kind of stressed out
These days
All up in my head now
OK
Tryna get the hell out
Of my way
Feeling kind of stressed out
I got lots of problems
that’s cool
I know how to solve them
Yes i do
I go out at midnight
stay up until the sunrise

It’s so much easier to breathe
When the city’s asleep
Just alone with the thoughts
In my mind
Nobody moving in sight
Its just me and the lights
And it feels like
And it feels like
Paradise

I’ve been kinda nervous
Wont lie
Maybe i deserve it
And thats fine
Cuz everybody's cooler than me lately and im just stuck here
driving myself crazy
And Im trying to change but i just let it be
Riding the wave but im lost out at sea
When all of the pressure is pushing on me

It’s so much easier to breathe
When the city’s asleep
Just alone with the thoughts
In my mind
Nobody moving in sight
Its just me and the lights
And it feels like
And it feels like

Nobody moving in sight
Its just me and the lights
And it feels like
And it feels like
Paradise
