		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass (bass, bass, bass, bass)

Yeah, it's pretty clear, I ain't no size two
But I can shake it, shake it, like I'm supposed to do
'Cause I got that boom boom that all the boys chase
And all the right junk in all the right places
I see the magazines (ah-ha) workin' that Photoshop (ah-ha)
We know that shit ain't real
Come on now, make it stop
If you got beauty beauty (ah-ha), just raise 'em up
'Cause every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top

Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size (shoo-wop, wop)
(Sha-ooh-wop, wop)
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
And no I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll (shoo-wop, wop)
(Sha-ooh-wop, wop)
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go ahead and move along

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, hey

I'm bringing booty back
Go 'head and tell them skinny bitches that
No, I'm just playing, I know y'all think you're fat
But I'm here to tell you
Every inch of you is perfect
From the bottom to the top

Yeah, my mama she told me don't worry about your size (shoo-wop, wop)
(Sha-ooh-wop, wop)
She says, boys like a little more booty to hold at night
(That booty, booty, uh, that booty, booty)
And no I won't be no stick-figure, silicone Barbie doll (shoo-wop, wop)
(Sha-ooh-wop, wop)
So, if that's what's you're into
Then go 'head and move along

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble (no treble)
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
(Said) I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
(I said) I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass (ooh)

Because you know I'm all about that bass
'Bout that bass, no treble
(Said) I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble
I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble (I'm all about that bass)
(Said) I'm all about that bass, 'bout that bass
'Bout that bass, 'bout that bass
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, ooh
You know you love this bass
