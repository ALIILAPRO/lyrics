		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is Chapter 2
We tie those fuckers up and boil alive all of you human witches
It is time motherfuckers

This is what you're gonna get fucking murdered for
All of humanities cancer will spread throughout this rotten planet
This is what we came for

Guess who's back you fuckers
Move the fuck up
The smell of humans makes me wanna rip your face apart
And shove a fucking blade up your ugly fucking cunt

I'll eat your kid limb by limb
I'll set the torso on fire
This is a new chapter, this is your torture, this is your death, this is your deprivation method

Your child's burning bodies will sink into my skin
While I use its jaw as a fucking ring
While I use its jaw as a ring

You know this sound, Parjure is emerging from underground 
Covering Paleface's back on this motherfucking killer track

Nowhere to hide when I start my Hunt
I'll bring you back where there's no more lights
To the darkest place from my darkest Word
Where will you hide your pride when you start to fucking cry?

Blackened sky upon our heads
Slamming Beatdown This is Paleface
Mental Cruelty
Some human beings don't deserve the gift of life
They just deserve to die

It's vicious you fuckers and we all fucking agree
There's a huge problem with humanity
Every man for himself
A loss of respect
No more equality just a general disconnect
With values that where once that important to us

I think it's about time for intelligent life to come to earth
And to save it from human dirt
Eliminate those that abuse their power
Those who like to devour
The money from those who have nothing in their hands
Those who lack the energy to take a stand
We can not deny
That we need to take actions to purify
An earth with potential to reach unseen perfection
Erase the wicked by natural selection
