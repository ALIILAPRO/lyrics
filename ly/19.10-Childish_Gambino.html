		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me tell you something true

I remember back when I was six years old
Daddy said "the world's so cold"
"There is something that you should know", uh
"You're so gorgeous", thank you daddy
"Nothing's really worth your time"
"But someday soon you just might find"
"The truth about the world's design", oh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
No, no, no, no, yeah, yeah, yeah
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know that, yeah

Now remember
You do what the hell you want
But someone's gonna smell your funk
You're exactly what they want (truth)
To be happy
Really means that someone else ain't
And balance ain't a one-food plate
Everything is give and take, oh oh

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change your truth, I can't get you used to this
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
And I know

Go' do it like this, OK
Shoulder shake, whoa (oh no)
Do it in and out, ayy, ayy

To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Can't get you used to this, no no no no
To be beautiful is to be hunted
I can't change the truth, I can't get you used to this
Ooh, give it to me now
Bring the strings back

To be beautiful is to be hunted
We are beautiful, yeah
That's so beautiful
That's so beautiful
