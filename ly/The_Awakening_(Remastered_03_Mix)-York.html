		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made me suffer like never before, 
Suffering and angels, 
I know now why, 
It's because of what I did to you, 
It's okay now, if you believe, 
I paid my prize and I did it for you, 
Those dark days of a millenium, was ment to make me strong, 
I guess I made you strong too, 
Thats why we suffer, and we suffer and all, 
I feel one with you now, so don't run away, 
It's you, you know 
It's you that saved me, and I want to save you, too
