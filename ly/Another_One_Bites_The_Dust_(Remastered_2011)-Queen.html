		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, let's go

Steve walks warily down the street
With the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet
Machine guns ready to go

Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this? 
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along
Without you when you're gone? 
You took me for everything that I had
And kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied? 
How long can you stand the heat? 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you, too
Another one bites the dust

Hey
Oh, take it
Bite the dust
Kinda dusty

Hey

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust, ow
Another one bites the dust, hey-hey
Another one bites the dust, eh-eh

Ooh, shout out
There are plenty of ways that you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him, you can cheat him
You can treat him bad and then leave him when he's down

But I'm ready, yes, I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating to the sound of the beat, oh, yeah

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust, yeah
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Ooh, shoot out
Hey-hey
All right
