		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Parts of me keep thinking
We don't know where to draw the line
But I can feel my heartbeat give in
I wish that I could read your mind

'Cause when we get too close
Like the room is set on fire, on fire
We rise through the smoke
Let the tension take us higher

Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na
Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na, yeah
Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na
Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na, yeah

Don't try to cool me down
Don't try to cool me down

Caught up in illusions
Every time you take me there
Either way, I'm losing
Standing on the edge again

We rise through the smoke
Let the tension take us higher, on fire
We rise through the smoke
Let the tension take us higher

Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na
Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na, yeah
Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na
Don't try to cool me down, ooh na na na
I need another round, ooh na na na, yeah

Don't try to cool me down
Don't try to cool me down
