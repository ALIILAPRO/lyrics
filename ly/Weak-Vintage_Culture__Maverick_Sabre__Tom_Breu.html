		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught up in a hello
I'm high in the breeze
Need some distant stranger
To find love for me
And I, and I, and I, and I, and I
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my

Baby, I'm weak, baby, it's hard
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Whenever you're free, whenever you are
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, I'm weak, baby, it's hard
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, it's sweet, we can go far
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Whatever you need, we can be stars
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, it's sweet, we can go far
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Tell me where to go (hey, hey)
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)

Hey, hey
Hey, hey

And I need the heights of your love
And I feel the lights coming down
And I need for your endless touch
And I see the time's running out (out)
Running (out)

Baby, I'm weak, baby, it's hard
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Whenever you're free, whenever you are
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, I'm weak, baby, it's hard
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, it's sweet, we can go far
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Whatever you need, we can be stars
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, it's sweet, we can go far
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Tell me where to go (hey, hey)
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)

Hey, hey
Baby, I'm weak
Hey, hey

(Out)
Running (out)

Baby, I'm weak, baby, it's hard
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Whenever you're free, whenever you are
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, I'm weak, baby, it's hard
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, it's sweet, we can go far
Tell me where we go (hey, hey)
Whatever you need, we can be stars
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Baby, it's sweet, we can go far
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
Tell me where to go (hey, hey)
Let me hear you go (hey, hey)
