		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eighteen, failed dream
Attracted to a bad scene
Think I'll made a couple lemons
Cataclysmic age to be
When you're out of luck and your mother's in need
I made my money for the crooks and pushers
In the hopes that I got somethin' together for the night
I'm going out
For the night
I'm going out

I'm only gettin' started
Don't mean to be disheartened
Felt like I've given up so many times before
But I'm still here climbin'
I'm only gettin' started
Don't need to be disheartened
Felt like I've given up so many times before
But I'm still here grindin'

I came home and you were on the floor
Floored by the letters and the council rigmarole
What I wouldn't do to get you out this hole
For tonight I gotta let go
But tonight you gotta let me let go

I'm only gettin' started
Don't mean to be disheartened
Felt like I've given up so many times before
But I'm still here climbin'
I'm only gettin' started
Don't need to be disheartened
Felt like I've given up so many times before
But I'm still here grindin'

I'm gettin' started
Gettin' started
I'm gettin' started
I'm only gettin' started

I'm only gettin' started (I'm gettin' started)
Don't mean to be disheartened (I'm gettin' started)
Felt like I've given up so many times before (I'm gettin' started)
But I'm still here climbin' (I'm gettin' started)
I'm only gettin' started (I'm gettin' started)
Don't mean to be disheartened (I'm gettin' started)
Felt like I've given up so many times before (I'm gettin' started)
But I'm still here grindin'
