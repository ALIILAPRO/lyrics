		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We'll I'm standing by a river but the water doesn't flow
It boils with every poison you can think of
Then I'm underneath the streetlights
But the light of joy I know
Scared beyond belief way down in the shadows

And the perverted fear of violence chokes a smile on every face
And common sense is ringing out the bells
This ain't no technological breakdown
Oh no, this is the road to Hell

And all the roads jam up with credit
And there's nothing you can do
It's all just bits of paper flying away from you
Oh, look out world
Take a good look what comes down here
You must learn this lesson fast and learn it well

This ain't no upwardly mobile freeway
Oh no, this is the road
Said, this is the road
This is the road to Hell
