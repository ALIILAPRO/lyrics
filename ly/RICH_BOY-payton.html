		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like oh my god, you need a rich boy
To give you all the power, like oh lord
Can you give me just an hour, say less girl
We can leave, it ain’t a problem
But the way you looking at got me thinking you don’t wanna

I don’t give a fuck about your man, he a moron
Couple drinks down, by now you’re taking more off
Says she wanna party so I took her to the rooftop
Guess she’s not shy, shoulda seen her take her socks off

Like grab the ribbon, fuck your feelings
The way she suck my soul I need some spiritual healing
Grab the ribbon, fuck your feelings
The way she suck my soul I need some spiritual healing
Like oh my god, you need a rich boy
To give you all the power, like oh lord
Can you give me just an hour, say less girl
We can leave, it ain’t a problem
But the way you looking at got me thinking you don’t wanna
You need a rich boy
To give you all the power, like oh lord
Can you give me just an hour, say less girl
We can leave, it ain’t a problem
But the way you looking at got me thinking you don’t wanna

Got me thinking you don’t wanna
Tell me why you’re always causing problems and the drama
If you really want me you would just give me a holla
But you’re wasting all my time and you’re wasting all my dollas
I guess that’s how the story goes
We could take it back to my place, we could fall outta our clothes
But you’re stuck up in your head, and it’s time for me to go
So I guess I’ll see you later or I’ll see you on my phone

Like grab the ribbon, fuck your feelings
The way she suck my soul I need some spiritual healing
Grab the ribbon, fuck your feelings
The way she suck my soul I need some spiritual healing
Like oh my god, you need a rich boy
To give you all the power, like oh lord
Can you give me just an hour, say less girl
We can leave, it ain’t a problem
But the way you looking at got me thinking you don’t wanna
You need a rich boy
To give you all the power, like oh lord
Can you give me just an hour, say less girl
We can leave, it ain’t a problem
But the way you looking at got me thinking you don’t wanna
