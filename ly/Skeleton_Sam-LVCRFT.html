		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We gather here for this special occasion
One night only in limited engagement
So stomp your feet and clap your hands
For Skeleton Sam and his graveyard band

I was just a little ghoul when I heard his name
He's the graveyard legend of the dancing game
Rumor has it he invented how to knock 'em dead
He's the reason that we all say "break a leg"

When the sun goes down all the ghosts come out
Zombies rise up from the ground
Monsters come from all the lands
Just to see the bones of Skeleton Sam

Dance, dance, dance
The way he move, you in a
Trance, trance, trance
Ooh, he make you wanna
Dance, dance, dance
Until you can't
Shaking every bone like Skeleton Sam

Every bone is double-jointed, he can twist 'em all
Spin his head on his finger like a basketball
No one knows where he's from but I hear he's the king
Of the Lafayette Cemetery, New Orleans

When the werewolves howl and the witches fly
That's when you know Sam's nearby
When you hear the sound of a million screams
They're probably watching him on ghost TV

Dance, dance, dance
The way he move, you in a
Trance, trance, trance
Ooh, he make you wanna
Dance, dance, dance
Until you can't
Shaking every bone like Skeleton Sam

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) la-la-la-la-la-la-la
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Dance, dance, dance
The way he move, you in a
Trance, trance, trance
Ooh, he make you wanna
Dance, dance, dance
Until you can't
Shaking every bone like Skeleton Sam (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Dance, dance, dance (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
The way he move, you in a (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Trance, trance, trance (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Ooh, he make you wanna (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Dance, dance, dance (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Until you can't (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Shaking every bone like Skeleton Sam (la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
