		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know sometimes e be like say
Nobody send you, that one na lie 
I dey for you my friend

Padi no vex for me
Say I never call you since
But I hope that you are well
I hope your market sell
Every day I dey pray for you
Make baba God bless you
I never forget you
How I go forget you?

See my shoulder
Make you rest upon me
You know I got you
Na me be your friend indeed
The money don show now
I don keep some for you
You no go suffer rara
'Cause anything I get na for me and you, yeah

How are you my friend?
How do you do my friend?
I know sometimes e be like say
Nobody send you, that one na lie
I dey for you my friend

How are you my friend?
How do you do my friend?
I know sometimes e be like say
Nobody send you, that one na lie
I dey for you my friend

Oremi Atata
You always dey my mind
Padi me, gan gan gan
I cherish you with my life
No worry yourself o
Everything go dey alright
And if anybody try you
You know itâ€™s gon be on sight

See my shoulder
Make you rest upon me
You know I got you
Na me be your friend indeed
The money don show now
I don keep some for you
You no go suffer rara
'Cause anything I get na for me and you yea

How are you my friend? (I see you my brother)
How do you do my friend? (See you my sister)
I know sometimes e be like say
Nobody send you, that one na lie
I dey for you my friend (friend it's been so long)

How are you my friend? (It's been so long)
How do you do my friend?
I know sometimes e be like say
Nobody send you, that one na lie
I dey for you my friend

I know sometimes e be like say
Nobody send you, that one na lie
I dey for you my friend

I know that I don't call enough
But you're always on my mind, oh
I dey for you my friend
