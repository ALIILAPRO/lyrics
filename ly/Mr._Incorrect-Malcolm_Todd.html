		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, I don't wanna talk
I give you my love
You tell me goodbye
(Yeah, yeah)
(One, two, three, uh, oh, oh)

Babe, I don't wanna talk
I give you my love
You tell me goodbye
We're calling it off
And now I feel great
I got a new friend who kisses my face
I'm good, I'm doing alright
I don't gotta call, we don't gotta fight
I'll see you around
Well maybe I won't
That is okay
Cause baby I'm on

Baby I'm on
Baby I'm on
Maybe it's fair
I'm moving along
Cause I've been complaining for months and months
I'll go slow
But you know
I could do it with anyone else
I'm thanking you for having me
Now I'm on and I made a new song
Couldn't (mumbling), fuck, fuck

Babe, I don't wanna talk
I give you my love
You tell me goodbye
We're calling it off
And now I feel great
I got a new friend who kisses my face
I'm good, I'm doing alright
I don't gotta call, we don't gotta fight
I'll see you around
Well maybe I won't
That is okay
Cause baby I'm on

I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I thought I was right, but you're never wrong
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I thought I was right, but you're never wrong
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I thought I was right, but you're never wrong
I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I thought I was right, but you're never wrong

And I'm rather mad
Cause I'm always cool
And I'd rather do this than go back to school
I'd tell you I miss you but I'm in a rush
Don't tell me my problems, I don't give a fuck
