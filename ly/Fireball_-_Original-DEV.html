		<p>
		  Fireball, I'm atomic all day now 
Talking bout game, got bars like a playground 
Hey now, I hope you're ready for the take down 
Tell cyranizzy to hit me with the break down 
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there 
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere 
Ayee she a fireball (fireball), ayee she a fireball 
I'm a fireball, bitch
I'm a fireball, baby, I get money 
What's funny, dollar bills in my tummy 
I'ma keep it moving, moving, stay runnin' 
Boppers keep on hopping, playboy bunny 
Keep the money coming
Keep the money coming coming 
Keep the money coming
Keep the money coming coming 
Now I got the world humming
I got the world humming humming
(humming humming) 
W-w-what-what-what-what chu looking at, trick (trick) 
Fireball, I'm atomic all day now 
Talking bout game, got bars like a playground 
Hey now, I hope you're ready for the take down 
Tell cyranizzy to hit me with the break down 
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there 
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere 
Ayee she a fireball (fireball), ayee she a fireball 
I'm a fireball, bitch
Now I'm ridin baby, it's a late night 
Got purp on deck in a straight light 
I create hype, while you sit tight 
Don't think twice when I spit I always hit it right 
Keep the money coming, keep the money coming coming 
Keep the money coming, keep the money coming coming 
Now I got the world humming
I got the world humming humming (humming humming) 
W-w-what-what-what-what chu looking at, triick (trick) 
Fireball, I'm atomic all day now 
Talking bout game, got bars like a playground 
Hey now, I hope you're ready for the take down 
Tell cyranizzy to hit me with the break down 
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there 
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere 
Ayee she a fireball (fireball), ayee she a fireball 
I'm a fireball, bitch
I, I just want to have it all 
Seeing everything I dream of (dream of)
Watch me rising like a phoenix (phoenix) 
And I, I'm never gonna fall 
'Cause I'm harder than the rest of them 
And I think I got, the best of them 
I'm a fireball, baby (baby) 
I'm a fireball, baby (baby) 
And I'm driving you crazy (crazy) 
'Cause I'm the lady (lady) 
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there 
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere 
Ayee she a fireball (fireball), ayee she a fireball 
I'm a fireball, bitch
You got me running over here, running over there 
Baby tell me, can I holla, I've been running everywhere 
Ayee she a fireball (fireball), ayee she a fireball 
I'm a fireball, bitch
I'm throwin' money over here, money over there 
Tryna get the party, throw my money everywhere 
Ayee, aye aye, a-ayee, aye aye 
You got me running over here, running over there 
Baby tell me, can I holla, I've been running everywhere 
Ayee, aye aye, aye ayee, aye aye 
I'm a fireball bitch
