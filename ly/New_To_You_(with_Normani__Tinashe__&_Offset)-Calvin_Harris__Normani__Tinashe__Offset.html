		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh
Uh

This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything
I think you might love me, baby
This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything
I think you might love me, baby

(Uh, yeah)
Bet a billion that you gon' like this
'Cause you never had a wild one like this
Don't really do one night shit
'Cause one night make 'em wanna whole life it
You know, I left my old lover in crisis
'Cause the new girl a-hella up tight
And God broke the mold when he made my type
You got the same vibe, that's what I like (yeah)
Who's all about me, and talk about me
And look at my pics all day (all day)
Who always say, "Please" when I got to leave
And say it ain't big to stay (yes)
Stay focused on T, I'm all that he needs
And don't ever play no games
I love when you say my name

This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything
I think you might love me, baby
This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything
I think you might love me, baby

I don't love you but you know I fuck with you
I think I wanna fly you to Peru from Malibu
I wish I had you to myself, I like your attitude, you too fly
She been talkin' to her friends, talkin' 'bout the new guy
Talkin' 'bout the money that I'm spendin'
I got visions so you winnin'
Body fine, need a mitten
If I fuck up, they forgiven
I was dead on relationships, you made me feel like livin'
I'ma stand on the business, 'cause I
I got multimillion plans for us all to survive
All I need for you to do is never fold and don't lie
I felt like you was the one when I had looked in your eyes
Open the door, she seen the Ghost and we should go take a ride
Doin' the most, don't ever post, don't let 'em see what we got
We're on the boat, enjoyin' the culture, let me get right inside
This shit new to me, I never show nobody this side

This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything
I think you might love me, baby
This might be news to you
This thing might feel new to you
But if you like everything
I think you might love me, baby (might love me, baby)

(Love) And testin' my patience
(Love) Don't you keep me waitin'
Energy, chemistry, you and me
Can't be made up
(Love) Has been cultivated
(Now) I'm yours for the taken
Fantasies, on repeat, you and me
Kissin', makin' love

Mm, no
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, whoa
Oh
