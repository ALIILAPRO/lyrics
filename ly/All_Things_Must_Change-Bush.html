		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All things (all things) must change

Forgive yourself, let it slide
You can't sink so far inside
Colors collide on the daydream
Bright like the face of the sun
Letting yourself become water
Love like you just begun

You always come fast
Walk like Superman
Run like the wind in the rain

All things (all things) must change (must change)
All things (all things) must change

Forgive your heroes inside
You can't run from what you hide
Give yourself to the dangers
Open yourself to the stars
Think of ancient symbols
The work of a brilliant heart

You always come fast
Walk like Superman
Run like the wind in the rain
Breathe through all of this
Nothing stays the same

All things (all things) must change (must change)
All things (all things) must change
All things (all things) must change (must change)
All things (all things) must change

There's something in the water (in the water)
All the fish are dead (fish are dead)
There's something in the water (in the water)
It was everything you said, it was everything

Walk like Superman
Run like the wind in the rain
Breathe through all of this
Nothing stays the same

All things (all things) must change (must change)
All things (all things) must change
All things (all things) must change (must change)
All things (all things) must change
