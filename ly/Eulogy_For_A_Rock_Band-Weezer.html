		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye heroes, you had a good run
Fifteen years of ruling the planet
But now your light's fading

Adios rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when time marches on?
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago

Women were screaming, guys were copying you
'Cause you moved the people to sobbing, inspiring
You spoke for the world in your songs

Adios rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when time marches on?
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago

(Ooh) We'll never forget the gems you made,
(Ooh) Let 'em fade
(Ooh) It's time that we laid you in your grave,
(Ooh) Let 'em fade
(Ooh) Goodbye

Adios rock band that we loved the most
This is a toast to what you did
And all that you were fighting for
Who could do more when time marches on?
Words come and go
We will sing the melodies that you did long ago
