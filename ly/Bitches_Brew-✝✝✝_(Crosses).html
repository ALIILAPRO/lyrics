		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the moon ascends
The wolves come out to see the end
They hide from view and wait
To watch the ghost inside you come awake

And when the shots go off, you'll hear them call
My heart is racing just to see it all
To watch it crawl out of your changing shape
To take out your breath and watch it come awake

From the flames of the fire
I feel you crawl into my bed 
Throwing shapes at the sky
I watch you climb into me

With your knees open
On display, you taunt the beast again
'Cause when you move and shake
That thing inside you comes awake
As you dance against the breathing wall
My claws are out, I want to feel it all
Feel it crawl inside you, changing shape
Take out your breath and feel you come awake

From the flames of the fire
I feel you crawl into my bed 
Throwing shapes at the sky
I watch you crying into me

Say something, pray for something
Say something, pray or something
Say something, pray for something
Say something, pray or something
Say something

From the flames of the fire
I watch you crying to me

From the flames of the fire
I feel you crawl into my bed
Throwing shapes at the sky
I watch you climb into me

Say something, pray for something
Say something, pray for something
Say
