		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  내 눈에 비친 창문 눈을 감아
바람이 부는 곳에 날 데려가
Wanna be myself
Wanna leave this hell
꺼내줘 제발
Stuck in a place between the space of heart and mind
시간을 쫓아 꿈을 찾아 흘러가
And so am I

Drop, sit on the floor
Thinking I'll stop
Can't take no more
준비될 때 크게 난 roar
That was the battle but this is the war

I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them, ah
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter, ah

I got a way it depends on the day
That I forget I'm the best, that's done it
Hard on myself, put my heart on a shelf
'Cause I forget that myself needs loving
어둠에 가려진
기억 모두 이젠 잊어
'Cause I know that I can make it out those days

Drop, sit on the floor
Thinking I'll stop
Can't take no more
준비될 때 크게 난 roar
That was the battle but this is the war

I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them, ah
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter, ah

어둠보단 밝음이 더 크잖아
너의 가치를 너가 잘 알잖아
You know the darker the day
The more you shine, oh

어두움이 지나 밝은 하루가 babe
You don't have to be afraid

And I'm not 'cause today I'll show you what I'm made of
Rise to the occasion
Got fears but I face them, ah
And I'll show you what I'm made of
A heart full of fire
Looking at a fighter, ah

I'll show you what I'm made of, what I'm made of (yeah, oh)
I'll show you what I'm made of (oh yeah)
I'll show you (you, you, you, you, you)
