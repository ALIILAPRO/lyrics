		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, they tried to stop me
But it was too late
Oh, there's no interfering my fate
They was trying to hold me in every way
Thinking I've taken everything I could take

Everybody's challenge turning into mine
And overcame adversity

With my head high, my
Make a stand with my head high, my
I'm not afraid to love, I'm not afraid to try, I'm not afraid to fly
With my head high, my

No, it wasn't easy, but everyday
Oh, I took one step closer to change
They didn't wanna see me break these chains
Being more than just a name and a face

昨日も明日も越えて
更にそのもっと先へ

With my head high, my
Make a stand with my head high, my
I'm not afraid to love, I'm not afraid to try, I'm not afraid to fly
With my head high, my

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

With my head high, my
Make a stand with my head high, my

With my head high, my
Make a stand with my head high, my
I'm not afraid to love, I'm not afraid to try, I'm not afraid to fly
With my head high, my
