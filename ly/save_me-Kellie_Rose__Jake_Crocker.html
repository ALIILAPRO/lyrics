		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are like a life vest,
Hold my chest,
Keep me safe and sound in a storm
Keep my breathing steady
Stay with me
Know me wholly keeping me warm
Never did i ever consider us together
Would rock my achey breaky heart forever
Never keep me waiting
Loving the anticipating
Of how we’ll keep on falling for each other
Baby, you know you save me
even better than, better than, better than I save myself
Oh, and i’m waiting
for you to tell me there, tell me there, tell me there’s no one else
Save me, hmm
oh, you know you do it easily
You make love flow up out of me
I am filled to capacity
I know that you and me will do
Irrevocable damage to
Anyone who stands in our way
Always have i wondered
What’s the lighting in the thunder
It’s a power trip
Flipped script
Of what this thing is
Move through me faintly
Same frequency
Baby this is all i’ve ever needed
Baby you know you save me
Even better than, better than, better than I save myself
Oh, and i’m waiting
For you to tell me there, tell me there, tell me there’s no one else
Oh i know this love within me nowadays is hard to find
But i can feel it now with you here, baby, right there by my side
I can see why every other love has failed me every time
You were meant to be mine
Baby, you know you save me
Even better than, better than, better than i save myself
Oh, and i’m waiting
For you to tell me there, tell me there, tell me there’s no one else
