		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't feel my senses
I just feel the cold
All colors seem to fade away
I can't reach my soul

I would stop running
If I knew there was a chance
It tears me apart to sacrifice it all
But I'm forced to let go

Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?

I can feel your sorrow

You won't forgive me
But I know, you'll be alright
It tears me apart that you will never know
But I have to let go

Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?

Everything will slip away
Shattered pieces will remain
When memories fade into emptiness
Only time will tell it's tale, if it all has been in vain

I can't feel my senses
I just feel the cold

Frozen
What can I do?
Frozen

Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you
You say that I am frozen, Frozen
