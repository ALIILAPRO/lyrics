		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will I ever see your face again
Not just photos from an Instagram
Will you say hello from across the street
From a place and time we used to meet
Sometimes everything just grows apart
Broken pieces from a busted heart
Not even the drugs seem to work
Living in the shadows where we lurk

Outside my window before the sun comes up to shine
It's just another vacant, cold, and lonely night

Do you remember the jokes we told
Rumors from a long, long time ago
Did we get over our innocence?
Did we take the time to make amends?
Will you dedicate a song to me?
Do you want me to just go away
I just want to be your nobody
Is there any chance that I can stay?

Outside my window there is nothing but a sky
It's just another vacant, cold, and lonely night

Outside my window there is nothing but a sky
It's just another vacant, cold, and lonely night

Do you remember the jokes we told
Rumors from a long long time ago
Did we get over our innocence?
Did we take the time to make amends?
