		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been drinking absinthe
I just did the math, it ain't adding up
I've had enough of
Running 'round this board game
You can know your own name
I won't give it up

Am I crazy?
Am I foolish?
Am I stupid
For playing these games with you?

If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flying
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm saying
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm staying
My two feet are in the sand

I've been reading old shit
And I can't make sense of it
Ain't no conspiracy that can save me
Living in the moment feels good to me
'Til it hurts and I need somebody

Am I crazy?
Am I foolish?
Am I stupid
For playing these games with you?

If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flying
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm saying
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm staying
My two feet are in the sand

Take me as I am
I'm tired of dancing around the point
Sharp and it is jagged
Like the shape of glass and it steals my voice

If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flying
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm saying
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm staying
My two feet are in the sand

If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flying
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm saying
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm staying
My two feet are in the sand
