		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

And it's half past three
And I got angel wings 
But a devil's grin 
And only one can win (tonight I'm gettin' some)

I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new (brand new)
Oh, I'll cry about it later
Ooh, ooh

I know tomorrow, I'll be love hungover
But I'm ready for a shameless summer
Champagne on ice only makes you stronger

I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new

And it's half past three (past three)
And I got angel wings (and I got angel wings)
But a devil's grin (devil's grin)
And only one can win

I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
Tonight, I'm havin' fun
I'll cry about it later
I'll cry about it later
Tonight I'm gettin' some
Tonight I'm gettin' something brand new
Oh, I'll cry about it later
Ooh, ooh

Pourin' it, pourin' it, pourin' it nonstop
Drinkin' it, drinkin' it, drinkin' it all up
Body to body, I almost forgot
You're not him, you're not her
I'll cry about it later
