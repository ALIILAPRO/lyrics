		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pisces are you a Virgo ?
Your eyes give me Gemini
Attitude give me a libra
But Scorpio only at night
Hardheaded like a Taurus
But driven like a Capricorn
Focus like an Aries
Every Time we link it’s tempting
Heavy hearted like a Leo
Cancer vibe I can see that too
Perfect balance with each other
Why would I want another at all ?
Yeah
Cause I got you with me here
Of course my ex still probably want me
I dubbed that b***h cause she ain’t s**t to me
When I’m with baby
I can feel the chemistry yeah
I can feel the chemistry e yeah
I can feel the chemistry stry stry
I can feel the chemistry yeah

FaceTime when you see me
yeah you get a weak
Don’t know what it is but you like it
I’m that n***a that can get you excited
3 in the morning when the horny's your highest
I know you been through the most
With your old n***a
That n***a was garbage
I keep it real with you
Ima be real with you
I like your energy
In love with ya spiritual
I know you like it
That I’m faithful
But I can still be a toxic n***a like you
Keep you around
I get inspired whenever you’re around
If you act up ima kick you right out
But you’re the perfect entertainment right now
Yeah yeah

Reek

Pisces are you a Virgo ?
Your eyes give me Gemini
Attitude give me a libra
But Scorpio only at night
Hardheaded like a Taurus
But driven like a Capricorn
Focus like an Aries
Every Time we link it’s tempting
Heavy hearted like a Leo
Cancer vibe I can see that too
Perfect balance with each other
Why would I want another at all ?
Yeah
Cause I got you with me here
Of course my ex still probably want me
I dubbed that b***h cause she ain’t s**t to me
When I’m with baby
I can feel the chemistry yeah
I can feel the chemistry e yeah
I can feel the chemistry stry stry
I can feel the chemistry yeah
