		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you want to go deeper, deeper
Than anybody's ever been before you, babe?

Mascara on, my hair's messed up, let's get it goin'
Dom Perignon, my head's been spinnin' all night long
Champs-Élysées, so high, G5, to Saint-Tropez
Just you and me all night, all day, I'm down to play

I know you've been hurt before
Close your heart and lock the door
You don't want to lose control
Baby, I just gotta know

Do you want to go deeper, deeper
Than anybody's ever been before you, babe?
Do you want to go deeper, deeper?
I just really need to know where you wanna go
Do you want to go deeper, deeper
Than anybody's ever been before you, babe?

Ah
I don't schedule, if you wanna get me, get flexible
Forget the yard, the pool, the Bentley's
So fashionable you're lasting all season, yeah
Lasting all season, ah
Make you believe in love
Can you get deep enough?
Can you get deep enough?

I know you've been hurt before
Close your heart and lock the door
You don't want to lose control
Baby, I just gotta know

Do you want to go deeper, deeper (ah)
Than anybody's ever been before you, babe?
Do you want to go deeper, deeper? (Deeper, deeper, babe)
I just really need to know where you wanna go
Do you want to go deeper, deeper (oh, deeper baby, baby)
Than anybody's ever been before you, babe? (Anybody's been before you, babe- ah)

(Anybody's been before you, babe)
