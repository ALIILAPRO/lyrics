		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep looking for one thing, looking for something
Looking for anything
Trying to find a way to make some sense of what's been happening
I keep hoping that this time, hoping that sometime
Hoping for anytime
Holding out for an antidote to free me from this pantomime

Not taking it anymore
I'll be breaking down the door
Stepping into the light, yes, I'll be

Feeding the fire tonight
Oh, need to feel the energy
Feel it rushing into me
Free our desire tonight
Oh, it's the only remedy
For everything that's ailing me tonight

I've been waiting for this one, yearning for someone
Praying for everyone
I stand ready to give you what you need to help you overcome
We all need a release, we keep searching for peace
We're all dying to live again
We're all ready to finally have a day that brings us back again

Can't take it anymore
This is what we've been fighting for
The end is in sight (and now we'll be)

Feeding the fire tonight
Oh, need to feel the energy
Feel it rushing into me
Free our desire tonight
Oh, it's the only remedy
For everything that's ailing me tonight

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Feeding the fire tonight
Oh, need to feel the energy
Feel it rushing into me
Free our desire tonight
Oh, it's the only remedy
For everything that's ailing me tonight
Feeding the fire tonight
Oh, need to feel the energy
Feel it rushing into me
Free our desire tonight
Oh, it's the only remedy
For everything that's ailing me tonight

(Feeding the fire tonight)
