		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatcha gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my hump My hump, my hump, my hump, my lovely little lumps Check it out
I drive these brothers crazy I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely They buy me all these iceys Dolce & Gabbana
Fendi and that Donna
Karan they be sharin'
All their money got me wearing fly Gear but I ain't askin'
They say they love my ass in Seven Jeans, True Religion
I say no but they keep givin'
So I keep on takin'
And no I ain't taken
We can keep on datin'
Now keep on demonstratin'
My love, my love, my love, my love You love my lady lumps
My hump, my hump, my hump
My humps they got you
Whatcha gon' do with all that junk
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump
Whatcha gon' do with all that ass
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'ma make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream
'Cause of my hump (hump), my hump, my hump, my hump My hump, my hump, my hump, my lovely lady lumps
In the back and in the front They say I'm really sexy
The boys they wanna sex me They always standin' next to me Always dancin' next to me
Tryin' to feel my hump, hump Lookin' at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it If you touch it
I'ma start some drama
You don't want no drama
No, no drama, no, no, no, no drama So don't pull on my hand, boy
You ain't my man, boy
I'm just Tryin' to dance, boy
And move my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump
My hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my hump, my hump My lovely lady lumps
My lovely lady lumps my lovely lady lumps
In the back and in the front
