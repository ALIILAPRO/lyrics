		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, and two, and three
And, mmm

Hennessy, I'ma need this liquid courage
All of it, oh, yeah
And I seen a man, seen a man
Sat at the bar, oh, yeah
And for a while, I'ma kiss goodbye to my worries
All of 'em, oh, yeah
No dinner, man, I started seein' the stars, oh

The sad, sad way to learn how
Skirt's too short, I got my curves out
I'm a little too lit, so call the last round

I get all dressed up
To go ahead, let myself down
So you could just hold me like my dress, skin-tight
We could pretend this is Saturday night
And it's alright, it's alright, mmm
So tell me who's next up? (Tell me who's next up)
To come on here and waste my time, mmm (to come on here and waste my time)
So you could just hold me like my dress, skin-tight
Could we pretend this is Saturday night?
It's alright, it's alright
It's alright, yeah-yeah

I'm about to tell you I think you're funny
Oh, honey, oh, no
I'm drinkin', I'm drinkin', I'm lovin' the light
Oh well, I don't care if you don't call, if you don't want me
You're lucky, you can try
You won't see the real me when you look in my eyes, oh

The sad, sad way to learn how
Skirt's too short, I got my curves out
I'm a little too lit, so call the last round

I get all dressed up (I get all dressed up)
To go ahead, let myself down (to go ahead, let myself down)
So you could just hold me like my dress, skin-tight
We could pretend this is Saturday night
And it's alright, it's alright, mmm
So tell me who's next up? (So tell me who's next up)
To come on here and waste my time, mmm (to come on here and waste my time)
So you could just hold me like my dress, skin-tight
Could we pretend this is Saturday night?
It's alright, it's alright
Yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, motion
Flowin' slow-motion (motion)
Think that I should maybe take a love potion
If I put it in my drink, would you sip some?
Take a little sip, and you should see what I become
This ain't love, I was hopin' (hopin')
Hopin' we could find somethin' more
Feels better when it means somethin'
Yeah, I just want to feel somethin'

So I get all dressed up (so I get all dressed up)
To go ahead, let myself down (to go ahead, let myself down)
I'm hopin' you hold me like my dress, skin-tight
Like a dress that I wear on a Saturday night
It's a Tuesday, but I won't tell if you don't
So tell me who's next up? 
To come on here and waste my time, mmm 
So you could just hold me like my dress, skin-tight
Could we pretend this is Saturday night?
It's alright, it's alright

That was intense, haha
