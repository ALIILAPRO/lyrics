		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Rio)

Yeah, I'm in a big boy Tonka (skrrt)
Yeah, I got big boy racks (racks)
Yeah, we got big boy diamonds (yeah)
Bitch, I been goin' up straight to the top
I'm in a rich boy climate (rich)
Back on the Percs, I don't know when I'll stop (yerks)
I really wish I ain't tried it (yeah)
I just got brand new chains
Yeah, I just got a brand new car (skrrt)
Bitch, we don't kick it with lames (no way)
Yeah, I don't think that you see where we are
All of my racks sit inside of the bag
I seen a kid go out broke, it's so sad (yeah)
I don't give a fuck what you got, what you had
I can't see in that Cayenne, don't care, 'bout to crash

We headin' straight to the top, yeah
Wifey come gave me some top, yeah
I told her, "Keep goin', don't stop," yeah
I put the Perc' in that Wock', yeah
How the hell you sip fake drop?
With the Percs, there ain't never a drought
I'm a little addicted to X, yeah, y'all just addicted to clout
And I made it out, I don't know
Damn, she fit in her mouth, don't know how, yeah
They don't understand what I'm saying but I told 'em, "Just listen and figure it out"
Yeah, I been doing that shit for a while
I don't know, make do whatever I got
I'm so high, I be chillin' with God
My diamonds wet like they live on a yacht
I make a hit every time, it's a lot
Your wifey come suck me alive
I brought the Cayenne out, switching the side
All flawless diamonds, damn, not no SI

Yeah, I'm in a big boy Tonka (skrrt)
Yeah, I got big boy racks (racks)
Yeah, we got big boy diamonds (yeah)
Bitch, I been goin' up straight to the top
I'm in a rich boy climate (rich)
Back on the Percs, I don't know when I'll stop (yerks)
I really wish I ain't tried it (yeah)
I just got brand new chains
Yeah, I just got a brand new car (skrrt)
Bitch, we don't kick it with lames (no way)
Yeah, I don't think that you see where we are
All of my racks sit inside of the bag
I seen a kid go out broke, it's so sad
I don't give a fuck what you got, what you had
I can't see in that Cayenne, don't care, 'bout to crash
