		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a sound that sounds so simple
But dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away

All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said

All I need to know is
Where to stop
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go

Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all

Memories after all
Memories after all, and oh

You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go
Oh
It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go

We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall

Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
