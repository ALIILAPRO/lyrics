		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For A Glimpse When The Strobe Lights Scintillate
I Could Let It All Go And Be A Simp Today.
Ethereal, It's The Most Pious I've Felt.
You A Star, Shimmering Like Orion's Belt.
She Put A Smile On The Stoic.
She Moves Like Words In The Mind Of A Poet.
Gimme A Recipe Doc
For When She Passes By, My Jaw Involuntarily Drops
You Elevate The Beats Of My Heart
I Find Myself To Be Speechless A Lot
I'd Like To Adapt To Your Ways
I Wanna Get Trapped In Your Gaze
You Deserve Love From A Guy Who Does
Treat You Right Like A Queen Just To Wife You Up
With The Charm Of A Diva, The Calmest Demeanor
I Got Me Stumped Cuz I Got Me A Keeper
That's When I Perceive The Truth
So Angelic That Atheists Believe In You
I'd Give Into Pillow Talk With Fondness
Cuz You're Living Proof That God's An Artist

I Think I'm Falling For You
I Want You, I Need You
I Think I'm Falling For You
I Want You, I Need You

Yen Kural Un Perai Thedum (My Voice Searches For Your Name)
Unakaage Yen Idhayam Yengum (My Heart Longs For U)
Yenake Nee Yenake Venum (I Want You All To Myself)
Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

Un Vasanam Thaen Pol Kekum (Your Words Sound Like Honey To Me)
Kavidaigal Un Kangal Pesum (Your Eyes Speak Poetry)
You Can Be My Bae, My Begum
Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

I'm Tempted In All Ways Sinfully
A Chord Was Struck, My Heart Plays Symphonies
Your Lips On Mine, The Thought Is All Bliss
Gyrating Hips, She Flaunts, Is All Thick
These Other Girls Don't Get To Use My Duvets
My Vision Ain't Blurry, They Truly Two Faced
I'm On A Diet, I Don't Do No Buffets
But Imma Get A Snack Cuz You A Souffle
All Sugar And I Lack The Insulin
We're Set To Match Like The Wimbledon
A Ten Is What You Are, You Attract My Looks
Now I Can't Get Enough Of You Like Catchy Hooks
It's Petty, But They Can All Envy Me
And Test Me, Cuz Everytime You're Next To Me
I'd Go To War Across Seas Like A Viking
To Give You A Life That's All Treble, High End
Destroy Pantheons For You
To Be Frozen In Time, Spend Eons With You
I Keep It One Hundred, My Principles Sound
You Can Bank On Me, I'll Make Your Interest Compound

I Think I'm Falling For You
I Want You, I Need You
I Think I'm Falling For You
I Want You, I Need You
Yen Kural Un Perai Thedum (My Voice Searches For Your Name)
Unakaage Yen Idhayam Yengum (My Heart Longs For U)
Yenake Nee Yenake Venum (I Want You All To Myself)
Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

Un Vasanam Thaen Pol Kekum (Your Words Sound Like Honey To Me)
Kavidaigal Un Kangal Pesum (Your Eyes Speak Poetry)
You Can Be My Bae, My Begum
Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)

Azhage Needhaan (Beauty Is You)
