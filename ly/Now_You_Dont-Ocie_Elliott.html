		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are driving, amber lights down the road
Yellow lines and the horizon looks cold
Been going all night now, your darkness is going

And you've felt your day's been gliding on
And the year's almost gone
You had something tying you down
Now you don't

I am off now, to get back there to you
Picture the morning, when your door I come though
And you're in bed still, stirring like you were before
Like when I left you, and flew off

And I've been away for far too long
Stuck in another time zone
I had something tying me down
Now I don't
