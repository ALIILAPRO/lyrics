		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit, I should've called you
But I got caught up
Your friends are single
They shouldn't talk up
You wanted daytime
I gave you late night
You're getting tired of
Saying the same shit, all day

All day
All day
And you always say
I hate when it feels like
You don't have time for me
Nuh time
Nuh time
Nuh nuh
She said, she said
I hate when it feels like
You don't have time for me
Nuh time
Nuh time
Nuh nuh

I know you say that
People make time for
Shit that they want well
It's not that I don't want you
It's that you want more
From me
From me
You make it hard to trust you
And right now you're talking crazy
First marriage, then babies
Then test me, you hate me
But we still do the same thing all day
All day

All day
All day
And you always say
I hate when it feels like
You don't have time for me
Nuh time
Nuh time
Nuh nuh
You said, you said
I hate when it feels like
You don't have time for me
Nuh time
Nuh time
Nuh nuh

And how many times
Aw yea
And how many times
Yea
I don't have any time
Aw yea, ouuu
I don't have time for you
Aw yea, aw yea

Tell me if my words are getting through
So I can stop explaining
If I'm already good enough for you
Then won't you stop complaining
That body needs a little maintenance
I know
You just point me to where the pain is
And you been patient sitting in your room waiting
Anything good takes time
And I'll take the time to take care of you baby
I rode out there it ain't fair to you baby
I don't want it if you ain't there with it baby
I don't want shit that I can't share with you baby
(Me I'm all yours) And you're mine
As soon as I get home to you
I wanna take my time with you
With you
Yea
I wanna take my time with you
With you
I wanna take my time with you
