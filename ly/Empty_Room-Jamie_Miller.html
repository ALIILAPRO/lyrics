		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (So I'll scream it to this empty room)

You've got all the time in the world until you don't
I was betting on forever, but forever comes and goes
Never thought I'd have to know you as a memory
Now I'm rehearsing all the things I'd say if you were in front of me

I'd tell you that I love you, I miss you, I wish you were here
Maybe if I shout it loud enough, you might hear

I'll talk to the walls
I'll tell them the truth
Have a heart-to-heart with the ceiling 
'Cause I can't with you
I got all this love
But what good does it do?
If I'm all alone, so I'll scream it 
To this empty room
Hoping it'll get to you

I think I heard the curtains whispering your name
And the pain has started running like the tears across my face
And I don't know if it's helping
But I don't think I can help it
'Cause there's a million things I didn't get to say

Like how much I love you, I miss you, I wish you were here
Maybe if I shout it long enough, you'll appear

So, I'll talk to the walls
I'll tell them the truth
Have a heart-to-heart with the ceiling 
'Cause I can't with you
I got all this love
But what good does it do?
If I'm all alone, so I'll scream it 
To this empty room
Hoping it'll get to you, you, you

I don't know where you are
But I know that a little bit of you is in every part of me
I don't know where you are
But I hope that a little bit of you is out there missing me

I'll talk to the walls
I'll tell them the truth
Have a heart-to-heart with the ceiling 
'Cause I can't with you
I got all this love
And it's probably no use
But I'm all alone, so I'll scream it 
To this empty room
Hoping it'll get to you
