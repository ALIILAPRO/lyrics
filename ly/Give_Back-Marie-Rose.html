		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give back
Hey there
Give back
Slow down
So rivers, will always flow
Dig down deeper
Dig down
Shine your light
We're here to grow
And know your calling
Can always be heard now
And today my will
Bends to the heart now
What did I take
What did you give to me
Now, oh, will I ever know
'Bout how to give back
Oh oh, oh, oh, yeah
Give back
Be love
Give back
Give back
Give in to let it show
Feel in, Faith out
Let 'em know
Lay it out
Or we'll never get over
The despair
And the mourning
Rise from these hard times
Fading to gray, and let it go
Someone shouts out
Come on and help me out
And, I know
To take her hand
I know
I know I wanna Give back
Give back
Faithful
Get back
Get down
And lie on sacred ground
Give back, Brother
Stand and give back
Get down, Sister
Or we'll never know
About the secrets now
Never know
How the magic glows
Ever know
About the mystery no
Give back
Give back
Give back
Give back
Give back
