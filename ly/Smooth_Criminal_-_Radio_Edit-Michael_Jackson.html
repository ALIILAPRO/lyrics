		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
You could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

Annie are you ok?
Will you tell us that you're ok?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

You've been hit by, you've been hit by
A smooth criminal

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Mouth to mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?
Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

Annie are you ok?
Will you tell us that you're ok?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom

Annie, are you ok? So, Annie are you ok?
Are you ok, Annie?

You've been hit by, you've been struck by
A smooth criminal

Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now

Annie are you ok? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're ok? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why, baby)
Then you ran into the bedroom (help me)
You were struck down, it was your doom Annie (dag gone it)

Annie are you ok? (Dag gone it, baby)
Will you tell us that you're ok? (Dag gone it, baby)
There's a sound at the window (dag gone it, baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment (dag gone it)
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down, it was your doom Annie (dag gone it)
