		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If it's time to cry, it's time to cry
It’ll be ok, you’ll be alright
I know that life can feel hard and unforgiving

If you want to go then you can go
I'll be here if you come back home
Don’t go quietly at night
Please show some fight

Ride, Ride, crest the wave and fly
And I'll be right beside you
Please, please don’t turn around
It’s a long way back down
And I’ll be right behind you

I know that you’re just getting by
Struggling to breathe and stay alive
But know you’re not the only one treading water

Ride, Ride, crest the wave and fly
And I’ll be right beside you
Please, please don’t turn around
It’s a long way back down
And I’ll be right behind you

Ride, Ride, crest the wave and fly
And I’ll be right beside you
Please, please don’t turn around
It’s a long way back down
And I’ll be right behind you
Know, know I’d rather have known
And carried half of the load
Then attend a funeral
Because I, out of everybody alive
Want you to more than survive
I want to walk beside you

Ride, Ride, Ride,
I want to walk beside you
