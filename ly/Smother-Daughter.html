		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am wasted, losing time
On a foolish, fragile spine
I want all that is not mine
I want him but we're not right

In the darkness, I will meet my creators
And they will all agree, that I'm a suffocator

I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place to lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave

To follow
To follow
To follow
To follow

In the darkness, I will meet my creators
And they will all agree that I'm a suffocator, suffocator, suffocator

Oh love
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I'm sorry if I smothered you
I sometimes wish I'd stayed inside
My mother
Never to come out
