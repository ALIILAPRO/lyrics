		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle (Fuck with the winners baby)
Put up your hands for me, baby (Put 'em up)
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win

Consider this the theme song for victory
The shit you say to yourself when you make history
I'm trying to make it feel like the first time
Like a junkie I'm sort of chasing my first high
I'm focused, I'm disciplined, I'm ready
Mentally on point, sharp as a machete
Hard work, I work hard, I get the job done
It's only one number 1, nigga, I'm number 1
I'm confident, you can call it vain or conceited
Cars, clothes, I need it
Condos, condoms and bad bitches to be with
Run with a winner, baby
Be unconventional, freak me off friends maybe
You can be my girl, be my fair weather friend
Or you could be my, yeah yeah, be my friend to the end

Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win

I got that disease ambition, success is the cure
They wanna win, I gotta win, I sell the shit pure
I got dopeboy bonds, Einstein brains
The heart of a nigga homicidal on the chain gang
I want yachts and drops, I got spots to watch
I wanna see what life is like from the mountain top
Who says sky's the limit? I'm limitless, I just took the pill
Why you think a nigga slow flow so ill?
Be careful, the shit I got is highly contagious
We hustle 'til it had us all locked up in cages
Time gon' fly when a nigga been busy for ages
War stories and wounds, back and forth, a nigga been trading
For the root of all evil, Lord said it's for Satan
We from the bottom, desperation cause moves that we making
I guess it's all risk versus rewards
And a nigga risk it all for the broads (What's up)

Are you ready to win?
Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win

Come join the winners circle
Put up your hands for me, baby
And do it like we're supposed to
'Cause we're gonna win
