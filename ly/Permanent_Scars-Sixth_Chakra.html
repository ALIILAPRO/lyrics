		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm wearing myself thin
No more strength left within
I always let my self destructiveness win

I'm begging on my knees
These feelings just won't leave
Hyperventilating until I just can't breathe

I'm wearing myself thin
No more strength left within
I always let my self destructiveness win

I'm begging on my knees
These feelings just won't leave
Hyperventilating until I just can't breathe

The thought of ending my life
Is always on my mind
I don't really wanna die
But I don't even feel alive

Permanent scars on my arms
No reason for alarm
I turned my back on my soul, and now there's nothing left

The thought of ending my life
Is always on my mind
But if I've never really lived
Then can you even call it suicide?

My soul is dead
This state of mind has left me perpetually impaired

Pull the trigger
'Cause if I've never really lived
Then can you even call it suicide?

Is this even suicide?
Is this even suicide?

I'm better off dead

Is this even suicide?

I'm wearing myself thin
No more strength left within
I always let my self destructiveness win

I'm begging on my knees
These feelings just won't leave
Hyperventilating until I just can't breathe
Help me
Somebody, fuck

I'm convinced that there's nothing left
Nothing left to live for
I'm convinced that there's nothing left
Nothing left to live for

Slit

The thought of ending my life
Is always on my mind
But if I've never really lived
Then can you even call it suicide?
