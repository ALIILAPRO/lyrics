		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just me and my mate Johnny here
I know he's gonna like this little bit, see?
'Cause Dicky Palmer-James wrote us the words

If I only could deceive you
Forgetting the game
Every time I try to leave you
You laugh just the same
'Cause my wheels never touch the road?)
And the jumble of lies we told
Just returns to my back to weigh me down

We lay cards upon the table
The backs of our hands
And I swear I like your people
The boys in the band
Reminiscence has gone astray
Coming back to enjoy the fray
In a tangle of night and daylight sun

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Ooh
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

All completeness in the morning
He's asleep on his side
I'll be waking up the crewmen
Banana-boat ride
She responds like a limousine
Brought alive on the silent screen
Through the shuddering breath of yesterday

There's the succor of the needy
Incredible scenes
I'll believe you in the future
Your life and death dreams
As the cavalry of despair
Takes a stand in the lady's hair
For the favor of making sweet sixteen

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo

Easy Money, take one

One, two, three, four

Your admirers in the street
Got to hoot and stamp their feet
In the heat from your physique
As you twinkle by in mocassin sneakers

And I thought my heart would break
When you doubled up the stake
With your fingers all a-shake
You could never tell a winner from a snake, no

Easy Money

With your figure and your face
Strutting out at every race
Throw a glass around the place
Show the color of your crimson suspenders

We could take the money home
Sit around the family throne
My old dog could chew his bone
For two weeks we could appease the Almighty

Easy Money
