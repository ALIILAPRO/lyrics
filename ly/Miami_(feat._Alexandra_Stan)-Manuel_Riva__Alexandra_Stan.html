		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place in Miami where they heal your soul
They fill the glass with your deepest hope
Where the faces have no name
I feel I'm home
There's a beach in Miami, when the sun is gone
You dance in the sand and you're not alone
There's no faces and no name
I feel I'm home

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm home
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm home

There's a place in Miami where they heal your soul
They fill the glass with your deepest hope
Where the faces have no name
I feel I'm home
There's a beach in Miami, when the sun is gone
You dance in the sand and you're not alone
There's no faces and no name
I feel I'm home

There's a place in Miami where they heal your soul
They fill the glass with your deepest hope
Where the faces have no name
I feel I'm home
There's a beach in Miami, when the sun is gone
You dance in the sand and you're not alone
There's no faces and no name
I feel I'm home

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm home
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm home

There's a place in Miami where they heal your soul
They fill the glass with your deepest hope
Where the faces have no name
I feel I'm home
There's a beach in Miami, when the sun is gone
You dance in the sand and you're not alone
There's no faces and no name
I feel I'm home

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm home
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
I feel I'm home
