		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my heart stops
Will my wings unfold
Did you know that I had no one but you

When my eyes close
Will your blood turn older
Did you know that I had no one but you

In the snow veil
Where the ring of promise fell
In the cool white air
One stood abiding
When the road turns
Will my ghost find freedom
Did you know that I have nothing
So I

Sold my love
Forgot the vow
It feels like nothing comes to mind
I pull the weight
And sing
That there's a new cloud over my grave
Now I know
That it did kill me when I could not have you
Sold my heart
