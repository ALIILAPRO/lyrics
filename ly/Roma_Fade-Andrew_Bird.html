		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See her light, how it reigns
So hard on your high plains
So you take such pains
That she won't notice you
And your X-rays
Of your Paleo man
All gaze
How they rest, and play
Slowly corrupting you
I wonder what the chance is you wanted to
A thousand vacant stares won't make it true
Make it true

You need a witness just to know you're there
From the tips of your fingers, every strand of hair
You know someone's watching you watching me watching you
And all that we look upon
You may not know me but you feel my stare

And if she sees you, it changes you
Rearranges your molecules
And if you see her, it changes her
She's a danger now, after school
And if she sees you, it changes you
Rearranges your molecules
And if you see her, it changes her
She'll be seeing you after school
Here's where gentlemen avert their eyes
Maybe she's a gentleman in disguise
In disguise

You need a witness just to know you're there
From the tips of your fingers, every strand of hair
You know someone's watching you
Watching me watching you and all that we look upon
You may not know me but you feel my
Stare

And if I see you, how it changes me
And if you see me, how it changes you
Changes you
And if I see you, how it changes me
And if you see me, how it changes you
Changes you
