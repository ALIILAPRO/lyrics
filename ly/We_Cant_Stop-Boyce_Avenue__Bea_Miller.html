		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now
Bet somebody here might be the one now

If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a hell no?
'Cause we gonna go all night
Till we see the sunlight alright

So la da di da di
We like to party
Dancing you and me
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

To my homegirls just trying to leave it all
Shaking it like they can't get enough
Remember, only God can judge us
Forget the haters 'cause somebody loves ya
Memories made to the nights through
Surrounded by the ones who love you
We all so turned up here
Getting turned up, yeah, yeah

So la da da di
We like to party
Dancing you and me
Doing whatever we want
This is our house
This is our rules

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

It's our party we can do what we want to
It's our house we can love what we want to
It's our song we can sing if we want to
It's my mouth I can say what I want to

And we can't stop
And we won't stop
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?
And we can't stop
And we won't stop
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody
Yeah, yeah

It's our party we can do what we want to
It's our house we can love what we want to
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who bout' that life?
It's our song we can sing if we want to
It's my mouth I can say what I want to
We run things, things don't run we
'Cause we can't stop
