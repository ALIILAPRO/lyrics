		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus: x2]
Can't trust every face bitch you gotta watch em
Never trust a bitch shit you gotta watch em
We just do our thing and the feds watchin'
All we do is turn up, we some damn monsters

Can't trust every face shit I gotta watch em
Chief Keef sosa I'm a known topic
Smokin' big blunts and they long body
My niggas hard body, don't fear nobody
We be in the club bitches so excited
But we dont give them nothin' but some long pipe
Because we don't trust her with her mouth (de other night?)
We don't trust niggas, get out my sight
Folk 'nem poppin' pills and they startin' fights
Trust non muhfucka alright
Folk 'nem poppin' pills and they startin' fights
Trust non muhfucka alright

[Chorus: x2]

Sosa bitch a lot of niggas dont like
But I don't give a fuck, that's alright
Because I'mma do me and take all (light?)
Put your glasses on I'm comin' strong ight
Gotta get this bread for my new born
I'm a fuckin' monster with some trues on
In dis shit I've been waitin' to long
Two face niggas, call em two tones
We just do our thang and the feds watchin
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic
We just do our thang and the feds watchin
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic

[Chorus: x3]
