		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even though you're all alone
All alone when I am gone
I just wanna keep you warm
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, yeah-yeah
Yes, I'll be there
'Cause when I'm all alone
I think about your face
And how I wanna touch
I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is
Give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah-yeah

Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me

Oh, I'm aware that we just met
I don't wanna leave you yet
Promise that I won't forget
I'm coming back, I'm coming back
Yes, I'll be there, oh
Yes, I'll be there, oh
'Bout to board a flight
Sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you
But I'm so far away (I'm so)
All I wanna do is
Give you all of me now
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh

Don't go missing, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
Don't go missing, fly with me
(Check it out, check it out)
Don't go missing, fly with me, fly with me
