		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now one fell asleep in the street
And he never woke up
And now one died in pieces
Whose been with a mouthful of ghosts
And one threatening long ago I saw him
Melt in the bright of day
And one laid to rest in the field
On the stories and crawled, hey

I've been walking the sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
Still, I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come
Your time has come

Now one took some bullets to the chest and the field gone wrong
One got a little too depressed then he went and jumped the gun
One got shot right in the face and he somehow survived
But he doesn't know my name or who I am
And I'm not surprised, hey

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
Still, I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come

Yeah I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
Still I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come
Your time has come, hey

I've seen fifty thousand names all engraved on a stone
Most of them, met 'em at a grave years before I was born
All of them left brothers and sisters and mothers behind
And most of their family and friends are alive
Every time

I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
And I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come

Yeah I've been wandering sideways
I've stared straight into the sun
And I don't know why you're dying
Long before your time has come
Your time has come
