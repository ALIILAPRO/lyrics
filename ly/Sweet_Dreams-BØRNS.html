		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hearts in the cage

Hearts in the cage, hearts in the cage
You, you flipped the page and slipped away

Never thought that you were 
Someone to say things that you didn't mean

You didn't even call to wish me sweet dreams
Really thought we made a sweet team
But don't cry, consider this a lullaby
Sweet dreams

Ticking clocks on the wall, waiting for your call
But that cuckoo bird, won't sing at all

Never thought you would 
Take everything we had and up and leave

You didn't even call or wish me sweet dreams
Really thought we made a sweet team
But don't cry, can't you see that you're a love of mine

Sweet dreams, always thought you were the sweetest thing
But don't cry, consider this a lullaby

Them sweet dreams, sweet dreams
Sweet to me, oh sweet dreams
