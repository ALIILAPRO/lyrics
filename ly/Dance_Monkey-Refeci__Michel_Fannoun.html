		  ï¿¼Dance Monkey
Tones And I

Verse
They say oh my god I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine You know you stopped me dead when I was passing by And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry 
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say

Chorus
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay 
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again

Verse 2
I said oh my god I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes Just like a monkey I've been dancing my whole life 
And you just beg to see me dance just one more time 

Ooh I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry 
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
So I say

Chorus
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay 

And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
They say

Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say move for me, move for me, move for me, ay, ay, ay
And when you're done I'll make you do it all again
All again
