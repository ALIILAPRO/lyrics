		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue sky lights but tonight it's the morning
I can't get through to you
I wish that this floor would come to life and tell the story
'Cause no one knows where I missed my move

How am I supposed to move on if
You don't know what's really wrong, but

Let me know if there's something I can do to fix it
Let me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind
I can't promise you that I'll be waiting
But for you I'll leave anything behind

Back and forth, cigarettes and fast talking
I feel you slip away
I can't understand the reasons why you say you're leaving
'Cause you were so in love yesterday

How am I supposed to move on if
You don't even know what's really wrong, but

Let me know if there's something I can do to fix it
Let me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind
I can't promise you that I'll be waiting
But for you I'll leave anything behind
Let me know if there's something I can do to fix it
Let me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind
I can't promise you that I'll be waiting
But for you I'll leave anything behind

Let me know if there's something I can do to fix it
Let me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind
I can't promise you that I'll be waiting
But for you I'll leave anything behind
Let me know if there's something I can do to fix it (I still love you, let me know)
Let me know if you ever change, if you ever change, your mind (I still love you, let me know)
I can't promise you that I'll be waiting (I still love you, let me know)
But for you I'll leave anything behind (I still love you, let me know)

I still love 
I still love
I still love

I still love
I still love
I still love
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
I still love you
