		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come
Stand here with me
Stare at the peak
Of mountains we've known
We
Study their height
So maybe we might
Someday feel home
And I won't feel alone
Buried in snow
Caught in the cold
To never be known
Come
Lay here with me
Fade in the deep
Everwood
Tell
The secrets you keep
Tell me everything
You never could
And I won't feel alone
Buried in snow
Caught in the cold
To never be known
Let's get lost for good
Deep in the woods
If only we could
To never be known
Scared of it all
Carry it all
Just hold a light
For me tonight
There where it stood
Where only it could
Can you see
The Everwood?
Everwood
