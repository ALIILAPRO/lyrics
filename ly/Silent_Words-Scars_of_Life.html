		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here inside alone
This thought's coming down on me again
The where to run to?
As these twisted thoughts flow through my head
I never wanted to break away
Can't help that I don't feel the same

And now I'm standing here
Asking myself if I'm to blame

These silent words you'll never hear (These silent words you'll never hear)
These frozen thoughts will not appear
And I'm breaking down inside of me
Still no one's sees

I stare into myself I'm scared 
Of what I just might find
A reflection of my past
Something I've always tried to hide
And now my life is coming apart
Why must I always be this way?

And now I'm standing here
Asking myself if I'm to blame

These silent words you'll never hear (These silent words you'll never hear)
These frozen thoughts will not appear
And I'm breaking down inside of me
Still no one's sees

I can no longer take this
The pain that lives inside of me
Must I be waiting to erase this?
So I can't find memories

These silent words you'll never hear (These silent words you'll never hear)
These frozen thoughts will not appear
And I'm breaking down inside of me
Still no one's sees
