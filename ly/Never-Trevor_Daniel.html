		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind" (my, my mind)

I woke up glued to the mattress
Looks like I'm stuck in my habits
I think I'm made out of plastic
'Cause I feel nothing
This morning I looked for sadness (sadness)
Looked through the basement and attic (attic)
It must be weaved in my fabric
That I feel nothing

My friends say I'm narcissistic
It's probably true but I'm sick
And tired of feeling like this

I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind"
I woke up feeling like an asshole
Flipping through the channels
Looking for something that feels right
I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind" (my, my mind)

I wish that I could be solo
But God, I hate feeling so alone
My thoughts turn into a pile of clothes
And I feel nothing

My friends say I'm narcissistic
It's probably true but I'm sick
And tired of feeling like this

I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind"
I woke up feeling like an asshole
Flipping through the channels
Looking for something that feels right
I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind" (my, my mind)

(One, two, three, four)
I wanna live in a '90s movie
Where things just happen so easy
Sometimes I want things decided for my mind, my mind

My friends say I'm narcissistic
It's probably true but I'm sick
And tired of feeling like this
My friends say I'm narcissistic
It's probably true but I'm sick
And tired of feeling like shit

I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind" (I just keep saying)
I woke up feeling like an asshole
Flipping through the channels
Looking for something that feels right (oh, looking for something)
I want something that I'll never find
But I just keep on saying, "Nevermind" (my, my mind)
