		  Yeah, she gon' get nasty, yeah
Bad lil' baby gon' shake some (shake some)
Yeah, whole lotta money, you can make some (make some)
Go and throw it back, don't break none, yeah, yeah
She gon' get nasty, yeah (nasty)
Broke-ass nigga, girl, I ain't one (ain't one)
Whole lotta money, you can make some (make some)
Your hatin'-ass nigga wanna say some' (yeah)

She gon' do it on a handstand, do it on a dick
Do it 'cause you know you need that money for the free
Do it 'cause you hoping this gon' put you on a jet
Do it 'cause you know I get that good pussy wet
We live
Go and shake that shit like it's VLive
Instagram with it, baby, we live
Do whatever for the cat, love the feline (yeah)
Bring that ass back like it's rewind (yeah)
Bring it back (oh), bring it back (oh)
I ain't know you do it like that (like that)
Go ahead, get into it like that (like that)
Throw that ass and I'm throwin' money back
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring it back (oh), back (oh)
Tryna throw a nigga off track (off track, yeah)
Love it when you do it like that (like that)
Tell the DJ gotta run it back (yeah)

Yeah, she gon' get nasty, yeah
Bad lil' baby gon' shake some (shake some)
Yeah, whole lotta money, you can make some (make some)
Go and throw it back, don't break none, yeah, yeah
She gon' get nasty, yeah (nasty)
Broke-ass nigga, girl, I ain't one (ain't one)
Whole lotta money, you can make some (make some)
Your hatin'-ass nigga wanna say some' (yeah)

She like it when I dive in
Pullin' on her hair, I'ma show you what the vibe is, yeah
I've been tryna get naughty
Girl, I'm sorry not sorry
You should get freaky for me
Throw it in reverse, make it easy for me
Show a little skin, got you leakin' for me
Make it easy for me
If I tell you shawty got a ten-ten body you believe me, don't you?
Shawty was down for the hell of it

Whole lotta money, you can make some (make some)
Your hatin'-ass nigga wanna say some'

But you gon' get nasty, yeah
