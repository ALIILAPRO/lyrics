		<p>
		  (Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)
Grrah

Baddie, he makin' me thicker (makin' me thicker)
Rob his heart, bitch, it's a stick up (stick up)
I can't be fallin' in love with a nigga (in love with a)
Pockets was small, they got bigger (uh-huh)
You did me wrong, what I do? (What I do?)
Actin' a smoochie when I'm off the liquor (what?)
Showin' my thong, goin' ku (go ku)
Throwin' it back and I watch him get bigger (huh)

Baby, I watch how I move
Bitches, they see me, don't know what to do, like (like)
Baddie, I get in my mood (In my mood)
Nigga a munchie, he eat me like food, damn (grrah)
He eatin' it up, kitty on water, he beatin' it up (beatin' it up)
On fire, heatin' it up
Bitches be dirty, I'm cleanin' 'em up (Ugh)

Gimme a tissue
Why would I miss you when you was the issue? (huh)
Don't wear the shoe if the shoe doesn't fit you (Like)
Only around me when it's beneficial (grrah)
Stop textin' my phone
Nigga be fienin', like leave me alone, damn (leave me alone)
Back in my zone (in my zone)
Don't want the feelings, I just want the dome (grrah)

Baddie, he makin' me thicker (makin' me thicker)
Rob his heart, bitch, it's a stick up (stick up)
I can't be fallin' in love with a nigga (in love with a)
Pockets was small, they got bigger (uh-huh)
You did me wrong, what I do? (What I do?)
Actin' a smoochie when I'm off the liquor (what?)
Showin' my thong, goin' ku (go ku)
Throwin' it back and I watch him get bigger (huh)

Throwin' it back, put it right in his face (in his face)
He like how it taste (how it taste)
He grabbin' my waist (uh-huh)
Got 'em itchin' to stay (grrah)
He the bank and I'm makin' him chase (yeah)
I'm a baddie, I'm havin' my way (my way)
Nigga a munchie so we cannot date (like)
He a eater, I made sure he ate (grrah)
No, you cannot have your boo back (huh)
If I'm shootin' my shot, he gon' shoot back (grrah)
I'm on his head like a durag (huh)
Shittin' on bitches, I do that (I do that)
Shittin' on bitches my hobby (huh)
Body too crazy, they all on my body like (all on my body like)
All on my body like

Baddie, he makin' me thicker (makin' me thicker)
Rob his heart, bitch, it's a stick up (stick up)
I can't be fallin' in love with a nigga (in love with a)
Pockets was small, they got bigger (uh-huh)
You did me wrong, what I do? (What I do?)
Actin' a smoochie when I'm off the liquor (what?)
Showin' my thong, goin' ku (go ku)
Throwin' it back and I watch him get bigger (huh)
Baddie, he makin' me thicker (makin' me thicker)
Rob his heart, bitch, it's a stick up (stick up)
I can't be fallin' in love with a nigga (in love with a)
Pockets was small, they got bigger (uh-huh)
You did me wrong, what I do? (What I do?)
Actin' a smoochie when I'm off the liquor (what?)
Showin' my thong, goin' ku (go ku)
Throwin' it back and I watch him get bigger
