		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This old house is falling down round mice
I'm drowning in a river of my tears
When all my will is gone, you can hear me pray
I need you at the dimming of the day
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide
You know just where I keep my bed aside

The days have come to keep us far apart
A broken promise for a broken heart
Now all the bonny birds, have flown away
I need you at the dimming of the day
Come tonight you're only what I want
Come tonight you can be my comfort doll

I see you on the street in company
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me
I'm living for the night, we can steal away
I need you at the dimming of the day
I need you at the dimming of the day
