		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I had one single wish
I'd go back to the moment I kissed 
You goodbye no mater how hard I try
I can't live without you in my life

Maybe you'll say
You still want me
Maybe you'll say
That you don't
Maybe we said
It was over
But baby I can't let you go

I walk around
Trying to understand
Where we went wrong
And I can't pretend
It wasn't me
And it wasn't you
But I'm convinced
We gave up too soon

Maybe you'll say
You still want me
Maybe you'll say
That you don't
Maybe we said
It was over
But baby
I can't let you go

Nothing left to lose
After losing you
There's nothing
I can't take
When I run to you
When I come for you
Don't tell me
I'm too late

Maybe you'll say
You still want me
Maybe you'll say
That you don't
Maybe we said
It was over
But baby I can't let you go

(Maybe you'll say
You still want me
Maybe you'll say
That you don't
Maybe we said
It was over
But baby I) can't let you go

(Maybe we said
It was over)
But baby I can't let you go
