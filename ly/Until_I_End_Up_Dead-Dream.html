		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got blindsided, couldn't see it in the slightest
That path you walked was the same as mine is
Hard to believe man, tell me you're lying

This is something new
Crying, the first time I ever wore a suit
I saw me when I looked at you
So now I fear one day I'm gonna disappear
Look in the mirror to make sure I'm still standing here

I've been playing in my head
Those things I never said
Like, like existential dread but
I'm not staying in my mind
I'm living like you said
It's gonna be alright, until I end up dead

Until I end up dead
Until I end up

Blindsided, so strong why would you hide it?
It's in your bones man, you had to fight it
Came out of nowhere now pigs are flying

This is something new (something new)
Crying, the first time I ever wore a suit (wore a suit)
I saw me when I looked at you
So now I fear one day I'm gonna disappear
Look in the mirror to make sure I'm still standing here

I've been playing in my head
Those things I never said
Like, like existential dread but
I'm not staying in my mind
I'm living like you said
It's gonna be alright, until I end up dead

Until I end up dead
Until I end up dead
Until I end up dead
Until I end up dead

Until I end up dead
I'm gonna be just fine
