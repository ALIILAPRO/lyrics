		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we go away
And never turn around again
On an escapade
And always keep the vision
Can we open out
And spread ourselves around the sand
Captivate the sun
Keep the light 'til the world ends

Runaway
Runaway

Take away the wall
And break away my defense
Candle by our side
And never let the rain begin

We're a part of a plan
And it's already written
There is no other way
It's inside our every sense

Earth is our island

Karma, am I yours
Is that your intuition
If that is your word
I'm the definition

In our destinies
This is what was missing
Echo in my mind
Even through a distance
