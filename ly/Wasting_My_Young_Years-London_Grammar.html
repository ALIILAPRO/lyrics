		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You crossed this line
Do you find it hard to say it with me tonight?
I've walked these miles but I've walked 'em straight lined
You'll never know what was like to be
Fine

I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if

Baby
We are
We are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Baby
Oh we are
We are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years

Don't you know that it's only fear
I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I've heard it takes some time to get it right

I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if
I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if

Baby
We are
We are
Baby I'm wasting my young years
Baby
We are
We are
Baby I'm wasting my young years

I don't know what, you want
Don't leave me hanging on
Don't know what you want
Don't leave me hanging on
