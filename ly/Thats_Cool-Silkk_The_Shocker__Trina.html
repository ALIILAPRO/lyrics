		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what I'm 'bout

You know what I'm 'bout

Yo Silkk ask Trina can she wobble that thing...

Where my niggas yo?
Where my ladies yo?

Who you know could give it to you until you fall out
When you wake up - go by the mall out
Hop on the plane sperm or nothing never thawed out
Have her saying my name like destiny's child
'Cause I go all out
Speaking more sex than money so talk with your tongue out
And sex unbelievable, plus the money never run out
I'm a thug so I walk the street with my gun out
Top up when the sun set, top down when the sun out
Oh you want me, pushing up your number on the slick
Try to make the scene when I was in front of the click
How bout I pull the thongs off in the summer and shit
Laughing at my joke when it wasn't even funny and shit
She need a t-mac ms shaq she think that I ball
She know I'm a real nigga, plus she love that I'm tall
Checks again when she missed the phone, thinking I called
She want to fall for me look, but she think I'm a dog

[Chorus:]
Need somebody with some doe
That's cool
Who gon' keep it on the low
That's cool
Who gon' do you right
That's cool
You need a soulja in your life, that's right

You need a lover and a friend
That's cool
Who got ya back to the end
That's tru
Somebody that's off the chain
That's cool
Who could twurk that thang

You want to fuck that's cool but you gotta be the greatest
Take me the Prada, buy my the latest
Try it on the jet, fly me to Vegas
The baddest bitch can't nann hoe fade this
Paid bitch, in a gray six, made bitch
Blinging about 10 karats in the bracelet
Face it stick your tongue out I let you taste it
And if you broke when you see me nigga don't say shit
Cause I'm looking for a nigga that's filthy rich
Yo name Silkk, that's cool I'm a silky bitch
Lil mama stay shining like cuts in ice
Off glass make you bust three nuts in a night
And when I put it on ya, I hope you can stand it
I need a tune-up daddy is you the mechanic?
'Cause if you coming at me right with the real cash
You can play with me all night like Dreamcast

[Chorus:]
You need a lover and a friend
That's cool
Who got ya back to the end
That's tru
Somebody that's off the chain
That's cool
Who could twurk that thang

Need somebody with some doe
That's cool
Who gon' keep it on the low
That's cool
Who gon' do you right
That's cool
You need a soulja in your life, that's right

Your friends wonder why the house you never leaving
They knew wut you gettin' in life 
Now they wouldn't leave the house either

See I'm a real ass chick I'm a stay by your side
And when its time to ride for my man, I'm a ride

Just be a down chick cause you ain't gotta slave in fact 
Not cook, clean or nothing cause I got maids for that

Just treat me how you want to be treated
'Cause if I suck it and fuck it you gon' beat it and eat it

So I gots to put it on ya, have ya acting all silly
Then try to convince yourself that you ain't catching feelings
I need a girl who bout it and know how to hit it
You ain't gotta scheme on the doe,
'Cause if ya cards right, you gon get it
Some chicks ain't real though, (some niggas'll stunt)
I know what a woman need, (i know what a nigga want)
So keep it tight, and fuck the world
And who ever end up with me, that's one lucky girl

[Chorus:]
Need somebody with some doe
That's cool
Who gon' keep it on the low
That's cool
Who gon' do you right
That's cool
You need a soulja in your life, that's right

You need a lover and a friend
That's cool
Who got ya back to the end
That's tru
Somebody that's off the chain
That's cool
Who could twurk that thang

Burrrrraaahhh stick it
Ha ha ha stick it
Burrrrraaaahh stick it
Ha ha ha stick it
Shake it, shake it, pop it pop it
Brake it, rake it nah, drop it drop it
Twurk sumin', work sumin'
Keep it jumpin', but don't hurt nothin'
North, south, east, west, shake it up
No limit...
