		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanted you to love me like I loved you
But I guess I was asking for too much
I just wanted you to be there like I was there for you
But I guess I was asking for too much

I just want someone to talk to
I just want someone to talk to

I just wanted to tell you everything that haunts me
But I guess that I scared you too much
I don't blame you for thinking I'm a little crazy
Maybe I'm too hard to love

I just want someone to talk to
I just want someone to talk to

A little too late to go back in time
And now I'm alone and don't know why
Was living too fast, I pushed you away
Said all the wrong words to get you to stay

I just want someone to talk to

I just want someone to talk to
I just want someone to talk to
All I really wanted was you to talk to
I just want someone to talk to
