		<p>
		  Hi, hi, hi, hi
I just called to say hi
Hi
I just called to say hi

I was just sittin' here thinkin'
Sittin' here
All alone and I'm feelin'
It's been ten years
Since I've seen your face, yeah
And I wonder how you are
So I called to say hi

I shoot you a message, you answer right back
The first thing you say, it just makes me laugh
(I just called to say hi)
You know I always liked that, I always liked that
I just called to say hi
Now I'm thinkin' I hope that he sends me a picture
So I can see how he's aging
But I'm gonna send him one first
I picked one that I know is gon' hurt, yeah
I just called to say hi
Oh, ooh

And in a way, you're a picture of you
You got me stuck, I don't know what to do
And I just got one question for you
How are you so fuckin' fine after all these years?
How are you so fuckin' fine after all these years?
Ooh, ah
How is this possible, all of this chocolate here
How are you so fuckin' fine after all these years?
Now I'm thinkin' I need to see you
Get in your spaceship, let's take a daytrip
(Get in your spaceship, come here and taste it)

(Called to say hi)
