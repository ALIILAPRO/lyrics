		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Ooh

Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon's turn to wood

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Ooh

You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for good conversation
There's an ear for what you say

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Yeah

Ooh

Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Come along, come along with me

Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend

Yeah

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do 
Do do do do, yeah
Do do do do
Do do do do do
