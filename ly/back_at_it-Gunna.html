		<p>
		  Back at it
Smokin' this 'Scotti, this shit startin' to hit like it's crack in it
The boy got the rock and he sleep at the top like a crack addict
Two racks just for the tank top, you niggas is pathetic
Back at it (yeah)
Back at it (yeah)
Mess the boy up and I gave them the drip, let them gon' on (yeah)
And this is the thanks that I get, nigga, you tell me who wrong
Gotta go now, I can't prolong (prolong) 
I'm out of space in a ozone (ozone)
In a spaceship let it float on (float on) 
Can't stop me now, nigga, hold on

Double R truck and it's black, yuh
Load 'em up, get 'em intact, yuh
I'm flyin' like the black like a bat, yuh
These fuck-niggas poppin' my back, damn
Add up the numbers the math, yuh
I heard all of your stories is cap, yuh
Gervonta that boy with a right jab
I bet he didn't know we was right there
I heard a few shots, that's a hot pair (hot)
It's gon' be a whole 'nother sound
I promise that I can come drip the town
'Cause I ain't got no hate towards your town (nah)
Nigga wan' see me walk with my head down
Think it's funny, I ain't playin' around (nah)
Made my bed but a nigga ain't layin' down
If I pull up, I'm tearin' it down

Back at it
Smokin' this 'Scotti, this shit startin' to hit like it's crack in it
The boy got the rock and he sleep at the top like a crack addict
Two racks just for the tank top, you niggas is pathetic
Back at it (yeah)
Back at it (yeah)
Mess the boy up and I gave them the drip, let them gon' on (yeah)
And this is the thanks that I get, nigga, you tell me who wrong
Gotta go now, I can't prolong (prolong) 
I'm out of space in a ozone (ozone)
In a spaceship let it float on (float on) 
Can't stop me now, nigga, hold on

Big Double R, it's the Rolls truck
Blow the dust off, get it back crunk (yeah)
Go on a move, better mask up
Niggas caught up but be dead drunk
Ain't tryna sleep in
Ain't tryna sleep in no damn bunk
I'm 'posed to be here makin' anthems
And some of you niggas know well enough
Gunna still with it and it's been a minute, I know I been too hard to find
I had to admit it I know that you niggas could never be one of my kind
Asian persuasion
Asian persuasion, she's fine
Hit that shit right from behind
I can go two at a time

Back at it
Smokin' this 'Scotti, this shit startin' to hit like it's crack in it
The boy got the rock and he sleep at the top like a crack addict
Two racks just for the tank top, you niggas is pathetic
Back at it (yeah)
Back at it (yeah)
Mess the boy up and I gave them the drip, let them gon' on (yeah)
And this is the thanks that I get, nigga, you tell me who wrong
Gotta go now, I can't prolong (prolong) 
I'm out of space in a ozone (ozone)
In a spaceship let it float on (float on) 
Can't stop me now, nigga, hold on

(Double R truck and it's black, yuh)
(Double R truck and it's black, yuh)
(Double R truck and it's black, yuh)
(Double R truck and it's black)
(Double R truck and it's black, yuh)
(Double R truck and it's black, yuh)
(Double R truck and it's black, yuh)
(Double R truck and it's black)
