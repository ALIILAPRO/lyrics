		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, I'm in the bay smoking broccoli come and rock with me
Like DRAM, damn, love how my cash machine always talk to me
And I'm a scholar no Socrates but they flocking on the gram, man
My haters biggest hobby is stalking me
Aye, you sapping up all my energy
I can't entertain no entity that's constantly tryna make some amenities
My money deep like the Kennedy's
Need a remedy to ease up on these haters throw paper at all my enemies
Wings on like Amenadiel
Know I been a lil quiet but you better not sleep on me like some Benadryl
Ben and Jerry's my flavor I put in labor
This so hot it could burn you 'fore you listen come sign this waiver, ah
Mic, mic 1, 2 sound check
I'm so icy like the chain on my body I'm at your neck
Got my money in the stash, and a hundred on the dash
And I know my shit is fire tell a hater run it back, ah
Ah, I'm in the bay smoking broccoli come and rock with me
Like DRAM, damn, love how my cash machine always talk to me
And I'm a scholar no Socrates but they flocking on the gram, man
My haters biggest hobby is stalking me (Finish him!)
I'm boutta flex like I'm Hercules wearing Birkens while on Mercury
Cause even in space, comfort come first to me
See how my haters convert to me, I'm the one like the first degree
Ain't a question I know I'm the hottest certainly
My squad is rolling where I go I'm boutta T-up like Iroh
I blaze up on the interstate guess I always take the high road
I'm so fucking creative meanwhile you stuck in survival
You best be minding your business or imma dog you like Fido
This beat vibrate like a Xbox controller
Weed got me sayin shit backwards like Yoda
Out for the night like I slipped in a coma
11PM and I'm gone off the soda
I got more range than a mafuckin' Rover
But I need to balance my coke to my cola
If you got money you should never show her
Cause she'd kill for Christians, no witness, Jehovah
Mic, mic 1, 2 sound check
I'm so icy like the chain on my body I'm at your neck
Got my money in the stash, and a hundred on the dash
And I know my shit is fire tell a hater run it back, ah
