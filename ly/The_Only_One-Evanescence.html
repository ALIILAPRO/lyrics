		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When they all come crashing down-midflight
You know you're not the only one
When they're so alone they find a back door out of life
You know you're not the only one

We're all grieving
Lost and bleeding

All our lives
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
I'm not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me

So afraid to open your eyes- hypnotized
You know you're not the only one
Never understood this life
And you're right I don't deserve but you know I'm not the only one

We're all grieving
Lost and bleeding

All our lives
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
I'm not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me

Don't look down
Don't look into the eyes of the world beneath you
Don't look down, you'll fall down
You'll become their sacrifice
Right or wrong
Can't hold onto the fear that I'm lost without you
If I can't feel, I'm not mine
I'm not real

All our lives
We've been waiting
For someone to call our leader
All your lies
I'm not believing
Heaven shine a light down on me
