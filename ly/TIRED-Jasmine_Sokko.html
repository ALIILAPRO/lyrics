		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on my own in the corner with these people I don't know somehow
It's like a heavy situation, I can't drink my way out of it
Now these ice ain't breaking so it's melting in my drink
Where the taste is failing like your insincerity

Lately I just feel so tired, not because of my sleep
I don't like nobody and nobody likes me
I'm tired of the peacock speech
I don't like nobody and nobody likes me
I'm tired, not because of my sleep
I don't think I'm ready for the cliché speech
I'm tired, but I can't explain

Now people walk in and out anytime as if I'm a door
It's like we're making all these strangers out of friends and maybe more, yeah, yeah
Now these ice ain't breaking so it's melting in my drink

Lately I just feel so tired, not because of my sleep
I don't like nobody and nobody likes me
I'm tired of the peacock speech
I don't like nobody and nobody likes me
I'm tired, not because of my sleep
I don't think I'm ready for the cliché speech
I'm tired, but I can't explain

(Oh, I'm not sleepy)
(Oh, I need some space)

Now these ice ain't breaking so it's melting in my drink
Where the taste is failing like your insincerity

Lately I just feel so tired, not because of my sleep
I don't like nobody and nobody likes me
I'm tired of the peacock speech
I don't like nobody and nobody likes me
I'm tired, not because of my sleep
I don't think I'm ready for the cliché speech
I'm tired, but I can't explain
