		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  
Don't let your head rule your heart
Don't let your world be torn apart
Don't keep it all to yourself
Just let all your emotions run free 
With someone like me
That's the way it should be
Someone like me

I know it's hard when you're feeling down
To lift your feet apart from the ground
We make mistakes
But doesn't everybody
You don't always have to agree 
With someone like me
That's the way it should be
Someone like me

We know the story so far
I know what you want and who you are
Let all your emotions run free
You don't always have to agree 
With someone like me
But that's the way it should be
Someone like me
Someone like me
