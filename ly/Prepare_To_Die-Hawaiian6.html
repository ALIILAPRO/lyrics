		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark and thick
clouds cover all over the world
Threatening sounds
ring out everywhere
Sowing the seeds
of strife in the world
The shadow deepens much more
Promises break
Tips the scales of judgement
Hearing marching
sounds of the new world,
Now our daily life
is about to break down so badly
So many lies and
So many truths
All of these
are the realities of life
You cannot regret after the end
Let's get up, let's stand up
This is the world you live
Get back your freedom
Get back your future
We don't need a fake peace
This is not a battlefield
This is not a dead end
Listen,
We are not going to
prepare to die

If the world would end tomorrow,
What would I do?
I'd wanna say good bye at least
But,
I'm not talking about
such a cheap shit
We'll change the future
So many lies and
So many truths
All of these
are the realities of life
You cannot regret after the end
Let's get up, let's stand up
This is the world you live
Give me back my life
Give me back my heart
Can't be indifferent
Get back your freedom
Get back your future
We don't need a fake peace
This is not a battlefield
This is not a dead end
Let me find a place to die
Let's change the world you live
Get back your future
