		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living life like this is so crazy
This world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh
When they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run her back
Cause

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

So what now, (so what now), let's get down
Let's get drowned, on this vision, my division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say "what's your motivation?"
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving, (I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it
But fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
(Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it)

Making a single before your album is like
putting together a trailer for a movie you have yet to shoot
