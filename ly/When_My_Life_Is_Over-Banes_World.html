		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When my life is over
Hiding in your corner
Is the love we shared

Our hearts must have deceived us 
And this loneliness redeems us once again

We could never find it
Constantly reminded
That our love would end

It's happening in stages 
I'll cry about the changes   

I know thats its hard for you to be alone this time
You never trusted your heart my dear
I think its gonna take a long time 

Lost within the pages
Copy and then pasted in your arms again
Is it just me dreaming
I can't possibly believe it 

I'll pretend that I am next to you
In these dreams
