		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break the hard chains of fate
Roads we walk we create
For our futures are wide and vast

To respect and respond
To add strength to our bond
Cast the fury into the past
I can choose to be better at last

Through all the pain I've grown
Warm up this old heart of stone

Leave the hurt behind
Tearing the threads of the tethers
Leave the hurt behind
We can choose to be better
We can choose to be better

Crush the bones of despair
In the jaws of the bear
Prophecies may come to pass

Keep the beast deep within
Always under the skin
Let it claw through the mirror's glass
I can choose to be better at last

And even a heart of stone
Can warm when no longer alone

Leave the hurt behind
Tearing the threads of the tethers
Leave the hurt behind
We can choose to be better
We can choose to be better

In this winter of woe
Seeds of hope they still grow
Sheets of white over rock and grass

From contempt I have turned
Now I'm just trying to learn
Burning skies now overcast
I can choose to be better at last

Leave the hurt behind
Tearing the threads of the tethers
Leave the hurt behind
We can choose to be better
We can choose to be better
