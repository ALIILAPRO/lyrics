		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  White lies
You love to spin 'em
Eat that shit for dinner every night
Just like you love those white lines
Baby, you're bitter
Paint me like the sinner every time

If you can't take the heat, get the fuck out the kitchen
I won't be the one that's stuck reminiscin'
Say it's on me, but I ain't finna listen
You turned into a ghost
Out with your friends, so I'm at a party
2 AM sins, mix 'em up with Bacardi
Never say you're sorry, fucked her in the 'Rari, oh

Look who's cryin' now, tables turned around
Didn't give a fuck when it was my heart on the ground
But now you're on your knees while I'm wrapped in his sheets
Yeah, karma's a bitch, but she ain't got nothin' on me
Look who's cryin' now

No fun
Oh, how ironic
You can't stand when I'm holding the gun
But baby, you drew first blood
The way you cursed us
And then you had the nerve to call it love

If you can't take the heat, get the fuck out the kitchen
I won't be the one that's stuck reminiscing
Say it's on me, but I ain't finna listen
You turned into a ghost
Out with your friends, so I'm at a party
2 AM sins, mix 'em up with Bacardi
Never say you're sorry, fucked her in the 'Rari, oh

Look who's cryin' now, tables turned around
Didn't give a fuck when it was my heart on the ground
But now you're on your knees while I'm wrapped in his sheets
Yeah, karma's a bitch, but she ain't got nothin' on me
Look who's cryin' now (now, now)
Look who's cryin' (now, now), yeah
I said look who's cryin' now (now, now)
Look who's cryin' now (now, now)
Look who's cryin' now
