		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I don't know who to call when I'm off, nah
'Cause everybody's changing
Look away for a minute and you feel like you lost
Fuck, I'm running outta pages
Fading away in the dark night
I would never change put a bail on my past life
I fade away
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
You're really all alone and it's a dark world
I used to care but now she's just a lost girl
My mind is empty and cold and my heart burns
I might be blown away as the wind turns
Silhouettes, and my coffin
I won't break
They used to call me heaven-sent
But now I'm going back to where I started, ah
My blood flows out my chest
Trying to breathe don't know what's next
A part me won't let go
I'm only pulling myself under
Yeah, I don't know who to call when I'm off, nah
'Cause everybody's changing
Look away for a minute and you feel like you lost
Fuck, I'm running outta pages
Fading away in the dark night
I would never change, put a bail on my past life
I fade away
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
