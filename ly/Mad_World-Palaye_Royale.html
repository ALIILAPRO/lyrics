		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere

The tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrows
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
That dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very mad world, mad world

Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And they feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen

Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
That dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very mad world, mad world
Mad world, mad world

Mad world 
Mad world

And I find it kind of funny, I find it kind of sad
That dreams in which I'm dying, are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very mad world, mad world

Enlargen your world, mad world
