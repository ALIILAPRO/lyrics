		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  While she's been away
Livin' day-to-day's been tough
Without her at my side
Simply being alive's been rough
And though she won't be gone forever
There are many times I find it feels that way
And I'm not tryin' to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feelin' on that day

It's just like seein' her
For the first time again
It's just like seein' her
For the first time again

The time she's not around
Somewhere out of town's been hard
Somehow this old heart
Found time to work it out this far
And though I know she's comin' home soon
There are times I find it hard to feel that way
It's not inside me to forget her
Just understand how I'll be feelin' on that day

It's just like seein' her
For the first time again
It's just like seein' her
For the first time again
It's just like seein' her
For the first time again
It's just like seein' her
For the first time again
