		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been around the world, wonders to view
Been around the world, looking for someone like you
Pyramids try, Babylon too
But the beautiful-est treasures lie in the deepest blue

So I'll never say die, I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you

Been around the world, universe too
I've been around flying, baby, there's nothing I wouldn't do
Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
I'll be standing there besides you
Right when the storm comes through

'Cause I'll never say die, I'm never untrue
I'm never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire, that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is going to fight for you
My army of one is going to fall for you, yeah

'Cause you're right, 'cause you're right
'Cause you're right
My army of one is gonna call it through

Say my heart is my gun, army of one
Yeah my heart is my gun, army of one
Is my only weapon, army of one
Say my heart is my gun, army of one

(So I race for it)
Stare into darkness, staring at doom
My heart boom, bo-boom boom
Stare into darkness, admit defeat
Coming home and I'm finding no peace

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm out of luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know what you've got

So I put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, it's all right
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I race for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I race for it)

Stare into darkness, staring at doom
You make my heart go boom, bo-boom boom
Superhero, a masterpiece
Been in a city but it centered around me

And I know, and I know and I know
I know I'm in luck
And I know, and I know and I know
I know when I'm not

I just put my hands up to the sky, feel alive
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, feel it inside
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I just put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the prize
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna find
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

(So I reach for it) wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it)yeah yeah wherever you are, I'll find that treasure
(So I reach for it) and I know, and I know, and I know 
(So I reach for it) I know what I've got
X marks the spot
So I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocketship that I want to ride
I put my hands up to the sky, the feeling is like
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure

I put my hands up to the sky, feeling alright
I've got a rocket, eyes on the price
I put my hands up to the sky, I'm gonna fly
Wherever you are, I'll find that treasure, yeah yeah wherever you are
