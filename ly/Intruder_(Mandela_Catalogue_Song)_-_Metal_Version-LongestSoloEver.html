		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the fear of the unknown
The face in monochrome
Sound coming from your phone
Do you hear it?
I'm the terror on your screen
They don't know what you've seen
And once you've learned the truth
You know they'll never find you

So admit your fears
To the man on your TV
Do they know you're here?
Don't make me wake the others

Finding me here on your screen now
You're caught in between I'm
Repeating your screams
There's nowhere to hide
Sleeping but don't you remember
You followed The Shepherd
It's time to wake up
I am inside your home

Here, their faces aren't quite right
Intruders in the night
They'll speak the words on sight
Do you hear it?
Now, don't even try to scream
The ghost in the machine
You'll join the others
Thousands more, they'll never find you

So confess your fears
To the face you've always seen
Do they know you're here?
Don't make me wake the others

Finding me here on your screen now
You're caught in between I'm
Repeating your screams
There's nowhere to hide
Sleeping but don't you remember
You followed The Shepherd
It's time to wake up
I am inside your home

The door has been opened
The static is calling
Been waiting for you here
Forever and always
So admit your fears
Do they know you're here
You've made a bad decision
Nothing is worth the risk

Finding me here on your screen now
You're caught in between I'm
Repeating your screams
There's nowhere to hide
Sleeping but don't you remember
You followed The Shepherd
It's time to wake up
I am inside your home

Seeing your face on another
You're running for cover
It's here at your door and time is running out
Turn on the screen and obey me
I'm coming to save you
It's time to wake up
I am inside your home
