		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still see your green eyes every time that I close mine
Barefoot dancin', second glass of gas station wine
Yesterday I found the sweater that you left
Just one more reminder makes it hard to forget

You still get to me
Every time I find somebody
And I think I'm movin' on
You still get to me
And it still tears me to pieces
Every time I hear that song
'Cause you're not still the one
But you still get to me

When I go home, I stay off 285
'Cause I know you're somewhere in that ATL skyline
I heard you're happy now and that's what hurts the most
'Cause I'm in California and I still can't let you go

You still get to me
Every time I find somebody
And I think I'm movin' on
You still get to me
And it still tears me to pieces
Every time I hear that song
'Cause you're not still the one
But you still get to me

Even after all this time
Oh, you still get to me
And there ain't no gettin' over
All these memories, they're killin' me
Even after all this time, oh

You still get to me
Every time I find somebody
And I think I'm movin' on, whoa
You still get to me
And it still tears me to pieces
Every time I hear that song
'Cause you're not still the one
But you still get to me
