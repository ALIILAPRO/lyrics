		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea uh, 
I said baby dont worry Im way too numb to apologize, 
And we both feel sorry sometimes,
It okay to feel sorry sometimes,
And my momma told me keep distance cause all you do is wreck my mind,
And we both feel sorry sometimes,
its okay to feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldnt feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldnt feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldnt sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldnt feel sorry sometimes,
You been canceled come see the exit,
Say face for the broken,
Had you last threw you back took your heart and wrecked it,
All pain no emotion,
Grab em back the neck don't let go,
Baby Keem been top five what you smoking,
I could put a wish on her tippy toes,
No more opinion i'm done being open
I need one,
Hand in the air for the switch,
Two,
Hand in the air for a nigga you dont,
Three,
Hand in the air,
Four,
For the man in the mirror,
And I won't make it official,
I just hope we confidential,
Back and forth in a rental,
I pray to god that he sent you,
I said baby dont worry Im way too numb to apologize, 
And we both feel sorry sometimes,
It okay to feel sorry sometimes,
And my momma told me keep distance cause all you do is wreck my mind,
And we both feel sorry sometimes,
its okay to feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldnt sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't feel sorry sometimes,
I want you to pray for me,(pray)
Go out of your way for me(way)
Are you ever going to pray for me(pray),
That ain't nothing to play with,
Love tray falls down,
It don't come back around,
I can't stop now,
I can't stop now,
I said baby dont worry Im way too numb to apologize, 
And we both feel sorry sometimes,
It okay to feel sorry sometimes,
And my momma told me keep distance cause all you do is wreck my mind,
And we both feel sorry sometimes,
its okay to feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't feel sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't sorry sometimes,
We all feel sorry sometimes,
We shouldn't feel sorry sometimes,
