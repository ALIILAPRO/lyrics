		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There's something in this sound that takes me far
It's like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say you'll hear through my guitar

She told me add a bass line
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I'll never know
But it's beautiful

You can't take this away from me
The way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down the road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music gives me sun when winter starts

She told me add a bass line
And everything will be alright
She told me that the beat is mine
It will rock us through the night
And where I go
Can't explain I'll never know
But it's beautiful

You can't take this away from me
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me 
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

Hey! You can't take this away from me 
The way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me

You can't take this away from me 
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
(Just running through me)

Yo, I wear notes like coats
Blues like doos, war for the rhythm, soul that glues
That bounce to my bones, that jazz in my spine
The hop is my home, rap is my grind
I'm grindin' on the back side of life, we dance
She threw me a chance, my hands in my pants
Actually, my pockets holdin' me tight, whispering a dream I could hold in the night
(Look tight) a rhythm that's throbbin' my veins
Wake up and write it on the pad, the pains
Like church, the organ will invite the tears
(Like birth) the cryin' let you know I'm here
Held by the song that gave me a name
Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
(There's just bass in the line) safe to inhale
And if you live well
Then longer years in this state, you will be
A timeless octave to play for the tree
That's rooted in every single nerve in me
The nerve of he who ignores the key
And use it, it opens the minds that be free
Whenever you're hot-headed, pours you a breeze
Beneath the clouds, you allowed to see in clarity, through harmony
Someone harmin' me?
That won't be done
I stand protected by the laws of fun
I am perfected through the rhymes of run
Walkin' this way had the party stunned
This music, it launched me
With no aim, I've landed with some plane
Where I am I can't explain or ever know
But it's beautiful so

You can't take this away from me
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me (come on, yo)
You can't take this away from me
Oh the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
