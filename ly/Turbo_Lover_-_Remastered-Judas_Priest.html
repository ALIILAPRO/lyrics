		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You won't hear me
But you'll feel me
Without warning, somethings dawning, listen (listen, listen)
Then within your senses
You'll know you're defenseless
How your heart beats when you run for cover (cover, cover)
You can't retreat, I spy like no other

Then we race together
We can ride forever
Wrapped in horsepower, driving into fury
Changing gear, I pull you tighter to me

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

We hold each other closer, as we shift to overdrive
And everything goes rushing by, with every nerve alive
We move so fast, it seems as though we've taken to the sky
Love machines in harmony, we hear the engines cry

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

On and on we're charging to the place so many seek
In perfect synchronicity of which so many speak
We feel so close to heaven in this roaring heavy load
And then in sheer abandonment, we shatter and explode (explode)

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover

I'm your turbo lover
Tell me there's no other
I'm your turbo lover
Better run for cover
