		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
Back away from tangents, on the verge of drastic
Ways, can't escape this place, I deny your face
Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying

Put me in a homemade cellar
Put me in a hole for shelter
Someone hear me please, all I see is hate
I can hardly breathe, and I can hardly take it

Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
Hands on my face overbearing I can't

Lost, run at my own cost, fearing laughter, scoffed
Running from the rush, detached from such and such
Bleak, all around me, weak, listening, incomplete
I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging

I am in a buried kennel
I have never felt so final
Someone find me please, losing all reserve
I am fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
Hands on my face overbearing I can't

You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
There's something inside me
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise

Cut me, show me, enter, I am
Willing and able and never any danger to myself
Knowledge of my pain, knowledge of my pain
Or was my tolerance a phase?
Empathy, out of my way
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die
I can't die

You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something inside me
There's something inside me
There's something inside me
You all stare, but you'll never see
There's something in you I despise

Despise, despise

Purity
Purity
Purity
Purity
Purity
Purity
Purity
Purity

Have you ever seen God? 
Have you ever seen God? 
Have you ever seen God? 
Have you ever seen God?
