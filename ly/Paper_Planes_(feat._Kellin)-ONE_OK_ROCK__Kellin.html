		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out

Try and change me
Rearrange me
You're so crazy in the head (in the head)
Pull me closer
To the vultures'
But I won't be left for dead (left for dead)

You make me wanna go harder
Go a little bit larger
My fire starter
I'm gasoline
You make me feel so jaded
You're overrated
Burn up the pages
I'm kerosene

Money can talk but words are cheap
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
I'm taking my dollars and my dreams
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out

From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out

Can't contain me
In the mazes
I'll be breaking, through the seams
Leaving traces
That I'm making
Folding paper, into wings

Money can talk but words are cheap
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
I'm taking my dollars and my dreams
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out

(Show me what you get)
(Are you ready?)
(One, two, one, two, let's go!)

I'm not worried about a thing
No dollar bill is worth the price you pay
Don't need your money
I don't need the fame
So I cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out

Give me your car and your diamond ring
I'll burn it all to see the look on your face
What's it cost and is it worth the pain?
No I cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out

Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out

Money can talk but the words are cheap
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out
I'm taking my dollars and my dreams
So I'm gonna cash in, cash out

Paper planes and hand grenades
Paper planes and hand grenades

From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
From paper planes, to hand grenades
I'm gonna take you out
