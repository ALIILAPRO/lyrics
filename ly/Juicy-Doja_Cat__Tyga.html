		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep it juicy, juicy, I eat that lunch (yeah)
She keep that booty, booty, she keep that plump (yeah, yeah)
That natural beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front
Wait 'til you see it from the back 
Back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
If you could see it from the front, wait 'til you see it from the back

He like the Doja with the cat, yeah (cat, cat, cat)
He like it thick, he like it fat, yeah (fat, fat, fat)
Like to keep him wantin' more
He ask me "Doja, where you at, huh?" ("Doja, where you at, huh?")
And all the niggas wanna know
How long it take to pull my pants up
Broke a fingernail and then some
Tryna squeeze into my True Religion denim
Sell it big, don't wanna sell you light (I don't wanna sell it)
I don't buy it, where the cellulite? (Yeah, where that, where that at?)
He said the body unbelievable
Can't trust a big butt and a Gemini-i-i-i

I keep it juicy, juicy, I eat that lunch (yeah)
She keep that booty, booty, she keep that plump (yeah, yeah)
That natural beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front
Wait 'til you see it from the back 
Back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
If you could see it from the front, wait 'til you see it from the back

Bring that ass over, Doja, bring it back, back, back
I'm a big dog, tryna eat the kitty cat, cat
I'mma slide in, the way it fit, I can tell we match
All about my racks, hella cheese, I don't fuck with rats
Big crib in Hollywood, I don't even act
Call me lax, let a nigga tap, hit you on the app
Take a lil', with the, wipe the pain away
Juicy and it's tighter than a virgin, like Madonna say
I love when you give in, I love when you don't (sometimes)
Hit me with the threesome, and sometimes you won't (sometimes)
You told me don't fuck with no bitches you know (nah)
You got it, yeah, you got it baby, bust it on the floor (ay, ay) 

I keep it juicy, juicy, I eat that lunch (yeah)
She keep that booty, booty, she keep that plump (yeah, yeah)
That natural beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front
Wait 'til you see it from the back 
Back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
If you could see it from the front, wait 'til you see it from the back

He like it plump, he need that
Need the rump and need the thighs, he eat that
Eat that up, and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running, like it plump, he need that
Need the rump and need the thighs, he eat that
Eat that up and in the night, he see that
In the dark, and in the ride he keep that
Keep it running

I keep it juicy, juicy, I eat that lunch (yeah)
She keep that booty, booty, she keep that plump (yeah, yeah)
That natural beauty, beauty, yeah, yeah
If you could see it from the front
Wait 'til you see it from the back 
Back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, yeah, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
Back, back, back, back, back (wait 'til you see it from the)
If you could see it from the front, wait 'til you see it from the back
