		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think, maybe
Hold on, I'll try to give it another go
(Bo-Bo-Boxcutters)

My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I lose myself to suicide
My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I lose myself to suicide

Wokhardt on my dresser and I'm saving it for later
Look at your bills, my bills elevator
I woke up feeling fruity guess I'm feeling like a hater
Where I come from you can't flip you ain't a skater
And this is just a neighborly conversation with neighbors
They do not have a gun to me pointed under the table
And if you were to kick up and make another distraction
I could hit the door and be out if I am enabled
I won't be what you want to be
Kill my pets, label me a freak
I've lost bets, but that's on me
Kill my friends, fuck the police

My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I lose myself to suicide
My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I lose myself to suicide

I lean on my dresser, huh
Thinkin everyday, huh, how can I be extra, huh
I'ma find a way, uh
You can despite me all you want but I'll be paid, uh
You can drink my piss from a glass lemonade, yeah
Me like this type of instrumental, yeah (instrumental)
Avatar moves, elemental (elemental)
Weed mad loud like a kettle (like a kettle)
Crank that bass no treble, yeah (no treble)
You can hit me on my seven digits (on my digits)
Text me baby, yeah, I meant it (oh, goddamn)
Try not to get sentimental (stupid bitch)
Yeah, you like me, baby, I get it (you an idiot)
Lucky like a lottery, please don't try to talk to me (what? What? What?)
I'ma try to walk away if you try to talk to me (shut the fuck up)
Baby wanna fuck in my truck that's parked in my farm
Take her 'round the barn show lil' shawty that I'm hard (ayy, ayy, ayy)

My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I lose myself to suicide
My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I lose myself to suicide
