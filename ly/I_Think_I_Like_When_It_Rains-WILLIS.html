		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I like when it rains 
You told me to go to the light 
And what it's like to feel your pain 
Now I'm okay if you're alright 

I start to wonder why I came 
I dreamed of things you said to me 
We stayed at your place while it rains 
We talk and we laugh and watch TV 

And I couldn't find the words 
I couldn't think of what to say 
And all that I can do is stop 
And think about the day 

When all we used to dream about
was meeting after school
And we would go on home and start right back again 

I think I like when it rains 
Call up some friends and have some fun 
Oh Lord, I wish things were the same, nowadays 
We'd go back to your place when we're done

And I got nothing else to blame 
I wish the words would come to me 
We stay at your place while it rains 
We party while your mom is asleep

And I couldn't find the words 
I couldn't think of what to say 
And all that I can do
is stop and think about the days 

When all we used to dream about
was meeting after school
And we would go on home and start back again (hit it, Will)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 

And I couldn't find the words 
I couldn't think of what to say 
And all that I can do is stop think and about the days 
When all we used to dream about 
Was meeting after school 
And we would go on home and start back again 
We would go on home and start back again
