		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you to be rough but I want you to adore me
Adore me
(Mmm, mmm)
Yeah, I like it when you're tough but you'll never be above me
(Above me)
Adore me
I'm saving all my love, saving all my love for you
(For you)
For you
(For you)
I'm taking back the rush, I'm scared of being crushed by you
(By you)
By you
(By you)
So put your hands on my skin, but I won't let you sink in
I'm not just for the weekend
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
So put your hands on my skin, but I won't let you sink in
I'm not just for the weekend
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
(Give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
(Give you nothing, give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
Keep my lipstick on your lips so I'll know that you have got me
(You've got me)
You've got me, oh, oh
Let you under my fingertips if you show me that you're honest
So be honest
I'm saving all my love, saving all my love for you
(For you)
For you
(For you)
I'm taking back the rush, I'm scared of being crushed by you
(By you)
By you
(By you)
So put your hands on my skin, but I won't let you sink in
I'm not just for the weekend
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
So put your hands on my skin, but I won't let you sink in
I'm not just for the weekend
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
(Give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
(Give you nothing, give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
I want you, babe, but I know you're not
I know you care but I know you got your problems
My problem is I'm saving all my love, saving all my love for you
For you, yeah
So put your hands on my skin, but I won't let you sink in
I'm not just for the weekend
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
So put your hands on my skin, but I won't let you sink in
I'm not just for the weekend
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
(Give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
(Give you nothing, give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all or I'll give you nothing
(Give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
(Give you nothing, give you nothing, give you nothing)
Give me all
