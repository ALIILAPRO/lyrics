		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  FOURMATIC boys on the rise
We the wave like erosion's
Y'all niggas way too tired
Nigga what do you gain from emotions?
Stop the commotion
Y'all niggas not outside

Suck a dick, you sucka niggas can die
If I want it there ain't no way you can stop it
I could cancel all your plans with a swipe
I could cancel all your plans for life

Truthfully
You see the physique
You know you not fucking with me
To keep it a bean, I need me a G
If I'm putting words to a sheet
You niggas centipedes
You sensitive, please
A hundred feet on 'em at least
I'm where I'm 'posed to be
My spirit at ease, you don't wanna talk about free
I need 20 million on me (tax free)
Why you talking on the tweets? (At me)
I can see it in your face you don't feel safe (acne) 
Won't you come clean? (Tax free)

Got a brand new watch, that bitch tax free (yuh)
I don't need no Glock for no rap beef (safe)
Them boys Xerox, that's a pet peeve (yuh)
Bitch, I paid my dues
Tax free

Maytag niggas, I'm a Maytag niggas (Maytag)
Maytag niggas, I'm a Maytag niggas (louder)
Maytag niggas, I'm a Maytag niggas (kids)
Maytag niggas, I'm a Maytag niggas (louder)
Yeah

Name a nigga that can wash me (yea right, okay)
Better go get some money (yea right, okay)
Air it out like laundry (yea right, okay)
All my real niggas copy (yea right, okay)

Maytag niggas, I'm a Maytag niggas (Maytag)
Maytag niggas, I'm a Maytag niggas
(Maytag)

Sick of all you hoes, it's a pandemic
He said he want smoke can he handle it? No
You don't gotta question if I'm authentic
All my hoes from the motherland they look like Russell Stover
Bitch, I'm feeling extra as fuck
Leprechaun scope, nigga, push your luck
I don't need to boast I just gotta show up
Yeah, I heard all your flows, you not fucking with us (bitch)
Yeah, uh (bitch)
Bitch, I know yo' baby momma way too well especially
She tell me what time you work, so I'll be there 'til next week
I got me some lead for anybody wanna test me
Bless me, I don't need protection
Capricorn king, you can't cancel me (cancel me)
Well dressed hood booger, baby, dance with me
I know what you want, get your hands off me
All she get is dick at happy hour then she go to sleep

Tell me who you with 'cause ain't no playing sides (playing sides)
Run up on yo' ass, it's just me no mas (only me)
Niggas mad cause my theme song like E. Coli (sick as fuck))
Roaming with pockets of romaine
Gold chains, go change your gang
Niggas want yo lane, no way
I'ma let you get in my space
I'ma take the food off yo plate
I'ma give yo' boo Yoplait
Playing no games with this shit
I'm like Coltrane with this shit
Put my Soul Train in yo bitch
Head for goal don't need assist
How you the G.O.A.T? You don't exist
Open the door, hit me a lick
Bitch I'm Hov's 92 bricks
Losing control, niggas don't know where to go
You headed straight for the cliff
You get exposed, you perpetrate in your flows
Better come clean with that shit
(Maytag)
