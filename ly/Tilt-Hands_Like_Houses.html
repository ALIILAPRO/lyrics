		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if I told you that we're all the same
If no one is equal in this endless game?
What if I told you it's out of your hands?
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed
You'll want the same

You again, the future, has failed us, it's coming round again
The sickness, the sadness, the cycles have to win
Somehow, we're tilted and the ringing in my ears
Won't go away, it's happening again

If no one is equal in this endless game?
What if I told you it's out of your hands?
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed
You'll want the same, we all want the same

Here we go again, the feeling of falling
It's all we'll ever know
Swing backwards and forwards
It's getting old

My hands are tied behind my back
And I can barely catch my breath
And here we go again

What if I told you that we're all the same
If no one is equal in this endless game?
What if I told you it's out of your hands?
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed
You all want the same

And after all is said and done
We can right the wrongs and make our own
In time to start it all again
The cycle's gotta break

What if I told you that we're all the same
If no one is equal in this endless game?
What if I told you it's out of your hands?
And after all is said and done, and nothing has changed
You all want the same

The future has failed us, it's coming round again
The pendulum is broken, so we swing it by the neck
Instead, we're tilted, the ringing in my ears
Won't go away, it's happening again
You all want the same, we all want the same
