		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love,
Its been a long time since I cried
And left you out of the blue
Its hard leaving you that way 
When I never wanted to

Self-denial is a game
Its strange I never would've
Wanted if until there was you

Because I have learned that love is beyond
What human can imagine,
The more it clears
The more I have to let you go


But now I don'T understand why I'm feeling
So bad now when I know it was my idea
I could've just denied the truth and lied
But why am I the only one standing stranded
On the same ground?

My love because I have learned that love is a
Word gets thrown a little bit too much
The best excuse to fill the infinite abyss
I never have to if all else fail

Would you be there to love me?
When all else fail,
Would you be brave to see right through me?
