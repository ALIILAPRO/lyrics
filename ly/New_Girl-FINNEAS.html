		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crush, who's got a crush?
I like the way you blush
I like the way you bite
Touch, each time we touch
I wanna take too much
Keep me up all night

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play, my new girl?
I wanna play with you

Cash, got hard earned cash
I like the way you crash
Your lips into mine
Fast, we drive too fast
We got a checkered past
But I can let it slide

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play, my new girl?
I wanna play with you

Why'd you cut up all your clothes?
Tell me something no one knows
I don't owe you anything
But you're too much fun to let it rain
Ain't it fun, remembering?

I wanna scratch your surface
I wanna feel your groove
I wanna be your needle
I wanna lick your wound
You wanna play with fire?
Stick and poke tattoo?
You wanna play, my new girl?
I wanna play with you
