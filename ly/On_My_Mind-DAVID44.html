		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got these questions on my mind
But I'm afraid what I might find
You got me thinking, until I go crazy
So let me get this off my chest

Ey eyy
I really need to know
Ey eyy
You gotta let me know

Do you think about me baby
Did you think about me lately 
Do you think about me baby
Did you think about me lately

Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been 
On my, on my, on my mind

I was looking for some love
And then you came from up above
Now you got me crazy
I feel sedaded
I gotta get this off my chest

Ey eyy
I really need to know
Ey eyy
You gotta let me know

Do you think about me baby
Did you think about me lately 
Do you think about me baby
Did you think about me lately

Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been 
On my, on my, on my mind

Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been
On my, on my, on my mind
Baby you've been 
On my, on my, on my mind
