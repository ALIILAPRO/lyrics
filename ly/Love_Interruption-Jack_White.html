		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want love to roll me over slowly
Stick a knife inside me, and twist it all around

I want love to grab my fingers gently
Slam them in a doorway, put my face into the ground

I want love to murder my own mother and
Take her off to somewhere like hell or up above

I want love to change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies and show me how it's all my fault

I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
Yeah, I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore

I want love to walk right up and bite me
Grab a hold of me and fight me leave me dying on the ground

And I want love to, split my mouth wide open and
Cover up my ears and never let me hear a sound

I want love to, forget that you offended me
Or how you have defended me when everybody tore me down

Yeah, I want love to change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies and show me how it's all my fault

Yeah I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt, or interrupt me anymore
