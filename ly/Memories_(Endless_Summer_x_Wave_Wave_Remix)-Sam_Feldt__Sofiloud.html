		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you sometimes in the places
You and I used to go
Sometimes I just fall into pieces
More than you'll ever know

On my mind
All the time
Not a day, not a day, not a day
That I don't miss you
How I tried
To say goodbye
Every day, every day, every day
But I don't want to

I search for you through lonely eyes
Too hard for me to say goodbye
My love for you will never die
You're in my heart forever
Sometimes I see you in my dreams
Feel like you're right there next to me
Now all I got are memories
You're in my heart forever
You're in my heart forever

How can I move on and accept it?
I'm never gonna get you back
Left my life when I least expect it
And how do I handle that?

On my mind
All the time
Not a day, not a day, not a day
That I don't miss you
How I tried
To say goodbye
Every day, every day, every day
But I don't want to

I search for you through lonely eyes
Too hard for me to say goodbye
My love for you will never die
You're in my heart forever
Sometimes I see you in my dreams
Feel like you're right there next to me
Now all I got are memories
You're in my heart forever
You're in my heart forever

I'll search for you through lonely eyes
Too hard for me to say goodbye
My love for you will never die
You're in my heart forever
Sometimes I see you in my dreams
Feel like you're right there next to me
Now all I got are memories
You're in my heart forever
