		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running off over next door's garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone?
Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned?
Or you'll find yourself in a skirmish
Where you wish you'd never been born
You tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong
But we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks?
Can only hope that the ending is a pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And it's wrong, wrong, wrong
She can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks is this
Crime?

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight
That's right, he won't let her out his sight

Well, you'll be able to boast
Of the day of the most
Flawless heist of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble
Right before the very first kiss
Quiet, unassuming
But you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
But sorry, sweetheart, I'd much rather
Keep on the balaclava
