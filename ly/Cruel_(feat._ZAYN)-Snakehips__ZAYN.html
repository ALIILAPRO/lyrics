		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cab radio screaming
Noise and tears
Death on the TV
And then there's you
It's fucked, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline
Mhmm

Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl, ah ooh
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl, ah na na na na

Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then there's you
Venus in Converse
You put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door
For us

Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness you stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl, ah ooh
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl, ah na na na

Who do you love, who do you love?
Who do you love, who do you love?
Just see your outline

Back where we left off
Help you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness you stay so sweet

It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl, ah ooh
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl, ah na na na

Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster
Me and you
