		  Little Sister
(John Cale, Lou Reed)
Don't call me home, little sister
Before the night is done
My love and I are fleeing
Running into the sun.

Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well.

Take up all your jewels and gold,
Bury them away in the earth.
Let your memory reduce them to dust
But don't forget the knife that was thrust.

Turn to fly, go away
Little bird, please don't stay
Fare thee well.

Frozen kiss by the fountain
Running into the sea
Where shadows choose their horrors
Designed for music.

Turn to fly, go away,
Little bird, please don't stay,
Fare thee well.
