		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poolside convo about your summer last night
Ooh yeah, about your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night? (Last night)
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never
'Cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's nothing, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing

I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, oh, you got it
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, oh, you got it
Yeah
I, I, I know you gotta leave, leave, leave
Take down some summertime
Give up, just tonight, 'night, 'night
I, I, I know you got someone comin'
You're spittin' game, oh, you got it
