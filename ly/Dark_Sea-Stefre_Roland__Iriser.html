		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep down fall into my soul
There are only stones
Can't see the bottom
Can't feel my soul
Deep down fall into my soul
Into my soul

Dark blue sea is calling me
Empty horizon knows what I feel
Sun goes down behind the mountains
It kisses my chapped lips

Dark blue sea is calling me

Deep down fall into my soul
There are only stones
Can't see the bottom
Can't feel my soul

Deep down fall into my soul
There are only stones
Can't see the bottom
Can't feel my soul

Deep down fall into my soul
There are only stones
Can't see the bottom
Can't feel my soul
Deep down fall into my soul
Into my soul

Dark blue sea is calling me
Empty horizon knows what I feel
Sun goes down behind the mountains
It kisses my chapped lips

Dark blue sea is calling me

Deep down fall into my soul
There are only stones
Can't see the bottom
Can't feel my soul

Deep down fall into my soul
There are only stones
Can't see the bottom
Can't feel my soul
