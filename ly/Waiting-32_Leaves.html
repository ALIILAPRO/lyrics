		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Waiting
Rip apart like everything
Anger me through the ceiling
Say the one thing
That drives me crazy
Till I'm burning in the fire again
I swear
I am burning in the fire again

I know I've been there once before
With my face down to the floor
Begging to feel the weight no more

Jaded by the ways of the world, I keep on waiting
Waiting here alone
Jaded by like the rest of the world, I keep on waiting
Waiting here alone

Speak to me in riddles that
Are somewhat hard to understand
Say something or don't say anything
And I'm preaching to the choir again
I swear
I am preaching to the choir again

I know I've been there once before
With my face down to the floor
Beggin' to feel the weight no more

Jaded by the ways of the world, I keep on waiting
Waiting here alone
Jaded by like the rest of the world, I keep on waiting
Waiting here alone

So I pave my own way
Just to get through the cold
I'm so sick of suffering and waiting here alone

Jaded by the ways of the world, I keep on waiting
Waiting here alone
Jaded by like the rest of the world, I keep on waiting
Waiting here alone
