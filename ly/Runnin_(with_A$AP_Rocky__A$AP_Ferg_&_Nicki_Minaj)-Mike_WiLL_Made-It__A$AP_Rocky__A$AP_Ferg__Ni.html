		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came up out the mud, brush the dirt up off me
Going hard, hit them where it hurts, kill them softly
Bone stretch tryna clear my mind, even smoke less
Hopelessness but I'm in this shit for flesh
Talk reckless, coming for your neck, no strep throat
Runnin', runnin', runnin' this shit, both legs broke
Runnin' 'round town, yeah they comin' for my head though
Funny thing about it they don't always see my head though
Schizo, maniac I'm fiendin' to go klepto
So hands-on kinda hard for me to let go
Let go, stacking presidents like a LEGO
Would introduce you to my friends but they dead though
(Came up out the mud, brush the dirt off of me)

Ayo
Runnin', runnin', runnin', I'ma take it like a klepto
Anybody want it, they can get it, come correct though
Talk behind my back but when they see me it's respect though
Still got the crown, so I never give a F though
Everything is wavy, I'ma hit 'em with the breast stroke
Then I'ma get high, I'ma get the best dope
Yeah, I make the rules, I ain't following the dress code
I-I ain't do the mess though, I'ma put a hex though
I-I ain't with the hugs and kisses, don't do the XO
Soon as the bell go ding, doe
I'll be in the ring though, we can shoot cinco
Look at all these clowns, how they studying my lingo
Peaking out the window, but they never win though

Came up out the mud, brush the dirt up off me
Going hard, hit them where it hurts, kill them softly
Bone stretch tryna clear my mind, even smoke less
Hopelessness but I'm in this shit for flesh
Talk reckless, coming for your neck, no strep throat
Runnin', runnin', runnin' this shit, both legs broke
Runnin' 'round town, yeah they comin' for my head though
Funny thing about it they don't always see my head though

I'mma flex, yes, I'm the best, I'm the veteran (yeah)
In the Lex, yes, big baguettes in my necklace (woo)
In his head, neck, in his chest he gon' catch a fist (right)
I go deck, deck, break his leg, do it effortless (yeah)
In the ring, ain't no fucking game, ain't no Tetris
Hit him, bang, I'mma shake his brain, I'm gon' never rest (durr)
Man, I'm air, I'm the fucking champ, I can't fail at this (woo-woo)
Money dance, by the million bands, I got hella grip (durr)
Hella chips with a lot of chics coming by the clique
Mo' sex with the Rolex, come without a tip (yeah)
Mo' grip when the dough flip, gimme mo' lick
Whole fist break his whole shit, tuck up lil' bitch
Getting fit, I'mma win the chip
Watch them catch a fit
