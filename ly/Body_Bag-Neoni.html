		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Police tape, don't cross the line
It looks like there's been a crime
And ooh, it's your favourite type
Attempted murder of my mind
Can't even have a conversation
Without you breaking character
Yeah, you going Jason, two-faced
It'll be a cold day in whatever hell you came from
Before I let you get inside my brain and

Get in line, get in line
In line, line, line, line
You were not the first to try
Better luck next time

Body bag
Thought you could put me in a body bag
You tried your best, but it was never gonna last
You know me, I'm always coming back
You can keep your body bag
Your body, body

Haha, did you miss me, bitch?
Did you reminisce signing my death certificate?
You almost got away with it
But the reaper snitched, now you got to admit to
Your crimes, your lies
So slick, so sly, yeah
Why you gotta be that guy? Like
We could've been so tight, yeah (yeah)
But you just had to decide to

Get in line, get in line
In line, line, line, line
You are not the first to try
Better luck next time

Body bag
Thought you could put me in a body bag
You tried your best, but it was never gonna last
You know me, I'm always coming back
You can keep your body bag
Your body, body

Bag, ba-a-a-a-ag
Body, body bag, ba-a-a-a-ag
Body

Murder in the first degree
Sucks that you didn't succeed
Lock you up and toss the key
Welcome to living dead to me
Murder in the first degree
Sucks that you didn't succeed
Lock you up and toss the key
Welcome to living dead to me
Dead to me, dead to me, dead to me, dead to me

Body bag
Thought you could put me in a body bag
You tried your best, but it was never gonna last
You know me, I'm always coming back (always coming back)
You can keep your body bag
Your body, body

Bag (haha), ba-a-a-a-ag
Body, body bag (haha), ba-a-a-a-ag
Body, body
