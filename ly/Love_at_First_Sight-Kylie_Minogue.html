		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought that I was going crazy
Just havin' one those days, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out to fill up the sky
The music you were playin' really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause baby, when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one

I was tired of running out of luck
Thinkin' 'bout giving up, yeah
Didn't know what to do
Then there was you

And everything went from wrong to right
And the stars came out to fill up the sky
The music you were playin' really blew my mind
It was love at first sight

'Cause baby, when I heard you (when I heard you)
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one (to be as one)

'Cause baby, when I heard you
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one

Everythin' went from wrong to right
And the stars came out and filled up the sky (up the sky)
The music you were playin' really blew my mind
It was love at first sight
Love at first sight
Love at first sight
Love
Ooh, it was love, it was love at first sight

'Cause baby, when I heard you (when I heard you)
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one (to be as one)

'Cause baby, when I heard you (when I heard)
For the first time I knew
We were meant to be as one

It was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
Ooh, it was love, it was love, it was love, it was love
