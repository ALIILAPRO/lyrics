		<p>
		  Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (what's wrong with me?)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (why do I feel like this?)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (I'm going crazy now)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum

No more gas in the rig
Can't even get it started
Nothing heard, nothing said
Can't even speak about it
Out my life, out my head
Don't want to think about it
Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (uh-huh)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (uh-huh)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (uh-huh)
It's too close for comfort, ohh

Put on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight?
Your mind is in disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia
Disturbia

Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum

Faded pictures on the wall
It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnectin' all calls
Your phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this shh out
It's too close for comfort, oh-ohh

It's a thief in the night to come and grab you (uh-huh)
It can creep up inside you and consume you (uh-huh)
A disease of the mind, it can control you (uh-huh)
I feel like a monster, ohh

Put on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder (city of lights)
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out (ohh), you might just go under
Better think twice (think twice)
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise (be wise)

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you (oh) tonight? 
Your mind's in disturbia (oh)
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia (what you like)
Disturbia

Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (ba-da-da-da-dee-da)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (ba-da-da-da-dee-da)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (disturbia)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (oh, oh)

Release me from this curse I'm in
Trying to maintain but I'm struggling
If you can't go
I think I'm going to oh, oh, oh, oh-ohh

Put on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder (woo)
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must falter be wise

Your mind's in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight?
Your mind's in disturbia
Ain't (distubria) used to what you like
Disturbia
Disturbia

Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (ba-da-da-da-dee-da)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (ba-da-da-da-dee-da)
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum
Bum-bum-be-dum-bum-bum-be-dum-bum (ohh-ohh)
