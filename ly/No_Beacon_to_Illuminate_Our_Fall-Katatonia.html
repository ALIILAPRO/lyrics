		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That star used to shine
But it fell below the line
Dropped under my eyes
Thrown to the old shade
And shall never live again

In the power of dusk, inception of suspense
Channeling words to trouble the quiet
Surrender into the dark spread of a wing
It's visible now
How our past freedom turns to dust

Approaching our departure
No solace in our call
Scattered across the skyline
No beacon to illuminate our fall
(No dreaming back to everlasting light)
(No dreaming back to everlasting light)

I arm my dead mind
With the final reason
Will sell it to the lowest bidder
My final reason

I arm my dead mind
With the final reason
Will sell it to the lowest bidder
My final reason

I arm my dead mind (aim below the axis)
With the final reason (lose even more)
Will sell it to the lowest bidder (every day)
My final reason

It won't matter if you get back beneath my hand
No black magic ever enough to command

Approaching our departure
No solace in our call
Scattered across the skyline
No beacon to illuminate our fall (illuminate our fall)

Sedated
I'm turning myself in
Uncomplicated
The more you hurt, the more I love you

Vacated
The sickness tears my skin
I'm terminated
The more you hurt, the more I love you

Spent, can't undo
Nausea divine
Drifting off from life
And won't
Make it back
