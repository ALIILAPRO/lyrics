		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well, you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Well, you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
Well, you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (oh)

Well, you're windy and wild
You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Well, you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black, don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well, you dance when you walk
So let's dance, take a chance, understand me
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (ow)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (ow)
(Get it on)

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on 
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Take me
For a meanwhile I'm still thinking
