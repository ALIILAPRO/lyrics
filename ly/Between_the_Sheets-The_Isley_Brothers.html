		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey girl, ain't no mystery
At least as far as I can see
I want to keep you here
Laying next to me
Sharing our love between the sheets

Ooh baby (baby)
I feel your love surrounding me
Woah, oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh baby (baby)
Making love between the sheets

Ooh girl, let me hold you tight
And you know I'll make you feel alright
Oh baby girl, just cling to me and let your mind be free
While making love between the sheets

Ooh girl, I love you all night long
And I know you felt it coming on
Ooh darling, just taste my love
Ooh you taste so sweet
Sharing our love between the sheets

Ooh baby (baby)
I feel your love surrounding me
Woah, oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh baby (baby)
Making love between the sheets

Hey girl, what's your fantasy?
I'll take you there to that ecstasy
Ooh girl, you blow my mind
I'll always be your freak
Let's make sweet love between the sheets

Ooh baby (baby)
I feel your love surrounding me
Woah, oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh baby (baby)
Making love between the sheets

Ooh baby (baby)
I feel your love surrounding me
Woah, oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh baby (baby)
Making love between the sheets

Enough of this singin', let's make love

In between the sheets

Oh, I like the way you receive me
Girl I love the way you release me
I'm coming
Coming on strong (sweet darling)
In between the sheets

Oh, I like the way you receive me
Girl, I love the way you release me
Coming 
Coming on strong (ooh, sweet darling)
In between the sheets

You got me moaning
Girl, you got me groaning
I'm coming
Coming on strong (sweet darling)
In between the sheets

(Let's get all the way down)

You're the only one

I'm coming, coming, coming, coming, coming on strong (sweet darling)
In between the sheets

Da-da-da-da, da
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da
