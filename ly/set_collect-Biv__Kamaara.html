		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No disrespect, but only came to collect yuh
Pull up in all black, suggesting you run us that check yuh
Don't pose as a threat
You pussies don't pose as a threat
Mayville, Mayville, baby yeah you know the set yuh

Yall don't come from a spot
Where the pussy get popped
And the jaw get locked yuh
Ball so hard need ice on the cock
But I flaunt what I got yuh yuh
Still ain't need me a lot
Pray on my life
All the bitch want want
Dick in her gums
So she suck my funds
It's never her spot
Bitch just stop
Stackin thoughts
That leave me lost
I been exhaust
The smoke involved
We list it off
Can't miss at all
The shots get sprung
Ya mans is gone
Fuck this life
Bitch fuck you on
Fuck this life
Bitch fuck you on
Fuck this life
Bitch fuck you on
Bitch fuck you on yuh
They set it all up
For failure an such
Dastardly deed
No different to me
We chasin the fee
Got family to feed
Nobody should see
The happy we feed
Nobody should see
I need what I need
No different than me
Stand for my shit
While they taken they seats
Stand for my shit
While they taken they seats

No disrespect, but only came to collect yuh
Pull up in all black, suggesting you run us that check yuh
Don't pose as a threat
You pussies don't pose as a threat
Mayville, Mayville, baby yeah you know the set yuh

Bet that bitch want me dead
They been knockin in my head
I'm not living just for them
Bitch I'm crawling out my flesh
Bitch I'm crawling out my flesh

Bet that bitch want me dead
They been knockin in my head
I'm not living just for them
Bitch I'm crawling out my flesh
Bet that bitch want me dead
They been knockin in my head
I'm not living just for them
Bitch I'm crawling out my flesh
Bet that bitch want me dead
