		  Verse 1
Why u act so cold
When you say it's fine
Yeah I lost control
Baby in my mind
But I hope you know
That we still got time
Yeah I hope you know
Pre
Where did you go my love
What did I do my love
Why don't you want my love
It's unconditional
Where did you go my love
What did I do my love
Why don't you want my love
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
My love
My love
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
My love
My love
Verse 2
Tell me how you feel
What is on your mind
Want this to be real
Not a pie in the sky
When I close my eyes
You are by my side
When I close my eyes
Pre
Where did you go my love
What did I do my love
Why don't you want my love
It's unconditional
Where did you go my love
What did I do my love
Why don't you want my love
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
My love
My love
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
It's unconditional
My love
My love
