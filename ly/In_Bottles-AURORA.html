		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I put my tears in bottles
In case if I need them later
You never know, you never know
And if I get thirsty
Will they make me sad forever?
Forever

Oh, cover your eyes
Cover your eyes
Hide me inside, under your spine
Under your spine

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Oh

I will kindly watch you sleep
And I find out that your eyes are open
I hide other pieces that you never would have liked
If you knew about them
So I hide my children

Oh, cover your eyes
Cover your eyes
Hide me inside, under your spine
Under your spine

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Under your spine
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Under your spine

Mmm, ah
Mmm, ooh
I watch you sleeping under
I watch you sleeping under
I watch you sleeping under
Oh

Oh, cover your eyes
Cover your eyes
Hide me inside, under your spine
Under your spine

Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
Under your spine
Oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh
(Under your spine)

Down your spine, down your spine
Down your spine, down your spine
Oh, oh oh
Under your spine
