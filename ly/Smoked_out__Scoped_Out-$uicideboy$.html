		  Funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked out, funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked, funked out loced out
Fuck you, bitch! Funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked, funked out, loced, out
Funked out, funked, funked out, loced, out
Funked out, funked, funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked out funked out, loced out
Fuck you, bitch!

Ruby smoking like he's haunted
Big blunt, I light the front end
Me and my bitch, we keep it 80
20, get it how I want it
Double cup, I fucking double deck
Sippin' piss, I'm sippin' Tussionex
Told that bitch, "I'm cutting necks"
Pullin' out her throat
While I pull up in the fucking Benz
Told her fucking friends
"Ruby ain't that cool in person!"
So I asked her fucking friends if it
Was cool if I insert it snatch they purses
Now I'm countin' all this money
Yeah, practice makes it perfect
Money can't buy you happiness
All my life I fucking heard it
But money can buy a lotta drugs
At least enough to last me
Shit, I think I fuckin' earned it earned it
Ain't got a purpose and that's on purpose
What's worse is, I deserve it

Smoking on the bud sack, ounces of that indo
Paranoid illusions
Tap the gun against the window
Substance in my lungs, slow-motion
Benz cruisin'
Masked up, ensuing, rob 'cause I'm overusing
Six double six elements
Never quit or dope sick, the D, the O, the P
The E
I'm always on a chase to hit up outer space
Ain't no case where I don't
Need it every fucking day
When you see us, yeah
You know we on them fucking drugs
Percocets, Xanax, Roxycodone, crush 'em up
Snort it
Top notch bud crop, maybe quit later
Fuck that, 'till I'm dead
I am poppin' medication

Funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked, funked out, loced out
Fuck you, bitch! Funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked, funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked out funked out, loced out
Funked out, funked, funked out, loced out
Fuck you, bitch!
