		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (turn it up a lil' more)

Yeah, 'xtended in the Glocks
Know how we rock (yeah)
Speakin' on the shit, don't sweat
 blow his teeth out (Booyah)
Bad bitches droppin' neck for no reason
(ah, ah) hope I don't wreck in the 'Vette
(skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt) 'Cause I'm speedin'
Hoe call, don't answer (hello)
Niggas pocket watching
They wonder how I'm eating (Ha)
She see the Benz logo
Swingin' off the keychain (you like?)
Nigga, I got game for a lame like it's EA
(game, game, game, game)

These plays hit me back to back on my prepaid
(Brrt, brrt) 40 shells burn, don't get hit
They'll cremate you
Saks Edition, hunnid' made, I got two pairs
Walk in Ruth Chris with some mud
Up in my Root Beer (it's good)
My lil' mans filled a grave
He got a few tears (facts)
DA found about it, built a case
He got a few years (fuck 'em)
Back it up, beep beep bitch (beep beep bitch)
Had her on her knees 'til her jeans ripped
('til her jeans ripped)
All that mean muggin' don't mean shit
(never did)
Yeah, my cup dirty, but it's clean in it
(mud, mud)
Hit up Avianne, had my team with me (whew)
Since I left the hood, all the feens miss me
(aww, they miss me)

Yeah, 'xtended in the Glocks
Know how we rock (yeah)
Speakin' on the shit, don't sweat
Blow his teeth out (Booyah)
Bad bitches droppin' neck for no reason
Hope I don't wreck in the 'Vette
(skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt) 'Cause I'm speedin'
Hoe call, don't answer
Niggas pocket watching
They wonder how I'm eating (Ha)
She see the Benz logo
Swingin' off the keychain (you like?)
Nigga, I got game for a lame like it's EA
(game, game, game, game)

Smokin' gas in the hood, roll the windows up
(roll 'em up) probably dolo
But I'm moving like it's ten of us
Fuckin' on two bimbos, they identical (ha)
Trap boomin', never late when the rent is due
Catch you snoozin' on that street
I'ma finish you (Booyah)
Valentino on the feet, them just tennis shoes
(you like?) yeah, never make a move
Unless my heart is in it
You could smell it in the room
It's some hard up in it (damn)
Yeah, sharks up in the water
Don't get caught up in it
Young nigga, lotta' money
And a lotta' bitches real player
You could tell I'm one
Of my father's children
Watchin' what I'm sayin'
Nigga I got charges pending (fuck 'em)

Yeah, 'xtended in the Glocks
Know how we rock (yeah)
Speakin' on the shit, don't sweat
Blow his teeth out (Booyah)
Bad bitches droppin' neck for no reason
(ah, ah) hope I don't wreck in the 'Vette
(skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt) 'Cause I'm speedin'
Hoe call, don't answer (hello)
Niggas pocket watching
They wonder how I'm eating (Ha)
She see the Benz logo
Swingin' off the keychain (you like?)
Nigga, I got game for a lame like it's EA
(game, game, game, game)
