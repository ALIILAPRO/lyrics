		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There once was a lad who looked like me
He was an innocent soul but he loved TV
His friend got him into anime
And now he's a gahdamn weeb

Oh no he's addicted to porn
He watches hentai way into the morn
One day he was having some fun
Till his mom burst in Oh no

His step sis whispered onii-Chan
It felt so wrong but he was a fan
She got stuck in the laundry door
Ohwatch the little lad go

Oh no he's addicted to porn
He watches hentai way into the morn
One day he was having some fun
Till his mom burst in Oh no

When his stepmom walked in she was mad
She said imma bout to tell y'all's dad
Unless y'all wanna run it back
And make it a party of three

Oh no he's addicted to porn
He watches hentai way into the morn
One day he was having some fun
Till his mom burst in Oh no
