		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Memories is all that's left behind
As I lay and wait to die
Little do they know
That I hear their choice of life

End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope - Why don't you

Pull the plug
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to life this way

Once I had full control of my life
I now behold a machine decides my fate
End it now it's all to late

What has now been days, it seems like years
To stay like this is what I fear
Life ends so fast, so take your chance
And make it last

End it now, it is the only way
Too cruel, that is what they say
Release me from this lonely world
There is no hope - Why don't you

Pull the plug
Let me pass away
Pull the plug
Don't want to life this way
