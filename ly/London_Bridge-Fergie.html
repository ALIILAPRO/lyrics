		<p>
		  Oh, shit (oh, shit, oh, shit)
Oh, shit (oh, shit, oh, shit)
Oh, shit (oh, shit, oh, shit)
Are you ready for this?
Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit
Oh
It's me
Fergie
The Pen! 
Polow
(Fergie, Ferg, what's up baby?)

When I come to the club, step aside (oh shit)
Part the seas, don't be having me in the line (oh shit)
VIP, 'cause you know I gotta shine (oh shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time (oh shit)

All my girls get down on the floor (oh shit)
Back to back, drop it down real low (oh shit)
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a hoe (oh shit)
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go (oh shit)

How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like

How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like

Drinks start pouring 
And my speech start slurring
Everybody start looking real good

That Grey Goose got your girl feeling loose
Now I'm wishing that I didn't wear these shoes (I hate heels)
It's like every time I get up on the dude
Paparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like, get up out my face
Before I turn around and spray your ass with mace
My lips make you wanna have a taste
You got that, I got the bass

How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like

Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do
Me like a bullet type, you know they coming right
Fergie like 'em long time, my girls support 'em, right?
Aah, da, da, da, da, do, do, do, do
Me like a bullet type, you know they coming right
Fergie like 'em long time, my girls support 'em, right?

Another A-T-L
Cali callabo
Fergie and Polow

When I come to the club, step aside (oh shit)
Part the seas, don't be having me in the line (oh shit)
VIP, 'cause you know I gotta shine (oh shit)
I'm Fergie Ferg, and me love you long time (oh shit)

All my girls get down on the floor (oh shit)
Back to back, drop it down real low (oh shit)
I'm such a lady, but I'm dancing like a ho (oh shit)
'Cause you know I don't give a fuck, so here we go (oh shit)

How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like
How come every time you come around
My London, London Bridge wanna go down, like
London, London, London
Wanna go down like
London, London, London
Be going down like

(Fuck you, bitches!)
