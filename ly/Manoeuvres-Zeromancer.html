		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tailing you back home
It sure is gonna be late now
Somethings dying inside while I try to deny
It doesn't seem to bother you
That I am here watching take it easy

Raise your glass to pain and suffering
Let's make a toast to how much I hurt you
Let's drink to that and all sadness

To illustrate my point
Sitting in the bedroom
Waiting for me to let you down
In the temple of furs to explicate my point
It doesn't seem to bother you
That I'm still watching
I find it easy to taint your innocence

Raise your glass to pain and suffering
Let's make a toast to how much I hurt you
Let's drink to that and all sadness

Raise your glass to pain
Raise your glass to pain

Raise your glass to pain and suffering
Let's make a toast to how much I hurt you
Let's drink to that and all sadness
