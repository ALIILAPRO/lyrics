		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to hurt you
No reason have I but fear
And I ain't guilty
Of the crimes you accuse me of
But I'm guilty of fear
I'm sorry to remind
You but I'm scared of what we're creating
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Mmmm gotta try a little harder

It could be sweet
Like a long forgotten dream
And we don't need them
To cast the fate we have
Love don't always shine through
'Cause I don't want to lose
What we had last time your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn now
Mmmm gotta try a little harder

It could be sweet

But the thoughts we try to deny
Take a toll upon our lives
We struggle on in depths of pride
Tangled up in single minds
'Cause I don't want to lose
What we had last time your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Mmmm gotta try a little harder
'Cause I don't want to lose
What we had last time your leaving
This life ain't fair
You don't get something for nothing, turn back
Mmmm gotta try a little harder
It could be sweet
