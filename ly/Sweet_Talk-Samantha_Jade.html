		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh baby when you're next to me
I feel like I'm in ecstasy
(Uuh-uh)
Oh baby when you look my way
I hear the things you want to say
(Uh-huh)

And when your body moves close to mine
I get the rush I can't describe
When you get my heart beating like
(Oh baby, oh baby)
You should how to read my mind
Telling you it's about that time
And nothing could be better

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Filling me with love
What's love without your sweet talk?
Keep me going, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it

No need a fan to fly
Your sugar always gets me so high
(Uuh-uh)
Hotter than a fantasy
I'm living out in my wildest dreams
(Yeah, yeah)

When your fingers touch my neck
I start to lose my breath
And when you kiss me just like that
(Oh baby, my baby)
'Cause you know how to read my mind
Telling you it's about that time
And nothing could be better

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Filling me with love
What's love without your sweet talk?
Keep me going, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it

Ye-ye-yeah-ee-eah
Sweet, ye yeah
Talk to me, talk to me
Talk to me
Ooh-aah

I want your sweet talk
Talking to me all night
Filling me with love
What's love without your sweet talk?
Keep me going, don't stop
Till we turn the lights back on
Baby, I want you to
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
Sweet talk to me
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it

Sweet talk to me (talk to me)
Sweet talk to me (talk to me)
Sweet talk to me (yeah, yeah)
The sweetness on your lips
I need a taste of it
