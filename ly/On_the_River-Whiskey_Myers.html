		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  OL' JEBADIAH DON'T YOU LET ME DOWN
YOU PROMISED ME A PLACE FROM HERE MUCH BETTER 
THERE'S AFTERMATH TO THEM TIES AND TRACKS,
YEAH YOU'RE A RAIL DOG
BUT WOULD YOU GIVE IT ALL UP FOR ME
YOU SAID YOU'D SAVE A DIME A DAY AND BUILD A LOG CABIN 
DOWN THERE BY THE RIVER
WHERE WE CAN RAISE THE KIDS THE BEST THERE IS,
NOT WORRY BOUT AN ARROWHEAD AND QUIVER
					
CHORUS
YEAH THIS PLACE AIN'T SAVING GRACE
YOU CAN'T BUY MORE PEACE THAN IT PAYS
THERE'S WAR PAINT, MORE BLOOD THAN THERE AIN'T 
AND THERE'S SMOKE DOWN THERE ON THE RIVER.
					
OL' JEBADIAH GAVE IT TWO MORE YEARS
AND HE LANDED A JOB WITH THE MAN SELLIN' OFF LAND PLOTS 
HE BURIED AWAY THE GOLD HE MADE AND HE SAVED ENOUGH 
TO BUILD THAT HOME FOR MARY
ANOTHER DIME A DAY KEPT THE WOLVES AWAY
HE MADE A DEAL WITH THE TRIBE
AND HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD KEEP IT
IT ALL CAME DOWN TO THE PLAN HE MADE,
YEAH THERE'S A FIERY GRAVE FOR THE BEARDLESS ONES
WHO NEED IT.
