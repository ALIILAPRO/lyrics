		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I stay with you, if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now, but I'm winning late
That's all I want

Now we need some space, 'cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone, it seems so short
I can't explain

Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on

I will be so strong, looking for a new version of myself
Cause now all I want is to be a part of my new world

Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Why not have it all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
