		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still feel you crawling under my skin
You left a certain kind of sick that I can't let go of
I'm thinking back on all the time that I've wasted
I'm afraid that it's only leading to darker places

The curse you left, it ends tonight
Even if I have to tear out my insides
Never again will this heart be your home
I'll be happy as someone else

Today, I found my open door
I set my sights on something more
I live for something more

Another day spent waiting on a sign
For anything to tell me I'm doing something right
Somewhere, there's a love that I long for
But I can't see through the smoke in my window

Leaving you behind left me aimless
Staring in the mirror and I feel like I'm faceless
The only thing I know is that I'd rather die
Than live in a world where you still control my life

The curse you left, it ends tonight
Even if I have to tear out my insides
Never again will this heart be your home
I'll be happy as someone else

Today, I found my open door
I set my sights on something more
I'm done reliving the pain you dealt me
I'm sick of trying to take back time
Today, I live for something more

At both ends, burnt once more
But now I live for something more
Live for something more
Live for something more

Today, I found my own embrace
I'll never regret who I am today

Today, I found my open door
I set my sights
I set my sights on something more
Today, I found my open door
I set my sights on something more

I'm done reliving the pain you dealt me
I'm sick of trying to take back time
Today, I live for something more
