		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do, 'cause I'm gonna get you
No where to run no where to hide
All the things you've said and the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry

Look what you've done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (gangster)
Look at what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (i'm the blue gangsta)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(i could never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
Now I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

You've tricked me nine to five, left and you said a crime
People telling me, you've got another guy
I've been abused, watch me light in fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies

Don't know what I've done, everything you've got
Things you've done to me, are coming back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you've done to me
I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (i'm the blue gangsta)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do (what you're gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine (what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (look what you've done girl)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
(I can never fall in love)
The blue gangsta

See, I am so amused to the things you've said
And the things you have done to me
There is nothing in this world make me change
You make me wanna sing

The blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta (blue gangsta)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (look what you've put me through, baby!)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
(I never thought I fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do (what you're gonna do)
You ain't no friend of mine (what you're gonna do)
Look what you've put me through (look what you've put me through, girl)
Now that I'm the blue gangsta

What you're gonna do (oh no)
You ain't no friend of mine
(I never wanna fall in love)
The blue gangsta

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (you ain't no friend of mine)
Look what you've put me through
Now that I'm the blue gangsta (you ain't no friend of mine)

What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine (oh no)
(I never thought I fall in love)
The blue gangsta
