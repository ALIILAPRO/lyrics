		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm winning, you're losing
I'm falling, your agony 
Lower than lower, before 
Your forgotten memory 

My heaven, your hell 
I'm killing, your fantasy 
More and more, you follow
Your divorced reality 

You're trying to take me 
You're trying to make me 
This is the only 
Give me the only thing 

I'm tired of trying 
I'm tired of lying 
The only thing I understand is what I feel 

Identity, fantasy 
Heresy, killing me 
Lower than lower, before 
This thing to feed 

Hypocrite, lunatic 
Fanatic, heretic 
More and more, you follow
Your divorced reality 

You're trying to take me 
You're trying to make me 
This is the only 
Give me the only thing 

I'm tired of trying  
I'm tired of lying 
The only thing I understand is what I feel 

Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic
