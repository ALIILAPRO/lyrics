		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, your love is worse
Worse than cigarettes
Even if I had twenty in my hands
Oh, babe, your touch, it hurts
More than hangovers
No, that bottle don't hold the same regret

And my mother says that you're bad for me
Guess she never felt the high we're on right now
And my father says I should run away
But he don't know that I just don't know how

Well, if it's unhealthy then I don't give a damn
'Cause even if it kills me, I'll always take your hand
It's unhealthy, they just don't understand
And when they try to stop me, just know nobody can
You're still gon' be my man

Ayy, ayy, ayy
Still gon' be my man
Ayy, ayy, ayy

Oh, this body high
Gives me sleepless nights
It's a million times what any drug could give
And my red eyes
They go twice as wide
It might look like pain but to me it's bliss

All my friends, they say that you're bad for me
Guess they never felt the high we're on right now
And my sister says I should run away
But she don't know that I just don't know how

Well, if it's unhealthy then I don't give a damn
'Cause even if it kills me, I'll always take your hand
It's unhealthy, they just don't understand
And when they try to stop me, just know nobody can
You're still gon' be my man

Ayy, ayy, ayy
Still gon' be my man (still gon')
Ayy, ayy, ayy (still gon' be my man)
You're still gon' be my man

Ayy, ayy, ayy (you still gon' be my, still gon' be my, be my man)
Still gon' be my man 
Ayy, ayy, ayy (you still gon' be my, still gon' be my, be my man)
Still gon' be my man
