		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Havok, baby
50cal mixed it
Swear that's Ekayy?

Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (free him)
'Round here, we don't do no talking, if you're a talker, get slapped with a burner (And again)
Sweetie, show me, I know you're a well known twerker
I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse, let me rrr, rrr, rrr
Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (Free him)
'Round here, we don't do no talking, if you're a talker, get slapped with a burner (And again)
Sweetie, show me, I know you're a well known twerker
I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse, let me rrr, rrr, rrr

Shake that arse, let me lean and go
I'm in the back of the ride with bro
Oldschool, try smoke man's dome in pole, this finna jammed in Tulse
Why? Becah' I wanted a big man roast (normal)
Man can't talk on my bros when corn get let bro, man get brucked like Lego, 4.4 focus still had an echo (Always)
What do you mean by "Black Lives Matter?"
If Black Lives Matter, why black man still out here still roll with his hammer?
I had a star 9, same time had a dagger
I had the chop 'round when shh got mashed up
I had to train aim when bro's in a slammer
Mazza, creep up close with a cracker (pow)

Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (free him)
'Round here, we don't do no talking, if you're a talker, get slapped with a burner (And again)
Sweetie, show me, I know you're a well known twerker
I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse, let me rrr, rrr, rrr
Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (free him)
'Round here, we don't do no talking, if you're a talker, get slapped with a burner (And again)
Sweetie, show me, I know you're a well known twerker
I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse, let me rrr, rrr, rrr

I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse
Ay shawty, fling that back
I'm in the T house chasing cash, never trust no cat, get a key for the gaff
You know who is it? The gaff get boomed
Big man know how to bang (Best bang)
Best know how to bang, best know how to bang
If you ever get bagged, that's years in the can
And if you get years in a can, that's sad (Sad)
Bruce went aim for a mad ting
Was it a shooting? Was it a stabbing?
Practice makes perfect, don't ask why my niggas are out with a hand ting
Just know that the last time bro-bro pull up and crash it, beat like Jackson
Now, he's gone missing like Madeleine (missin')

Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (free him)
'Round here, we don't do no talking, if you're a talker, get slapped with a burner (And again)
Sweetie, show me, I know you're a well known twerker
I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse, let me rrr, rrr, rrr
Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (free him)
'Round here, we don't do no talking, if you're a talker, get slapped with a burner (And again)
Sweetie, show me, I know you're a well known twerker
I know you're a well known twerker, shake that arse, let me rrr, rrr, rrr

Practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice
Practice, practice, practice, practice, practice, practice
Practice makes perfect, free R1, swang that blade, got birded (fuck off)
