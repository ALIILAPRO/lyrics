		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where have all the good men gone and where are all the gods?
Where's the streetwise Hercules to fight the rising odds?
Isn't there the right knight upon a fiery steed?
Late at night I toss and I turn, and I dream of what I need

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
Larger than life

Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
Somewhere just beyond my reach, there's someone reaching back for me
Racing on the thunder and rising with the heat
It's gonna take a Superman to sweep me off my feet

Yeah, I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
He's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
Larger than life

Up where the mountains meet the heavens above, yeah
Out where the lightning splits the sea
I could swear there is someone somewhere watching me
Through the wind and the chill and the rain, yeah
And the storm and the flood
I can feel his approach like a fire in my blood

I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
And he's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
He's gotta be strong, and he's gotta be fast
And he's got to be fresh from the fight
I need a hero
I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light (yeah)
He's gotta be sure, and he's gotta be soon
And he's got to be larger than life
Larger than life
