		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?
Yeah, I'm from the middle finger
I'm from the Eastside, five, Zone 6
East Atlanta, EA
Brick city, yeah
Licks, all that shit
Sticks, all that shit
Hoes, set a nigga up, all that shit
Yeah, all that shit
In the club, beat a nigga ass, take a nigga chain, all that shit
Come at your crib, all that shit

I'm from the five, middle finger, Zone 6
Dirty land, dirty sticks
Bad bitches gettin' hit
Put a nigga on a lick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Rob a nigga for his shit
Young nigga fall off, turn into a snitch
Never turn into a bitch
Gotta keep it cool, homie, rob his ass quick
Never fallin' off, do a nigga bad rob him for his stash (do that)
Nigga talkin' like he a real gangster, put that stick on his ass (yeah, shoot that)
Gotta keep that shit 100 with you, never switch on your mans (yeah, 100)
Go and get some money, gotta get some money, never hold your hand

I'm the type of motherfucker nigga never had my hand out (never nigga)
Stupid motherfucker, in my pocket nigga, know I got my cash hangin' out (50s, 100s)
Big 30 on that motherfucker, long ways know that bitch hangin' out (30s)
Bad bitch, late night, with the Slimeball know she like to hang out
Middle finger with the 5, Zone 6, bitch, that's where I hang out (EA)
Apartments, late night, where a motherfucker like to do them shootouts (slime)
You ain't 'bout what you talkin' 'bout, you can't hang out (hang out)
Please don't try to jump off the porch, you too old now
Lame-ass nigga (lame-ass nigga)
Wannabe street nigga (damn)
Sweet-ass nigga (sweet-ass nigga)
Put on the plate, eat, nigga (eat up)
You ain't 'bout it, nigga (you ain't 'bout it, nigga)
I been in the street (streets)
(For how long, slime?)
Since I was like 13, nigga

I'm from the five, middle finger, Zone 6
Dirty land, dirty sticks
Bad bitches gettin' hit
Put a nigga on a lick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Rob a nigga for his shit
Young nigga fall off, turn into a snitch
Never turn into a bitch
Gotta keep it cool, homie, rob his ass quick
Never fallin' off, do a nigga bad, rob him for his stash (do that)
Nigga talkin' like he a real gangster, put that stick on his ass (yeah, shoot that)
Gotta keep that shit 100 with you, never switch on your mans (yeah, 100)
Go and get some money, gotta get some money, never hold your hand

Middle finger with the five (6)
Tinted windows when we slide (sticks)
Glock 40, Draco, know I'm ridin' round', nigga, with the slime (slime)
Shoot a nigga in his spine (spine)
Niggas snitch to cut time (21)
We the Fox 5 gang, niggas gettin' whacked snitchin' on mine (facts)
Back it up, back it up
.223 gon' make a nigga back it up (21)
Tryna strip a nigga, gotta change my outfit, nigga
It ain't black enough (you dig)
Bouldercrest Road, Glenwood Road
Name a hood out-whackin' us (6)
Niggas runnin' to their plug cryin'
Sayin', "Slaughter Gang keep taxing us" (pussy)
I get them racks and then I stack it up (21)
This is not a Scat Pack, this a Hellcat and it's on angel dust
Nigga, breaking news gang
Fuck nigga, we dangerous (you dig)
I get inside that pussy, beat her back out
Yeah, you know a nigga strangle her (I did)
That fake-ass jewelry tangled up (21)

I'm from the five, middle finger, Zone 6
Dirty land, dirty sticks
Bad bitches gettin' hit
Put a nigga on a lick
Rob a nigga for a brick
Rob a nigga for his shit
Young nigga fall off, turn into a snitch
Never turn into a bitch
Gotta keep it cool, homie, rob his ass quick
Never fallin' off, do a nigga bad, rob him for his stash (do that)
Nigga talkin' like he a real gangster, put that stick on his ass (yeah, shoot that)
Gotta keep that shit 100 with you, never switch on your mans (yeah, 100)
Go and get some money, gotta get some money, never hold your hand
