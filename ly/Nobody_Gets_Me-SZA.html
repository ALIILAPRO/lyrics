		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a long vacation, no makeup, just Jay-Z
You were balls deep, now we beefing
Had me butt-naked at the MGM
So wasted, screaming, "Fuck that"
Blurry now, but I meant it then
Hurry now, baby, stick it in
'Fore the memories get to kicking in
It's too late, I don't wanna lose

What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do
You do
Nobody gets me, you do

Took me out to the ballet
You proposed, I went on the road
You was feeling empty, so you left me
Now I'm stuck dealing with a deadbeat
If I'm real, I deserve less
If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
I pretend when I'm with a man it's you
And I know that it's too late, I don't wanna lose

What's left of you
How am I supposed to tell you
I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
Nobody gets me like you
How am I supposed to let you go?
Only like myself when I'm with you
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
You do
Nobody gets me, you do (do)
Nobody gets me, you do
