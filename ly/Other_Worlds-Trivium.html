		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
No other
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
No other

Is there hope
To break through
All the walls
Built around you?

You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Dim the world
A glassy stare
Face to face now
Do you even care to try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Broken mast
Shipwrecked mind
Future sinks
By design

You're like a song within a nightmare
A thought within a scream

Lost our minds
Lost our way
Face to face now
Do you even care to try to understand
Where we went wrong
Or how it seems

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real
Someone wake me from this nightmare
I can't even tell what's real

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds

We're dreaming in color
But we're living in other worlds
We've lost our way in the other worlds

We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
We're dreaming in color
Believing no other
'Cause we're living in other worlds
Breathing in other worlds
