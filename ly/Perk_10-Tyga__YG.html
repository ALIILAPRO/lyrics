I got a Perc-10 on me right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Bitch, I'm vibin', you can see it 'cause I bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down
I'm feelin' like the man, nigga, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Up the score, I'll take a nigga, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down

I got a hundred bands on me right now
Four in the mornin', suckin' dick, she a night owl
Keep talkin', we gon' see what that hype 'bout
Came in the game a lil' nigga, I got hype now
Skin itchin' off fetty, you see the bite down
One day with me, I'm who she like now
Me and T-Raw runnin' this shit, it's a light mile
I just popped another Perc-10 right now
Y'all niggas know the type of time I'm on
Don't come playin' with me, take your ass to Sky Zone
Y'all bitches know the type of vibe I'm on
Don't come layin' with me, tryna keep them thighs closed
Might crash, think I'm drivin' with my eyes closed
I do drugs 'cause it get me through my highs, lows
Demon time, in a whole 'nother time zone
Sick in the head, that's what I'm told

I got a Perc-10 on me right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Bitch, I'm vibin', you can see it 'cause I bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down
I'm feelin' like the man, nigga, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Up the score, I'll take a nigga, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down

Ayy, hand me the Oxy' right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Yeah, and I'm high on a Cloud couch, nigga, I can't come down, come down, come down, come down
And I stunt like Evel Knievel (Evel Knievel)
Got your bitch doin' shit that's illegal (shit that's illegal)
I'm the man in my city, tell that lil' bitch pipe down, pipe down, pipe down, pipe down
Gon' take another dose of this dope (dope)
Got your bitch floatin' on it like a boat (boat)
Bitches all on me like a coat (coat)
Niggas wanna go to war, we ain't tuggin' rope
One eye open (open), Interscope
I'm holdin' the money (the money) in a choke
All this cheese (all this cheese), artichoke
That's green, motherfucker (ha)

I got a Perc-10 on me right now, right now, right now, right now, right now (yeah)
Bitch, I'm vibin', you can see it 'cause I bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down, bite down
I'm feelin' like the man, nigga, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now
Up the score, I'll take a nigga, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down, wipe down
