		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Death is coming, carried on his crooked wings
I can't do anything
Death is coming, carried on his crooked wings
I can't do anything

Hold onto what you've got
Put a lock on the door, double the knot

Love is coming, coming for to carry me
I don't know anything
Love is coming, coming for to carry me
I don't know anything

Send the rain, send my love
Send my love to everyone
Send the rain, send my love
Send my love to everyone

Ooh, aah ooh, hey

Send the rain, send my love
Send my love to everyone
Send the rain, send my love
Send my love to everyone
Send the rain, send my love
Send my love to everyone
Send the rain, send my love
Send my love to everyone

To everyone to everyone
