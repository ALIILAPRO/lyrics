		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dream
I am a traveller of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk in song from tongues of lilting grace
Sounds caress my ear
And not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh, oh baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh yeah I've been flying
Ma-mama, ain't no denying, no denying

All I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Heed the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
Like Shangri-la beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay, yeah

Oh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Oh, yeah-yeah, oh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Oh, my baby, oh, my baby, let me take you there
Come on, come on, oh, let me take you there, let me take you there
