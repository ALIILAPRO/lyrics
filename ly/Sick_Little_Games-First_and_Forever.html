		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A little used, a little blush 
A little frayed at the edge 
Cut through, hit the rush 
Let it flow to your head 
I think I remember clearly now 
Don’t slip, it’s a long way down 
 
And I swear I never meant to go out 
Out this way 
 
Someone call a doctor, I don’t think I’m okay 
Put your venom in my veins and take my pain away 
Let down with nothing to say 
Keep me coming back just to play your sick little games 
 
Love the fall, love the lie 
Love that look in your eyes 
First we crawl, then we die 
Just a matter of time 
Are you afraid of what you know 
Don’t cry it keeps you cold 
 
And I swear I never meant to go down 
Down this way 
 
Someone call a doctor, I don’t think I’m okay 
Put your venom in my veins and take my pain away 
Let down with nothing to say 
Keep me coming back just to play your sick little games
