		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where have you gone?
Walk in circles back to square one
Made it through yesterday
Spillin' wine, thinkin' of the time
Wrote you a melody
Rollin' your eyes, held your hand a while
Need not say anything to me
Hear you loud and clear
Loud and clear

I'll take care of everything from now on

Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?

Wait for the sun
Say hello, maybe it will come
You watched the hummingbirds
Naming every one
Do you have a minute for me?
If you don't mind, I'll be stopping by
Count all the little black clouds
Don't you worry, please don't worry

I'll take care of everything from now on

Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me, who will show me how?

I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything from now on

Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me, who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me how?
Where are you now?
Who will show me, who will show me how?

I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
I'll take care of everything
