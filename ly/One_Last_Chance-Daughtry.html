		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you need and I will find a way to stop the bleeding;
No, don't add to my mistakes.
Tell me you're not leaving
and I'll tell you everything you need to know.
Don't throw it all away, don't say my words are just too late.

I don't want to be left behind,
I've been so blind to all that I have broken.
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they don't exist; just me out in the open.
I know this will take time,
can you give me one last chance to make it right?

You say the story's ending but I think it's time we stop pretending;
No, can't let you turn the page.
Does your heart remember when we used to say forever, don't let go.
Don't throw it all away; don't say these words are just too late.

I don't want to be left behind,
I've been so blind to all that I have broken.
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they don't exist; just me out in the open.
I know this will take time, can we put the past behind us,
Tonight I'm gonna fight for you;
just give me one last chance to make it right,
Last chance to make it right.

I don't want to be left behind,
I've been so blind to all that I have broken.
Can we put this back together?
No more empty promises, they don't exist; just me out in the open.
I know this will take time,
can you give me one last chance to make it right?

Give me one last chance to make it right,
A last chance to make it right
A last chance to make it right
No more empty promises, they don't exist; just me out in the open.
I know this will take time,
can you give me one last chance to make it right?
