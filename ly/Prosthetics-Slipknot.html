		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even if you run, I will find you
I decided I wanted you
Now I know, I need
If you can't be bought tougher than I thought
Keep in mind I am with you
Never left out fate can't concentrate even i you

You will be mine!
Ah fucking you will be mine!
Ah fucking you will be mine!
Ah fucking you will be mine!

I found you

Leanin' out of an open window
You laughed (my fingers clenched)
Too perfect far too careless
I couldn't help myself I just took you

Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake

Better make yourself out home
You're here to stay
You won't bother me
If you let me bother you
All the doors are locked, all the windows shut
Keep in mind, I watch you
Never leave my side, never leave me, fucker
Even if you run

What the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
Man, I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' this
What the fuck is different?
I can't believe I'm doin' this

Man I knew it was a mistake
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
Dammit man I knew it was a mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake
(You brought it outta me) mistake
(You brought it outta me)
