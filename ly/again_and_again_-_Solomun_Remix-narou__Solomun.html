		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is flying by 
What a beautiful ride 
This Feels like another life I like all the things you like 

Tell me now I wanna know Are we going too fast ?
I don't mind it at all 
I'll be myself 
It's easy with you 
We do our best 
Fuck what anyone says 

Girl 
I would do it 
all again 
You driving me crazy 
Am I letting you in 
Ill Make sure that we got this 
Cause I love how it's been 
Got all my attention 
Again and again 
Girl 
I would Do it 
all again 
You driving me crazy 
And I am letting you in 
I am sure that we got this
Cause I love how it's been 
Got all my attention 
Again and again 

I like to look in your eyes 
Cause they always make me feel so alive 
Around you I feel safe every night 
I let you know 
That we on to something special 

I'll be myself 
It's easy with you 
We do our best 
Fuck what anyone says 

Girl 
I would Do it 
all again 
You driving me crazy 
Am I letting you in 
Ill Make sure that we got this 
Cause I love how it's been 
Got all my attention 
Again and again

Girl 
I would Do it 
all again 
You driving me crazy 
And I am letting you in 
I am sure that we got this 
Cause I love how it's been 
Got all my attention 
Again and again 

Girl 
I would Do it 
all again 
You driving me crazy 
And I am letting you in 
I am sure that we got this 
Cause I love how it's been 
Got all my attention 
Again and again 

No 
Well you know what baby 
Cause Love comes first 
No 
Open your eyes baby 
Cause love comes first
