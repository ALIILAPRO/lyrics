		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me home
I'm scared to leave again
Losing touch
We could be anything,
And we still can.
Take my hand, take mine, take my hand
We've been losing touch
We could reach the sun again
Take my hand, take mine, take my hand
We've been losing touch
We could reach the sun again
Shadows falling, I'm dreaming
At the bottom of an ocean long gone dry
Is it ending? I feel so empty
Without the song I'd sing with you
Will you find me? Will you fight if I ask you to?
Take my hand, take mine, take my hand
We've been losing touch
We could reach the sun again
Take my hand, take mine, take my hand
We've been losing touch
We could reach the sun again
