		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see your smile
Tears run down my face
I can't replace
And now that I'm strong I have figured out
How this world turns cold
And it breaks through my soul and I know
I'll find deep inside me
I can be the one

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven

It's okay
It's okay
It's okay

Seasons are changing and waves are crashing and
Stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the one

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
'Cause you're my
You're my, my
My true love
My whole heart
Please don't throw that away
'Cause I'm here for you
Please don't walk away and
Please tell me you'll stay, yeah
Whoa
Stay, whoa, whoa
Use me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be okay
Though my skies are turning grey (grey)

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven

I will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you send me to heaven
