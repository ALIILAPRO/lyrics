		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sleep in, sleep until it's all okay
Tell me, tell me how the system's changed
I see, I see you've come a long long way
Tell me, I'm only just a call away

I'm okay
I feel safe
I might stay
'Cause I'm okay

Get in, get under my skin, get in
I just want to itch
My face clicks, with every little glitch
It clicks again, and then sticks

Tie up, tie up the dog and come on in
Get out of that dreaded wind, come in
This is it, there is no other moment better than this
Promise

I'm okay
I feel safe
I might stay
'Cause I'm okay
I'm okay

Liquid, your words are liquid, that never spills
Your cup is overfilled
Shoot it, shoot the front cover
Make a kill, have no mercy or goodwill

Play with, play with my body
You're the puppeteer, you win
Sinking, sinking down faster than you think
I wish I learned to swim

I'm okay
I feel safe
I might stay
'Cause I'm okay
I'm okay
I feel safe
I might stay
'Cause I'm okay
I'm okay
