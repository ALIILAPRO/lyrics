		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I don't understand you
Same road, just different direction
Same note, but different vibration
I've gotta admit, you're not all it seems
You've got planets in your eyes
Guess it's not my thing
But you make it look alright

(Sometimes I don't understand you)

And I know that we've been so tired lately
Want a change
And like those movies from the old days
You've been making us watch
Well, it's a foreign language to me, baby
But I love hearing you talk

I'm intoxicated by you
Day drunk, hit the double feature
A "life sucks then you die" t-shirt
And a stolen kiss
That's not all you need
I've seen the look in your eye
L'Avventura dream (L'Avventura dream)
I hear it call you in the night

(Sometimes I don't understand you)

And I know that we've been so tired lately
Want a change
And like those movies from the old days
You've been making us watch
Well, it's a foreign language to me, baby
But I love hearing you talk

And I know that we've been so tired lately
Want a change
And like those movies from the old days
You've been making us watch
Well, it's a foreign language to me, baby
But I love hearing you talk

And I know that we've been so tired lately
And I know that you've been looking for a new way to, to make the world stop
Well, it's a foreign language to me, baby
But I love hearing you talk

It's a foreign language to me, baby
But I love hearing you talk
