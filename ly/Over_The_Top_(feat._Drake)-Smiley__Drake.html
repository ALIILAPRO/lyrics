		  (Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)

Prada and Gucci don't go together
Louis and Dior, I swear it go better
He wear my drip, but I wore it better
Kilani gang, I swear it go wetter
Huh? Gang
On go mode, I should get a chain for the promo (ayy)
Gang, gang, gang

The level is just too advanced
The bezel is Tiffany stamped, don't grip on my hand
I know that I came with the slide from left to right
But now I don't wanna dance
I got too much on the line, too much on my mind
Too much ain't enough for my plans
Nike don't pay me to tell you, "Just do it"
They pay me to show you I do it again

Huh? Yeah
I'm in control of the block (live)
You know how October get hot (you know)
Might make this glizzy go pop (bang)
The crib is over the top (it is)
The whip is over the top (how?)
I thought about letting her go (I did)
But I was in over the top

I can't be pale in my casket
Make sure I die with a tan, it's part of the brand
I know I came with the slide from left to right
But now I don't wanna dance
Cannot depend on a man
I slide her some bread in a jam, that's just who I am
Customs just wavin' at us from the window
They don't even come on the plane when we land
Anyone else would retire, but I'm not content
I wanna bury these niggas like twenty feet down
So no one can find them again
It's gotta be scary to witness me carry these niggas around
In both of my hands
They stay inviting me over, they say they got bitches
I get there and then it's just them

Got a verse from the boy and it leaked (fuck)
He sent me a new one said, "Use it instead" (use it)
Everything good when you live in the Hills
Got a chef and and maid for a bed (wow)
Can you imagine the shit that I seen?
I went from the Roy to South Point dreams
Then bridge got burned and shattered (fuck)
I'm climbing, I don't need a ladder
New year, it's a new chapter (new)
Girl snapped, I didn't even snap her (I didn't)
She wanna fuck out of anger (she wack)
Back in the days, life was so hard 
In Pelham trapping in backyards
I didn't even know 'bout Goyard (I didn't)
I just sent Mike a new bank card (here you go)
Remembering days in the court yard
I came from trapping at Nats (at Natalie's)
Trapping with bugs in the trap (ew)
She wanna spill all the facts (you do that)
Yeah, yeah
I can't sit on my ass (I can't)
I gotta chase me a bag
My shooters think it's tag (brra)
She wanna buy me a Jag
BM text me, throw ten at her like Messi (here you go, babe)
Take the Draco piece, it get messy (yeah)
Told Kilani I want grills like Nelly's (uh-huh)
I was locked, no one answered cellies (no one)
No one change up my line so I sell these (that's gang)
This TEC-9 hold many
Lucky told me don't trust many, gang

The level is just too advanced
The bezel is Tiffany stamped, don't grip on my hand
I know that I came with the slide from left to right
But now I don't wanna dance
I got too much on the line, too much on my mind
Too much ain't enough for my plans
Nike don't pay me to tell you, "Just do it"
They pay me to show you I do it again

Huh? Yeah
I'm in control of the block (live)
You know how October get hot (you know)
Might make this glizzy go pop (bang)
The crib is over the top (it is)
The whip is over the top (how?)
I thought about letting her go (I did)
But I was in over the top
