		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a game I wanna show you

If I tell you my name, you'll have to play too

I've been here for years, biding my time

Waiting and primed until I could find you

Just sign on a line and we can be friends

I'll be here for you until your world ends

Enjoy all your toys, I will supply

You only live once and you'll be mine the

Day you die, I'll have my payment

Your eternal soul's enslavement

Did you divine our dark arrangement?

You were lovely entertainment

The dark desires you've been serving

You can bet that you're deserving

No regret for who you're hurting

Why, it's almost like you're flirting

Come into my world, take a look at me

I am the nightmare on the dark side of the moon

I'm your first last resort so call me

When you need a helping hand

Play your cards wrong and I'll see you soon

Sorry, I don't mean to alarm you

If you ask me to stay, I would be charmed to

You all have such cozy little lives

How do you survive like that, I wish I knew

But you've got a lovely little secret

You're tired of feeling awful small, SO YOU

Give Mr. Alastor a call to make a deal

Because you're hungry

For the sights, you wanna see them,

Earthly delights, you feel you need them

Your appetites, I'll help you feed them

I'll be your sweet radio demon

And once your hunger has abated

Don't forget your friend who waited

Watched as you endulged your thirst and

Did I mention that you're cursed?

Come into my world, take a look at me

I am the nightmare on the dark side of the moon

I'm your first last resort

So call me when you need a helping hand

Play your cards wrong and I'll see you soon

You lay your chips out on the table now

When you gamble souls, the house will always win

I'm double dealing in betrayal

And I'm here to catch my payout

I hope it was worth the life of sin

Welcome to my world, take a look around

Inside your nightmare, deep beyond the mortal veil

You made a wrong turn at the crossroads

Now you're at the final episode, eternity with me in hell

Pleasure to play, how I enjoyed you

Suffice to say when I play, I don't lose

Collect on the debts that you accrued

It was such a gas, I really am amused

Have a dark thought, I'm right beside you

A casual whisper just to guide you

Look over your shoulder and I'm gone

Remember this song and I bid you adieu
