		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, you're bad for me, like drugs in my veins
You bring me up just to fall in deeper
Drifting into your voids
Stuck down you're making noise
You took the air that I breathe

Feeling so good, till you tear through my heart
Can't cover the scars anymore, baby
There's blood in the sky, the birds couldn't fly
And I'm losing my mind

You run through me like bad drugs, yeah
Tearing me to pieces, preying on my weakness
You're like bad drugs, yeah
You go to my head, but fuck me up instead

Run through me like bad drugs
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You run through me like bad drugs
Oh, yeah
Run through me like, like bad drugs
Like bad drugs
Run through me like bad, bad drugs, oh oh
You run through me like bad drugs

Girl, your anatomy is pulling me closer
Medusa's my enemy, yeah
Turnin' me into stone
I look at you and I'm gone
Feel like I'm startin' to freeze

Feeling so good, till you tear through my heart
Can't cover the scars anymore, baby
There's blood in the sky, the birds couldn't fly
And I'm losing my mind

Running through me like bad drugs, yeah
Tearing me to pieces, preying on my weakness
You're like bad drugs, yeah
You go to my head, but fuck me up instead

Run through me like bad drugs
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You run through me like bad drugs, yeah
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
You run through me like bad, bad drugs
Run through me like bad, bad drugs, oh, oh
You run through me like bad drugs
