		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew you were gonna hit up my line
It was only just a matter of time
Was it a case of out of sight out of mind?
Cause something 'bout you just ain't right
You told me that me you were gonna see me later
Maybe you were tryna keep me sweet
Had me clutching on my pillow
And checking out the window
But what you want with me?
Where did you come from baby?
And why'd you keep bringing me down
And If you don't want me baby
Then why would you keep me around
Boy I don't want no drama
I got to move on in life
I won't let you cause me trauma
You just want to waste my time
Haven't seen you in a minute
You probably wanna wrap me innit
Got me in deep I just wanna hold you tell you all my feelings
Been cleaning my room for hours
You better come through with flowers
Your love is bliss but I know
If you don't really care about it and
This ain't what you wanted
Then I gotta throw in the towel
But don't you treat me like a child
And tell me all these lies
I'm begging you
Don't be cruel
Just say that we're through
Where did you come from baby?
And why'd you keep bringing me down
And If you don't want me baby
Then why would you keep me around
Boy I don't want no drama
I got to move on in life
I won't let you cause me trauma
You just want to waste my time
Where did you come from baby?
And why'd you keep bringing me down
And If you don't want me baby
Then why would you keep me around
Boy I don't want no drama
I got to move on in life
I won't let you cause me trauma
You just want to waste my time
