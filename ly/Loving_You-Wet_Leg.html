		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had it all
We had it all
We had it all planned out
You said that I was everything you ever wanted 
There's no doubt
I used to wanna love you like you wanted me to
Now I wanna hate you like I tell you I do
Sorry if I seem a little bit upset
When you say she looks a little bit like me when we first met

(La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la)

I don't wanna have to be friends
I don't wanna have to pretend
I don't wanna meet your girlfriend
Hope you choke on your girlfriend

Don't call me up, you fucked it up
I'm not your friend, I'm not your pal
You're fucking wishing that I was though 
Every time you see me out
You say you think about me in the midnight hour
I know that you're just rubbing one out up in the shower, honey
Sorry if I seem a little bit upset
When you tried calling me crazy 'cause I'm not DTF

(La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la)

I don't wanna have to be friends
I don't wanna have to pretend
Well I hope you're very happy
Hope she gets on with your daddy

After all 
I don't wanna have to be someone you want to marry
Fucking hell, yeah, that's a life of mis'
I don't wanna have to be the one to say I'm sorry 
'Cause I'm not, that's fucking faking it
Am I scaring you?
Well, what's a girl to do?

(La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la)

I don't wanna have to stay friends
I don't wanna have to pretend
I don't wanna meet your girlfriend
Hope you're choking on your girlfriend
When she calls 9-9-9, they cut the line on you
