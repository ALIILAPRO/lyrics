		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear it's true
The last thing I expected was to fall for you
What were we to do?
Just two imperfect pieces pullin' at the glue
Sometimes it's hard to remember
What we liked about this place
And I, I, I really don't want to think
It's the reason I stay

I've waited so long for someone like you to come along
Oh, what I would give, give for one kiss on your open mouth
Green, your eyes are so green
So emerald green, Siena dream
So I'll hold it all down
I hang around 'til you come around, you come around

Our love was smoke
You were swimmin' in my mind before you told me so
How was I to know?
It is time to get unwind and I'd be yours alone
Sometimes when we lied together
I could die and make my peace
'Cause I, I, I'll love you forever, you know
And we're gonna beat this thing

I've waited so long for someone like you to come along
Oh, what I would give, give for one kiss on your open mouth
Green, your eyes are so green
So emerald green, Siena dream
So I'll hold it all down
I hang around 'til you come around, you come around
You come around
You come around
