		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh, oh

I get so used to it
Disappointment after disappointment
So pointless and I'm through with it
Only function in the dysfunctional too comfortable

And I ain't even asking you to sympathize
'Cause bullshit's always been a friend of mine
All I wanna do with you is get it right this time

So where you been hiding?
Tell me why you're just so hard to find?
Where you been hiding? Oh, oh

I often dream of it
Even after all the damage, I ain't damaged goods, I'm a free spirit
Past impossible, can't stop me feeling what's possible

Still gonna love like it's the first time
The bullshit's always been a friend of mine
All I wanna do with you is get it right

Where you been hiding?
Tell me why you're just so hard to find
Where you been hiding? Ooh
Where you been hiding?
I've been waiting for you all my life
Where you been hiding?
Oh

There's always something I'm missing
Still tryna find what it is
All of the time I've been wishing (wishing, wishing, wishing)
Maybe it's out of the question
Maybe it doesn't exist
Maybe it's all just a lesson (lesson, lesson, lesson)

Where you been hiding?
Where you been hiding?
Where you been hiding? Oh yeah
Oh, oh
Where you been hiding?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
