		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, uh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Shh, shh, shh, man
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, damn (God)
You see how I'm comin', nigga
Man (nigga, I took this shit overseas and shit)
Mm-hmm, damn, Cardo
(Shit crazy)

A nice day in the city, so I'm whippin' for real (whippin' for real)
The sun is out, I closed the deal
One thing about these dudes, they'll be mad for nothin' (they'll be mad for nothin')
Nigga, get off your ass, it's a life to live (life to live)
I'm pushin' the lines (pushin' the lines) 
My shoes designer (shoes designer)
And I don't want to fuck if we ain't usin' a condom
I'm a fresh ass nigga with a check on Hamlin (check on Hamlin)
I like girls from Oakland, but I'm a Frisco man (Frisco man)
Hold on, bitch, you had a chance then blew it (chance then blew it)
Fuckin' with them little niggas, bitch, you must be stupid (must be stupid)
I'm a boss, and I boss up daily (up daily)
Niggas changin' over money, man, this shit gettin' shady (shady)
I'm rollin' up a 'Wood while I chill on my balcony (ayy, balcony)
Niggas know what's happenin', I get on a nigga casually (casually)
Drop top vehicles and pretty ass women (pretty ass women)
June, where you been? I been four lane switchin'

I been all around the world, nigga, gettin' to a bag
Nigga, money in my pocket 
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga
If you want to make somethin' then you got to take a chance
Nigga, money in my pocket 
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga
Livin' life every day, nigga, fuck what they said
Nigga, money in my pocket 
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga
I been all around the world, nigga, gettin' to a bag
Nigga, money in my pocket
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga

G bodies (G bodies), 50s (50s)
'Vettes with no sleeve (no sleeve)
(Good job, Larry)
Movin' (movin'), keepin' it P (sheesh)
Twenty Gs in these cargo jeans (sock it to me)

I'm dippin' up the block and my speakers is knockin' (and my speakers is knockin')
Everything clean, so these hoes is jockin' (hoes is jockin')
Pulled up on a bad ass bitch named Tasha (bitch named Tasha)
Then bent a couple corners on that black Ducati (keep goin')
I'm in a different mode, got her bent over, mm-hmm
Baby got back so I'm pullin' up, mm-hmm
Ten stacks in the nap wap, nigga, mm-hmm
They be like, "That's a nice watch", I'm like, "Mm-hmm"
I'm feelin' good today, I fucked around and bought her Goyard
Money in the walls and the flo', I feel like Ozark
Skylarks, .442s, and them Novas
Everything legit, I ain't trippin' off the rollers

I been all around the world, nigga, gettin' to a bag
Nigga, money in my pocket 
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga
If you want to make somethin' then you got to take a chance
Nigga, money in my pocket 
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga
Livin' life every day, nigga, fuck what they said
Nigga, money in my pocket 
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga
I been all around the world, nigga, gettin' to a bag
Nigga, money in my pocket
Nigga, money in my pocket, nigga

G bodies (G bodies), 50s (50s)
'Vettes with no sleeve (no sleeve)
(Good job, Larry)
Movin' (movin'), keepin' it P (sheesh)
Twenty Gs in these cargo jeans
