		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm money broke and it's no joke can't core use the rope this time (Hey!!)
Nuckel up buckel up the rideÂ´s getting rough but I will not loose my mind (Hey!!)
I asked 'em if I could come in and the first thing they said was no (Hey!!)
If I can't come in that's mean that I can't come back that means I got nowhere to go

[Repeat x2]
I'm a hyena fighting for lion share
Sometimes the lions share ain't there

Absent from political authority an animal I've become (Hey !!)
Total disorder and confusion is the life style that I run (Hey !!)
Permit me to do what I want and I will I'm a nomad to travel (Hey !!)
Concrete class stone and gravel

[Repeat x2]
I'm a hyena fighting for lion share
Sometimes the lions share ain't there

Every time I turn around itÂ´s the same sad story
Getting ganked I wish it could end in life's commissary
I'm a bad missionary with a wicked message I sent
Who can I trust in a world of greed
When I'm taught to take and not to give

Who can I trust when I'm taught to take and not to give

I'm money broke and it's no joke can't core use the rope this time (Hey!!)
Nuckel up buckel up the rideÂ´s getting rough but I will not loose my mind (Hey!!)
Permit me to do what I want and I will I'm a nomad to travel (Hey!!)
Concrete class stone and gravel

I'm a hyena fighting for lion share
Sometimes the lions share ain't there
Sometimes the lions share ain't there...shit
