		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, the sunny place for shady people
A crowded room where nobody goes
You can be whoever you wanna be here
Oh, I've been living at the Chateau
Shouldn't drive but I should really go home
I don't even know 'em but they won't leave here

Frightened by my own reflection
Desperate for a new connection
Pull you in but don't you get too close
Love you now but not tomorrow
Wrong to steal but not to borrow
Pull you in but don't you get too close

I've been California dreaming
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night (all night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night

I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

Hello, I'll tell you all the people I know
Sell you something that you already own
I can be whoever you want me to be
Love me now but not tomorrow
Fill me up but leave me hollow
Pull me in but don't you get too close (oh)

I've been California dreaming
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night (all night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night

I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something
But I keep feeling nothing all night long

All night long
All night long
All night long
All night long

I've been California dreaming
Plastic hearts are bleeding
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night (all night)
Lost in black hole conversation
Sunrise suffocation
Keep me up all night (keep me up)
Keep me up all night

I just wanna feel
I just wanna feel something
But I keep feeling nothing all night long
