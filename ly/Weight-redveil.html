		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, uh, uh
Tell myself I ain't feeling the weight
Nigga, yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh

Tell myself I ain't feeling the weight
I came far from accepting defeat
Made it out with the blood on my face
We done shed every tear we can weep
Watch 'em wearing they heart on they sleeve
My shit don't even come out the fleece
Niggas don't even pay it no mind
'Cause I'm dressing that shit in Supreme
Nah, that NLFTS, black culture the blueprint
Don't fuck with the BS, I'm doing my best
They washed out, need to give it a rest
The tables turn, why they tryna confess?
I'm still the same nigga needing my space
'Cause shit be evil but look good in the face
They haphazard but I'm keeping my pace
They haphazard but I'm, uh (Yeah)
I remember when I was 11 and watching my blood on the TV get spilled out
Now I got a lil older, no love for the system
and I'm reaching back for the grip now
And it's really fuck twelve I done grown in myself
to the point I can see that they hate us
All these white niggas bold on the web with that word
But in person they know they won't fade us
If you not getting money then shut the fuck up
Bro, I don't wanna hear what you got to say
'Cause that chase be the only option for a nigga like me
I can't make it no other way
I was sitting in class in the back with my thoughts
consuming everything that's around me
When I'm snapping back into reality, shit still ain't change
The music still found me, ya dig?
Yeah, uh

Tell myself I ain't feeling the weight
I'ma thrive, it ain't up for debate
Already got enough food on my plate, nigga, yeah, uh
You can see all the sweat on my face
We been hungry from birth to the date
If you fuck with the grind gotta skate
Ya dig? Uh
Tell myself I ain't feeling a way
I'ma thrive, it ain't up for debate
Already got enough food on my plate
Yeah, uh
You can see all the sweat on my face
We been hungry from birth to the date
If you fuck with the grind gotta skate, nigga, uh
