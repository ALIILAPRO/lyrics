		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, oh yeah
Yeah (blatt), oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah (alright), oh yeah, yeah (alright)
Uh-uh, yeah, uh-uh, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Okay, alright, yeah (yeah)

Show me somethin' I ain't never seen, won't be easy for me, yeah-yeah (blatt)
All the time that I could hear 'em speak, that shit been hard to believe, yeah-yeah
Tables turned but you gon' fuck around and wish you still had your seat, yeah-yeah
She said, "Tecca, boy, you think you the shit," but who fuckin' with me? Whoa, whoa

Down with me, won't see them 'round if they not with me
She like, "I needed you," I think God sent me
Gave me your heart, I said, "Don't tempt me"
She said, "Don't break my heart," I said, "Don't let me"
I don't even try, no, they won't get me
Get these racks, see, I been on the road steady
Nowadays, I don't need nobody
It's easy, I don't even know many (yeah)

Don't even get me time, fuck it (don't even get)
I get this bread in my meantime (yeah)
Makin' plays, we don't even get we time (yeah)
Where the blunt? Bitch, I always get tree time
Everyday we don't gotta agree, now I'm better
Fuck it, I fly you to meet the sky later
Don't know who you wanna be when I met her
Told me your nigga wan' be my level

Show me somethin' I ain't never seen, won't be easy for me, yeah-yeah (blatt)
All the time that I could hear 'em speak, that shit been hard to believe, yeah-yeah (whoa)
Tables turned but you gon' fuck around and wish you still had your seat, yeah-yeah
She said, "Tecca, boy, you think you the shit," but who fuckin' with me? Whoa, whoa

Down with me, won't see them 'round if they not with me
She like, "I needed you," I think God sent me
Gave me your heart, I said, "Don't tempt me"
She said, "Don't break my heart," I said, "Don't let me"
I don't even try, no, they won't get me
Get these racks, see, I been on the road steady
Nowadays, I don't need nobody
It's easy, I don't even know many
