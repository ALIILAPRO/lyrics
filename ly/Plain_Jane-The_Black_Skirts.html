		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
like a movie I kissed her in the rain 
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
here's a song to send her off on a plane

it almost felt like love
I almost fell in love again 
I think I will survive, it's not like I got hit by a train 

goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
one hundred is not good enough for me
goodbye goodbye goodbye
don't take it slow I only got one speed

I don't like to be tamed
I don't play teenage games. oh, that's so lame
if she's after my fame, surprise!
I am not a household name

goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
she's a mistake I wanted to make
goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
no candles burning on our cake 
I was in love with a plain Jane 
I don't think I will ever do it again
