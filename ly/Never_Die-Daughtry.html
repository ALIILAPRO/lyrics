		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this hour breaking? Now we're out of time
Changing seasons
A thousand reasons to say goodbye
Have we given all we have to give?
And are we living all the
Life that we can live?

We take away, take away
A piece of you and me and just walk away
But we'll never die never die

See it your way
Or see it my way or never mind
Should we keep hurting or keep
On searching the other side?
Have we taken all that we can take?
And have we broken every
Promise we can break?

We take away, take away
A piece of you and me and just walk away
But we'll never die never die

And it's safe to say, safe to say
We never really mean it anyway
Cause we'll never die, never die
Never die, never die

Make amends, start again
Before we go off the deep end
And turn the page, a new day
How can we pretend?

Oh, oh

Take away, take away, yeah
A piece of you and me and just walk away
And it's safe to say, safe to say
We never really mean it anyway, yeah
And we'll take away, take away
A piece of you and me and just walk away
And with our two worlds collided we may fall
We will never die, never die
Never die, never die never die, never die
