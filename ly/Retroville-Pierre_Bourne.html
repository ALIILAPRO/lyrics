		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, we was skippin' class in the bathroom
Ayy, we was passin' notes in the classroom
I was crushin' on you, yeah, homeroom
I was fuckin' on you, mom gon' be home soon
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt 
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Skirt, shirt, panties, bra, she take it off
Skirt, shirt, panties, bra, she take it off
We're blastin' off
Rocket ship, we're blastin' off
Rocket ship, we're blastin' off
Rocket ship, we're blastin' off

When I touchdown, that's like seven points
Hop out the bed like Soulja Boy
Stack my guap, even lil' coins
Make her move like she deployed
Need some glue 'cause she destroyed
Can't repay them, love them more
This Dolce not from the store
Fresh to death like I'm at the morgue
Still on the block where I was poor
She get wet, yeah, she gon' pour
Lingerie, purple, of course
I let nature take its course 
Now my money never short
I rock Sossboy, watch me sport
I was needin' you, you ignored
Lighter than Common, you hear my voice
Don't let the money blur the vision
Money blue, my pockets, now they denim
See my knots like my pockets inches
She give me mouth like some dentures
Jimmy Neutron, I'm on my adventure
My dawg like Goddard, that's my nigga
No robot, I can't be Bender
Katara, she gon' water, I bend her
Call me Mr. Spalding 'cause I be, uh, ballin'
I got the racks like it's on sale
I got the pack but it's not mail
He can't talk, his money like braille
I ain't gotta see that shit to tell
These niggas dirty, I ain't even gotta smell
Pass the truck, gotta give 'em hell

Ayy, we was skippin' class in the bathroom
Ayy, we was passin' notes in the classroom
I was crushin' on you yeah, homeroom
I was fuckin' on you, mom gon' be home soon
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt 
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt

Skirt, shirt, panties, bra, she take it off
Skirt, shirt, panties, bra, she take it off
We're blastin' off
Rocket ship, we're blastin' off
Rocket ship, we're blastin' off
Rocket ship, we're blastin' off

Yeah, that nigga really broke like he fractured
We can see though, with me, y'all need glasses
I wear the purple, yeah, like I'm Aladdin
Doin' tricks with my money, yeah, like it's magic
She want my wood, yeah, like a cabin
Her pussy Saweetie, yeah, so I tap it
Like Skippa Da Flippa, yeah, I'm havin' it
They sleepin' on me, yeah, like a mattress
Diamonds shinin' like it's sunny
Money talk, but it ain't funny
Money like pussy, it keep comin'
Through her mind, I just keep runnin'
Got the drop, boy, don't be clumsy
They gon' spin yo' block just for me
Y'all niggas got robbed like Horry
All my opps still watchin' my story

Ayy, we was skippin' class in the bathroom (we was)
Ayy, we was passin' notes in the classroom (we was)
I was crushin' on you yeah, homeroom (I was)
I was fuckin' on you, mom gon' be home soon (I was)
Skrrt, skrrt (skrrt), skrrt, skrrt (skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt (skrrt), skrrt (skrrt), skrrt, (skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt (skrrt), skrrt, skrrt, (skrrt)
Skrrt, skrrt (skrrt), skrrt, skrrt, (skrrt)

Skirt, shirt (shirt), panties, bra (bra), she take (take) it off (off)
Skirt, shirt (shirt), panties, bra (bra)
She take (take) it (it) off (off, yeah, she take it off)
We're blastin' off (we're blastin' off)
Rocket ship (I'm blastin' off), we're blastin' off (we're blastin' off)
Rocket ship (we're blastin' off), we're blastin' off (I'm blastin' off)
Rocket ship (I'm blastin' off), we're blastin' off (we're blastin' off)

Yeah, I'm blastin' off, yeah, we're blastin' off
Yeah, I'm blastin' off, yeah, we're blastin'
Yeah, we're blastin' off, yeah, we're blastin' off
Yeah, I'm blastin' off, yeah, we're blastin'
