I was really getting high with
The motherfucking birds when they

If it's morning or night they hitting, yeah

Yeah, all of my demons gon' slide
Talk about demons, they flying
Talking 'bout demons, they kill and I
Get to tell you, like, why

Pull up, Chanel, get the bag, fuck

Pull up, Chanel, fuck the tag (Bust)
I'm on demon time after the X (M-m-m)
Boy, I take me this X
I don't have no regrets (Dawg)

Tell me why everyone sound like me (Me)
Tell you why his bitch really want me

Yeah show me that receipt (yeah)
Yeah, we in Chanel, double C (Double C)
And the bitch wear Gucci, double G (Double G)
Super wet pussy, we'll see (yeah)
