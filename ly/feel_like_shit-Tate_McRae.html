		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Usually never cry at all
I would say I'm pretty tough
But it's been a couple weeks now
And I still feel stuck in my lungs
And usually I go out on nights
And not think of you once
But if they start playin' that song
I can't help but to think about us, oh

Really thought I'd be done with the hardest part
When I pulled myself out of your arms
Wish I knew that was only the start
And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause

Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call
Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all
And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
But right now I just feel like shit (ah, ah)
Oh, oh

So I kissed somebody else
Just to see how it felt
But all that was goin' through my brain
Was your hands around my waist
You know how to do it so well

Really thought I was done with the hardest part
When I pulled myself out of your arms
Wish I knew that was only the start
And now I'm fallin' apart 'cause

Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call (you didn't even try to call)
Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all
And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
But right now I just feel like shit (ah, ah)
Oh, oh

Now if I get a little too drunk
I'll start thinkin', "What if you were the one?"
I know that the damage is done
And I still have the shirt that you wore
When we first met, it's there on the floor
I might kick it under the bed
Hopin' that I could forget that

Last night for the very first time
You didn't even try to call
Oh, I won't lie, I thought I might die
I couldn't even sleep at all
And maybe I'll get used to it (ah, ah)
But right now I just feel like shit (ah, ah)
Oh, oh

(Used to it)
(Feel like shit)
