		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I stop 
My vehicle drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
'Cause that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen, air, financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want for me, I can't maneuver 
Without you next to me
It's so complex to me

What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list 
To you I'm Santa, Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? 
(Yours, yours, yours)

I'm your puppet 
You control me
I'm your puppet
I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?) I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?) You control me
(Did I wait too long?) I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?) I don't know me
'Cause I'm your puppet (puppet, oh)
You control me (control me)
I'm your puppet (puppet)
I don't know (ooh ah)
I'm your puppet 
(Did I wait too long?) Ohh
Woah, oh, oh (puppet)

You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ay, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see
A to Z, nah son, I'm gonna take a breathe
Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breather
On a cedar
On a wee verse
Light the weed first
Blowin' reefers, get the reverse (yeah we 'bout to scream, yeah we 'bout to scream)
Get the weed (yeah we 'bout to scream, oh lord)

(La, la, la, la)
(La, la, la) Breathe on a song
(La, la, la) Breathe on a song
(La, la, la, la, la, la) Breathe on a song
(I've been lost)

(La, la, la)
(La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
(I've been lost, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
But at some point, you come to your senses
