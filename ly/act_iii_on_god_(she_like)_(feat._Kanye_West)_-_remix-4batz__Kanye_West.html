		  (SSEVA)

She like, "Boy, go find someone, find someone you love"
Girl, I can't find no one, 'cause you the one I love
You don't understand, it's so hard to trust
She like, "You not the one, you didn't give me enough"
Seen us
Trust me, I seen from far
You told me that you loved me
And you put that shit on God

You so damn hard to read
It's so damn hard to please you
I know you're wrong for me
But I still want you to come home to me
It's not my fault

Don't do that, don't do that
Don't call back, DM that, deletin' that
You can't get me mad
You can't get no better than me, bitch
I'm the best you had
Do Italian leather on the bag
Claimin' you on your period 'cause you're mad
I'ma fuck you better on the red
Listenin' to broke bitches, now ya both broke
Relationship advice from girlfriends
Who ain't got a man, what a joke
But I guess it's how it go, cap shit to the side though
That shit hurt my pride though, how I feel being lied to
Couldn't love me if you tried, too

She like, "Boy, go find someone, find someone you love"
Girl, I can't find no one, 'cause you the one I love
You don't understand, it's so hard to trust
She like, "You not the one, you didn't give me enough"
Seen us
Trust me, I seen from far
You told me that you loved me
And you put that shit on God

Don't you walk away now
Look at what we made together
Don't you walk away now
We can clear this stuff together
Don't you walk away now
Look at what we made together
Don't you walk away now
