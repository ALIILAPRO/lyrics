		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bang, bang, kill it, gotta go, go get it
I'ma lean, rock with it, in the trap, goin' silly
If she drop like it's hot, tell that bitch bounce with it
Talkin' big knot flippin', talkin' big sauce spillin'
Got a check, big drip, I'm drenched
Pardon my French, I'm with a foreign bitch
And she don't speak no English
Big money spent, blow like a vent
Been tryna hit it, if you with it
Come and get it

Bang, kill it, gotta go, go get it
I'ma lean, rock with it, in the trap, goin' silly
If she drop like it's hot, tell that bitch bounce with it
Talkin' big knot flippin', talkin' big sauce spillin'
Got a check, big drip, I'm drenched
Pardon my French, I'm with a foreign bitch
And she don't speak no English
Big money spent, blow like a vent
Been tryna hit it, if you with it
Come and get it

Bang, kill it, gotta go, go get it
I'ma lean, rock with it, in the trap, goin' silly
If she drop like it's hot, tell that bitch bounce with it
Talkin' big knot flippin', talkin' big sauce spillin'
Got a check
Drippin'

Big money spent
Drippin'
Been tryna hit it, if you with it
Come and get it

Know I run it, keep up, no limit Visa
I got married to the streets, should've signed a prenup
Hood ting, Keisha, good brain, genius
And with this big pile of money, I don't never need love
Big wolf on my necklace, big dog, see me flexin'
If I ever get arrested for the gang, my confession, ayy

Bang, bang, kill it, gotta go, go get it
I'ma lean, rock with it, in the trap, goin' silly
If she drop like it's hot, tell that bitch bounce with it
Talkin' big knot flippin'
Been tryna hit it, if you with it
Come and get it

Bang, kill it, gotta go, go get it
I'ma lean, rock with it, in the trap, goin' silly
If she drop like it's hot, tell that bitch bounce with it
Talkin' big knot flippin', talkin' big sauce spillin'
Got a check, big drip, I'm drenched
Pardon my French, I'm with a foreign bitch
And she don't speak no English
Big money spent, blow like a vent
Been tryna hit it, if you with it
Come and get it

Bang, kill it, gotta go, go get it
I'ma lean, rock with it, in the trap, goin' silly
If she drop like it's hot, tell that bitch bounce with it
Talkin' big knot flippin', talkin' big sauce spillin'
Got a check
Drippin'
Big money spent
Drippin'
Been tryna hit it, if you with it
Come and get it
