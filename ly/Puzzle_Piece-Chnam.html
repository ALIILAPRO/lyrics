		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait, I didn't get a chance to say
That imma miss you when you leave
I'll wear your heart upon my sleeves
Love, it's hard to deal with you not here
You know I'm not too good with grief
And every day I'm on my knees, asking the Lord
Why they take your soul away?
Is this the price that I must pay?
I never knew I'd see the day
Oh no, I can't believe this shit is true
Your dark thoughts took you
The dark side took you

If I could, I would open up your mind
So we could numb your stress which you kept right deep inside
You took your life, yet didn't know that you had saved mine
My missing puzzle piece, my missing puzzle piece

Love, it's been a while since we last spoke
And even now, I cannot cope
Plus every day feels very slow
When I'm at work, I be dreading going home
'Cause I won't see you on my phone
And once again, I'm on my own
I'm so alone, it's just me, myself and I
I've lost count how much I've cried
Those flashbacks with you on my mind
It hurts, although
I know when it's my turn to die
I'll meet you in the afterlife
And have your presence by my side

If I could, I would open up your mind
So we could numb your stress which you kept right deep inside
You took your life, yet didn't know that you had saved mine
My missing puzzle piece, my missing puzzle piece
If I could, I would open up your mind
So we could numb your stress which you kept right deep inside
You took your life, yet didn't know that you had saved mine
My missing puzzle piece, my missing puzzle piece
