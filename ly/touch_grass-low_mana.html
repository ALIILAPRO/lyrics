		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well this song is 'bout depression
It's like a way to open up a conversation
Yeah I felt that too
It's my confession, lack of expression, more like obsession
Yeah I felt that too
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it ain't cool flexing 'bout your conditions
I mean like, who in the world makes it cool to be sad?
Objection hearsay, that's bullshit
Bitch you need to go out and touch the fucking grass
Stop saying shit nobody asks
It's not all about you and your sorry ass
But I mean it, you need to touch some grass
Bruh you need to stop
Cause we're 80s, we pass the mountain just to see the math classes
You just soft ass boy called 90s
Or it's gen z?
Hell, I don't even know what to call you guys bangsat
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it ain't cool flexing 'bout your conditions
I mean like, who in the world makes it cool to be sad?
Objection hearsay, that's bullshit
Bitch you need to go out and touch the fucking grass
Stop saying shit nobody asks
It's not all about you and your sorry ass
But I mean it
(Bitch)
You need to go out and touch the fucking grass
Stop saying shit nobody asks
It's not all about you and your sorry ass
But I mean it, you need to touch some grass
