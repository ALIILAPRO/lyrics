		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me singing
Even though the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had

You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of the places we could hide

You got me singing 
(Singing even though the world is gone) even though the world is gone 
You got me thinking
(Thinking that I'd like to carry on) I'd like to carry on

(Oh, oh, oh) you got me singing
(Singing even though it all looks grim) even though it all looks grim
You got me singing
(Singing the Hallelujah hymn) the Hallelujah hymn

(Singing the Hallelujah hymn)

You got me singing
(Singing like a prisoner in a jail) like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
(Singing like my pardon's in the mail) like my pardon's in the mail

You got me wishing
(Wishing our little love would last) our little love would last
You got me thinking (you got me thinking)
(Like those people of the past) like those people of the past

You got me singing (la, la, la)
Even though the world is gone (even though the world is gone )
You got me thinking
(Thinking that I'd like to carry on) I'd like to carry on

You got me singing
(Singing even though it all went wrong) even though it all went wrong
You got me singing
(Singing the Hallelujah song) the Hallelujah song

(Singing the Hallelujah song)
