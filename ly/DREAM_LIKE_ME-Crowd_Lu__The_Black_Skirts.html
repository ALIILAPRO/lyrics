		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seasons have changed 
Since you ran away from home 
I've looked everywhere 
But it's time to let it go 
There's a ghost in my kitchen 
A graveyard in my bed 
Endless nights and fever dreams 
My soft edges are gone 

But I don't have to ask you
'Cause I already know 
You don't love him like you loved me
No matter what you tell him 
You left your heart behind, girl
Come back and pick it up
We are never gonna be done, no, no 
Woo

Seasons have changed 
Since you ran away from home 
I've looked everywhere 
It's time to let it go 
There's a ghost in my kitchen 
A graveyard in my bed 
Endless nights and fever dreams 
My soft edges are gone

But I don't have to ask you
'Cause I already know 
You don't love him like you loved me
No matter what you tell him 
You left your heart behind, girl
Come back and pick it up
We are never gonna be done, no, no 
Umm, woo

Does he dream like me? 
In a world full of broken dreams 
Does he make you feel like I did, babe? 
In a room full of nobodies 

Does he dream like me? 
In a world full of broken dreams 
Does he make you feel like I did, babe? 
In a room full of nobodies 

Who would paint the sky green for you? 
Who would wait out in the rain for you?

Who would paint the sky green for you? 
Who would wait out in the rain for you?
