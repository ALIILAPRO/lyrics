		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm falling at the sight of you
You tripped me, it's alright
Is it just me or is it you?
Is it love or am I fooling
Around trying to find the truth
I'm trying to find the truth

Is it us
Or is it supernatural?
Sometimes we fall so fast it's hard to tell
(Stella ella ola, clap clap clap)
Oh, is it love
Or is it simply something else?
Sometimes I think I'm caught under a spell
(Stella ella ola, clap clap clap)

I'm floating like a satellite
Like the sound of the ocean
Just rolling around in the blue
It is just me without a clue?
I'm tryna find the truth
I'm tyna find the truth

Is it us
Or is it supernatural?
Sometimes we fall so fast it's hard to tell
(Stella ella ola, clap clap clap)
Oh, is it love
Or is it simply something else?
Sometimes I think I'm caught under a spell
(Stella ella ola, clap clap clap)

Is it us
Or is it supernatural?
Sometimes we fall so fast it's hard to tell
(Stella ella ola, clap clap clap)
Oh, is it love
Or is it simply something else?
Sometimes I think I'm caught under a spell
(Stella ella ola, clap clap clap)
