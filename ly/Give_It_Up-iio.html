		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet September, where'd you go
I was hoping someone knows
Have you missed me
Was I there

I was dreaming someone cared
Now hear me out
I was the one
I waited for you

To get what is due
I want it from you
So will you give it up
I want you to move

Can you feel the love
I could haunt you, listen clear
Remember my voice
In you ears

In your bedroom
In your car
In the movies
In your heart

So feel me out, 'cause I'm still the one
I gave it to you
And still know how to
I won't let you forget my name

I am part of the bigger game
I can load it in your mind
I won't ever fade in time
Have you heard me now

'Cause I'll be the one
I'll take it from you
However you choose
