		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time to walk these streets alone, a future now unknown, to fix my broken dreams.
The city lights, I see in my rear view, the life that I once knew, the ghosts I leave behind.

You came right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, I´ve got nothing left to lose. I´ve got nothing left to lose.

I´ve been feeling out of touch, I´ve been feeling out of touch lately
So close to giving up, so close to giving up, and no sleep.

You came right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, I´ve got nothing left to lose. I´ve got nothing left to lose.

It's time to walk these streets alone, a future now unknown, to fix my broken dreams.
The city lights, I see in my rear view, the life that I once knew, the ghosts I leave behind, the paths I didn't choose.

right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, I´ve got nothing left to lose. I´ve got nothing left to lose.

You came right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, a better life to choose.
Right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, a better life to choose.
Right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, a better life to choose.
Right when I needed it, right when I needed you, I need something new, a better life to choose.
