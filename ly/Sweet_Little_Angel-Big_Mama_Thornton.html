		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a sweet little angel
And I love the way she spreads her wings
Yes, I got a sweet little angel
And I love the way she spreads her wings
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me
You know I get joy in everything

I asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill
Yes, asked my baby for a nickel
And she gave me a twenty dollar bill
I asked her for a little drink of liquor
My baby gave me a whiskey still

Yes, if my baby should quit me
Lord, I do believe I would die
Yes, if my baby my baby should quit me
I do believe I would die
Yes, if you done love me little angel
Please, please tell me the reason why
I just got to have a little more
