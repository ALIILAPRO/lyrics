		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never was a fan of the internet
She never felt that safe in her own head
We both hate the news
There for the grace of God goes you
Smiling when I ask if she's bored yet
We wonder if we took it too far
Both taste confused
Darling, what am I to do?

I like to think that I'm
The only guy she'll see tonight
You can call me what you like
As long as you call me

And you can kiss the skin
From my lips if it makes you feel good
I'm not sure if you want it
I'm not sure if you need me, too
And you can taste the beer
On every guy that talks to you
But you can't stay awake forever
No, you can't stay awake forever

And so I find myself in your mum's bedroom
Fighting with the pink roller blinds
It's on pay-per-view
Just place your bets on whose lost their minds
You take a pirouette under duvet set
You sigh with perfect pitch on the time
I'm not made for you
But what else is new?
Oh, Lord she tells me that it's nothing
I really hope it's nothing

You can kiss the skin
From my lips if it makes you feel good
I'm not sure if you want it
I'm not sure if you need me, too
And you can taste the beer
On every guy that talks to you
But you can't stay awake forever
No, you can't stay awake forever

This just in, I am a total fucking dumbass
And I've come to the uncomfortable conclusion
I'm gonna be spending the rest of my life in a state
Of constant paranoia
Just let me follow you
And I'll proceed to bang my head on every doorway
And doorframe you see suitable for us to go through
And I've found that the road to happiness
Is paved with rows and rows of very tempting parking spaces
I'm not paranoid, I'm a realist
I know you're gonna kill me

You can kiss the skin
From my lips if it makes you feel good
I'm not sure if you want it
I'm not sure if you need me, too
And you can taste the beer
On every guy that talks to you
But you can't stay awake forever
But you can't stay awake forever

And you can kiss the skin
From my lips if it makes you feel good
I'm not sure if you want it
I'm not sure if you need me, too
And you can taste the beer
On every guy that talks to you
But you can't stay awake forever (you can't stay awake)
You can't stay awake forever (you can't stay awake forever)
