		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry)
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry, cry)

I found out from a friend of a friend that you're here again
What gives you the right to come back to the city that I live in?
Yeah, I know that you grew up here and I know that your family's here
But I found out from a friend of a friend that you're here again

So what now?
Should we talk?
If we run into each other on the streets
Should I keep walkin'?
So what now?
Do you tell your friends
That things ended well?
That I'm over-dramatic, it was chill
Do you lie and say you don't wanna see me again
'Cause I do it too
Both of us like to pretend
So we feel like we're cool
So what now?

(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry)
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry, cry)

I'm like what the hell, why the hell didn't you call me yet?
I know I cuss you out, that's my mouth
But you should be banging on my doorbell
Yes, I said I hated you and those little dimples too
Still, I'm like what the hell, why the hell didn't you call me yet? (Cry)

So what now?
Should we talk?
If we run into each other on the streets
Should I keep walkin'?
So what now?
Do you tell all your friends
That things ended well?
That I'm over-dramatic, it was chill
Do you lie and say you don't wanna see me again
'Cause I do it too
Both of us like to pretend
So we feel like we're cool
You don't wanna see me again
'Cause I do it too
Both of us like to pretend
So we feel like we're cool

So what now?
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry) (So what now?)
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry) 
So what now? (So what now?)
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry)
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry)
You're a dumb crusty ass bitch but I think I love you
Welcome back to California
I love you
You're so small I could flick you across the room
I wish I could hug you
I might kiss you but I also might fight you

(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry)
If I miss your call I'm gonna cry
(If I'm missing calls I'm gonna cry)
If I miss your call I'm gonna cry
