		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is what you need (hey)
I came with plenty (racks)
This is what you need
Wear my heart (heart), on my sleeve (hey)
Sit me down, baby, tell me where to be
Cross my heart, the door ajar unless it's Bentley
Say, when I wanna turn my back, don't go knock on my dawg door (yeah, yeah)
I'm makin' love to shawty, oh (yeah)
Ayy sis, spendin' it up
Okay, you beat your cases and you don't have to sell the can now (sell the can now)
And her fuckin' ring look like the Grand Slam (whoa)
Oh, I'ma have to take a Bentley just to transit (whoa)
Eat us some lobsters, just the bros, I left the hoes out
Lost thirty million this year and that's with the shows out (whoa)
I told 'em put the rest of it up, we got to hold out
Got a few opp bitches tryna figure out where my show spot
Racist, pockets full of big faces
Get you paid quick
Walk up on 'em and just face it (baow)
Open cases, guess they thought I was somethin' to play with (woo)
Watch me falsetto out in Vegas with your lady (woo)
Tryna rob you, chances are slimmer than shady (yeah)
She got her hair long with the Maisons on, no basic (oh yeah, yeah)
She got me thinkin' everybody 'round me cheatin' (yeah)
These niggas basic, they need to face it
I'ma turn off the light
But tell me is you breathin'?
Tell me if you caught a fever
Strictly for cuttin' up every season (oh)
I took her out, seein' it changed me
I took her out, you know the pain, babe
You a hard headed nigga, yeah
Fuck all that though
No back and forth with them opp or them hatin' hoes
No back and forth with them opp 'bout your ratchet ass
I hope you plan on growin' up with your ratchet ass, yeah

La-la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, ooh, na-na
I don't wanna get no crown
Blessed with her heartaches
My heart gone
