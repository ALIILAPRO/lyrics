		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go
C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go

My soul invaded vital force
Won't spare what I'm hunting for
It's the animal within my blood
Wouldn't stop it, if I could
Seed is sown, I'm chippin' in
Roll the bones, I'm chippin' in
Embed the code, I'm chippin' in
Mayhem flows

Not backing down
Never backing down
Not backing down
Yeah

C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go
C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go
Yeah

Suits run when I come undone
Can't kill me, I'm zero and one
Add justice to the people's math
Blaze your way down the rebel path
Hear my call, I'm chippin' in
Total war, I'm chippin' in
Casings fall, I'm chippin' in
Kill them all

Not backing down
Never backing down
Uh

C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Oh, yeah
Come on

C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go
C-can you feel it?
Can you touch it? 
Get ready 'cause here we go
