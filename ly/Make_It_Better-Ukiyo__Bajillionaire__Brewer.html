		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Inside, Inside, I don't know where I've been
This time, this time, It will be different
I lied, I lied right to your faces
So I'll try, I'll try 
To find a way to

Inside, Inside
(Inside, Inside)
This time, this time
(Inside, Inside)
I lied, I lied
(Inside, Inside)
But I'll try, I'll try
To find a way to

Make it better
Make it better

Yeah, I swear I'll try better,
Cause last time we all crashed when I cut the brakes
I don't want to remember, 
Cause each time you just fade out again
Leave me here
Where'd you go?
Leave me here
I don't know
Disappear 
In a flash of false forgiveness
It's unclear how I got in this mess
It's all I my own head
It's all in my own head

Inside, Inside
(Inside, Inside)
This time, This time
(Inside, Inside)
Yeah I lied, I lied
(Inside, Inside)
(Right to your faces)
But I'll try, I'll try
To find a way to

Make it better
Make it better
