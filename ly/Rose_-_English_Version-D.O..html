		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you driving your car down to school (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Your lips are so fine
And you're looking so cool (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know you've noticed me, too
And if I'll be honest with you now
Maybe, I'm thinking maybe (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you need a lover
Let me know (oh, oh, oh) and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you roses every day
I might not have a fancy car (ooh, ooh)
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover, baby

They look at me when I'm looking at you (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't give a damn
'Cause it's all I can do (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Please don't go breaking my heart
Tell me you're aching for me now
Baby, baby (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you need a lover
Let me know (oh, oh, oh) and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you roses every day
I might not have a fancy car (ooh, ooh)
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover, baby

Any flowers ain't your pain
I got so much love to give you, babe
As long as you feel the same way
You know we can do
Whatever you want
You just need to either let me come inside
Or leave me standing in the rain (ah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you need a lover
Let me know (oh, oh, oh) and let me in
I could treat you better
Steal you roses every day
I might not have a fancy car
But I fancy you
So gimme a chance
If you need a lover, baby
