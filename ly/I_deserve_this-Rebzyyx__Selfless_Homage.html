		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swear I fucking miss you
It's been a few months since we last talked
I don't know if you miss me
I've been stuck in my head everyday
I can't get out 'cause I don't know what to say
Remember last July you went out lied
Lied to my face and made me feel denied
Don't know what I did, but it was still my fault
That's what you said, that's what you said

Leave, leave me down on the dance floor
I can't pick up my self no more
I deserve this, I deserve this
I deserve this, I des-, I des-, I
Leave me down on the dance floor
I can't pick up my self no more
I deserve this, I deserve this
I deserve this, I des-, I des-, I
I need you tonight
I don't wanna cry for one night
I just want a normal life
I just wanna be alright
I don't wanna kill myself
I just wanna fix my health
Fucking hate this loneliness
Never felt-
Leave, leave me down on the dance floor
I can't pick up my self no more
I deserve this, I deserve this
I deserve this, I des-, I des-, I
Leave me down on the dance floor
I can't pick up my self no more
I deserve this, I deserve this
I deserve this, I des-, I des-, I
Leave me down on the dance floor
I can't pick up my self no more
I deserve this, I deserve this
I deserve this
