		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ay, you ready?
Ay, grab that right there
Huh

Are you ready? (Ay) Is you ready? (Ready)
You say you ready? (Oh) Whole squad ready (ready)
Is you ready? (Huh?) Are you ready? (Ready)
Is you ready? Whole squad ready

We came here to see just what you got (oh)
No, no, no, not on my watch (no way)
Bring what you got, I'm goin' to the top (ay)
You can bring what you got, I'm goin' to the top (woo)
Bring what you got (ay), bring what you got (ay ay)
I'm goin' to the top (ay), I'm goin' to the top (ay ay)

Are you ready?
You know what time it is, right?
They don't want us to make it, so it's time to take it
Ay

Ridin' with them killers, it's time to see who be realer
Unload it, empty the clip on 'em, make sure these people feel it (brr)
I'm shootin' like Reggie Miller, don't move or I'ma hit you (move)
Cop a pound, turn it to you, I call it the Lemonilla
Scope on the bean, no more shin-picks, I hit ya from distance
Came out the trenches with extensions, God is my witness (God)
Gotta get that first shot off before that bullet hit me (grra)
Ain't gotta worry about lookin' back when my squad with me (no)

Are you ready? (Ay) Is you ready? (Ready)
You say you ready? (Oh) Whole squad ready (ready)
Is you ready? (Huh?) Are you ready? (Ready)
Is you ready? Whole squad ready

We came here to see just what you got (oh)
No, no, no, not on my watch (no way)
Bring what you got, I'm goin' to the top (ay)
You can bring what you got, I'm goin' to the top (woo)
Bring what you got (ay), bring what you got (ay ay)
I'm goin' to the top (ay), I'm goin' to the top (ay ay)

Offset
Hoppin' out the trunk (hop out) with the killers lookin' like Thriller
I'm ready for the millions, talk to myself in the mirror
Is you ready? (Ready?) Jump off in that Bentley with no ceilings
Is you ready? (Is you?) Sick off takin' losses, time for winnin' (winnin')
Can't hang with us, can't bang with us (nah)
They know we armed and dangerous
If you think you fuckin' with my squad, better hang it up (squad)
We been gridin' hard (hard), can't take that from us
We been gridin' hard on the jump, can't take that from us (nah)

Are you ready? (Ay) Is you ready? (Ready)
You say you ready? (Oh) Whole squad ready (ready)
Is you ready? (Huh?) Are you ready? (Ready)
Is you ready? Whole squad ready

We came here to see just what you got (oh)
No, no, no, not on my watch (no way)
Bring what you got, I'm goin' to the top (ay)
You can bring what you got, I'm goin' to the top (woo)
Bring what you got (ay), bring what you got (ay ay)
I'm goin' to the top (ay), I'm goin' to the top (ay ay)

Are you ready? (Ay) Is you ready? (Ready)
You say you ready? (Oh) Whole squad ready (ready)
Is you ready? (Huh?) Are you ready? (Ready)
Is you ready? Whole squad ready
