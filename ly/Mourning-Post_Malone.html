		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to sober up
The sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God that's a warning"
Don't want to sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

I just left Wally's in a Maserati
The way I gotta flex you'd think I did pilates
I called my quote and quote friends, do you got plans?
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot, bye-bye (damn)

Don't want to sober up
The sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God that's a warning"
Don't want to sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus

Stumbling down a corridor, came across an open door
Throwing up is easy and who put on The Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more
Who am I talking to? Nobody
Take me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When money ain't a problem, everyone's sliding
Even when I tell myself that I

Don't want to sober up
The sun is killing my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God that's a warning"
Don't want to sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just want to pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
