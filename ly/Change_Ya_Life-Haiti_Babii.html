		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suuu (ha)
Ouuu
Money, Power, Respect (respect)
Trick it, pop it, and I did it with a Tec
Quit keep playing, you a rookie, I'ma vet
Demarcus cousin, Bitch I always got a Tec
Remember love ain't easy, when they tryin' to tear the window
If they fucking with my niggas, then they fucking with me too
I got no time to spend, I'm busy fucking with the crew
In the grave they try to stick me
I'm fucking with voodoo

From the streets we got niggas who tryin' to get paid
Reminiscing the day homies had been on coke yay
Mama seen me up on tv and she know this won't stop
Know that Rollie on your wrist got you green tick tock (l's)
Thick bitch, juicy lips with Gucci flip flops

Like if you and I could go out one night
I'll show you a good time
Promise you I'll change ya mind just let me freak you
Keep this between me and you
(Let me free ya mind)

Don't go telling all your friends, that we in love for real
(You know you love me, yes you do)
Don't go telling all your friends, that we in love for real
Come and get this dick, this'll change ya life
(Tell me how you feel)

See but I got something for your mama
He say she say drama
And I know how you feel
So I gotta keep it real
I can't stand being alone
But baby tonight you gotta come through
I'ma slide in the two seater right behind you
Baby tell me how you feel
I'm show you what I do
If this ratchet don't work I'ma ride with the banger
You got my heart and that's dangerous
But I fell in love with the streets and I fell asleep with the heat
Tell me baby don't lie to me
Was you really finna slide for me (is you really finna slide)
Was you really finna ride for me (is you really finna ride)
Is you really finna die for me (is you really finna die)

Don't go telling all your friends, that we in love for real
(You know you love me, yes you do)
Don't go telling all your friends, that we in love for real
Come and get this dick, this'll change ya life
(Tell me how you feel)
