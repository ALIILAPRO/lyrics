		  Ayy, masked up
I'm finna hit a lick on these niggas
Went down, now I'm back up
I done did a trick on these niggas
Fuck running a bag up
I'm finna hit a sprint on these niggas
Man, you better back up
'Cause we finna act up ('cause we finna act, ac-, ac-)

Spinning the block in the whip with the ch-ch, mm
I'ma let that bitch rip 'til it click-click, mm
If we miss, we gon' do the same shit with a twist
Spin it back like a ereh-ereh mix, mm
Got that dope when you itch for the quick fix
My whole life I've been running with misfits
My whole life I've been up in the trenches
This shit ain't really on me, it's in me
Back in the day I was bummy and dingy
Now I'm on the up and up, I'm ascending
Always tried to be so loving and friendly
Now you can't get nothing from me, I'm stingy
Ducking the envy, not fucking with many, I'm clutching the semi
Don't trust 'cause I know that they want to come get me just 'cause he is winning
They thought it was over, it's just the beginning
Down on my luck, I swear nothing was giving
Fucked around and got stuck up in a penitentiary
Deep down, I knew though that something was pending
Started plotting the come up of the century
Demons told me quit, they wasn't convincing
What's a couple Benji's?
Won't stop until I am abundantly living
The cup runneth over, I still put in work like the cup runneth empty

Masked up
I'm finna hit a lick on these niggas
Went down, now I'm back up
I done did a trick on these niggas
Fuck running a bag up
I'm finna hit a sprint on these niggas
Man, you better back up
'Cause we finna act up ('cause we finna act, ac-, ac-, ayy)

Come 'round my block and get chopped up (come 'round my block and get chopped up)
Blow yo' wig back like a drop top (blow yo' wig back like a drop top)
I got the game in a headlock (I got the game in a headlock)
Feel like my cousin, you bet' not (feel like my cousin, you bet' not)
Come 'round my block and get chopped up (come 'round my block and get chopped up)
Blow yo' wig back like a drop top (blow yo' wig back like a drop top)
I got the game in a headlock (I got the game in a headlock)
Feel like my cousin, you bet' not (Feel like my cousin, you bet' not)
Straight off the top like a NLE dreadlock
Yeah, the boy stoned, no bedrock (bedrock)
Pick up the mic, and they head rock (head rock)
I got the sight, it's a dead shot (dead shot)
No scope, headshot (ah)
Yeah, the boy stoned, no bedrock (uh)
Pick up the mic, and they head rock 
I got the sight, it's a dead shot (ahh)
No scope, headshot
Ayy
Heavy is the neck that wears the chain
I can't refrain from leaving every one of 'em in pain
Step to the mic, you heard it right, I will ignite the world
'Cause I'm the best in the game
Thought you knew, but you did not
I am the key, the lock turn on me, I pop
Keep a piece to keep the peace
To feed the beast, I been driven, don't need no lease
I think I'm feelin' myself
Hunnid' thousand on my neck, yes I'm feeling my wealth
I think I'm feeling this high (high)
Why you think we all wear masks on the Y (take it off!)
Rappin' 'bout money and chains (money and chains)
Rappin' 'bout killing the game
That shit is an epidemic inside us (side us-side us-side us)
This shit is systemic
This is my house, you a tenant (house you a tenant)
Hold up, now listen my sentence
'Fore you end up with a sentence
I'm tryna move this shit forward, yeah, yeah
I'm tryna move this shit forward
Ya'll moving backwards like tenet

Masked up
I'm finna hit a lick on these niggas
Went down, now I'm back up
I done did a trick on these niggas
Fuck running a bag up
I'm finna hit a sprint on these niggas
Man, you better back up
'Cause we finna act up ('cause we finna act, ac-, ac-)
