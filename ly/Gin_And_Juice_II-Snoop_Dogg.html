		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get your motherfuckin' glass, 'cause it's a blast from the past
You didn't think would touch it two times, nigga
Gin and Juice up in this bitch, yeah
Some of that Beats By the Pound flavor, you feel me (you heard me)
Get your ice, get your cups, 'cause we 'bout to get fucked in here
You heard me? (Yeah) Straight up (yeah)

I'm still smokin', driftin', swifter than a mothafucka
Twisted off a cup of that 'ol ignat juice
Heated in the seat, cup fulla drank
Beatin' up the block in the dark blue tank
Bullet proof vest on my chest for the cause
Dig in my draws for them muthafuckin' laws
Harrassin' a nigga, or blastin' a nigga
I ain't seen shit, so why you askin' a nigga?
I'm too fucked up off that G-I and juice
C-I get loose, nigga what y'all wanna do?
I got a crew, but I choose to roll solo
Especially on Sundays, dippin' in my low-low
Convertible top, spot for the Glock
I ain't fuckin' with the hen dog, so toss out the sauce hot 
Put my shit on three wheels, for thrills
I hit a corner and make sure my drink don't spill, that's real

Rollin down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top rolled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Now trip this, I'm on Interstate 10 fuckin' with this Creole
She said she know Nino, stop lyin' (know Nino)
Cup of that gin and juice, I blank a bitch out
Then turn the bitch out, look here
Ain't no need for you to be wastin' my time
See I picked you up, now I'ma stick you up and dick you up
And give you what you need, then bring you back down to reality
With that California weed, she seemed trouble at first
And then it got worse
'Cause now I got my hand up and down her mini-skirt
Twerkin' that shit while I'm ridin' up the highway
Doin' it my way, the hella highway, the fly way
Swervin' in another lane, tryin' to maintain
And baby girl steady takin' dick to the brain
Left no stain 'cause she swallowed it up
Then she wanted to take a puff
I said "look here bitch you done had enough"

Rollin down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top pulled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top pulled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies (check this out)

Somebody say, I wanna get fucked up (say what? Say what?)
Come on, now everybody say
I wanna get fucked up (what you say? What you say?)

I popped by the ice cream shop top cop somethin', pop somethin'
Ya heard me? Where's Serv-B? Nigga, well serve me
Since you got that big bad ass dangle
Nigga, you know I'm known for havin' that big ass bank
Tryin' to buy all your dope 'cause I'm a smoker
I'll find that indo weed even when I'm on the East Coast
'Cause times gettin' hard on the boulevard
But I refuse to lose and buy a zip of that backyard (hell no)
Lil' Jimmy sent me somethin', I need to cop somethin'
I know you got somethin', nigga stop frontin'
Get at your boy, hook me up like Master P
Or would it be a tragedy, ya feel me, the best weed nigga

Rollin down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top pulled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies

Rollin down the street with heat
Drankin' trees, sittin' on D's
Top pulled back so I can feel the breeze
Never slippin', I keep my eyes on my enemies (beyotch)
