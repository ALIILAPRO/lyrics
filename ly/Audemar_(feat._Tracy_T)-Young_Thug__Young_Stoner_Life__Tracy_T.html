		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt

Ride in a new Maybach, dunk on these hoes like Shaq
Jimmy Choo shoes relax, gym fit socks to match
I was just smokin' on thrax now I'm playin' with that sack
Pussy just fall in my lap, money just Chase my back
The gang came back with rags, I'm ridin' 'round town with a gat
I'll beat a nigga face with a bat, pink slip pad, Patek!
I bought me the new Hellcat
I'm blowin' in a new Hellcat
I walk in the club, Hellcat
Eighty five racks, Hellcat

I eat the steak with the crab cake
I stuck my D in her trash can
Baby "Tip Drill" with a passion
Equipped, came like trash can
Audemar back fade, I'ma come through like Aladdin
Audemar trash can
Audemar coupe was matchin'
Audemar Black sand
Audemar Biggavelli
Audemar Piguet
I just got Audemar thrax in
All of y'all ass fast, all of y'all ass gon' stash packs
All of y'all ass fat, Audemar with a passion
Audemar, Springfield
Audemar, drop top Bel Air
Audemar paralyzing drip, Audemar wheel chair
Audemar hand made, aye Audemar billionaire
Aye Audemar blue and red
Audemar float chair
Audemar wrist band, Audemar, Rollie face Ric Flair
Audemar wrist splash, Audemar splish, splish splash
Audemar whiplash, shawty got Audemar moustache'd
Turned my chips to cash
I don't need to worry, millions

Ride in a new Maybach
Dunk on these hoes like Shaq (let's go!)
Jimmy Choo shoe, relax
Gym fit socks to match
I was just smokin' on thrax
Now I'm playin' with that sack
Pussy just fall in my lap
Money just chasin' my back
The gang came back with rags
I ride 'round town with a gat
Beat a nigga face with a bat
Pink slip pad, Patek!
I bought me the new Hellcat
I'm blowin' in a new Hellcat
I walk in the club, Hellcat
Eighty five racks, Hellcat

Yves Saint Laurent just to match it
Christian Dior with the ratchet
Audemar make it do magic
Audemar, I want that Patek
Audemar make her come out of her panties
Come with that water like I'm at Atlantic
I land in a jet, just to pick up a package
I land on your bitch, just to bust on the mattress
I tell her bend 'round and I bust on the backwards
I call her hoe, but that bitch call me "daddy"
My money long like the '73 Caddy
Put in that work we gone weigh it and bag it
Don't come with it shawty, might shoot til it's jammin'
In the back on the Maybach I got on that fashion
He got on Richard Mille?, that shit ain't average
My bitches? I bought 'em some titties and asses

Ride in a new Maybach, dunk on these hoes like Shaq
Jimmy Choo shoe relax, gym fit socks to match
I was just smokin' on thrax, now I'm playin' with the sack
Pussy just fall in my lap, money just chase my back
The gang came back with rags, I'm ridin' 'round town with a gat
I'll beat a nigga face with a bat, pink slip pad, Patek
I bought me the new Hellcat
I'm blowin' in a new Hellcat
I walk in the club, Hellcat
Eighty five racks, Hellcat

Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
