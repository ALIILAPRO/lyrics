		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, girl in my dreams)

Girl in my dreams, where are you
Girl in my dreams, I'm so blue
How I yearn, how I love for you

If I could just hold your hand
Surely then you'd understand
That it's you I adore forevermore

A love like mine is hard to find
It's a fire, it's a raging flame
Although you won't hear my plea
That love is raging just the same

Girl in my dreams, what can I do?
Girl in my dreams, I'm sad and blue
Can't go on on without you, girl in my dreams

Girl in my dreams, what can I do?
Girl in my dreams, I'm sad and blue
Can't go on on without you, girl in my dreams
