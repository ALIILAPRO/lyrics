		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  you took the mirrors off the wall
but I like what you see
too much sugar in your cologne
and your keys on the washing machine

come here, lover
what you waiting for
I can't stop the way you make me feel
you know I need some more
tonight i'll close my eyes
to touch you in the dark
baby, believe it
let me leave my mark

I put the love letter in your leather
in the lining on the left side
oh, I put the love letter in your leather
in the lining on the left side

blood on your waterline
like I know your pain
i'm never leaving you behind
but you gotta let me in

come here, lover
what you waiting for
I can't stop the way you make me feel
you know I need some more
tonight i'll close my eyes
to touch you in the dark
baby, believe it
let me leave my mark

I put the love letter in your leather
in the lining on the left side
oh, I put the love letter in your leather
in the lining on the left side
