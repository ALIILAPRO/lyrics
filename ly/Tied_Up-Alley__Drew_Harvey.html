		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got me sinking deeper into you
And I don't care if you're words are true
I can't ascend when both my hands are tied
And I wouldn't love you without your lies
Now I can't see the light i think we're lost
And I can't go by your words cause its just not enough
Had me tied up to the ground and it's my fault
But I'm so tied up in you
I don't really care at all
Can’t be bad without acting rude
Stress drinking in the afternoon
Ain’t no quick fix for an attitude
Can’t ask anything without lighting your fuse
You got a sense for lack of image
Personal projects you can finish
Thought that I would always be aware
Lookin like I fell into your care
And I’m feeling white like eyes on the sunshine
But I won’t know my loss if I stay blind
And you got me sinking deeper into you
And I don’t care if your words are true
I can’t ascend when both my hands are tied
And I wouldn’t love you without your lies
Now I can't see the light i think we're lost
And I can't go by your words cause it's just not enough
Had me tied up to the ground and it's my fault
But I'm so tied up in you
I don't really care at all
And I know you don't trust no-one
So tell me how you plan to fall in love
I know you don't chase no-one
You chase these millions
And I'm so tied up in you
I have trouble trying to run
Yeah I'm so tied up in you
No need to tell me the truth
