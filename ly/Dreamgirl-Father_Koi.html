		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on, don't hit and run
The graceful way they fall, one by one
Convenience store rooftop days
Jump off the train, I'm in that place
Still think I deserve that bit of fun
Don't you, boy?

Days are passing slow but
How many I don't know
I'm tired of this shit
Can I kick it, make it glow?

Playing Tetris all the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Too much of wanting really messes with your mind

Cut me deep, won't look inside
How much do you want to hide
She asked me how you feel about her
Said, "Don't know, I'll see you later"

Don't know what you make of me
Standing there inside my dreams
Sugar pills and motorbikes and nevеr-ending turnpikes

Come on, don't hit and run
Thе graceful way they fall, one by one
Convenience store rooftop days
Jump off the train I'm in that place
Still think I deserve that bit of fun
Don't you boy?

Cut my notebooks like I'm still in the third grade
Here I am in college but I'm feeling like I don't age
Doing shit all day makes me feel so goddamn useful
Making money all the time, don't want to lose this time
Give decent advice but I never really take it
If I look too hard inside my head I'm scared that I might break it
When I call you on the phone I don't want to be alone
Close my eyes, keep me safe under your collarbone

I don't even know your name
But I want to play your game
But I always lose this game
I don't even know your name
But I want to play your game
But I always lose this game
Yeah!

Come on, don't hit and run
The graceful way they fall, one by one
Convenience store rooftop days
Jump off the train I'm in that place
Still think I deserve that bit of fun
Don't you, boy?
