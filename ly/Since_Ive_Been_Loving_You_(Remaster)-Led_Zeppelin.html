		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Workin' from seven to eleven every night 
Really makes life a drag 
I don't think that's right
I've really been the best, the best of fools 
I did what I could, yeah 
'Cause I love you, baby 
How I love you, darling 
How I love you, baby 
My beloved little girl, little girl
But baby, since I've been loving you, yeah 
I'm about to lose my, my worried mind, oh yeah

Everybody trying to tell me 
That you didn't mean me no good
I've been trying, Lord, let me tell you
Let me tell you, I really did the best I could 
I've been, I've been working from seven to eleven every night
I said, it kinda makes my life a drag, drag, drag, drag 
Lord, yeah, that ain't right, now, now
Since I've been loving you 
I'm about to lose my worried mind, yeah
Watch out

Said I've been crying, yeah
Oh, my tears they fell like rain
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?
Don't you hear them, don't you hear them falling?

Do you remember, mama, when I knocked upon your door? 
I said you had the nerve to tell me 
You didn't want me no more, yeah 
I open my front door, hear my back door slam
You know, I must have one of them new fangled
New fangled back door man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been working from seven, seven, seven to eleven every night
It kinda makes my life a drag, a drag, drag 
Ah, yeah, it makes a drag
Baby, since I've been loving you
I'm about to lose
I'm about to lose, lose my worried mind 
Just one more, just one more, oh yeah
Since I've been loving you, I'm gonna lose my worried mind
