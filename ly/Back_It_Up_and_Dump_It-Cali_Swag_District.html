		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!

We all on and I'm in the zone
Everything's in doubles,
Everybody got a come!
You see two women so I see four,
But to back it up and dump it,
Make sure you hit the flow!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin'
In a chick with a face something like Letoya Lucket,
We both hands on,
Something like a puppet,
And her booty like a pillow,
Makin' smoove wanna fluff it.
Make that back drop like a new song or album,
I just wanna play all in yo middle like Malcolm.
My name ain't Vick but I'm something like a falcon
I'm fly as I wanna be with all the women under me

All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!

I'm in the back with that Carnavaux,
With the light on my neck like a Carnavaux,
Is too many girls and I want them all,
The way they bounce that thing like a basketball!
Call on my Willy, they talkin bout Wanka,
She backed it up and dump it like a truck Tonka.
Send your bullies home,
Just to fly on my rib or drink when the boy passed by.
She's looking like a Cupid,
So I think I need her,
She said her name was Nina,
She reminded me of my heater.
So I grabbed her by the waist, pull her back
And made her dump it!
Criminal bootie, oh my God, I could

All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!

Hey, shwaty is like a stripper,
Look at her legs, she can't get no thicker,
And if she did, she ain't be fat,
Back it up and dump it for me, baby just like that!
Hey ya! Baby let your weave down,
If you ain't with the boys in the V.I.P league now,
'Cause Bone get Scummy and I like rhymin,
So grab that pole, and slide like diamond,
It hurts all, it ain't no finding,
All the rap booty, big booty duty,
I think me and you girl should go and make a movie,
I'm not playing games, just calling you for a duty.

All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
O.K.!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
Back it up and dump it!
And for you, you, back it up and dump it!
