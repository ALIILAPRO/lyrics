		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be alone where is my baby?
I don't want to be alone where is my man?
I spend hours by the phone where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone where is my man?

My list of needs is really quite brief
I need a man who can bring my relief
From all the stress and strains of the day 
With just a tiny stroll thru Cartier

I need a man who can take me then taunt me and make me
Buy the things I so richly deserve 
A man who knows what I require
Is the thing that I desire 
Is there anyone out there who has the nerve?

I don't want to be alone where is my baby?
I don't want to be alone where is my man?
I spend hours by the phone where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone where is my man?

Where is my baby? He cant be far
Look for an ascot, a big cigar
Tell him to find me just send his car 
To this address I have to stress, I need him now
Where is my baby when will he start? 
To use his Visa right to my heart
Ill give him Carte Blanche baby be smart
Drop your amount in my account
But do it now

I don't want to be alone where is my baby?
I don't want to be alone where is my man?
I spend hours by the phone where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone where is my man?

The kind of man that I adore 
Is the kind of man that gives me more 
Of all the better things in life that aren't free
Such things as summer by the sea 
The Hamptons, Malibu, Capri
The kind of man who comes alive when he comes near Rodeo Drive
Is the kind of man who wins my heart with style and class
You know I've tried some other men
The kind with zeros, less than ten
But every time I grab the ring its always brass

I don't want to be alone where is my baby?
I don't want to be alone where is my man?
I spend hours by the phone where is my baby?
I chew my fingers to the bone where is my man?
