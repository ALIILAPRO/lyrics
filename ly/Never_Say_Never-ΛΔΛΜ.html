		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dark obsessions, dangerous liaisons
The serpent rattles, the thrill of the kill
Your style is malice, cold and callous
Sex and violence is how you get your fill
I’ve got a question, do you have the answer?
You blur the lines between pleasure and pain
A classic story of slave and master
A vicious cycle against the grain
Because you’ve stung too deep and I should have seen the sign
But the door was unlocked and you sharpened the knife
I can’t resist when you pull the chain
I die, I live and then I die again
Never say never
I’ll borrow this one from you
Never say never baby
Every single word was true
Do unto others, then crawl under covers
The Devil is hiding beneath the skin
The fire’s still burning, hopelessly yearning
Victims of chance, seduced by sin
I’ve got a secret, wanna know about it?
I only pick battles that I can’t win
Fingers on triggers, primed for disaster
The mark gets worked but he still believes
Because you’ve stung too deep and I can’t forget that night
You kept what was yours and you took what was mine
Seeking release before I turn insane
I live, I die, I live again
Never say never
I’ll borrow this one from you
Never say never baby
Every single word was true
Never say never baby
Only moving back to square one
Never say never baby
The game has just begun
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never baby
I’ll borrow this one from you
Never say never baby
Every single word was true
