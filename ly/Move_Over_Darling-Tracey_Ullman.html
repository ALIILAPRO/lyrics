		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our lips shouldn't touch 
Move over darling 
I like it too much 
Move over darling 
That gleam in your eyes is no big surprise anymore 
Cos you fooled me before 

I'm all in a spin 
Move over darling 
I've got to give in 
Move over darling 
And though it's not right, I'm too weak to fight it somehow 
Cos I want you right now 

The way you sigh, has me waving my conscience bye-bye 
You can call me a fickle thing 
But I'm practically yours forever, because 

I yearn to be kissed 
Move over darling 
How can I resist 
Move over darling 
You captured my heart, and now that I'm no longer free 
Make love to me 

The way you sigh 
Has me waving my conscience good-bye 
You can call me a fickle thing 
But I'm practically yours forever, because 

I yearn to be kissed 
Move over darling 
How can I resist 
Move over darling 
Please give me your love, I'm longing for you 
I need all your love, honest I do 
You captured my heart and now that I'm no longer free 

Make love to me
