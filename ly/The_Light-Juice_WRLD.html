		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forever is a long, long time from tonight (oh)

When it's dark outside, you're always the light (oh yeah)
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice (oh, oh)
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep inside

I owe fines, the devil say I owe him for life
But I could feel it, I got God on my side
Remember when He sent you to me that night
Had to cuff you up, like a cop on a heist
Cupid is the judge, so I must testify
I won't move or budge, I'll stand by you for life
All my life, when you die is when I die
I sometimes wonder why
We argue and fight
And quickly make things right
It's probably 'cause we gotta grow more over time
Wouldn't be real love without rough nights
Can't feel these drugs, but I feel your eyes
When you look at mine, things feel alright

When it's dark outside, you're always the light (oh yeah)
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice (oh, oh)
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep inside

Been through it, I don't really wanna get into it
Throwin' out your heart to break mine, so I won't do it
Also, baby, you're my lifeline, you're an influence
All the times you was mad, I was over under your influence
I feel sorry for the people that don't get it
It's really rare that you feel the real love feelin'
Some people get hurt and never love again
Some people get hurt and give the drugs a binge
Some people get dressed and go and hit the club to mend
There's no love in one-night stands, but you can play pretend
Not me, I'ma admit it
All of these hoes one thing, that's pretentious
And if I know one thing, then I know this
It's us forever, worse or better, no discussion, that's how I'm comin'

When it's dark outside, you're always the light (oh yeah)
This heart of mine was once cold as the ice (oh, oh)
The more I try, the more I open my mind, for you
To find, the demons hidin' deep inside
