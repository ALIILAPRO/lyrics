		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, ah, yeah
I live my life like there's no tomorrow
And all I've got, I had to steal
Least I don't need to beg or borrow
Yes, I'm livin' at a pace that kills

Ooh, yeah
Ahh (Runnin' with the devil) 
Ahh-hah, yeah
Woo-hoo-oo
(Runnin' with the devil)
I'll tell you all about it

I found the simple life ain't so simple
When I jumped out, on that road
I got no love, no love you'd call real
Ain't got nobody, waitin' at home

Ahh, yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
(God, in the name of the lord of Nazareth, I'm only gon' tell you one time)
Ahh, yeah 
(Runnin' with the devil) you bet I am, yeah
Woo
Woo

You know, uh, I found the simple life weren't so simple
When I jumped out, on that road
Got no love, no love you'd call real
Got nobody, waitin' at home

Ha-yeah
(Runnin' with the devil)
Oh God, oh God, I'm runnin', aw yeah
(Runnin' with the devil) uh, uh
Ooh ooh, one more time

(Ha-yeah)
(Runnin' with the devil) (oh, yeah)
(Runnin' with the devil) (woo, woo, woo)
(Runnin' with the devil) (ah-ha, yeah, ah-ha, yeah, ah-hah, yeah)
(Runnin' with the devil) (woo)
