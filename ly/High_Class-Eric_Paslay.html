		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody needs one night
To go out in style
Try on a little spotlight
For a little while

I'm talking fancy
Where the food ain't fast
Two forks, two knives
Bud Light in a glass

Rent us a car, show up late
Valet, that's right
Credit on my cards
Money in the bank
At least for tonight

Keepin' my shades on inside
All dressed in black
Escalade me some casies
Yeah baby Cadi up this lac
We ain't on the list
But we on the list
When you look like this
And you walk like that
Skip the line baby
Don't look back
Tonight we high class
Yeah, tonight we high class
(High class)
Hey-Hey

Drop a little bit
Drop a little bit more
Come on baby
Drop a little bit
Drop a little bit more
Tonight we high class

Going at the DJ
He knows what to play
Head on the dance floor
All the girls be like
Heard he taught Timberlake
'Cause I'm smooth when I move
I'm outta my league but confident

I've had high life but not like this
A good ole' boy could get used to

Keeping my shades on inside
All dressed in black
Escalade me some casies
Yeah baby Cadi up this lac
We ain't on the list
But we on the list
When you look like this
And you walk like that
Skip the line baby
Don't look back
Tonight we high class
Yeah, tonight we high class
(High class)
Hey-Hey

Drop a little bit
Drop a little bit more
Come on baby
Drop a little bit
Drop a little bit more
Tonight we high class

Can't take it with you
With you when you die
So I'm going all out
Spend my overtime

Can't take it with you
With you when you die
So I'm going all out
At least for tonight

Got my shades on inside
Oh yeah, all night
Escalade me some casies
Yeah baby, yeah
Kinda like this life
Ha-ha

Keepin' my shades on inside
All dressed in black
Escalade me some casies
Yeah baby Cadi up this lac
We ain't on the list
But we on the list
When you look like this
And you walk like that
Skip the line baby
Don't look back
Tonight we high class
Yeah, tonight we high class
(High class)
Hey-Hey

Drop a little bit
Drop a little bit more
Come on baby
Drop a little bit
Drop a little bit more
Tonight we high class
