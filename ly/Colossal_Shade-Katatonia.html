		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are gathered here tonight
His apostles in the moonlight
He's coming in
A foul saint coming marching in

Engineer of the colossal shade
This is us
Losing grip of the daylight
Letting go of the daylight

He is the voice of our demise
Spitting fire like a mountain
This is us

Let's drain the source
And trade it for the greater high
Just say the word
I'll give up my final piece of freedom

Collapse my mind
I'm ready for the crowning blow
Come what may
I'm ready to enjoy the treason

Satellite star
My future watching me
Transmitting scars
My future watching me

We are gathered here tonight
His apostles in the moonlight
He's coming in
A foul saint coming marching in

Engineer of the colossal shade
This is us
Losing grip of the daylight
Letting go of the daylight

Let's drain the source
And trade it for the greater high
Just say the word
I'll give up my final piece of freedom

Collapse my mind
I'm ready for the crowning blow
Come what may
I'm ready to enjoy the treason
