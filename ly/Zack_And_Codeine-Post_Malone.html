		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (codeine)
Thirty bottles, yeah the bill is on me (on me)
Been livin' fast, no I can't take it slowly (slowly)
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (codeine)
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep (no sleep)
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

I'm whippin' a foreign, I can't whip no Beetle
I rock that Saint Laurent over my beater
I like to stunt like I'm Evel Knievel (ooh)
But it don't mean nothing without all my people
When I step up on stage, hands up to the sky
Every little thing I do, they always analyze
Gave that bitch a little blow and then she come alive
Started dancing on the table like she had on mine

I don't fuck with nobody
Yeah you hardly know me
What you take me for?
No, I can't save your soul
I don't fuck with nobody
Yeah you hardly know me
Please just leave me alone

Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (codeine)
Thirty bottles, yeah the bill is on me (on me)
Been livin' fast, no I can't take it slowly (slowly)
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (codeine)
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep (no sleep)
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

Made a hundred bands so all your hands out
No my friend, can't do no handouts
All these rappers, they sound the same now
Sayin' I'm to blame, now y'all see me?
On the TV
Multimillionaire by the time I'm 23
Gettin' no sleep, ragin' for a week
I hit number one and I ain't even hit my peak
I just had to tell 'em

I don't fuck with nobody
Yeah you hardly know me
What you take me for?
No, I can't save your soul
I don't fuck with nobody
Yeah you hardly know me
Please just leave me alone

Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (codeine)
Thirty bottles, yeah the bill is on me (on me)
Been livin' fast, no I can't take it slowly (slowly)
Man, my life so sweet, I feel like Cody (Cody)
I wake up, rinse my mouth with fuckin' codeine (codeine)
We on a bender, we ain't gettin' no sleep (no sleep)
We turned the hotel lobby to a party

We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', we ain't
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin' tonight
We ain't sleepin', we ain't sleepin', no way
Pour that drink 'cause we ain't sleepin' tonight
