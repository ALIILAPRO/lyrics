		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I just want you to kiss me better)

Never been so close but yet so far
Never felt so light and loved so hard
Never played around with broken hearts
But here we are

It's like we're going on and off again
You say that it's us until the end
But when we go out, I'm just a friend
I fall apart

I just want you to kiss me better
Want you to kiss me better
I just want you to kiss me better
'Cause the sun won't shine on us forever
I just want you to kiss me better

I just want you to kiss me better
I just want you to kiss me better
I just want you to kiss me better

Never been the type, to give it all
Always been afraid to slip and fall
Everything's been safe within my walls
But here we are, ooh

It's like we're going on and off again
You say that it's us until the end
But when we go out, I'm just a friend
I fall apart

I just want you to kiss me better
Want you to kiss me better
I just want you to kiss me better
'Cause the sun won't shine on us forever
I just want you to kiss me better

I just want you to kiss me better
I just want you to kiss me better
I just want you to kiss me better
