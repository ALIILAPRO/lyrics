		<p>
		  Is everybody in? Is everybody in?
Good
The ceremony is about to begin
I lose my senses with you
I got you

How I've got you, I'll never let you go
Now I've got you, I won't let you go

End of the road, babe
Can you see where I'm going?
Get out the car, baby, please
'Cause I don't think you wanna come
This is something else
Something more than you and me
Get out the car, baby, please
Cause any further, you can never leave

And don't say I didn't warn you
Or that you never saw it coming
And don't say I didn't warn you
We saw the target and the loaded gun

How I've got you, I'll never let you go
Now I've got you, I won't let you go
How I've got you, I'll never let you go
Now I've got you, I won't let you go

Take a drive with me
Head down south
Warm weather, baby, lot of people
A lot of room for you to spend some
Spend some time with me
Spend a lot of time with me, babe
No one else can go
Unwind with me

Now I've got you, I'll never let you go
Now I've got you, I won't let you go
Now I've got you, I'll never let you go
Now I've got you, I won't let you go

And don't say I didn't warn you
Or that you never saw it coming
And don't say I didn't warn you
We saw the target and the loaded gun
I won't let you go
