		  (Ayo, Lil Mexico, pass the gas)

If you tryna die, then pick your poison, I got five ways
Slapped him with this nine 'cause he was lookin' at me sideways
I pulled up just to violate, these opps I'm bout annihilate
Got partners doin' life, some others waitin' on they trial date

If you tryna die, then pick your poison, I got five ways
Slapped him with this nine 'cause he was lookin' at me sideways
I pulled up just to violate, these opps I'm bout annihilate
Got partners doin' life, some others waitin' on they trial date

I just woke up, pissed as fuck, might let my gun off
This life from sun up, sun down, I ain't got no time to run off
This goofy tried to run off, oh no, never with my pack
Pack of wolves, chased his ass, this chopper hit him in the back

Overseas, got the keys, now it's time to lay the plane down
Ain't no time to wait, tell 'em gotta make the play now
'Bout my money, I don't play 'round, plus that AK make a great sound
I remember taking greyhounds with 8 pounds
'Cause I was way down, penny pincher
Pockets empty, ain't nothin but just a shank in it
Tryna turn a profit lost homies along the way with it
Wishin' it was way different, still can't change what happened
Gotta put on for 'em in each of my every actions
At the forum, I'm performin', I'm preachin out to the masses
This that shit you hit the pit, split his shit and break his glasses
Life a movie, makin' classics this a boat, then I'm the captain
They keep on callin' me goat but bitch I'm a fucking dragon

If you tryna die, then pick your poison, I got five ways
Slapped him with this nine 'cause he was lookin' at me sideways
I pulled up just to violate, these opps I'm bout annihilate
Got partners doin' life, some others waitin' on they trial date

If you tryna die, then pick your poison, I got five ways
Slapped him with this nine 'cause he was lookin' at me sideways
I pulled up just to violate, these opps I'm bout annihilate
Got partners doin' life, some others waitin' on they trial dates
