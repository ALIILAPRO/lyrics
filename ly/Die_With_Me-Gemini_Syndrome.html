		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa Lord
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa Lord

I hear you breathing 
I hear you think
I hear the meaning that’s hiding underneath
I feel the essence
I fill the void
I feel the hunger that’s growing inside

Whoa whoa 
I’d like the God in you to meet the God in me 
Whoa whoa 
You plus me equals 23

Hallelujah
Are you able to be my sinner and my savior?
Come die with, die with me
Holy altar on your table
I am here alive and able
Come die with, die with me

Whoa whoa 
I’d like the God in you to meet the God in me
Whoa whoa 
I’d like the God in you to meet the God in me

I feel the pressure
I see the spark
I see your energy overcome the dark
I am a servant
I’m on my knees
Is that your shadow enveloping me 

Whoa whoa 
I’d like the God in you to meet the God in me 
Whoa whoa 
You plus me equals 23

Hallelujah
Are you able to be my sinner and my savior?
Come die with, die with me
Holy altar on your table
I am here alive and able
Come die with, die with me

We’re like the moon and the sun
We’re like a zero and a one
Come die with me
Die with me
Is this the pleasure or the pain?
Is it the acid or the rain?
Come die with me
Die with me

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelu…
Hallelu…

Hallelujah
Are you able to be my sinner and my savior?
Come die with, die with me
Holy altar on your table
I am here alive and able
Come die with, die with me
