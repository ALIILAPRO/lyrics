		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Death is life is death is life is death is life is)

They're carving my name in the grave again
The flowers are fresh and their faces wet
My body has died but I'm still alive
Look over your shoulder, I'm back from the dead
Lightin' my candles to draw me in
Seeing all the same things, I'm gone this time
Your words mean nothing, so take 'em back
And meet me here across the plain
The other side, I'm not far

When you aren't around, I sink into the ground
I try to pretend I'm closer to you
Never understand it, you're always on my mind
I cannot help it
I don't wanna be carrying the weight on my shoulders
Death has come to me, kissed me on the cheek, gave me closure
Immortal by design, I'll be meeting you here every time

Back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead (death)
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead (death)
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead (death)
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the (I'm back)

(I'm back)
(I'm back)
(Death, death, death, I'm back)
(Death, death)
(I'm back)

They're saying my name in their prayers again
I flicker the lights so they understand
I won't say goodbye, I'm right by your side
We're screaming and pleading, this separation ends
Doing all your witchcraft to pull me in
Burning all your sage to connect our line
I show my presence, you run away in fear of ghosts
I try to talk, the barriers are too strong

When you aren't around, I sink into the ground
I try to pretend I'm closer to you
Never understand it, you're always on my mind
I cannot help it
I don't wanna be carrying the weight on my shoulders
Death has come to me, kissed me on the cheek, gave me closure
Immortal by design, I'll be meeting you here every time

Back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead (death)
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead (death)
I'm back from the dead (death), back from the dead

Please (I'm back from the dead, back from the dead)
Don't ever worry (I'm back from the dead, back from the dead)
I know it's morbid (I'm back from the dead, back from the dead)
But we all die one day (I'm back from the dead, back from the dead)

I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the dead
I'm back from the dead, back from the (I'm back)
