		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep trying, nothing's working
I still wanna know, if you're alone
I keep trying to put this behind me
I still wanna know who's taking you home

For tonight, I'm going to get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night, go where the music is loud
So I don't have to think about it, I'm beggin', please, don't play

No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play no more sad songs

Dancing with danger, talking to strangers
Don't care where I go, just can't be alone
They'll never know me, like you used to know me, no

For tonight, I'm going to get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night, go where the music is loud
So I don't have to think about it, I'm beggin', please, don't play

No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play

No more sad songs (no, no more sad songs)
No more sad songs
No more sad songs (no, no more sad songs)
No more sad songs 

Going home, take the long way round
Lights pass, sit back with the windows down
Still got you on my mind
Starting to realise
No matter what I do
I will only hurt myself, tryna hurt you
And if I turn the music loud, just to drown you out
I'm beggin', please don't play

No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
No more! (sad songs)
I'm beggin', please, don't play

No more sad songs (no, no more sad songs)
No more sad songs
No more sad songs (no, no more sad songs)
No more sad songs 
No more sad songs
