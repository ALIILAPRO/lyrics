		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did you get through my skin  
I wonder how you ever found out 
Never cared who I have been 
Never saw it coming you move with no sound 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you

I can feel my heart changed
Seems like I'm over you 
I can feel my heart changed
Thought it would never do 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now 

Don't tell me that you feel this way 
We always want what we can not have 
Telling me forever you stay 
We always want what we can not have 
I know that you and me will never be 
I guess you have to find another me 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you

I can feel my heart changed
Seems like I'm over you 
I can feel my heart changed
Thought it would never do 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now 

Don't say you 
Don't say you love me know 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now 

I can feel my heart changed
Seems like I'm over you 
I can feel my heart changed
Thought it would never do 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you 
Don't say you love me now
