		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that they've all left you behind
Your heart broke when the party died
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?

When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark, oh, Laura
You're more than a superstar
And in this horror show
I've got to tell you so, oh, Laura
You're more than a superstar

You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
Drape your arms around me and softly say
Can we dance upon the tables again?

Your smile is so wide and your heels are so high,
You can't cry
Put your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark, oh, Laura
You're more than a superstar
You'll be famous for longer than them
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin, oh, Laura
You're more than a superstar

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark, oh, Laura
You're more than a superstar
And in this old horror show
I've got to let you know, oh, Laura
You're more than a superstar
You're more than a superstar, read more at
