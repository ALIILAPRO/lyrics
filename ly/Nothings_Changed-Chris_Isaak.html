		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's take a drive through the old town,
Back past the place where we meet.
Some things are hard to remember,
Some things you'll never forget.

Let's take a walk down your old street,
Who lives in you house today?
Let's see if we can remember,
All of the vows that we made.

Kisses you gave me, the vows you made me.
None of these things have changed.
Nothing's changed, nothing's changed.

Young lovers stand in the shadows,
New lovers taking our place.
And though your gone I remember,
And I can still see your face.
Kisses you gave me, the vows you made me.
None of these things have changed.
Nothing's changed, nothing's changed.
