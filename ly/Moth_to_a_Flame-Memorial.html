		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamt I saw you in the morning
As bright as the day shines
The warmth kissed your face
And a smile cuts through

I wonder how you’re doing
And who’s arms are around you
And if whatever you’re searching for
Has found you

Like a moth to a flame
I am drawn to your light
But it hurts me everyday

How’d it get this way
Drifting through my whole life
Just to talk with you again
There’s been mist on my mirror
For far too long

Wish I could see you now
Your voice is like a river that flows to the south
I should have looked back
Did you turn around

And like a moth to a flame
I am drawn to your light
But it hurts me every day
I’m still drawn to your life
But it hurts me every day
Can’t be part of your life
I know, it’s okay
I’m still drawn to your light if it kills me anyway.
