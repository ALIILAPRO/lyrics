		  Find a way
Find

I know that you don't want to talk
I know I was drunk when you called
I know I can't expect you stay
But I hope (I hope)
Hope that you can find a way
A way, a way
Find a way

Find a way
Find a way
Find a way
(A way, a way)
Find a way
(Find)
(Find)
(Find)
Find a way
(A way)

I know it'll take you some time
Yeah, do want you want, clear your mind
You don't have the words to explain
But I hope (I hope)
Hope that you can find a way
A way, a way

I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way
I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way
I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way

I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way

(I know it's been a long time)
(But I'll find a way)
(If you can wait a little longer)
(Just a little longer)
(I know I can't ask for much more)
(I hope you find a way)

You can find a way
That you can find a way (find a way)
You can find a way (a way)
That you can find a way (a way, a way)

I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way
I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way
I hope
Hope that you can find a way
Find a way
I hope
Hope that you can find a way
A way, a way
A way (a way)
