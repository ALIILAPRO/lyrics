		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
Yeah
So come on and chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Check (yeah)
(Yeah) check

You better check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
'Cause I'm bad for your health, I come real stealth
Dropping bombs on your moms, fuck car alarms
Doing foul crime, I'm that nigga wit' yo' Alpine
Sold it for a six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know we got that indo'
No, I'm not a sucker sitting in a House of Pain
And no, I'm not the butler, I'll cut you
Head-butt you, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, punk mothafucka
Here to let you know, boy, oh boy
I make dough but don't call me Dough Boy
This ain't no fucking motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, I'll get wit'cha
And hit you taking that yack to the neck
So you better run a check

So come on and chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Yeah, come on and check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
'Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

Chicky-check (yeah)
Chicky-check

Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
'Cause they bitch-made pulling out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle 'cause that's a knife-o
AK-47, assault rifle
Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
Got a new style (watch out now)
I hate motherfuckers claiming that they folding bank
But steady talking shit in the holding tank
First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screaming for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they running up in you slow
You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just 'Twan
Switch it, snap it, rolling your eyes and neck
You better run a check

So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Come on and check yo' self before you wrickity-wreck yo' self
So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Big dicks up yo' ass is bad for your health

Chicky-check (punk)
Chicky-check (yeah)

Yo, it's them niggas again
Watch out, you need to check yo' self, you know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause niggas is definitely fallin' off
Word is bond, word is bond

If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You coulda had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to your cranium (pow)
I got six and I'm aiming 'em
Will I bust or keep you guessing?
'Cause fuck you and that shit you're stressing
Bitch get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker
Go ahead and keep your drawers
Giving up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop your coochie and you're dead
Bitch is a Miami Hurricane head
Sprung, niggas call her "Lips and Lungs"
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check

So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Come on and check yo' self before you wrickity-wreck yo' self

'Cause bitches like you is bad for my health

Chicky-check (punk)
Chicky-check (yeah)

So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Come on and check yo' self before you wrickity-wreck yo' self

So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
So chickity-check yo' self before you wreck yo' self
Come on and check yo' self before you wrickity-wreck yo' self

'Cause the Lench Mob is bad for your health

Nine Trey, remix
Old school tip, yeah
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
