		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

I just been goin' through motions
Back and forth like a ocean
I am a fraud, I am the shit
Hopin' that nobody notice
Bang chest in the mornin'
Head down in the night
Drink less if I wanted
Strike up with the light

And square up, I'm the mightiest
Myself in the fight
Hurt twice but I tried it
No advice for this shit
Might die for this shit
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?

Feel more like limbo
Hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset
That's more my tempo
Yeah, that's more my tempo

Ooh
But this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me

Looked at my demons and saw myself
Put all my meanin' in someone else
Outta sight, outta mind
Don't know where to find it
Don't know where to hide
But I still
Eat good, drink good, feel good, s'all good
Can't hear my head when I'm sat beside ya
Fucked lungs and a liver
Good looks in the mirror
Do I feel alive, feel alive, feel alive?

Feel more like limbo
Hands out my window
Chasin' that sunset
That's more my tempo
That's more my tempo

(keshi) ooh
But this is all that I am
I only show you the best of me
The best of me
Ooh
Tryin' but I'm just a man
Hopin' it won't get the best of me
The best of me
