		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever, when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the day time
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat me right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night 

Everybody's got the fever
That is somethin' you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long time ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said, "Julie baby you're my flame"
Thou givest fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm on fire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
"He gives me fever, with his kisses"
"Fever when he holds me tight"
"Fever, I'm his missus"
"Daddy won't you treat him right?"

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever
When you kiss them, fever if you really learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn 
What a lovely way to burn
