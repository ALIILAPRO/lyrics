		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn, you're beautiful
Damn, oh, yeah
Oh, woah, girl
Damn, you're beautiful
Damn, rain on you
Woah, woah

She make it clap, it be bouncin'
Bouncin', bouncin', bouncin', bouncin' (yeah, bouncin', yeah)
And she be wet like a fountain
Fountain, fountain, fountain, fountain, oh-woah, yeah

She be throwin' it around like this all she about
When she do it, it's like she do it on the runway
She do it just like they do it on the runway
Throw the money in the clouds, let it all come down
When she do it, it's like she do it on the runway
She do it just like they do it on the runway
Oh, incredible, collectible
From head to toe, she in ready mode
She bust it like she's tryna go professional
Would I still cuff it? Girl, you'll never know
I'll probably be doin' hunnid after hunnid (oh-woah)
Givin' you what you want
It probably be the same way with us
It's nothin' that I can't say when I'm on one
Drinkin', comin' off strong, probably reachin'
I think I wanna rock with you
I think I wanna rock with you, woah

Yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh
Yeah, oh

Say what's the word? Lil' mama, I just wanna see you satisfied
I make time to settle all the shit we set aside
Headed to your side if we ever vibe
You know I ain't tryna slide if it's never mine
On the E-way like I'm racin' to the money
I won't be late, you been waitin' for the longest
Origami with your body, how I fold it
Girl, I know just how you want it

Face down, ass up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Slim waist and your body snatched up (oh)
No clothes on, but I'm masked up (oh)
Like is you ready or what?

'Cause I can't waste my time, don't play
You been on my mind all day
If you don't mind, I'll slide up, babe
G5 how I fly your way
I can't waste my time, don't play
You been on my mind all day
If you don't mind, I'll slide up, babe
G5 how I fly your way (your way)
