		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One ticket, please
Lord have mercy, everybody's there
Hey, what's goin' on man, yeah
She's at home, yeah, she's at home
Yeah, she's at home

Let the music play
I just want to dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wee

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
On and on and on and on and on and on and on 
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on

I'm out here dancin' and still, huh
I can't erase the things I feel
The tender love we used to share
See, it's like it's no longer there
I've got to hide what's killin' me inside

Let the music play
I just want to dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long, oh, oh, oh, oh

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
Let it play on
On and on and on and on and on and on and on 
And on and on and on and on and on and on and on

I think im gonna be alright, haha haha
If I can make it through the night oh lord
I just wish she was here with me, i close my eyes, her face i see
I know its make-believe, but its holding on for me

Let the music play
I just want to dance the night away
Here, right here, right here is where I'm gonna stay
All night long, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, wee

Let the music play on
Just until I feel this misery is gone
Movin', kickin', groovin', keep the music strong
Let it play on
Let it play on
Let it play on
Please let it play on
Let it play on
