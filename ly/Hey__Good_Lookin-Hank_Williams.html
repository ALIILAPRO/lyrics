		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'? 
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me? 
Hey, sweet baby 
Don't you think maybe
We could find us a brand new recipe? 

I got a hot-rod Ford and a two-dollar bill
And I know a spot right over the hill 
There's soda pop and the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun come along with me
Say hey, good lookin' 
Whatcha got cookin'? 
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me? 

I'm free and ready
So we can go steady
How's about savin' all your time for me? 
No more lookin'
I know I've been tooken 
How's about keepin' steady company? 

I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence
And find me one for five or ten cents 
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page 
Say hey, good lookin' 
Whatcha got cookin'? 
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?
