		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Covered in sinners and dripping with guilt
Making your money from slime and from filth
Parading your bellies in ivory towers
Investing our lives in your schemes and your powers

You got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief in your head

Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead

See what's ruling all our lives
See who's pulling strings
See what's ruling all our lives
See who pulls the strings
I bet you won't fall on your face
Your belly will hold you in place

The serpent is crawling inside of your ear
He says you must vote for what you want to hear
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're alright
Pull yourself stupid, rob yourself blind

You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head

Be quick or be dead
Be quick, quick, quick, quick
Or be dead, dead, dead, dead

You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head
You've got to watch them
Be quick or be dead
Snake eyes in heaven
The thief's in your head

Be quick 
Or be dead
Be quick
