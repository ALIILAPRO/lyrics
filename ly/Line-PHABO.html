		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living luxury and lavish, nigga bossed up
We on Rodeo, the nigga shop at ross, look
Matching Louis sweats and Fendi with your Balmain
I'ma buy it, I don't care what it cost, look
Though the pipe 'bout to bust from the pressure
You went the plug, I would never finesse you
Come to bed, lay your head on my chest, bae
And leave the smell of YSL on your sweater

Like Jericho, your walls fall down
Like Jericho, your walls fall down
Like, baby, you've been on my mind for the longest
I've been blowing up your line for the longest, yeah
I can see it in your eyes, know you want this
Put my heart in your hands, you control it
So we pull up to the club in a Lotus
Two of us can't afford not to focus
(I've been blowing up your line)
I've been pennin' hella hits for your favorites
Off the drink she like, "My nigga wrote this", yeah
(Ayy)
Off this drink, you're like, "My nigga wrote this"
(I've been blowing up your line)

Off this drink, know that mouth is an issue
Throw it back with an arch like the rent due (line for the longest, yeah)
Team pretty, white toes in the Louis slides
Feel like you struck gold if you do it right
Fell for the wrong hoes, oops, silly me
I'm up now like, "Yeah, bitch, it's really me"
We been mixing cranberry with the grenadine
Mango, red cherry, Halle Berry team
She been tryna cut down on the brown liq'
Doggystyle but that pussy 'bout to meow, bitch
Big dick, big dank, that's a big move
It's manual so let me show you what the stick do
You knew exactly what it was when I hit you
You know exactly what it is when I'm with you

Like Jericho, your walls fall down
Like Jericho, your walls fall down
Like, baby, you've been on my mind for the longest
I've been blowing up your line for the longest, yeah
I can see it in your eyes, know you want this
Put my heart in your hands, you control it
So we pull up to the club in a Lotus
Two of us can't afford not to focus
I've been pennin' hella hits for your favorites
Off the drink she like, "My nigga wrote this", yeah
Off this drink, you like, "My nigga wrote this"
(I've been blowing up your line)
This (line for the longest, yeah)
I been blowing up your li-
