		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is gospel for the fallen ones
Locked away in permanent slumber
Assembling their philosophies
From pieces of broken memories

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

Their gnashing teeth and criminal tongues conspire against the odds
But they haven't seen the best of us yet

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

This is gospel for the vagabonds
Ne'er-do-wells, insufferable bastards
Confessing their apostasies
Led away by imperfect impostors

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart
Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart, this is the beat of my heart

Don't try to sleep through the end of the world
And bury me alive
'Cause I won't give up without a fight

If you love me let me go
If you love me let me go
'Cause these words are knives that often leave scars
The fear of falling apart
And truth be told, I never was yours
The fear, the fear of falling apart

Ooh oh oh ooh, the fear of falling apart
Ooh oh oh ooh, the fear, the fear of falling apart

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart
The fear of falling apart

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart
The fear of falling apart

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart
The fear of falling apart

Ooh oh oh ooh, this is the beat of my heart
The fear of falling apart
