		  Uh, yeah, pissed off
Uh, yeah, pissed off (Pissed off)
Uh, yeah, pissed off (Pissed off, yeah)
Uh, yeah, pissed off, yeah (Pissed off, yeah)
I just wanna do a pit'stop on my ho
(yeah, on my ho)
Make one wrong move in this bitch
I bet the bodies drop, yeah
You was coolin' with that bitch, you
Know she set to drop, yeah
I ain't even foolin' with that bitch
She only give me top, yeah
Tornado with this stick, you know
I spin the block, yeah
(Oh yeah) and you know I'm gon' hit
I'm like John Wick with the Glock
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)

Uh, pissed off uh, yeah, pissed off (Uh)
And he know I'm fucking on his bitch
That's why he pissed off (He mad)
Can't go out sad 'bout no
Bitch, can't go out bad, hell nah
(Can't go out sad, oh nah)
I just tell these bitches anything
To get my cash up racks up, yeah
(yeah) , packs up, yeah (Uh huh, uh huh)
I been stackin' racks so I can
Get a house for my mom (My mom)
I been stackin' racks so I
Can put 'em on anyone
My boys complete the task so
You better not play dumb racks up, yeah
(Oh yeah) , packs up, yeah (Oh yeah)
She know she the best with that head
She go dumb callin' up your bitch
I got that check like LeBron
I'm hittin' her from the back
I told that bitch, "Better not run"

Ooh, yeah, pissed off uh, yeah, pissed off
Uh, yeah, pissed off (Pissed off)
Ooh, yeah, pissed off, yeah (Pissed off)
I just wanna do a pit'stop on my ho
Make one wrong move in this bitch
I bet the bodies drop, yeah
You was coolin' with that bitch, you
Know she set to drop, yeah
(Oh yeah, pissed off)
I ain't even foolin' with that bitch
She only give me top, yeah
(Oh yeah, uh huh, oh yeah)
Tornado with this stick, you know
I spin the block, yeah
(I spin the block)
And you know I'm gon' hit
I'm like John Wick with the Glock
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)
