		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a little bit funny, this feelin' inside 
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy, if I did 
I'd buy a big house where we both could live 

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no 
Or a man who makes potions in a travelin' show 
Oh, I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do 
My gift is my song and this one's for you 

And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind 
I hope you don't mind 
That I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the world 

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss 
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross 
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song 
It's for people like you that keep it turned on 

So excuse me forgettin', but these things I do 
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue 
Anyway, the thing is, what I really mean 
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen 

And you can tell everybody this is your song 
It may be quite simple but now that it's done 
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
