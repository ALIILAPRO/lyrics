		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You already know what it is)
We got another one boy, (A-T-L)
(Just throw it in the bag)
What's up Brooklyn?, Whats up son?
What's up Fabo?, Ay man, I got that black Amex wit me
Aka that throw it the bag card, yeah!

Now I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Yeah I know you ain't over there starin' at my girl
Nigga I know you don't call yourself hollarin' at my girl
I know you don't call yourself hollarin' at my girl
I keep her in Louboutin, Louie Vuttion
Gucci down to her feet, yup just like me
I'm the one, with them ones
Fuck the price on the tag
Just throw it in the bag

Un huh un huh un huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

Look at price tags
Where they do that at?
Heard that in A-T-L
When I'm in A-T-L
Just ask my baby girl
I treat that lady well
Ain't nothin' so so
An I know JD well
A couple Benz's, black white gray C.L.
Got niggas lookin' like, did we miss a Mercedes sale?
Don't wonder what I do, just know they pay me well
They keep that Gucci and that Louie on my labi-els
That's the way we feel
Must be nice man
You wit the right man
You ain't gotta price scan, or ask how much
Now what I look like?
Son I'm from Brooklyn, what it look like?
You get it, 'cause I got it
I got it, so you get it
In my Miami they say, don't stop get it get it
Mami do the speedy
Daddy do the duffel
Bag full of chips
We ain't talkin' ruffles

Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

See I know what I'm a tell her
The same thing that the bank robber told the teller
"Just throw it in the bag"
That's the way it suppose to be
A real nigga posed to help you out with the groceries
Just throw it in the bag
Paper or plastic, it's safer to ask it
So dead that nigga, I will pay for the casket
That Remy Mar' got him spittin' plenty bars
Broke ass nigga couldn't buy the mini bar
So get with Loso
He ain't got to no so
Such a gentlemen dozen bottles of that rose Mo
Oh you gotta man, well you need a richer one
Meet me in the parking lot, the place say get you one
Meet me at the register
I'm there on the regular
Them niggas price checkin'
You can help them in a second
As we proceed to give you what you need
Like we breakin' down the weed
Shorty just throw it in the bag!

Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag

Everybody do the throw it in the bag
Hey throw it in the bag
Everybody do the throw it in the bag
Hey throw it in the bag
Everybody do the throw it in the bag
Hey throw it in the bag

Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
Uh huh uh huh uh huh
Just throw it in the bag
