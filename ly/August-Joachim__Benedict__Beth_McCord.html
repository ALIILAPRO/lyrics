		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I got nostalgia for the summer days
Need a cool drink just to feel the same
Eyes shut, leaned back trying to drift away
Ay
Sunshine said it's on the way
I bought 2 day shipping but it never came
Stick to name brand for my sunny rays
Eyes shut, leaned back, escape

I'm at the end of my rope
Waiting for sunshine
Trying to find the warm in the cold
To settle my mind
Wish I had a new way to cope
I miss the good life
The good life

I just need the beach
And a sun to bake it
Somewhere by the sea
Anywhere I'll take it
And a little bit of breeze
Rolling through the heat
Just a couple friends
This is where my heart is
Living like king
Driftwood apartment
And a little bit of breeze
Rolling through the heat
Just leave me living in August

I've been feeling worn down from the cloudy grey
Traded cold drinks for the colder days
Forecast 45 everyday it's the same
Rain
Homesick for the summer days
Got on warm clothes but it still ain't the same
Flip flops don't work very well in the rain
Eyes shut, take me away

I'm at the end of my rope
Waiting for sunshine
Trying to find the warm in the cold
To settle my mind
Wish I had a new way to cope
I miss the good life
The good life

I just need the beach
And a sun to bake it
Somewhere by the sea
Anywhere I'll take it
And a little bit of breeze
Rolling through the heat
Just a couple friends
This is where my heart is
Living like king
Driftwood apartment
And a little bit of breeze
Rolling through the heat
Just leave me living in August

I'm at the end of my rope
Waiting for sunshine
Trying to find the warm in the cold
To settle my mind
Wish I had a new way to cope
I miss the good good good good life
I'm at the end of my rope
Waiting for sunshine
Trying to find the warm in the cold
To settle my mind
Wish I had a new way to cope
I miss the good life
The good life

I just need the beach
And a sun to bake it
Somewhere by the sea
Anywhere I'll take it
And a little bit of breeze
Rolling through the heat
Just a couple friends
This is where my heart is
Living like king
Driftwood apartment
And a little bit of breeze (and a little bit, just a little bit)
Rolling through the heat (just a little bit)
Just leave me living in August
Oh living in August
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh let me live here

I'm at the end of my rope
Waiting for sunshine
Trying to find the warm in the cold
To settle my mind
Wish I had a new way to cope
I miss the good life
The good life

I just need the beach
And a sun to bake it
Somewhere by the sea
Anywhere I'll take it
And a little bit of breeze
Rolling through the heat
Just a couple friends
This is where my heart is
Living like king
Driftwood apartment
And a little bit of breeze (and a little bit, just a little bit)
Rolling through the heat (just a little bit)
Just leave me living in August
Oh living in August
