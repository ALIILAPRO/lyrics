		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember the neon lights
Through the final hallway
Same old deafening sound
The roaring up above my head

They said we might never be back
The odyssey may never end
Your memory, my guiding light
Will we ever meet again?

Man-made gravity
Holding on to me
Fading bravery
As the blue’s turning to black
It’s getting clear we’re not coming back
Drifting as we get closer to the dark

Crushed by the weight of what’s left behind
Riding through space at the speed of light
Emerald skies no longer is sight
I’m nearly passing out
Hoping for a crash
Something to help the torment pass
A symphony of stars ahead
Laughing at our rusty wreck
Encapsulated

Giving in to the void
Forgive me

Glowing dot in the black open
Roaming through infinite possibilities
They hide behind their maps but we know
There’s no direction cause there’s nowhere left to go

Hold on
Maybe we’ve all gone wrong
How can we really think that we deserve a second chance
When all that we were given has been turned into a mess?

Hold on to love
There’s nothing left but memories
I’ve been so wrong
Infinitely lost in the nothing

Gone for good
This is farewell
Oblivion above my head
And I miss the distance
Between me and the Machine

Smells of gasoline
The air is smothering
Doomed with a lifetime of suffering

Encapsulated

Lights turned red
Sirens are breaking up my head

I’d give anything to break out of this cell
I’d rather burn with you than live in a cold black hell

I just can’t force myself to believe
That this is how the story ends
My fragile knees shatter the ground
Drowning in tears as I forget

Gone for good
This is farewell
Oblivion above my head
And I miss the distance
Between me and the Machine

Between me and the Machine

This is the fate we refused to see
Trapped like rats in the nothing
Giving in to the void
Forgive me

Gone up in smoke
There’s nothing left but apathy
We dug our hole
As one with the symphony

I remember the neon lights
And when they faded away
Never thought I’d miss the sound
I’ll carry your love ‘till the edge
