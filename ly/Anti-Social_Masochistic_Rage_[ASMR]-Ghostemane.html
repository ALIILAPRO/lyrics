		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took a knee and put some food in my cage
And then you taught me how to sit and behave
You told me, "Lick your fingertips for a taste"
And then you smacked me and you called me a waste

I guess you gave me a little surprise in my drink
Stumbled through the hall and hit my face on the sink
Woke up in a panic and unable to see
The pain intensified consequently

Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?

You took a knee and put some food in my cage
And then you taught me how to sit and behave
You told me, "Lick your fingertips for a taste"
And then you smacked me and you called me a waste

Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
