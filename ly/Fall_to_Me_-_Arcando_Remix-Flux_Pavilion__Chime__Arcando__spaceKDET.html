		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never change your spots
But wanna be spotless
Every step tryna be brave
Humans never wanna stop
Until we can't stop them 
I'd give my last breath to keep you safe
How could we fly with burning wings?
I'll float to you
In my balloon

A thousand eyes
Would never see
I'll float to you
You'll fall to me

I'll float to you
In my balloon

I'll float to you
You'll fall to me

You never change your spots
But wanna be spotless
Every step tryna be brave
Human's never wanna stop
Until we can't stop them 
I'd give my last breath to keep you safe
How could we fly with burning wings?
I'll float to you
In my balloon

A thousand eyes
Would never see
I'll float to you
You'll fall to me

I'll float to you
In my balloon

I'll float to you
You'll fall to me
