		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not the way you lead me by the hand into the bedroom
It's not the way you throw your clothes upon the bathroom floor

Been thinking about ya, I just couldn't wait to see
Fling my arms around ya as we fall in ecstasy

Ooh, sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside, yeah
Ooh, sometimes
It's the broken heart that decides

It's not the way that you caress me, toy with my affection
It's not my sense of emptiness, you fill with your desire

Climb in bed beside me
We can lock the world outside
Touch me, satisfy me
Warm your body next to mine

Ooh, sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside, yeah
Ooh, sometimes
It's the broken heart that decides

Ooh, sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside, yeah
Ooh, sometimes
It's the broken heart that decides

Ooh, sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside
Ooh, sometimes
It's the broken heart that decides

Ooh, sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside, yeah
Ooh, sometimes
It's the broken heart that decides

Ooh, sometimes
The truth is harder than the pain inside, yeah
Ooh, sometimes
It's the broken heart that decides
