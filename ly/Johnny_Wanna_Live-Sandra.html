		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got something on my mind
Makes me sad and makes my cry - oh no
Johnny want to live

Just an ordinary day
An animal will pass away - oh no
Johnny want to live

Who's to say he got no rights
Even not a right to life
Don't know why it leaves you cold
Don't know how to make it show - oh no
Johnny want to live
Johnny want to live

Got to give his skin away
For coats they wear on summerdays - oh no
Johnny want to live

Beauty aid and all the rest
Come directly from a test - oh no
Johnny want to live

Through his eyes i look inside his heart
He can feel like me and you
Can't defend himself cause he can't talk
And this is why i talk you

Johnny isn't just a name
He stands for every creature's pain - oh no
Johnny want to live
Johnny want to live

Go and try to look inside his heart
You can find your own mistakes
Try to hide them thinking he can't talk
But he can read them in your face

I got something on my mind
It makes me sad
And it makes me cry - oh no
Let him live

Tell me why it leaves you cold
I swear
I'm gonna make it show - oh no
Johnny want to live
Johnny want to live
