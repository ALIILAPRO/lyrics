		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said is it time of judgement?
I'm a rolling holy, down the dirty river

In a dream, I heard gabriel's trumpet
Lord and I was blistered
Just a strong out angel

I saw the feet of pilgrims bleeding
I saw whole cities drowning
I saw old hermits dying

A reverie of starlings on my show bird
I'm show bird of a highway
Judgement time is near
Ohoh...
Judgement time is near

Watch those stars above, they're falling
And when the sky is falling
It falls like heaven's rain

She said it's the time of judgement
I'm a rolling holy, down the dirty river

Oho, judgement time is near
Oho, judgement time is near
Oho, judgement time is near
