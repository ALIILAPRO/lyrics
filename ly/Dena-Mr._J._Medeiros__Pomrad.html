		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Dena

I see the sun coming out like dubs
West coast gets love man where have you been
Staying calm with these palms up high
Falling for for the sky like I'm parachuting 
cnd I been feeling Lucky Boy at Huntington with a bundled joy
But I'm aware the 210
Got choppers on the ground plus choppers in the air
Oh yeah that's a pair a shooting
I rap but I aint no "G"
Cal got techs but they aint on me
No I'm technical with the text
Flipping raps into checks with a style back from the 90's
If 5 O's on a G then they paid me well
I'm tryna pull more G's than JPL
I'll be a rocket man who can say he fell
When his pockets on a daily swell

Hey Dena 

Dena everybody tryna steal your sunshine
Don't let anyone bring that shade around 
You just keep your rays in the face of stormy weather  
Summer coming soon so back'em down

Well I got 5 on it when the 210 splits
Right side get the pits left side get the rich
You can swim with the fakes or can drown with the snakes
Both sides share a Lake in the 626
Take your pick man that's on Roscoe's
See'em turn chicken come thinking Dirty Dena wasn't hostile 
Came for the Roses but kept seeing cops though
S.W.c.T. teams helicopters and hearing shots go
Going and it's gone steady tryna get a head like
Jackie Robinson's on the lawn yeah
The city got a crown but it's roses got thorns
cnd now Dena's tryna show me how to put them both on
Thats that sacrifice when you are chosen
To build a life for a child you can see as an old man
Hollywood lights up a scene for a gold man
La La Land aint a dream no man this is Pasadena


It's a slow dance 
With the cousin of sleep they're aint no chance 
Colorado bridge seen suicides and romance
So many lives have been written up in Vromans
You gotta write your script with your own hands

Hey Dena

Dena everybody tryna steal your sunshine
Don't let anyone bring that shade around 
You just keep your rays in the face of stormy weather  
Summer coming soon so back'em down

Dena's for the Mad Men
Pie and burger having
Little ol' Lady
Now Gold line traveling
The home of the Doo Dah
Back to the Future
Where you saw the first moonwalk by Michael Jackson
Don't get it twisted though this city is banging
Them middle fingers twisted yeah this city still banging 
The Hat the Hamlet the Playhouse 
The Lengham they casting but they shooting
Plus they tootin in the cM
When the lights go out at the Laemmle
cnd when the Ice House aint got no comedy 
When the Rose Bowls closed 
cnd I'm on the street late nights like
Hey J who do you wanna be
clone with a coffee up at Conrads
Or on the lawn of the Pavilion as a first time dad
Old Town keeps changing
Nothing stays the same 
But I thank Dena for the time we had

Hey Dena

Dena everybody tryna steal your sunshine
Don't let anyone bring that shade around 
You just keep your rays in the face of stormy weather  
Summer coming soon so back'em down
