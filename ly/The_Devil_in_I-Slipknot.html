		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Undo these chains my friend
I'll show you the rage I've hidden
Perish the sacrament
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven
You and I can't decide which of us was taken for granted
Make amends, some of us are destined to be outlived

Step inside, see the devil in I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your devil anymore

Under the words of men
Something is tempting the father
Where is your will my, friend?
Insatiates never even bother
You and I, wrong or right
Traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light
You're not what you seem

Step inside, see the devil in I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your devil
I'm not your devil anymore

Your station is abandoned
Fooled you 'cause I know what you've done
Sensation, depravation
You should've burned when you turned on everyone

So step inside, see the devil in I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
Step inside, see the devil in I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
Step inside, see the devil in I
You'll realize I'm not your devil anymore
So step inside, step inside
See the devil in I, see the devil in I
