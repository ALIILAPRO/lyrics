		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Diese kleine heimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht
Wir glauben beide
Cette petite île étrange a fait de moi une arme
Nous croyons tous les deux que nous pouvons
L'utiliser pour changer l'élan de cette guerre)

Esta pequeña isla espeluznante me ha convertido en un arma
Ambos creemos que podemos usarla para cambiar el impulso de esta guerra

Welcome back to Trench
Welcome back to Trench

I created this world
To feel some control
Destroy it if I want
So I sing Sahlo Folina
Sahlo Folina
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)
(Wait, what? Wait, what?)

Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react
Actin' gobsmacked, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
I feel like I was just here, same twitchin' in my eyes
Don't sleep on a boy who can't fall asleep twice
In the same night and won't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
Don't hesitate to maybe over compensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
Don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Where am I from? I was born right here, just now
Originated right in front of your eyes
If you can't see, I am Clancy
Prodigal son, done running, come up with Josh Dun
Wanted dead or alive
So now you pick who you serve
You bow to the masses
Get kicked to the curb
For passin' the classes
Half empty, half full, save half for your taxes
Then overtake your former self

I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
Don't hesitate to maybe over compensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
Don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer
But for goodness sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón
Days feel like a perfect length
I don't need them any longer
But for goodness sake
Do the years seem way too short for my soul, corazón
Way too short for my soul, corazón

Earned my stripes, three hundred tracks in my Adidas track jacket
Bless your ear holes while you react
Actin' gobsmacked, don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate

I said I fly by the dangerous bend symbol (wait, what? Wait, what?)
Don't hesitate to maybe over compensate
And then by the time I catch in my peripheral (wait, what? Wait, what?)
Don't hesitate to maybe overcompensate
