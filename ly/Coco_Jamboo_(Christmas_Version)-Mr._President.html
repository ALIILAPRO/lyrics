		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

Here we go, gettin' smooth to the groove
Watching lovely ladies that are smooth as they move
'Cause that's what they say but I can't prove
So turn it up again and watch me move to the groove

As we get close, you whisper, "Coco"
I hold you in my arms and you say "Jamboo"
Scream and shout, turn and say, "Colombo"
Now I gotta go, so coco

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, ayo

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, ayo

That's the way I treat the girls, kinda smooth, see
'Cause there's one man and yo, well that's me, see
So let me show you 'round while you sip your tea, G
But no coco loco boom while I take a pee, Lee

When I hold my baby, she says I do it nicer
I like my chicken with rice and lemonade
And that's what you get when she shouts out "Jamboo"
Now I gotta go, yo, coco

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, sing it, everybody

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, sing it, everybody

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, ayo
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, take my heart
And make me happy

Put me up, put me down
Put my feet back on the ground
Put me up, feel my heart
And make me happy

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, coco jamboo
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, ayo

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, coco jamboo
Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah, ayo

Yah-yah-yah, coco jamboo, yah-yah-yeah
