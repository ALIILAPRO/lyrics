		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you ever make it out of your head?
Do you still swim in your thoughts?
Do you still mistake your flaws for property?
Something that just don't sit right with you
But Heaven knows, Heaven knows
Your wings can't weight you down

Angels make a way somehow
And if we fall, we fall on clouds

Black girl here, black girl with the black girl hair
Took a little sunkiss just to look like this
God sent, you're an angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Heaven wears your halo
They know you're an angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)

I'm a big deal
I get sick and tired of holdin' it in
Rich blood, you can probably see the gold in my skin
I'm more than a girl, won't let the troubles of the world
Come weigh me down

But angels make a way somehow
And if we fall, we fall on clouds

Black girl here, black girl with the black girl hair
Took a little sunkiss just to look like this
God sent, you're an angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Heaven wears your halo
They know you're an angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)

Some might hate and they wait on your fall (oh)
They don't know there's a grace for it all (oh)
My flaws don't make me
Beautiful and real, all you fake cannot compare
Oh, you're perfectly a masterpiece
And all of me, even my scars
Even my scars, yeah

Black girl here, black girl with the black girl hair
Took a little sunkiss just to look like this
God sent, you're an angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Heaven wears your halo
They know you're an angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
Angel (angel)
