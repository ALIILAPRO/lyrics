		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I just want to touch you for your warm inside again
Maybe I just want to let you the sweetest pleasure is me
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like

Are you coming to the moment
When you know your heart can break
I'm inside you
I'm around you

Just want to hear you cry again
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why why but it just makes me feel like

You don't know how much it hurts when you fall asleep in my arms
Before the morning comes
I want to run away, I want to run away
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why

I don't know why why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why why it just makes me feel like
I don't know why why but I love to see you cry
I don't know why why but it makes me feel like
