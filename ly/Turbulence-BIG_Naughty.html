		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got the same scars deep in our hearts
I thought it was worst, but it always goes worse
That's how it works, and that's why it's worth it
Gave us growth, but yeah, it's still gross

We got the same scars deep in our hearts
I thought it was worst, but it always goes worse
That's how it works, and that's why it's worth it
Gave us growth, but yeah, it's still gross
I gave you my all

You gave me your soul, I write it to songs
그게 지금 이거
긴 비행시간에 고민도 했고
난기류를 만나 죽을 뻔도 했어
이촌향도 했어, 내 슬픔들 take your seatbelts off
비빔밥 한 사바리하고 relax on
이름 모를 푸른 구름바다 위에서
바라본 하늘 한 아름 너를 위해서

We got the same scars deep in our hearts
I thought it was worst, but it always goes worse
That's how it works, and that's why it's worth it
Gave us growth, but yeah, it's still gross

We got the same scars deep in our hearts
I thought it was worst, but it always goes worse
That's how it works, and that's why it's worth it
Gave us growth, but yeah, it's still gross

Ayy, ayy, girl, baby, how was your day?
오늘 날씨, 아니, 니 기분은 어때?
오늘도 사회학 교수가 귀찮게 해?
그럼 째고 앉자, 키칠라노 바다 앞에
뭐 어때? 털어나 봐, 토씨까지 나한테
집에 갈 때 나한테 기대어서 잘 때처럼
얼른 들어가, 씻고 누워 빨간 이어폰에
두 귀를 맡겨, 영화나 마저 이어 보게
난 아직도 매일 밤 니 꿈에 헐떡대
행복에 껄떡대, 난 아직도 겁도 없게
너 왜 철들었냬, 물어 자꾸 부끄럽게
왜긴 왜야? 사랑하니까 너를, 시끄럽게

We got the same scars deep in our hearts
I thought it was worst, but it always goes worse
That's how it works, and that's why it's worth it
Gave us growth, but yeah, it's still gross

We got the same scars deep in our hearts
I thought it was worst, but it always goes worse
That's how it works, and that's why it's worth it
Gave us growth, but yeah, it's still gross
I gave you my all
