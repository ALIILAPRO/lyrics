		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me when your ready, we can hit the gas
Hands steady, heart heavy, stay hella sad
You love it already, know it never lasts
Thats breaking glass, can’t take it back (yeah)
Up off another, give me two of that
My heart has been colder, don’t get too attached
You love it already, know it never lasts
Thats breaking glass, can’t take it back (yeah)

Up off another, it’s a triple stack
We never need closure, nothing new with that
All summer not sober, got me seeing black
I love her I know it, ain’t no going back
I been going thru it for my next shit, stressing
Nights got me turning, ain’t no resting
Yes it’s, crazy crossing borders, we finessing
Guess it’s, really not what anyone expected
Lost in your eyes feeling reckless
I try, guess I got a death wish
Got drip from her tongue to her necklace
Caught feels trying to heal through the wreckage (yeah)

Tell me when your ready, we can hit the gas
Hands steady, heart heavy, stay hella sad
You love it already, know it never lasts
Thats breaking glass, can’t take it back (yeah)
Up off another, give me two of that
My heart has been colder, don’t get too attached
You love it already, know it never lasts
Thats breaking glass, can’t take it back (yeah)

We faded, you know it, you ain’t got to ask
We jaded, been coping, you ain’t got to act
Some nights I lose focus, so I ware a mask
We sad but don’t show it, got me throwing cash
And I understand it’s excessive, flexing
Guess it’s getting lonely in the section
Blessings, some how get turned to depression
Stressing, really not what anyone expected
Lost in your eyes feeling reckless
I try, guess I got a death wish
Got drip from her tongue to her necklace
Caught feels trying to heal through the wreckage (yeah)

Tell me when your ready, we can hit the gas
Hands steady, heart heavy, stay hella sad
You love it already, know it never lasts
Thats breaking glass, can’t take it back (yeah)
Up off another, give me two of that
My heart has been colder, don’t get too attached
You love it already, know it never lasts
Thats breaking glass, can’t take it back (yeah)
