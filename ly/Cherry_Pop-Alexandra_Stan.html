		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was this guy and me
I never thought that we could have that chemistry
But he became the one to show me stars in the sky
That light up the night
My fantasy fell into something true
He put a spell on me under the moonlight
And I knew
Now I can stop thinking 'bout that tasted like cherry pop
Pop pop, che-cherry che-cherry pop pop
Pop pop, che-cherry che-cherry pop
Last night we made out
Then we saw the blackout
But it tasted like a cherry pop pop pop
When I look into his eyes
All I see is paradise
You're tasty like a cherry pop pop pop
Never felt like this before
I just want more
Che-cherry che-cherry pop pop pop pop pop pop

And now they're asking me
Are you and him together
How's it gonna be
Or is it just a player playing tricks on your mind
I bet that he's not your kind
My fantasy fell into something true
He put a spell on me under the moonlight
And I knew
Now I can stop thinking 'bout that tasted like cherry pop
Pop pop, che-cherry che-cherry pop 
Pop pop, che-cherry che-cherry pop
Last night we made out
Then we saw the blackout
But it tasted like a cherry pop pop pop
When I look into his eyes
All I see is paradise
You're tasty like a cherry pop pop pop
Never felt like this before
I just want more
Che-cherry che-cherry pop pop pop pop
Pop pop pop

Cherry cherry cherry pop (cherry cherry cherry pop)
Cherry cherry cherry pop (cherry cherry pop)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (whoah)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (ooh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (whoah)
Ooh (ooh)

Cherry pop pop pop
Che-che-cherry pop pop pop
Che-che-cherry pop
Last night we made out
Then we saw the blackout
But it tasted like a cherry pop pop pop
When I look into his eyes
All I see is paradise
You're tasty like a cherry pop pop pop
Never felt like this before
I just want more
Che-cherry che-cherry pop pop pop pop
