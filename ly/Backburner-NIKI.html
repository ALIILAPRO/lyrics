		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't lie, it feels nice that you're calling
You sound sad and alone and you're stalling
And for once, I don't care about what you want
As long as we keep talking (as long as we're talking)
I mean, you got to admit the history's kind of unmatched
Asian Calvinism, we made it out of that
Well, whether we're free of will or predestined
Clearly, I've not learned my lesson even now
Hope He doesn't strike me down (strike me down)

The Goo Goo Dolls are dead to me
The way you should be too
But you bring them up
Along with how much I fucking miss you

Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried
Maybe life's less romantic when I don't wanna die
You'd think I'd be a fast learner
But guess I won't ever mind crisping up on your backburner

(Your backburner)
(Your backburner)
(Your backburner)
(Your backburner)

It's pathetic, but at least you are too
I don't know what to do
I don't like anyone except sometimes you
And now you're sounding like a hurt puppy
You look ugly when you cry
But I'm the one you think to call
How do you feel lucky and appalled at the same time?
After everything you put me through
I somehow still believe in you
Oh

But I know in a week or so
You'll fade away again
And I wish that I cared
Hey, are you still there?
Good

Maybe I'm just not better than this, I haven't tried
'Cause maybe you'll finally choose me after you've had more time
I thought I was a fast learner
But guess I won't ever mind
Guess I won't ever mind
Maybe I blame my mother bleedin' into my stride
Maybe it was my father and his wandering eyes
(It's their fault that) I'll always be in your corner
'Cause I don't feel alive 'til I'm burning on your backburner

(Backburner) oh
(Your backburner)
And I know that it's sad (backburner)
That I settled for the backburner (backburner)
(Backburner) oh
(Backburner)
Guess I won't ever mind (backburner)
Crisping up on your backburner (backburner)
(Backburner) oh
(Your backburner)
As long as you still think of me
(Backburner) oh
(Backburner)
