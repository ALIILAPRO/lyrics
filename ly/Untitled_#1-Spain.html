		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walked away, released from all my crimes
Walked away, released from all my crimes
But I could never hide what I kept inside

Walked away, released from all my sins
Walked away, released from all my sins
But the crudest thing was all my suffering
When I held you that night
I knew it felt so right
I knew it felt so right

Walked away, released from all my crimes
Walked away, released from all my crimes
But I could never hide what I kept inside
