		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we stuck where we can't go back?
Are we stuck where we can't move on?
This regret that we bury deep inside
And now the memories are burning us in time

But maybe
In another moment
In another place and time
Would you feel the same
If I said we'd live forever

(Said we'd live forever) said we'd live forever
(Said we'd live forever) said we'd live forever

Every time that we fell off track
Every time that we ran so far
From the world we created side by side
I see you here and I can't let go
I see you now and it's all I know
It is too soon to let go

But maybe
In another moment
In another place and time
Would you feel the same
If I said we'd live forever

(Said we'd live forever) said we'd live forever
(Said we'd live forever) said we'd live forever

It is too soon to let go
It is too soon to let go

But maybe
In another moment
In another place and time
Would you feel the same
If I said we'd live forever

(Said we'd live forever) said we'd live forever
(Said we'd live forever) said we'd live forever

It is too soon to let go
Said we'd live forever
