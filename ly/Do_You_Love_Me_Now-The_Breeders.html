		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I saw you now 
Could I look in your eyes? 
  
Do you think of me 
Like I dream of you? 
  
Do you wish you were here 
Like I wish I was with you? 
  
You've loved me before 
Do you love me now? 
  
Does love ever end 
When two hearts have torn away? 
Or does it go on 
And beat strong anyway? 
You've loved me before 
Do you love me now? 
  
Come back to me right now! 
C'mon c'mon come back to me right now! 
  
C'mon c'mon come back to me right now! 
C'mon c'mon come on! 
  
You've loved me before 
Do you love me now? 
  
You've loved me before 
Do you love me now?
