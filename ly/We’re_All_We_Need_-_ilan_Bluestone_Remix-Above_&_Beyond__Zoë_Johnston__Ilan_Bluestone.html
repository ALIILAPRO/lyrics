		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me of a place you like to go
You say it will reach out and seize the sorrow
And we always mean to act on what we say
So come on, oh darling now hurry hurry let's go

We're all we need
Oh darling
We're all we need
Ooh darling
Hey we're all we need
Ooh darling
Hey, we're all we need
Ooh darling

I told you of a place that I had been
It was dark and I was supremely alone
No matter now if the compass fails again
'Cause in your love, I built a home

We're all we need
Oh darling
yeah we're all we need
Ooh darling
We're all we need
Oh darling
yeah, we're all we need
Oh darling

hey, we're all we need
hey, we're all we need
hey, we're all we need
hey, we're all we need

We're all we need
Oh darling
hey, we're all we need
Ooh darling
hey, we're all we need
Oh darling
hey, we're all we need
Ooh darling

Most certainly I'm where I'm supposed to be
In a molten sun, with you I am free
Today our hearts won first prize
'Cause we're wise with the feeling
Yeah we're all we need
