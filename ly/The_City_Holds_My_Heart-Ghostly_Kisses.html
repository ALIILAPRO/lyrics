		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe 
What do you want to know?
We've already been over this 
A million times  

Wait   
Though I told you I would be
There when you needed me
Can't pretend to be 
Someone else 
For you  

And I know, I know, I know, I know
There is something missing
Something that was there before
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I'll still love you  
Even worlds apart

The city holds my heart  
Within walls of glass and steel 	
Can't you see I just can't go?
These walls are all I know

The city holds my heart
Like a shell  
I cannot feel surrounds
I want you to go 
I'm scared to tell you so  

Babe, what do you want from me?  
We've already tried everything 
Hold me 
Don't ask me why I still can't leave
This is where I feel at home
This is where my heart always belonged

And I know, I know, I know, I know
I'll still love you
Always in my dreams  

The city holds my heart
Within walls of glass and steel
Can't you see I just can't go?
These walls are all I know

The city holds my heart
Like a shell
I cannot feel surrounds
I want you to go 
I'm scared to tell you so 

Even if you go
You remain a whisper in my dreams
