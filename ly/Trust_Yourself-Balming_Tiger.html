		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't get caught up in your freakin' mind
See outside, in the moment we all passin' time
Baby cry, it's okay to not be alright, huh
Listen to me, listen to me, you are gonna be alright

When you feel like the world is collidin'
Walls up, pretendin' to love the party
Dyin' inside, all the emotions are hidin'
How to live, it's confusin', I know it

Trust yourself, ayy, ayy, ayy
Trust yourself, ayy, ayy, ayy
One step a day, even just by inches
One step a day, closer to your meaning

Trust yourself, ayy, ayy, ayy
Trust yourself, ayy, ayy, ayy
One step a day, even just by inches
One step a day, closer to your meaning, hey

It's okay to feel ashamed by the actions you regret
Trust me, I do this every motherfucking day
Just remember to watch it go away
Hey, just remember to watch it go away

I stopped judgin', and I never felt so free (free, free)
비교를 멈춰 그게 진짜 진리지 (oh, oh)
Double sided sword, I'll catch the 손잡이 (oh, oh)
정렬해, 숨을 멈출 때까지

Don't get caught up in your freakin' mind
See outside, in the moment we all passin' time
Baby cry, it's okay to not be alright, huh
Listen to me, listen to me, you are gonna be alright

Why do you always say to me? I can't do anymore
진입장벽이 있다면 bruh, just kick in the door
여길 떠 I can't trust anyone, forgive me lord (forgive me lord)
So I pack it up 패기로
Hold on a minute, you shouldn't be talkin' that shit

Trust yourself, I wanna say it
Cheers for myself 어떻게? 
나 자신을 위해 어서 pray hard
넌 너를 못 믿었고 결국 삶에게 K.O.
난 나를 믿어 의심치 않지

Time is runnin' out
I mean don't worry about it
넘어지면 어쩔 건데?
You need more passion and self-confidence
기를 모아, 무조건 돼
너를 믿어 like religion 더 깊게
You know I really love me
난 이미 답을 알아냈어, 네게 말해줄 건 오직

Trust yourself, ayy, ayy, ayy
Trust yourself, ayy, ayy, ayy (ayy)
One step a day, even just by inches
One step a day, closer to your meaning

Trust yourself
(Inhale, exhale)
Trust yourself
(Breathe in, breathe out)
Trust yourself
(Believe in your vision)

Trust yourself
Trust yourself

(Nothing else but a moment, now you let it reveal
You gotta let it go, let it go!)
Trust yourself
(Never regret, never forget, yeah)
Trust yourself
(Never regret, never forget, yeah)

Trust yourself
(Never regret, never forget, yeah)
Trust yourself
(Never regret, never forget)
