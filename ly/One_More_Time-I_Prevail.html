		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna wait for tomorrow
I'm gonna say it today
I'm sick of making excuses
I'm sick of being afraid
When all we have is a moment, with so much left to say
Don't wanna wait for tomorrow, I'm gonna say it today

Cause all my life I've tried to hide behind the fear inside
And I can't remember why

Sometimes you gotta go down swinging
Get up, get up feel the kick drum beating
One more time
One more time, tonight
Sometimes you gotta fight that feeling
Get up, get up feel your heart still beating
One more time
One more time, tonight

I know you're chasing tomorrow
But don't give up on today
If you keep making excuses
You'll always stand in your way
When all we have is a moment, with so much left to say
I know you're chasing tomorrow
But don't give up on today

Cause all your life I've tried to hide behind the fear inside
And you can't remember why

Sometimes you gotta go down swinging
Get up, get up feel the kick drum beating
One more time
One more time, tonight
Sometimes you gotta fight that feeling
Get up, get up feel your heart still beating
One more time
One more time, tonight

I don't wanna feel down down down
When nobody's around round round
I don't wanna feel down down down
When nobody's around

I don't wanna feel down down down
When nobody's around round round
I don't wanna feel down down down
When nobody's around

Sometimes you gotta go down swinging
Get up, get up feel the kick drum beating
One more time
One more time, tonight
Sometimes you gotta fight that feeling
Get up, get up feel your heart still beating
One more time
One more time, tonight
