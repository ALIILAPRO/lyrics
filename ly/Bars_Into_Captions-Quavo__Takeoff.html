		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Quavo (Buddah Bless this beat)

Welcome to Atlanta, baby, it's bigger than magic
Where young niggas pull up Lambo' trucks and still trappin' (skrrt)
Only place where you can pull up a bad bitch in traffic
Just keep that fire on you (baow)
Won't catch me lackin' (nah)
I put that shit on, lil' nigga, this that real fashion
Now every time they see the Huncho, they like, "Shawty havin'" (gone)
We too player with the ball, babe, we all passin' (player)
At the hour, wall-to-wall, she a hookah savage (hookah)
Yellow gold ropes laid up before the karats (ice)
Havin' motion, havin' too motion, we too active (woo)
Turn my savage up (up)
Nigga, 'cause the streets get nasty
When P signed me, I seen millions in the garbage bag (woo)
Just like Diddy in my city, makin' them bands, can't quit
Then put a Rollie on his wrist that I was cookin' some grams with
Think I'm bullshittin'? (Oh)
Come down to the city and it's lit
All these hoes thick (woo)
We gon' fuck 'em all and get rich

So quit worryin' 'bout a bitch and get your bag, lil' buddy (oh, yeah)
When you see this douple cup, you got to know that it's muddy (mud)
And I ain't goin' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for somethin' (go)
And she ain't gon' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for money (oh)
Now this her first time in Atlanta
Bounce that ass for the camera
Where your hammer? (Baow)
You know it ain't shit sweet off in Atlanta (no)
This the city (woo)
You know this where the trappers turn to rappers (trappers)
Don't tolerate no cappers
Turn these bars into captions (captions)

And we are
Creatures that come from another planet (creature)
The rocket ship take off, I'm 'bout to land it (take off)
I gotta stick, the switches automatic (brr)
Ain't never average, keep that shh in the attic (let's get it)
Don't tell me lies
Look at your neck, your chest, your breasts
Tell me everythin' that's on your nasty mind (don't lie to me)
Your friends be tellin' me that you tellin' 'em 'bout the D
You ridin' your tank on E, so how you drive? (Skrrt)
I love who you are
Hate that you can't
You're so Anne Frank
Let's take a trip to Greece and hide out for a week (week)
She got a body, petite physique
I went and got me a new Phillippe
I'ma make her cunt squirt, skeet-skeet (splash)
She ain't gotta wrap her hair up in my silk sheets (hell nah)
Smash and hit the block, like what the lick read? (Talk to me)
Brand new AP straight out the factory (AP)
When I'm on stage, and at my shows, bitches, they grabbin' me (get 'em)
Yeah, I'm the rocket, they callin' me, "Takeoff"
How is you passin' me? (How)
You barely see me
But if you do, somebody ask for me
He in the 'Cat, I'm in the 'Gatti
That shit ain't fast to me (ha)
If I pay the rent and get her a bag, she give the cat to me (me)

So quit worryin' 'bout a bitch and get your bag, lil' buddy (oh, yeah)
When you see this douple cup, you got to know that it's muddy (mud)
And I ain't goin' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for somethin' (go)
And she ain't gon' for nothin' (go)
Unless she goin' for money (oh)
Now this her first time in Atlanta
Bounce that ass for the camera
Where your hammer? (Baow)
You know it ain't shit sweet off in Atlanta (no)
This the city (woo)
You know this where the trappers turn to rappers (trappers)
Don't tolerate no cappers
Turn these bars into captions (captions)
