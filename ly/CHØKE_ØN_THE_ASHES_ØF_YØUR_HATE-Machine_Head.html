		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faithless weaponized, mass corrupted lies, poison everything
False conspiracy, soulless enemy, dead for all to see
Look around and see the great decay
Violence turns the fearful into slaves

Choke on the ashes of your hate
Now it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside it's rotting cage

Sick society, lost in vanity, paid to slowly die
Lifeless reprobate, soul incarcerate, cutting like a knife
Shoving their vile venom down our throats like Klonopin
Force feed their lies back like medicine

Choke on the ashes of your hate
Now it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside it's rotting cage

Chaos cratering, riots, anarchy
Lawlessness abounds, all of us hell-bound
We're the damaged ones, left with the damage done
We don't care no more, this is fucking war

Chaos cratering, riots, anarchy
Lawlessness abounds, all of us hell-bound
We're the damaged ones, left with the damage done
We don't care no more, this is fucking war

Mutator, bastard
Bow to your master
Dead men, no worry
Welcome hell's fury

Mock and penalize, vex and victimize, starving refugee
Race identity, burning you and me, cinders char the free
Lowering like a shackled animal
Day of slaughter only time will tell

Choke on the ashes of your hate
Now it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside it's rotting cage

Choke on the ashes of your hate
Now it's far too late
Look around and see, the great hypocrisy
Glittering inside it's rotting cage, go
