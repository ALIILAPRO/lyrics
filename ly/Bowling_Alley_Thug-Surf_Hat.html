		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hideaway your money
Nothing's safe from me

I'm a cool, cool bowling alley thug
Modern Casanova with an ordinary mug
Did you think that they'd talk about us
Every time we go home

I'm a tidal wave
You wash away, good luck in the break

I'm a cool, cool bowling alley thug
Modern Casanova with an ordinary mug
Did you think that they'd talk about us
Every time we go home

I'm a cool, cool bowling alley thug
Distant second cousin of your unrequited love
Around the edges I might look a little rough
But I just need a hug

I'm a slick Rick, smoking my cigar
Black fingernails match the carpets of your heart
Not as cool as we once was, I guess it's time to go home

I'm a cool, cool bowling alley thug
I'm a cool, cool bowling alley thug

I'm a cool, cool bowling alley thug
Modern Casanova with an ordinary mug
Did you think that they'd talk about us
Every time we go home
