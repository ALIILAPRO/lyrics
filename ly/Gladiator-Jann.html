		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Welcome to the party, say hi to everybody
Paid for by Martini but they're sippin' on Bacardi
Body's more than just a flesh
You can sell it for success
What's your price? What's your address?
We can finish at my place

Ever been to Bali?
I really need some sun
Such a shame 'bout that tsunami
I'll have to go to Cali
I can get you dressed
Wrap your body in excess
Give them something to obsess over
You'll love it when I

Give it to you, leave you wanting more
I know your addiction's attention
Let's start a show
Is it everything and more than you were hoping for?
Show us something we ain't never seen before

Smash your competition, baby
Show us some good entertainment
Victory's your only payment
Gladiator, gladiator

Welcome to the party
I know it's kind of funny
That everyone is acting like they know you personally
Just play along, be nice and all
You won't get far being on your own

They've all been dying for a little drama
Their favorite stars getting out of coma
To fill the news with 90's nostalgia
It will take more than just a pretty face to top that

Give it to you, leave you wanting more
I know your addiction's attention
Let's start a show
Is it everything and more than you were hoping for?
Show us something we ain't never seen before

Smash your competition, baby
Show us some good entertainment
Victory's your only payment
Gladiator, gladiator

Fake it till you make it
Mask on, never take it off
Wear it till wearing it feels natural
Whatever you tell yourself, it's not true
Power's what I make it
Pixels like it's 8-bit
I'm picking your new favorite
You buy it and I'll savor it

You buy it and I'll savor it
You buy it and I'll savor it
You buy it and I'll savor it
Buy it and I'll savor it
You buy it and I'll savor it
