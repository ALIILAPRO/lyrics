		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by

I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice, I belong to your life
Because I will live to love you someday
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away

And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

(I'll fly with you)
(I'll fly with you)

Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh baby, every day and every night
Well, I said everything's gonna be alright

And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
