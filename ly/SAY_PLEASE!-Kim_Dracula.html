		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shout out to the devil

Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say? Ay
Well you know what I mean
Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say? Ay
What an awful kind of day

Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say?
Say please
Nu mă, nu mă iei
Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say? Ay
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay‐ay‐ay‐ay)

If you wanna stop me then go buy me a coffee
'Cause I'm a little bitty tired from the socking and blocking
You better get your head up locking on a pocket of nothing
A pretty pity party packet pulling buckets of fucking

(Blood) it's so much fun
Now I am one with the sun
I'll load the gun
Sounds like a drum

Pum-pum-paparum, pum-pum-pum-pum
Pum-pum-paparum, pum-pum-pum-pum

(Dove) innocent dove
You've got a hole in your lung
Hell of a drug
Death from above

So I got a text from God
God texted me
He said he just wanted to talk
I blocked his number

Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say? Ay
Well you know what I mean
Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say? Ay
What an awful kind of day

Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say?
Say please
Nu mă, nu mă iei
Ay, ay ay, what the fuck you say? Ay
(Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay‐ay‐ay‐ay)

(No thoughts, just kill)
Perverse, my eyes
(Kill)
Murder suicide
(Kill)
Perverse are my eyes
(Kill)
