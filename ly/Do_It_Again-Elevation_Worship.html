		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking around these walls
I thought by now they'd fall
But You have never failed me yet
Waiting for change to come
Knowing the battle's won
For You have never failed me yet

Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You've never failed me yet

I know the night won't last
Your Word will come to pass
My heart will sing Your praise again
Jesus You're still enough
Keep me within Your love
My heart will sing Your praise again

Oh yes it will
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You never failed
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You never failed me yet

Never failed me yet
Ohh, ohh

I've seen You move
You move the mountains
And I believe
I'll see You do it again
You made a way
Where there was no way
And I believe
I'll see You do it again

I've seen You move
You move the mountains
And I believe
I'll see You do it again
You made a way
Where there was no way
And I believe
I'll see You do it again

I've seen You move
You move the mountains
And I believe
I'll see You do it again
You made a way
Where there was no way
And I believe
I'll see You do it again
I'll see You do it again
Oh move again, ohh

Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You never failed (oh)
Your promise still stands
Great is Your faithfulness, faithfulness
I'm still in Your hands
This is my confidence, You never failed me yet

Oh You've never failed me yet
I never will forget
You've never failed me yet
I never will forget
