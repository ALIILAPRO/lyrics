		  (Jess, your beat on the radio)
Ayo

There I go again kickin' some dumb flow
Think they Harajuku, they just some young ho (bahm, bahm)
Fronto with the Raw, how the gumbo roll
My nigga with the pot, it ain't gumbo though (bahm, bahm)
Switchy on my hippy, sound like drumroll, ho
I paid a couple bands, let the drumrolls go
Switchin' up the plans if that dumb ho go
We out in SoHo, you just so-so, ho (bahm, bahm)
Man, y'all know that bitch is wack, y'all gon' tell her or not?
Y'all report everything, y'all be tellin' a lot (bahm, bahm)
'Bout to tell my niggas, "Chill," 'fore they snap like chat
Pussy and the crown, everything intact (mm)

They say my price ridiculous, I don't like them bitches
Pussy tight and vicious, hit them lights to lick this (oop) (bahm, bahm)
Screamin', "Fuck the opposition", totin' Glocks and switches
Used to pots and dishes (brr) (bahm, bahm)
Got the Bentley 'cause that's just tradition
Made him drop his bitches just from pussy pictures (bahm, bahm)
Made him eat me, we don't swap positions
We don't talk on phones, don't put the cops in business (bahm, bahm)

Tryna keep my cool so don't be blowin' my high
Bitches ain't blowin' up, they only blowin' the guys (bahm, bahm)
Heavy on the side, everything is a vibe
I've been here for a minute, just enjoyin' the ride (bahm, bahm)
Gabbana denim boots all the way to the thighs
'Fit cost a grip, hope you enjoyin' the fly
A bitch been sittin' back, just lettin' you bitches lie
Throwin' your likkle shots, I've been lettin' them slide (bahm, bahm)
Me against you, you know who they gon' decide
Tryin' to be down, application denied (bahm, bahm)
He could tell this pussy good by the look in my eye
Don't ever run up on me 'less you lookin' to die (mm)

They say my price ridiculous, I don't like them bitches
Pussy tight and vicious, hit them lights to lick this (oop) (bahm, bahm)
Screamin', "Fuck the opposition", totin' Glocks and switches
Used to pots and dishes (brr) (bahm, bahm)
Got the Bentley 'cause that's just tradition
Made him drop his bitches just from pussy pictures (bahm, bahm)
Made him eat me, we don't swap positions
We don't talk on phones, don't put the cops in business (bahm, bahm)
