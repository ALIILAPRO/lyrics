		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you ready?

You call me on the phone
I act like nothing's going on
We're driving in my car
I pretend that you don't turn me on
(Ah ah ah) you sexy thing
Yeah you know it yeah
(Ah ah ah) you move around now you show it

I'm not in love
It's just a fase that I'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
But don't go running away

It's almost three AM
I'm hoping that you don't let go
You're moving in so close
I'm trying not to lose control
(Ah ah ah) you sexy thing
Yeah you know it yeah
(Ah ah ah) you move around now you show it

I'm not in love
It's just a phase that I'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
Don't go running away
Oh I'm not in love
I try to tell myself all the time
I just can't help how I feel tonight
So don't go running away (yeah)

I'm not in love yeah yeah
I'm not in love
I'm not in love (give it to me now)
I'm not in love (break it down)
(Ah ah ah) you sexy thing
Yeah you know it
(Ah ah ah) you move around yea you show it

I'm not in love
It's just a phase that I'm going through
I'm always looking for something new
Don't go running away
Oh I'm not in love
I try to tell myself all the time
I just can't help how I feel tonight
So don't go running away (I'm not in love)

I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
