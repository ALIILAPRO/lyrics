		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a heart but it don't beat
I got a song that I can't sing
I gotta wait for you alone

I gotta love that I can't chase
The kinda mystery won't fade
I gotta wait for you alone

And I'm wasting away

You've taken everything that I want
'Til there's nothing left of me
And there's no one left to be

You've changing everything that I need
'Cause there's nowhere left to hide
When there's nothing to believe

Would you leave me here behind
Would you love to watch me cry
Would you like to fly away

I can show you the truth
If you only let me loose
If you told me what you need

And I'm fading away

You've taken everything that I want
'Til there's nothing left of me
And there's no one left to be

You've changing everything that I need
'Cause there's nowhere left to hide
When there's nothing to believe

And I'm wasting away
And I'm fading away

You've taken everything that I want
Til there's nothing left of me
And there's no one left to be

You've changing everything that I need
'Cause there's nowhere left to hide
When there's nothing to believe

And I'm wasting away

'Til there's nothing left of me
And there's no one left to be

And I'm fading away

'Cause there's nowhere left to hide
When there's nothing to believe

Would you leave me here behind
Would you love to watch me cry
Would you like to fly away

I can show you the truth
If you only let me loose
If you told me what you need
