		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can remember swimming in December
Heading for the city lights in 1975
We share in each other
Nearer than father
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

For each every other
The feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven' 
Got lost in your eyes

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try (I know I try)
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try (I know I try)
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now? (Believing now)

Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we'd energized
Lie in the sand and visualize
Like it's '75 again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try (I know I try)
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now? (Believing now)

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try (I know I try)
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now? (Believing now)

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try (I know I try)
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now? (Believing now)

I can't do well when I think you're gonna leave me
But I know I try (I know I try)
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now? (Believing now)
