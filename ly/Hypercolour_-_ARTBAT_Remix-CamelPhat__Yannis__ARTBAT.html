		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving on the endless, open roads
All the places that I used to know
Running through the endless, open blue to
Hypercolour feeling taking hold

Driving through the endless, open blue to
All the places that I used to know
Smoke rings running through my mind when
Visions in mind start to grow

How I feel when I'm whole again
How I feel when I'm whole again

Driving on through the endless, open road to
All the places that I used to know
Where hypercolour feeling when I go back again

How I feel when I'm whole again
How I feel when I'm whole again

Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
(How I feel when I'm whole again)
Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
(How I feel when I'm whole again)
Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
(How I feel when I'm whole again)
(How I feel when I'm whole again)

Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind
Endless, open wide road running through the sky
Hypercolour blue and the summer in your mind

How I feel when I'm whole again
How I feel when I'm whole again
