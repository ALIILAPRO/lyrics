		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

And if we should die tonight
We should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall, then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screaming out

And I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burning the trees
I see fire hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire, oh, you know I saw a city burning (fire)
And I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)
And I see fire, ooh-ooh-ooh (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainside
