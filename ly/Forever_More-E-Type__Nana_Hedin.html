		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why is it that you are there when
I am not awake
Where do you go when I'm here
I still can sense your ache

I U FIRE
I am entombed

I can't leave when i know that you need me
Why can't you please see
That you have to let me go
When you call me amazing
I wanna stay forever more

I can't leave when I know that you see me
That you believe me
But you will have to let me go
Don't you call me amazing
Cause I can't stay forever more

I can't leave when I know that you need me
I want to stay
But I have to go

I can't leave when i know that you need me
Why can't you please see
That you have to let me go
When you call me amazing
I wanna stay forever more

I can't leave when I know that you see me
That you believe me
But you will have to let me go
Don't you call me amazing
Cause I can't stay forever more
