		<p>
		  Body on my mind
Gotta body on my mind
Body on my mind
Gotta body on my mind

Tell me would you follow if I left here
I wanna be the one that takes you home
We both know the rules were made for breakin'
'Cause I know, it's for sure, when we we're alone, yeah

Like the way you feel
You give me everything and more
Touchin' on each other
Got 'till daylight to explore
I don't want no other
I'm addicted to your love
And there's no signs of slowing down
I wanna feel the rush

Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your, I got your body on my mind

When you're in control you know my weakness
Even though your back's agains the wall
I can feel the scratches gettin' deeper
When you scream out my name
You want more, yeah

Like the way you feel
You give me everything or more
Touchin' on each other
Got till, daylight to explore
I don't want no other
I'm addicted to your love
And there's no sign I'm slowing down
I wanna feel the rush

Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your, I got your body on my mind

Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind

Body
Your body, your body on my mind
Your body, your body, your body on my mind
Your body, your body, your body on my mind
You got, you got, you got

Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your, I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your body on my mind
Body on my mind
I got your, I got your body on my mind
