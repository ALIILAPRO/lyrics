		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're used to fighting at the speed of sound
But now each time you try you hit the ground
Held by the legacy behind you

When wiki says you're still around fifteen
But time goes by, green hill is not that green
You're not a tape and no one can rewind you

Is that you
A hero with no rings in his hand?
Why so blue?
You saved the world, but can't save on rent

You run so fast to escape from the pain
But heavy thoughts keep on scrapping your brain, you're
Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
You lose control on the slightest turn
No time to live, no time to learn, you're
Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties, yeah

Gotta take it slow

Now you don't get to see your friends at all
One babysits and won't return your call
Another works so hard he starts to stammer

Dust off your old Dreamcast, go catch some frogs
And let your stomach rust from chilli dogs
Until your wife gets home and draws her hammer

Is that you
Still gaining speed for more bonus points?
It's no use
The doctor said it's bad for your joints

You run so fast to escape from the pain
But heavy thoughts keep on scrapping your brain, you're
Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Your cardiologist is praying and hoping
You're lying there with your heart wide open
Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties, yeah

Gotta take it slow

You grind another rail
But they're still on your tail
You rush into your dirty crushing thirties
They chase you like a truck
You're running out of luck
You rush into your dirty crushing thirties
A city from which there's no escape

You regret
Past failures they rub in your face
You forget
Life's not an endless challenging race
Still that's you
Some changes you just have to embrace
Staying true
And moving on at your own pace

Your MRI came in but you're afraid of
Finding out exactly what you're made of
Crushing in your thirties!
You run so fast to escape from the pain
But heavy thoughts keep on scrapping your brain, you're
Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties, yeah
You lose control on the slightest turn
No time to live and no time to learn, you're
Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties, yeah

Gotta take it slow

Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties
Gotta take it slow

Crushing in your thirties
Crushing in your thirties

Whoa, crush it
