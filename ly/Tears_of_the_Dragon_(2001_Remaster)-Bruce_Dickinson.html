		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For too long now, there were secrets in my mind 
For too long now, there were things I should have said 
In the darkness I was stumbling for the door 
To find a reason, to find the time, the place, the hour 

Waiting for the winter sun, and the cold light of day 
The misty ghosts of childhood fears 
The pressure is building, and I can't stay away 

I throw myself into the sea 
Release the wave, let it wash over me 
To face the fear I once believed 
The tears of the dragon, for you and for me 

Where I was, I had wings that couldn't fly 
Where I was, I had tears I couldn't cry 
My emotions frozen in an icy lake 
I couldn't feel them until the ice began to break 

I have no power over this, you know I'm afraid 
The walls I built are crumbling 
The water is moving, I'm slipping away

I throw myself into the sea 
Release the wave, let it wash over me 
To face the fear I once believed 
The tears of the dragon, for you and for me 

Slowly I awake, slowly I rise 
The walls I built are crumbling 
The water is moving, I'm slipping away

I throw (I throw) myself (myself) into the sea 
Release the wave, let it wash over me 
To face (to face) the fear (the fear) I once believed 
The tears of the dragon, for you and for me 

I throw (I throw) myself (myself) into the sea 
Release the wave, let it wash over me 
To face (to face) the fear (the fear) I once believed 
The tears of the dragon, for you and for me
