		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a scream inside, the one you just can't hide
The sound so deafening, you can't hear yourself think
As real as real can get
Keeping my heart in check, from feeling anything but my own apathy
Again, again

It's creeping up on me
Making it harder to breathe

We're all under pressure
Can't stand the weather
For the worse and not for the better
Please, this ain't the way to live
Something's got to give
We forgive but don't forget it, no

Another day, another battle
We all have a cage to rattle
This just might be the death of me
Might be the death of me

It's reached a fever pitch
I'm living proof of it
I find it hard to cope, without a thread of hope
Blood is thicker then water
But love is even stronger
Hold out a little longer
Until we found ourselves
Again, again

It's creeping up on me
Making it harder to breathe

We're all under pressure
Can't stand the weather
For the worse and not for the better
Please, this ain't the way to live
Something's got to give
We forgive but don't forget it, no

Another day, another battle
We all have a cage to rattle
This just might be the death of me
Might be the death of me
Another day, another battle
We all have a cage to rattle
This just might be the death of me
Might be the death of me

Like a scream inside, the one you just can't hide
The sound so deafening, you can't hear yourself think
As real as real can it
Keeping my heart in check from feeling anything
Making it harder to breathe

We're all under pressure
Can't stand the weather
For the worse and not for the better
Please, this ain't the way to live
Something's got to give
We forgive but don't forget it, no

Another day, another battle
We all have a cage to rattle
This just might be the death of me
Might be the death of me

Another day, another battle
We all have a cage to rattle
This just might be
Yeah, this might be the death of me
