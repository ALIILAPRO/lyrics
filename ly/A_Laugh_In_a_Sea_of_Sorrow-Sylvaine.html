		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Troubles way you down
But still you put on a smile
Try your
Best to keep things right
But know that your heart won't be
Satisfied

You hide behind a mask
You made
Out of fear for them
But it won't take long
Before it breaks
Fractured
Shattered

Troubles way you down
But still you put on a smile
Try your
Best to keep things right
But know that your heart won't be
Satisfied

Don't close your eyes and drown in pain
Open them up
Let the light in
Even though the outcome looks dark
Embrace life
Fill it with elation

One day
Things will be different for you
Things will change
Life isn't fair
You haven't had much luck
But thru grief comes bliss

Troubles way you down
But still you put on a smile
Troubles way you down
But still you put on a smile
Don't give up
Continue the fight
And know that your heart
Will be satisfied
Your heart will be satisfied with time
