		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate love
It's a bitch sometimes
Mama, I'm sorry for using that word
But I only use it when it applies
I hate love
It's a cruel reminder
Even when I know it's bad for me
These memories fill my mind

Why do you smell so good?
You know I love that cologne
Why do I want what I shouldn't
Why can't I leave it alone?
Hangin' on to the good as I wipe the slate clean
I know I shouldn't, but you know, lately
I hate love
(I hate love) (hey, hey)

Beatin' my head against the wall
Little by little, you took it all
Love's no friend of mine
Countin' your blessings on my back
Livin' your best life, livin' fast
Love, you're out of time

I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
Ooh

I hate love
And "The Notebook" lied
"It's Complicated" is more like what happens
So you can keep Gosling and I'll take Steve Martin
I hate love
And all its shine
Not all that glitters is gold
And then sometimes love can leave you behind

Why does it hurt so much
When you know it's the right thing?
Why do I crave your touch?
Love is so damn blinding
Hangin' on to the good as I wipe the slate clean
I know I shouldn't, but you know, lately
I hate love
(I hate love) (hey, hey)

Beatin' my head against the wall (beatin' my head against the wall)
Little by little, you took it all
Love's no friend of mine
Countin' your blessings on my back (countin' your blessings on my back)
Livin' your best life, livin' fast
Love, you're out of time (time)

I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
Ooh
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
Ooh

Nothin' left here but a mess
I played the fool, yes, I confess
I kinda did this to myself
Love, you won this round
Love, I'm on the ground
Love, I'm empty now
So I'm tappin' out

Beatin' my head against the wall
Little by little, you took it all
Love's no friend of mine
Countin' your blessings on my back (countin' your blessings on my back)
Livin' your best life, livin' fast
Love, you're out of time

I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
Ooh
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
I hate love (I hate love)
Ooh
