		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Je suis désolé
Lo siento
Ik ben droevig
Sono spiacente
Perdóname

I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before

I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
(I've listened to your stories)
You're not half the man you'd like to be

I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
We stayed because I made it so convenient
Don't explain yourself you'll never see

Gomen nasai
Mujhe maaf kardo
przepraszam
Slihah
Forgive me

Sorry

I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before

I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before
And I can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'
I've seen it all before
And I can't take it anymore

Don't explain yourself cause talk is cheap
(I don't wanna hear)
(I don't wanna know )
(Please don't say you're sorry)
There's more important things than hearing you speak
(I've heard it all before)
(And I can take care of myself)
I don't wanna hear
I don't wanna know
Please don't say 'forgive me'

(I've heard it all before)
(I've heard it all before)
(I've heard it all before)
