		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A train in the distance
I hear the whistle
A lonely tune calling
Telling where the wind is blowing

At the station
An army's waiting
Spend my whole life not growing
Now the whole world is coming

I don't know why we're fighting
I just know that we're going

A chip on my shoulder
Everyone's getting older
Heroes die young, that's fine
I'm still a child inside

Kid you are a soldier now
The wind upon which all his words ride out
Can't kill and drag us down
With crown and guns we'll keep our fortress strong

The best of the greatest
The greatest but few
Those doomed to be heroes
The King wants you!
The King wants you!

Sixteen years, my mother's son
Now a big boy wielding guns
Marching, falling, getting up
Never knew how to stop
Wrote a letter
Said things are better
Taught me how to fight and die
I wish I knew how to live and lie

I don't know where we're going
It's better to go without knowing

I'm ready and willing
Literally make a killing
Dead today, it's all the same
As long as someone knows my name

Kid you are a soldier now
The wind upon which all his words ride out
Can't kill and drag us down
With crown and guns we'll keep our fortress strong

The best of the greatest
The greatest but few
Those doomed to be heroes
The King wants you!
The King wants you!

(The King wants you)
(The King wants you)

Left, right, left
Left, right, left
Look to the King
All eyes on the King
All hail the King

The best of the greatest
The greatest but few
Those doomed to be heroes
The King wants you!
The King wants you!
The King wants you!
The King wants you!
