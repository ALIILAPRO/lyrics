		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, she said in triumph
Oh, she said to me
"Baby, you're the one"
"Baby, you're the one"
Oh, she said in triumph
Oh, she said to me
"Baby, you're the one"
"Baby, you're the one for me"

And I can't
Seem to figure out
Why I'm so in love
And I can't
Seem to figure out
Why I'm so in love

Whoa, she said in triumph
Whoa, she said to me
"Baby, you're the one"
"Baby, you're the one"
Oh, she said in triumph
Whoa, she said to me
"Baby, you're the one"
"Baby, you're the one for me"

Whoa
Oh, she said in triumph
Oh, she said to me
"Baby, you're the one"
"Baby, you're the one"
Oh, she said in triumph
Oh, she said to me
"Baby, you're the one"
"Baby, you're the one for me"
