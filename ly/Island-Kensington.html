		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to blame
I just want to leave this horrid place the way I came
But here we are again

I don't want to wait
For another wave to come and rule another day

I don't want to stay
I just want to wash away this vile and awful taste
But here we are again

Got nothing more to say
Only want to leave it and not seek for it again

And I'll be an island
And the shore where I stand
Can be reached by more than waves
I told my sharks

That I need an island
For I know the violence
And I'll make the same mistakes
Again

I don't want a flame
I don't want to risk a fire that leaves a toxic waste
But here we are again

And I don't want to play
Only want to breathe again
Be free and let it end

And I'll be an island
And the shore where I stand
Can be reached by more than waves
I told my sharks

And I need an island
If it turns to violence
Then I swear I'll drift away
I cross my heart

All will in time mend
When the moment is right will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and

All will in time mend
When the moment is right will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and

All will in time mend
When the moment is right will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and

All will in time mend
When the moment is right will the feeling die?
Who am I inside then?
When I know when I fight all I want is hide and

And I'll be an island
And the shore where I stand
Can be reached by more than waves
I told my sharks

That I need an island
If it turns to violence
Then I swear I'll drift away
I cross my heart

I know my heart
I know my heart
I know my heart
I sold my heart 

I don't want to blame
I just want to leave this horrid place the way I came
But here we are again
