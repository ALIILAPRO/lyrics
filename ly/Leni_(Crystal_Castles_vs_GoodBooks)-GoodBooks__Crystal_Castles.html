		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To believe

There are times when I will need you

Times when, I will need you
There are times when, you're not around

To believe

Times when, I will need you
There are times when, you're not around
There are times when I will need you
There are times when, you're not around

Need, need, need, need
Need, need, need, need

Need

To believe

Times when, I will need you
There are times when, you're not around
Times when, I will need you
There are times when, you're not around

And I'm losing my patience
I will love her, from the grave

Times when I will need you
Times when, ah ah ah ah

Times when,

Might as well
