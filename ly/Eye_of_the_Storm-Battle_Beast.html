		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The dark clouds are gathering
Chaos entwined
Thunder and lightning
I need shelter tonight

The edge of what I can endure
Been there, riding through the storm, in the snow
Must go, flee before the fall
To the place, where I can feel the love
Through the cold

My heaven, the eye of the Storm
The place I want to go
Serene and beautiful
My place to rest, my heart and soul
My heaven, the eye of the Storm
Shrouded by the fog
Protected from the cold
Where it's warm, where I'll endure

The light keeps on burning
As the storm rages on
It's time for hope and learning
A golden future unfolds

Enough, the past exists no more
The pain, the darkness in my soul, finally gone
Carry on, escape the masquerade
Get away, before it's just too late
Break the chains

My heaven, the eye of the storm
The place I want to go
Serene and beautiful
My place to rest, my heart and soul
My heaven, the Eye of the Storm
Shrouded by the fog
Protected from the cold
Where it's warm, where I'll endure

My heaven, the eye of the Storm
The place I want to go
Serene and beautiful
My place to rest, my heart and soul
My heaven, the eye of the Storm
Shrouded by the fog
Protected from the cold
Where it's warm, where I'll endure

My heaven, the eye of the Storm
The place I want to go
Serene and beautiful
My place to rest, my heart and soul
My heaven, the eye of the Storm
Shrouded by the fog
Protected from the cold
Where it's warm, where I'll endure
Yeah
