		<p>
		  Ah, get on the floor and dance
Ah, on the floor and dance

So get on the floor
And dance with me (dance with me)
I love the way you shake your thing
Especially (especially)

There's a chance for dancin'
All night long
There's a chance for groovin'
And it will be soothin'
With a song

Then why don't you just dance across the floor?
'Cause there's a chance for chances
And the chance is choosin'
And I sure would like just to groove with you

So get on the floor, woo (get on the floor and)
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing (on the floor and)
Especially (woo)
So get on the floor, woo (get on the floor and)
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl (on the floor and)
Especially

No need for rejection
Determined to be
Gonna groove, gonna move ya
Gonna say things to you
Just wait and see

Then why don't you just dance across the floor?
'Cause there's a chance for choices
And it's you I'm choosin'
And I sure would like just to groove with you 

So get on the floor, woo (get on the floor and)
And dance with me
I love the way you shake your thing (on the floor and)
Especially
So get on the floor (get on the floor and)
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl (on the floor and)
Especially

Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, oww
Won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get down, won't you go'n get down
Won't you go'n get (woo)

So get on the floor, haha, woo
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl
Especially (hold up)
So get on the floor
And dance with me
I love the way you shake that thing, girl
Especially (woo)

Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down (dance with me)
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down
Get up, won't you go'n get down
Shake your body, won't you go'n get down (especially)
