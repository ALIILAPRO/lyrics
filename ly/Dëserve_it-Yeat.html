		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Wake up, F1lthy) let's go, let's go, yeah, yeah
I deserve it, yeah (deserve it)
I was walkin' 'round the mall
Went and bought a new turban, yeah, yeah, yeah (I bought a new turban)
One of my bitches told me that I deserve it, yeah (you should have it)
Called up my jeweler, got a new chain and that bitch perfect, yeah (Italian gold)
Now that bitch pull up and eat me like McFlurries
I got mil's on top of mil's, I bought a new Urus
Yeah, told 'em watch they tone, why the hell y'all got courage? (Yeah, shut up)
Yeah, I done blocked this bitch, I don't know, I did it on purpose (yeah, shut up)

I don't give a fuck 'bout the 'Gram, yeah
They don't really know who I am, yeah
Big body, got me the Lamb', yeah
Everything easy, a layup, yeah (skrrt)
I spent ten bands on a bag, band on my shoes, I was chillin' in Rodeo (yeah)
Yeah, my bitch pulled up, she suckin' my dick all day, paint her face like mayo
And all my brothers, they know if they locked in a jam
I'ma get 'em, I'm payin' they bail (yeah)
I just been shippin' this Za' in the mail
shippin' that kale, it's all for sale, yeah
I'm finna do it myself, yeah, I don't really need no help, yeah
Perc' got me slow like snail (yeah), X got my body all pale, yeah
Just left the garage inside the Tonka, I hit Chanel (let's go)
My bitch fell in love with me, we ain't even met, yeah (yeah, yeah)
We some real rich boys, we on private jets, yeah
We some real rockstars, we don't have respect, yeah
I just wake up in the morning, count up all my checks (hunnids)
I already did all the shit I could, I don't even know what's next

(Wake up, F1lthy) let's go, let's go, yeah, yeah
I deserve it, yeah (deserve it)
I was walkin' 'round the mall
Went and bought a new turban, yeah, yeah, yeah (I bought a new turban)
One of my bitches told me that I deserve it, yeah (you should have it)
Called up my jeweler, got a new chain and that bitch perfect, yeah (Italian gold)
Now that bitch pull up and eat me like McFlurries
I got mil's on top of mil's, I bought a new Urus
Yeah, told 'em watch they tone, why the hell y'all got courage? (Yeah, shut up)
Yeah, I done blocked this bitch, I don't know, I did it on purpose (yeah, shut up)
