		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness 
And you may find a friend

I knew a man that I did not care for 
And then one day this man gave me a call
We sat and talked about things on our mind
And now this man, he is a friend of mine

Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness 
And you may find a friend

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

Don't be afraid of love, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid to love, listen to me
Everybody needs a little love
Everybody needs somebody (don't be afraid, don't be afraid to love)
That they can be thinking of, now reach out

Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness
Reach out in the darkness 
And you may find a friend

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
That people are finally getting together

I think it's so groovy now
That people are finally getting together
I thinks it's wonderful and how
