		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, won't you lie here with me?
The day is growin' sober, mmm
Is it over?
Let us savor its last

Baby, won't you lie here with me?
I'm runnin' on empty, ooh
It's takin' over, mmm
And I long to be free

Have you walked along the coastal front?
The air is changin', ooh
And it is breathin' on
And we're recedin' bay
And it is leanin' on me
And I long to be free

Lie with me
Under fluorescent
Baby, won't you lie with me?
'Til the risin' sun
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Under fluorescent
Baby, won't you lie with me?
'Til the risin' sun
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Though I long to be free
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Though I long to be free
Baby, won't you lie with me?
Though I long to be free
Baby, won't you lie with me?
