		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh we're living in the present, mmm
But our mind is in the past past
Not knowing what we'll lose
Don't know what we'll last last (yeah)
The things you always dare to dream, oh
Are not always what they seem, mmm
Close to total peace
As the pain begins to ease

Not often we can see
The beauty in the pain
Not often we can see, the value that we gain
Now listen little one
The wounds will heal in time
I know it weighs a ton
But baby you'll be fine

You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine

Start living for the moment
Letting go of the past past, yeah
Start cherishing what you hold dear
And we will make it last

Not often we can see
The beauty in the pain
Not often we can see, the value that we gain
Now listen little one
The wounds will heal in time
I know it weighs a ton
But baby you'll be fine

You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine

You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine, fine (hey)

You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine
You'll be fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You'll be fine, fine baby you'll be fine
