		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Zac Brown
Mr. Worldwide
This is how you change the world
Let's ride (hey)

Get lost with me tonight
Cruise slow motion, chase the sun as we burn one down
Get lost with me tonight, e going
High as a mother (woo)
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now

I'm here to remind y'all, just in case you forgot
Mr. Worldwide, the world's my block (hey)
I'm like time, I never stop
I'm from the bottom, y'all keep the top (305)
See nobody, fear no one
Still the hottest thing under the sun (hey)
Still got it locked (uh-huh)
And it's never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever gon' stop (woo)
You can knock me down, but you won't knock me out
I love it when they count me out
Now let's party to the nights that we can't remember
With the friends that we can't forget, get lit

Get lost with me tonight
Cruise slow motion, chase the sun as we burn one down
Get lost with me tonight, we going
High as a mother (woo)
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now

Don't call it a comeback, I've been here for years
Hustlin', blood, sweat, tears (hey)
I say what they won't, I do what they don't
I am what they ain't, I go hard like Shaq in the paint
I'm a fighter (yeah)
Survivor, rider (yeah)
Nascar team's all lined up (hey)
Trackhouse bringing that fire 
Zac Brown and Pit fire
You can knock me down, but you won't knock me out
I love it when they count me out (hey)
Now let's party to the nights that we can't remember
With the friends that we can't forget, get lit (woo)

Get lost with me tonight
Cruise slow motion, chase the sun as we burn one down
Get lost with me tonight, we going
High as a mother (woo)
Nothing's gonna stop us now

Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now

I don't need water, I need a drink
So pass me a bottle and let's get lit
I don't need water, I need a drink
So pass me a bottle (high as a mother, woo)
And let's get lit (nothing's gonna stop us now)

Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now

Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
Na, na, na
No, no, no
Ain't nothing gonna stop us now
