		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No strings to hold me down
Feeling so high
We don't need wings
To fly
No strings to hold me now
It's just me and you tonight
We don't need wings
To fly

Meet me at the Thurston Ave bridge
Sit around and watch the rich kids
Wonder how they got what they got
Dad was gone and mom had four jobs
Told me you were sick of living here
All you wanna do is disappear
Watched you as you stared over the edge
Stick-and-poke tattoos on your wrist

We don't care what anybody thinks of us
Living dangerous
Living reckless
We don't care what anybody thinks of us
Just some wanderers
Never high enough, oh

No strings to hold me down
Feeling so high
We don't need wings
To fly
No strings to hold me now
It's just me and you tonight
We don't need wings
To fly

We don't need wings to fly
We don't need wings to fly

Parties in an old abandoned house
Skateboarding under grey clouds
Swore to God that I would make it out
Couple of us went a different route
This town will suffocate ya
First they love ya, then they break ya
Driving 95 on 88
Never going back upstate

We don't care what anybody thinks of us
Living dangerous
Living reckless
We don't care what anybody thinks of us
Just some wanderers
Never high enough, oh

No strings to hold me down
Feeling so high
We don't need wings
To fly
No strings to hold me now
It's just me and you tonight
We don't need wings
To fly

We don't need wings to fly
We don't need wings to fly

We don't need, we don't need, we don't need
We don't need, we don't need, we don't need
