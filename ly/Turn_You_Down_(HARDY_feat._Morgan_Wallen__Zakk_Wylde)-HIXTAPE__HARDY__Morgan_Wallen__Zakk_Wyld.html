		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mama said addiction runs
Like a kudzu vine in my family tree
That preacher said it'll be my death
But I can't quit you for the life of me
When you walk in 10 out of 10 times out of 10
I'm a hell of a mess
I wanna taste your cookin', I know I shouldn't
But girl, I must confess

Like a tall sip of Jack and Coke
"Sweet Child of Mine" on the radio
Colorado Left Hand, cigarette smoke
When you turn me on, I just can't turn you down
Hell, like a damn good time
Stirrin' up the dust of a dirt road drive
Backwood 40 on a Saturday night
When you turn me on, I just can't turn you down, yeah

We had a good run, honey
But the honeymoon wore off like a summer tan
Had better days, so we parted ways
Like a bottle of booze to a sober man
Ain't it kinda funny how we ended on the money
But we can't even stand each other?
Well, the only thing that we got in common
Is being a couple damn good lovers

Like a tall sip of Jack and Coke
"Sweet Child of Mine" on the radio
Colorado Left Hand, cigarette smoke
When you turn me on, I just can't turn you down
Hell, like a damn good time
Stirrin' up the dust of a dirt road drive
Backwood 40 on a Saturday night
When you turn me on, I just can't turn you down, yeah
Girl, I just can't turn you down

Like a morning sun when you wake up hungover
Let's get stoned when you're stone cold sober
Bad idea from the devil on your shoulder
Baby, what you say, you slide a little closer?

Like a tall sip of Jack and Coke
"Sweet Child of Mine" on the radio
Colorado Left Hand, cigarette smoke
When you turn me, on I just can't turn you down
Hell, like a damn good time
Stirrin' up the dust of a dirt road drive
Backwood 40 on a Saturday night
When you turn me on, I just can't turn you down, yeah
Well, I just can't turn you down
When you turn me on, I just can't turn you down, yeah
Yeah
