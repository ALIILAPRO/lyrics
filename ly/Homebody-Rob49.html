		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You a homebody, start comin' outside
Homebodies get cheated on
Hahahaha, for real
Better start comin' outside, girl, homebodies get cheated on
(Known to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Doe)

Yeah
When I'm in Miami, foreign whip go pan-Americ'
Fuckin' on the ghetto, we treat bad hoes like a sandwich, nigga
Trippin' on liquor, we make bad hoes pop their pussy, ooh
I know she a savage, she recordin' it while I'm hittin' it, ooh
Keep that bum-ass nigga from out our business, love, yeah
Keep your bum-ass friends from out our business, please, yeah
I'll get a flight right now for you and your friends and 'nem
Yeah, tryna come introduce you to my city (yeah-yeah)

We on weed, we on pills, we on lean
We on drugs, we on drugs, we on drugs
Yeah, bad bitch tryna come rip me out my jeans
That one opp nigga, I wanna put son in a blunt
Yeah, I didn't let that liquor turn me slut (okay, okay)
Shit, you done let that liquor turn you up, I see, alright
Every time we walk in, we the ones
I light that green but I'm in love with blue hunnids, nigga

Yeah
When I'm in Miami, foreign whip go pan-Americ'
Fuckin' on the ghetto, we treat bad hoes like a sandwich, nigga
Trippin' on liquor, we make bad hoes pop their pussy, ooh
I know she a savage, she recordin' it while I'm hittin' it, ooh
Keep that bum-ass nigga from out our business, love, yeah
Keep your bum-ass friends from out our business, please, yeah
I'll get a flight right now for you and your friends and 'nem
Yeah, tryna come introduce you to my city (yeah-yeah)

You my baby, huh?
You knew good girls who don't come outside get cheated on? Huh
You know when we come to your city, we turnin' your city up? Huh
You know SR wasn't enough, we wanted them VVs, huh?
They make no VVs, huh?
Shit, girl, come outside now (alright)
I'm tryna come bust ya down (for sure)
I'm tryna go round for round (uh-huh)
I'm tryna go tit for tat (yeah)
I'm treatin' this sex like safety net, uh-uh, no strings attached
So wait, I'm outside, where you at?
Alright, I'm makin' my haters mad

Yeah
When I'm in Miami, foreign whip go pan-Americ'
Fuckin' on the ghetto, we treat bad hoes like a sandwich, nigga
Trippin' on liquor, we make bad hoes pop their pussy, ooh
I know she a savage, she recordin' it while I'm hittin' it, ooh
Keep that bum-ass nigga from out our business, love, yeah
Keep your bum-ass friends from out our business, please, yeah
I'll get a flight right now for you and your friends and 'nem
Yeah, tryna come introduce you to my city
