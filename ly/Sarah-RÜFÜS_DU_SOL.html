		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sarah, we made a promise
I'm not taking my breath tonight
Lover, you know you got it

Sarah, heart of a lion
One more minute 'til it breaks apart
Lover, you're all I wanted
Maybe I lost it

I feel it when I talk about you
I don't want to sort it out
I'm feeling like I'm falling in two
I don't want to work it out, no
I feel it when I talk about you
I don't want to sort it out
Every time I've thought about you
I don't want to let it out, no
I feel it when I talk about

Sarah, I hear them calling
Calling your name across the sky
Lover, without a warning
Maybe I lost it

Sarah, we could've had it
I lie awake on my bed tonight
Lover, you're not forgotten

I feel it when I talk about you
I don't want to sort it out
I'm feeling like I'm falling in two
I don't want to work it out, no
I feel it when I talk about you
I don't want to sort it out
Every time I've thought about you
I don't want to let it out, no
I feel it when I talk about

Maybe I lost it
I feel it when I talk about you
Maybe I lost it
I feel it when I talk about you
I don't want to sort it out
I'm feeling like I'm falling in two
I don't want to work it out, no
I feel it when I talk about you
