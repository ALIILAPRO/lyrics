		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh tell me how you sleep at night
Cause what you did to me is making all my dreams into nightmares 
I gotta come up for air 

I followed you, followed your light
But maybe all this time my love made me blind
Now it’s time to play fair
Darkness naming her heir 

Was it nothing more than all a game to you
Was I the moth and you the flame?

Oh you should be afraid 
Cause now I’ve locked away 
The girl that you had known 
The girl you betrayed
Can’t resist it - Can’t resist it
Can’t resist my metamorphosis 
My metamorphosis

The pain made me strong - It’s where I belong
No little bird in her cage singing her little songs
And it makes me laugh everytime I look back 
When I believed I couldn’t be anything more than that 

I followed you followed your light
Fell straight off of the edge but I’m taking flight
Now it’s time to play fair
Darkness crowning her heir

Was it nothing more than all a game to you
Was I the moth and you the flame?

Oh you should be afraid 
Cause now I’ve locked away 
The girl that you had known 
The girl you betrayed
Can’t resist it - Can’t resist it
Can’t resist my metamorphosis 
My metamorphosis

Boy it’s such a shame 
It had to end this way 
Gave my heart and gave my soul
I gave it all to you and more 
Boy it’s such a shame
I’m standing on your grave 
But I’m no longer the moth no baby I’m the flame

Oh you should be afraid 
Cause now I’ve locked away 
The girl that you had known 
The girl you betrayed
Can’t resist it - Can’t resist it
Can’t resist my metamorphosis 
My metamorphosis
