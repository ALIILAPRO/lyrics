		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today, I feel close to ill
It seems to be alright
Steady hands and steady feet
I push you far behind
Miles to go, I'm drifting slow
This wholesome life of mine
Mother told us not to go
No fingers in the fire
Alright

I am only as good as you want me to be
I don't pick up the phone if I don't want to speak
I am only as good as you want me to be
I don't know what I'm doing
It's easy to see
Mmm

Pages after pages I write for me and no one else
Standing tall, no brick in the wall
I take care of myself
Fickle is as fickle does
As solitary links
My, oh my, it's hard because she says just what she thinks
Mmm

I am only as good as you want me to be
I don't pick up the phone if I don't want to speak
I am only as good as you want me to be
I don't know what I'm doing
It's easy to see

So pour it all on me
Pour it all on me
You know what
Shower me with what you're giving
Human behaviour forgotten
Da da dum, da da dum, dum dum
Da da dum, da da dum, dum dum

How can I be vanilla, baby?
How can I be vanilla, baby?
How can I be vanilla, baby?
How can I be vanilla, baby?
