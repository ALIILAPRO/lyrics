		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looks like I've been crying again
Over the same thing
I wonder if anyone has ever cried for me
Nothing means anything
At least anymore
Even my tears have gone room temperature

I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

I was sitting here last year the same time ago
Still wearing the same thing
These aren't even my clothes
I've just don't change that much
'Cause who's to impress?
There's nobody around when I make my bed

I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more

I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
I should get out more, I should get out more
