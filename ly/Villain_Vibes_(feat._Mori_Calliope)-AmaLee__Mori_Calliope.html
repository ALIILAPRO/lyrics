		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Better back down, get on your knees, 
Stealing your heart, she’ll make you plead 
Giving you something to believe 
Like aye-oh-aye-oh-aye-oh-aye

She’s got them villain vibes - villain vibes 
Got them killing vibes - killing vibes
Watch her taking lives - taking lives 
Singing aye-oh-aye-oh-aye-oh-aye

She’d rather be the hunter than the prey 
Rather be a killer than a saint 
Either way, she’s still gonna make you pray (pray pray pray)
Maybe long ago was heaven-made
But she slipped and fell along the way 
Now she’s got another role to play (play play play)

So don’t go - playing with - playing with fire
So don’t go - playing with - playing with fire
Don’t go - D-Don’t go

She’s got them villain vibes - villain vibes 
Got them killing vibes - killing vibes
Watch her taking lives - taking lives 
Singing aye-oh-aye-oh-aye-oh-aye
aye-oh-aye-oh-ay-oh-aye
aye-oh-aye-oh-ay-oh-aye

She got them villain vibes - villain vibes 
Every time I see ‘em I-I-I’m crazy, I know - I know she’s crazy
But I kinda like, kinda like living on the edge of this high high baby, 
I like - I like crazy 
Strike that match and make it blow up 
Hit that gas, it’s half of the fun
Don’t show this to just anyone
But - but can’t stop what you’ve begun 

Ha ha wild and viscous, hungry 
Smiled ‘til the mischief felt boring 
She ain’t the hero, just the villain of somebody else’s story 
Straight up predatory 
Made up swagger, what’s the matter? 
Acting tough, nah you not even in the same category 
But ya fear the reaper like never before 
Once you hear it, falling deeper ‘til she severs your core 
Somehow begging for more 
Bring them to life just to kill ‘em again 
Swing til’ the end with this scythe 
Trust it’s a thrill you’ll never comprehend

So don’t go - playing with - playing with fire (ohhh)
So don’t go - playing with - playing with fire (no)
Don’t go - D-Don’t go 

She’s got them villain vibes - villain vibes 
Got them killing vibes - killing vibes
Watch her taking lives - taking lives 
Singing aye-oh-aye-oh-aye-oh-aye
aye-oh-aye-oh-ay-oh-aye
aye-oh-aye-oh-ay-oh-aye
