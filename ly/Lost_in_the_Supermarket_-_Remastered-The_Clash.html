		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for that special offer
A guaranteed personality

I wasn't born so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see

I heard the people who lived on the ceiling
Scream and fight most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling
That's how it's been all around me

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for a special offer
A guaranteed personality

I'm all tuned in, I see all the programs
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit discotheque album
I empty a bottle, I feel a bit free

The kids in the halls and the pipes in the walls
Make me noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality

It's not here
It disappear
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for that special offer
A guaranteed personality

(I'm all lost) I'm all lost in the supermarket
(I'm all lost) I can no longer shop happily
(I'm all lost) I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality

(I'm all lost) I'm all lost in the supermarket
(I'm all lost) I can no longer shop happily
(I'm all lost) I came in here for a special offer
A guaranteed personality

I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for a special offer
A guaranteed personality

I'm all lost
I'm all lost
I'm all lost
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for the special offer
A guaranteed personality
