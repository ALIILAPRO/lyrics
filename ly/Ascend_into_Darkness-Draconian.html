		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the first one to die,
parting with these filthy attires now
I can see the dazzling dark
defying the scorn of the rulers
to no longer sleep in stone

Dead wishes,
dead wishes upon the Heavens,
And the hollow-hearted
for them comes no revealer
I will never bow
For they are Deceivers
The soulless seven
for them there's no remorse
Only Death

Clad in jewels of grievance
A clandestine dream of the Earth
is the death of rebirth
As I feel your shame inside me
I'm but a reverent prowling
the shores of Eden

But I'm leaving here

A wound that heals
and the right to be forgotten
The sad voice of Wisdom
yearns for a dreamless sleep

The Demiurge and the crooked cross,
the god-imitator
and the harvester of loss
Wallow and weep, ravished kin
Fear not to surface your soul
in this silent, violent world

No wishes,
no wishes upon the Heavens
and the heart-departed
they plead to their redeemer
And I will never bow  

For they will just deceive Her
And the soulless seven
for them there's no remorse
Only Death

Do not conform
to the shroud of fallen daughters and sons,
to the dwindled faith of lovers long gone
Faded with the setting sun
Behold my ascendance
from a creation taken from us
Mismanaged by the angelic deep state
and inorganic spiritual hate

Every material thing
a brick in the barricade
Dear mother, have mercy on me
I've just learned your name

But I'm leaving here

A wound that heals
and the right to be forgotten
The sad voice of Wisdom
yearns for a dreamless sleep

Dear Mother,
Have mercy on me
I've just learned your name

I can see the dazzling dark

Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Oh mother,
Have mercy
