		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm
I know, it's been comin' for some time
When it's over so they say
It'll rain a sunny day
I know, shinin' down like water

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down a sunny day?

Yesterday and days before
Sun is cold and rain is hard
I know, been that way for all my time
'Til forever, up on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow
I know it can't stop, I wonder

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down a sunny day?

Yeah

I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain?
I wanna know
Have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down a sunny day?
