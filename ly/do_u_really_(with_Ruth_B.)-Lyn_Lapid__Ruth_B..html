		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you really wanna fall in love? (Hey, hey, hey)
Do you really wanna settle down?
Or are you happy just to mess around?
Do you really wanna fall in love? (Hey, hey, hey)
Do you really wanna find the one?
Or are you happy just to lead me on?
Do you really wanna fall in love?

(I want to, I want to, I want to) 
(I want to, I want to, I want to)

Wonder if we let this love grow
I won't have it in me just to let go?
Won't get outta the ring if you say so
Do you really wanna fall in love?
Havin' my heart here for takin'
Even if you choose to break it
Bet you won't leave it here forsaken

Do you really wanna fall in love? (Hey, hey, hey)
Do you really wanna settle down?
Or are you happy just to mess around?
Do you really wanna fall in love? (Hey, hey, hey)
Do you really wanna find the one?
Or are you happy just to lead me on?
Do you really wanna fall in love?

Openin' up on the drive home
You were givin' me hints, winks, and high hopes
But you're still into her yeah, I know
Do you really wanna fall in love?
Tryna prove that you're all grown up
Holdin' my heart that you've sewn up
But then again you told me you were lonesome

Do you really wanna fall in love? (Hey, hey, hey)
Do you really wanna settle down?
Or are you happy just to mess around?
Do you really wanna fall in love? (Hey, hey, hey)
Do you really wanna find the one?
Or are you happy just to lead me on?
Do you really wanna fall in love?

Mm-mm-mm (Do you really wanna fall in love?)
Mm-mm-mm

If I wait for you (wait for you)
Will you wait for me? (Wait for me)
If I wait for you (wait for you)
Will you wait for me? 

Do you really wanna fall in love?
