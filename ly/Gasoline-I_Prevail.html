		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's burn it fucking down
Yeah

Back from the dead to tell you that I'm alive
Killed the old way but I survived
Fuck the blueprint, I redesign
Death or exile, you decide
Tell 'em all that I made my name
Tell 'em all that I paved my way
Found the fear then went face to face
Now it's mine to send up in flames

'Cause this right here is as far as you go
This right here is where I lose control
This right here is as far as you go

Burn it all down, burn it all down
I don't give a fuck
Burn it all down, burn it to the ground
Feed the flames, go insane
And burn it all down, burn it all down
Fuck what they say, fuck everything
Light the match, gasoline
Kill it all, kill everything
And burn it all down, burn it all down

Nothin' but red inside when I close my eyes
Vision built that you can't deny
Born and bred to take back what's mine
Break or bow down, you decide
Tell 'em all that you can't be saved
Tell 'em all that you dug this grave
Learn to live in this mess you made
Now it's mine to send up in flames

'Cause this right here is as far as you go
This right here is the end of the road
This right here is as far as you go

So burn it all down, burn it all down
I don't give a fuck
Burn it all down, burn it to the ground
Feed the flames, go insane
And burn it all down, burn it all down

The time is up
There's no return
Fuck them all
Watch them burn
Yeah, 'cause I don't give a fuck

Fuck what they say, fuck everything
Light the match, gasoline
Kill it all, kill everything
And burn it all down, burn it all down
