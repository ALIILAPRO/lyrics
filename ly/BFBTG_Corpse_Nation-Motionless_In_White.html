		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Good evening, and welcome to another chilling installment
Of broadcasting from beyond the grave
Tonight's grim and ghastly tale
Corpse Nation

Look into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot
Feed into the promise
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops

They spew it, nothing to it
Just another cycle of abuse, propaganda on a loop
A sermon, so determined
To be the live grenade in predatory game

Adrift lost in the cyber sea
A movement consuming, contentious hate is blooming
Aimed to harden the divide

United by a story in your melting pot of misery
Hold yourself a prophet but you're really just a comedy
We won't take this anymore
Let me say it one more time

Look into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot
(Corpse Nation)
Feed into the promise
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops
(Corpse Nation, Corpse Nation)

(Oh my god, they're horrifyin')

Violence, systemic virus
Please take a seat and read the room
Ignorance will be your doom
Contagious, hysteric rages
But it's time to let the rhetoric go up in flames

Assault with your cryptic words
Uncensored ramblings to a brain dead herd
Agenda tailored for supremacy
Indoctrinated fallacy

Look into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot
(Corpse Nation)
Feed into the promise
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops
(Corpse Nation, Corpse Nation)

Malignant manifesto
Two-bit horror show
If truth's what makes you shudder
Research this, motherfucker

Where you go one you'll all fall
I won't, I won't, I won't stand back and bite my tongue
Where you go one you'll all fall
Disillusioned, where are you now?

Stare into the darkness
Web of crooked thoughts
Lobotomized and left to rot
(Corpse Nation)
Malignant manifesto
Worship every drop
Deny it when the pageant flops
(Corpse Nation, mutation, Corpse Nation, damnation now)

Fuck you
