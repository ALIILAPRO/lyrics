		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life flashed before my eyes
Razor-blade lips and daggers up in your eyes
Baby, your love is a crime
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
My life flashed before my eyes
Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky
Baby, your love is a crime
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky

(Hey)
You lit up like a full moon
Yeah, I heard you were the baddest on the street
(Hey)
You work it like there's no rules
Little criminal, I'm calling the police

Keep me on a leash tonight
There's nowhere for me to hide
See you on the other side

My life flashed before my eyes
Razor-blade lips and daggers up in your eyes
Baby, your love is a crime
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
My life flashed before my eyes
Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky
Baby, your love is a crime
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky

(Hey)
I can tell your heart's cold
Like a fallen angel walking in your sleep
(Hey)
I guess you're just a lost soul
But when the moon comes out, you turn into a beast

Keep me on a leash tonight
There's nowhere for me to hide
See you on the other side

My life flashed before my eyes
Razor-blade lips and daggers up in your eyes
Baby, your love is a crime
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
My life flashed before my eyes
Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky
Baby, your love is a crime
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
Danger by day, but you're evil in the night
Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky

Bombs over Broadway, fire in the sky
