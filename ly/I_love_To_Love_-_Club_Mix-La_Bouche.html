		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love to love 

I love to love you 

So much I want to share in you 

Oh Oh Oh.. 

I love to love 

I love to love you 

I want to find a way to you 

I'll tell you a secret 

If you're mine for the rest of the future 

If you're mine coz you know that I need ya 

I'll give you love and I'll give you satisfaction 

This is the way that it is  that it is 

You know that lovin' 

Have a little tempo 

Just like the music 

Nothin' but a stop'n'go 

And if you like I will be around 

I'll tell you a secret 

Chorus: 

I love to love 

I love to love you 

So much I want to share in you 

Oh Oh Oh.. 

I love to love 

I love to love you 

I want to find a way to you 

If I had a dream tonight 

I'd dream that I'd be with you 

If I had a wish tonight 

I'd wish you'd love me too 

I'll tell you a secret 

I'll tell you a secret 

I'll tell you a secret 

Another woman and another night 

Another time that you want to fright 

Another day that you feel alone 

This is the way that it is, that it is 

I need some lovin' 

Nothing sentimental 

Not only sex 

But your heart is gentle 

And if you like I will be around 

I'll tell you a secret 

Oh Oh Oh.. 

Chorus 

Bridge: 

I love to love, that's what I do 

I love to love, it's me and you 

I love to love, my heart is tired 

Girl let me set your soul on fire 

If I had one wish tonight 

I'd kiss and hug and hold you tight 

All we need to sail away 

Are peace and love on brand new days 

So Twinkle twinkle little star 

Girl I wonder who ya are 

Up above the clouds so hight 

Like a diamond in the sky 

Soul too real with much appeal 

You know the deal, it must be real 

Love to love, girl take the cue 

Love to love, it's me and you 

If I had a dream tonight 

I'd dream that I'd be with you 

If I had a wish tonight 

I'd wish you'd love me too 

I'll tell you a secret 

I'll tell you a secret
