		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo!

Yeah, every small town's got its boss hog
Big dog steady runnin' the show
Yeah, attitude, tattooed, sleeves rolled up
He's all swoled up with nowhere to go
Everybody's rollin' 'round in 4-wheel drives
And jackin' up their trucks
Yeah, they think they livin' it up

Not like us
We're on another level
These folks 'round here
2-steppin' with the devil
I'm callin' y'all's bluff
Y'all drinkin', y'all smokin' it up
Show me what you got boy
I'll show you that you're not like us
Wanna be, yeah, you know you wanna be like us
Wanna be but you're never gonna be like us
Not like us

Everybody likes to light it up
With your buddies get to buzzin' like a neon light
Hit the strip, get it lit man, take another sip
Hit a lick on a Saturday night
Yeah, they closin' down and throwin' down
Until the sun comes up
Yea they think they livin' it up

Man, but not like us
We're on another level
These folks 'round here
2-steppin' with the devil
I'm callin' y'all's bluff
Y'all drinkin', y'all smokin' it up
Show me what you got boy
I'll show you that you're not like us
Wanna be, yeah, you know you wanna be like us
Wanna be but you're never gonna be like us
Not like us

Everybody's rollin' 'round in four wheel drives
And jackin' up their trucks
Closing down, and throwing down
Until the sun comes up
You say if I were one of y'all
You know I got you all
Everyone of us wants all of, all of y'all

What's up?
We're on another level
These folks 'round here
2-steppin' with the devil
I'm callin' y'all's bluff
Y'all drinkin', y'all smokin' it up
Show me what you got boy
I'll show you that you're not like us
Wanna be, yeah, you know you wanna be like us
Wanna be but you're never gonna be like us
You're not like us

(Hahahaha)
(Look here)
(Some of y'all phonies)
(You need to stay on the porch)
(Oh mercy)
(Don't come down here)
