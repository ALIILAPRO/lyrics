		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Almost pierced my nose in the bathroom out of spite
‘Cause I had to move back home and my mom and I were in a fight
But I just couldn’t
Guess I’m not that wild
And I don’t wanna stay her least favorite only child

Almost crashed my car into a light pole just to say I did it
I don’t wanna die I just want people to think I could’ve
So the next time they see me they’ll hold me a little tighter
And think about how sad it’d be i I wasn’t alive anymore

And I know that it’s probably selfish
And I shouldn’t think like that 
So what if I do it for attention
Would that really be so bad?

‘Cause I’m not gonna do it, just gonna think about it a lot
And I’m not a danger to myself or others
I know that’s what it sounds like but I swear I’m not I just wanna feel different
Than what I’ve felt before and I don’t wanna be my mom’s least favorite only child anymore

Almost ran away I packed my car and took the keys 
Just to see if I disappeared would anyone even look for me
I cut and dyed my hair to try and feel like someone new
But I couldn’t escape myself no matter how badly I wanted to

And I know that it’s probably selfish
And I shouldn’t think like that 
So what if I do it for attention
Would that really be so bad?

‘Cause I’m not gonna do it, just gonna think about it a lot
And I’m not a danger to myself or others
I know that’s what it sounds like but I swear I’m not I just wanna feel different
Than what I’ve felt before and I don’t wanna be my mom’s least favorite only child anymore

Hmmmmmmm

And I know that it’s probably selfish
And I shouldn’t think like that 
So what if I do it for attention
Does that really make me bad?

‘Cause I’m not gonna do it, just gonna think about it a lot
And I’m not a danger to myself or others
I know that’s what it sounds like but I swear I’m not I just wanna feel different
Than what I’ve felt before and I don’t wanna be my mom’s least favorite only child anymore

And I know I should be kinder to my body and my mind
And things are gonna get better if I just give myself more time
I’ve got the rest of my life to feel different than I do
And being my mom’s least favorite only child must mean that I’m her favorite too
