Oh, as the king and the queens gather the cheese
No fees, you cannot buy these

Told all my opps, "All my life, it's been troublesome tings" (yeah)
We can go faster, chapters, won't hold back 
Niggas see where we at
All of my shooters, my goonies a team
Some shit always seen, I'm ready for action (yeah)
Keep it goin' on and on
Can we, can we keep it, keep it goin'? 
It's live, yeah, bitch (yeah)
Fuck them niggas, they annoyin' (they annoyin')
Get it, tell them pussies we ain't slowin'
Nah, nah, no flex, han (nah)
Get some relief (hey), spark up the leaf
Call up my niggas, we live out our dreams, hey
God got his hands on my believe
Rumors are cheap (hey, hey), do it for V
All of them days that I couldn't eat
Brodie keep watchin', I know that I'll reach, reach, reach (yeah)
When the Vamps leave on the scene
While I whip the X I'm on a winnin' streak (uh-uh, uh-uh)
Steppin' next, you've never seen (let's go)
I feel filthy, on the run, it's a movie

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
