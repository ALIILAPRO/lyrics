		  How will I know?
How will I know?
How, how will I know?

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of (he's the one I dream of)
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm
Ooh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough (can't seem to get enough)
When I wake from dreaming, tell me, is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things
How will I know?
How will I know?
How, how will I know?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now (wish I had you near me now)
Said there's no mistakin', what I feel is really love
Ooh, tell me

How will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know?
How will I know?
How, how will I know?
How will I know?
How will I know?
How, how will I know?

If he loves me
If he loves me not
Hey, if he loves me
If he loves me not
If he loves me
If he loves me not
Oh, how will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me? (How will I know?)
I say a prayer with every heartbeat (hey, how will I know)
I fall in love whenever we meet (ooh)
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things (how will I know?)
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
How will I know? (How will I know?)
How will I know?
