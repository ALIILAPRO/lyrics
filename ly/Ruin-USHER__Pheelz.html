		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, you broke me and took your time with it
Babe, you gave me all these memories that I regret
All I can do is congratulate
'Cause you ruined me for everybody (ooh)
Yeah, you ruined me for everybody (ooh, ooh)

Wake up in the mornin'
A different girl be on my line
Constantly be callin' every day, I still decline
See? This exactly what you did
You ruined me for everybody
You ruined me for everybody, ooh

Bye-bye, good riddance for the last time
So you can try, try, maybe get it right next time
Different timeline, maybe then you can be mine
Ruined me for everybody
You ruined me for everybody, ooh

I be learnin' tricks where you put up on me
'Cause back then I was very lonely
I still am, I'm just tryna find peace every day
My heart is on holiday
Still gives me sleepless nights
Sometimes I wonder how
It happened all of a sudden
You ruined me for everybody

I wake up in the mornin'
Different girls be on my line
Constantly be callin' me, I just don't reply
See? This exactly what you did
You ruined me for everybody
You ruined me for everybody, whoa-oh

Bye-bye, good riddance for the last time 
So you can try, try (try, try, try), maybe get it right next time (maybe you can get it right)
Different timeline, maybe then you can be mine (then you can be mine)
You ruined me for everybody
You ruined me for everybody, ooh
Bye-bye, good riddance for the last time (ooh, for the last time)
So you can try, try (oh), maybe get it right next time (you can get it right)
Different timeline, maybe then you can be mine (oh)
Ruined me for everybody
You ruined me for everybody
