		  Top down ride It slow
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna see you stunt
I could see you with your girls turning up
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna put you on
Just wanna put you on the
Top down ride It slow
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna see you stunt
I could see you with your girls turning up
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna put you on
Just wanna put you on the
Even If we don't feel the same tomorrow
Even If the love we made is hollow
Even If I gave my heart to borrow
Even when I talk that shit I'm all yours
Top down ride It slow
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna see you stunt
I could see you with your girls turning up
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna put you on
Just wanna put you on the
Top down ride It slow
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna see you stunt
I could see you with your girls turning up
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna put you on
Just wanna put you on the
Top down ride It slow
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna see you stunt
I could see you with your girls turning up
Oh you bad as fuck I just wanna put you on
Just wanna put you on the
