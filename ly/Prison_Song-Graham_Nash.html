		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One day a friend took me aside
And said I have to leave you
For buying something from a friend
They say I've done wrong
For protecting the name of a man
They say I'll have to leave you,
So now I'm bidding you farewell
For much too long.
And here's a song to sing,
For every man inside,
If he can hear you sing
It's an open door.
There's not a rich man there,
Who couldn't pay his way
And buy the freedom that's a high price
For the poor.

Kids in Texas
Smoking grass,
Ten year sentence
Comes to pass
Misdemeanor
In Ann Arbor,
Ask the judges
Why?

One day a friend said to her kids
I'm gonna have to leave you
For selling something to the man
I guess I did wrong
And although I did the best I could
I'm gonna have to leave you
So now I'm kissing you farewell
For much too long.
And here's a song to sing,
For every man inside
If he can hear you sing
It's an open door.
There's not a rich man there
Who couldn't pay his way
And buy the freedom that's a high price
For the poor
