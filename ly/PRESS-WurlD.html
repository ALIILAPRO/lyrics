		  Hummmmmmmmming Vocalizing intro 



She no dey press 

She tell me baby she no want stress 

She got her own so she no dey press 

Say na my vibe wey dey make am wet 

Me I no dey press 

Give me your loving don’t want no stress 

Say many men dem dey try to press 

Na only me wey dey make her press 



Oh na na na 

Baby no make me go all la la out 

Press on your buttons all na na na night 

I won’t press your feelings 

I won’t cross those lines yeah 

I know so many will tell you lies 

Lie on my past so that we can divide 

It’s no lie for you, I go all la la out 

For you, anything I go all la la out yeah 

And I don’t wanna waste your time 

Catching my high with your vibe 

Giving me the signs,  I’m looking in your eyes 

Love it when you smile and giving me that whine 

Eyayiyahiyai don’t like 

Wasting my time pushing on the wrong tribe 

Many evil things wey my eyes don see 

only thing I need is the way you make me feel yeah



She no dey press 

She tell me baby she no want stress 

She got her own so she no dey press 

Say na my vibe wey dey make am wet 

Me I no dey press 

Give me your loving don’t want no stress 

Say many men dem dey try to press 

Na only me wey dey make her press 



I ain’t never make I wait pronto pronto 

Giver her anything she want pronto pronto

Press her button make she come pronto pronto

Me o no go let you go pronto pronto 

I ain’t never make I wait pronto pronto 

Giver her anything she want pronto pronto

Press her button make she come pronto pronto

Me o no go let you go pronto pronto 



Oh na na na 

your touch is spiritual, human divine 

the way your dey make go all la la out 

Chop all my money go all la la out yea 

I need you everyday by my side 

if you trust me with your heart 

I won’t let you cry 

If you trust me with your body 

I won’t let you drown 

For your anything I go all la la out yeah 



And I don’t wanna waste your time 

Catching my high with your vibe 

Giving me the signs,  I’m looking in your eyes 

Love it when you smile and giving me that whine 

Eyayiyahiyai don’t like 

Wasting my time pushing on the wrong tribe 

Many evil things wey my eyes don see 

only thing I need is the way you make me feel yeah



She no dey press 

She tell me baby she no want stress 

She got her own so she no dey press 

Say na my vibe wey dey make am wet 

Me I no dey press 

Give me your loving don’t want no stress 

Say many men dem dey try to press 

Na only me wey dey make her press 



I ain’t never make I wait pronto pronto 

Giver her anything she want pronto pronto

Press her button make she come pronto pronto

Me o no go let you go pronto pronto 

I ain’t never make I wait pronto pronto 

Giver her anything she want pronto pronto

Press her button make she come pronto pronto

Me o no go let you go pronto pronto
