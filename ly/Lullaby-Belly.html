		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I die a little more inside

Money told me to speak on it, I'ma speak on it, fuck it
It's mumble rap man it's, it's mumble rap right
That's what we doin'? Alright

Yeah
Wonder if God heard me pray, when I was tryna repent
If he didn't I know he heard my mother cry over rent
Then you wonder why the mood inside this room is so tense
No offense, but I don't really got nowhere to go vent
Oh yeah, success is like a drug and I've been high on it since
Feel like I've wasted all the money, and the time that I spent
Maybe the tears inside my eyes had me blind with revenge
I told her even if we crash I'm gon' ride 'til the end
There I go lying again, don't know why I pretend
Hold up, let me try this again
Lord you know I never open up
Abusing drugs never thinking I was dope enough
She's over me when I'm the one that she's supposed to love
At least my heart broke enough for the both of us
They told me play your part, though we different you smart
Let her lay in your bed, though never let a bitch in your heart
Still around the same ones that I was with from the start
Though the distance got us drifting apart
Felt betrayed, swear to God 'til this day man this shit hit my heart
Wanted to shine so bad that I got left in the dark
Still love you, can't help but see that kid in the park
Runnin' around the town lookin' for some shit we can stir
Any issue I was right there with it, I was
I bought my dream house, but I been having nightmares in it

The game ugly, just tell me why you can't love me
Or why the fuck you're ashamed of me, you can't judge me
That's why I stay numb, and the smartest thing I ever did was play dumb
Staying up nights 'til my day comes
Old memories had me wishin' that we stayed young
I'm a mess, thinking less now I'm saying more
I talked to God about you, so I'm praying more
That's why I smoke a hundred blunts straight
Pops left moms cried for a month straight
Used to cry too but I would never show it
Superwoman feel blessed if you ever know her
Look at all this shit that me made it through
They bugged the house, and they raid it too
If that ain't ironic, I'm a crazy fool
Play it cool baby, play it cool

They don't acknowledge my accomplishments
My Opp was just an optimist
I'm copping shit but still I'm not convinced that this is opulence
I could probably fuck Pocahontas right out her moccassins
Killing everything that I'm authoring like a offering
Ten stitches with my limbs twitching
You ever went through withdrawal 'til your skin itches?
Screaming fuck what you think, tears falling while I write it down smudging the ink
Please pour out a couple of drinks
Sometimes I wish that I was up there with Chinx
You wouldn't even care if I ever die
So I wrote this for the tears that you never cry
Lullaby
