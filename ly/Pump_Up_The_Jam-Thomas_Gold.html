		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Technotronic cover)

Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that

Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that

I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day

(Pump up the jam...)

Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that

Pump up the jam
Pump it up
While your feet are stomping
And the jam is pumping
Look ahead, the crowd is jumpin'

Pump it up a little more
Get the party goin' on the dance floor
See, 'cause that's where the party's at
And you'd find out if you do that

I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
I don't want
A place to stay
Get your booty on the floor tonight
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day
Make my day

(Pump up the jam...)

Make my day
