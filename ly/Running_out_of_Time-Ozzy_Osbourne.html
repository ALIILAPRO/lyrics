		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been around this world so many times
If you could only see my mind
I watch my secret heaven turn to hell

Faith alone has guided me
The ghost of my own destiny
I haven't even got a soul to sell

All the thing I put me through
I wouldn't wish my hell on you
You'll never know what's going on inside

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Trouble always seems find
A way to live inside my mind
My haunted head and me remain alone
Underneath my masquerade
A simple man who's so afraid
I try to find a light to guide me home

Momma please just hold me tight
Feeling so afraid tonight
'Cause your the only one that really knows

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of faith and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Fighting for my sanity
Many nights of tragedy
Got to leave my Wretched ways behind

Just another lonely broken hero
Picking up the pieces of my mind
Running out of fate and hope and reason
I'm running out of time
Running out of time
I'm running out of time
Running out of time

Underneath my masquerade a simple who's still afraid
