		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Self-medicate, self deprecate
Self-help books on the shelf, help meditate
Hard on myself, friends can't relate
Time is your friend, can't reciprocate
Times up come on out

Now I'm trapped in the grass
Not gonna laugh, not gonna go home
Not ready for the crash
Heavy body frozen
Hand on my wrist
Hand on my cold shoulder
Skies open up, I think I got a little older

Older
Older

Sweatin' on a page
Sweatin' through the maze
Gettin' out the keys
To the place
That I thought I put away
Million dollar days, in a sort a way
I had to get away to come back
Time's up come on out

The river ran clean as a dream so I swam in its fountain
The fast went hard in the jungle on a mountain
Fast was the beat of my heart
In the back of my mind was a beautiful, truthful shouting

You can let go
That weight you carry with ya (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Once and for all
Once and for all

(The only way out is through)

Welcome back, that's at least one big monkey off my back
Knew I'd get around to it
I can't forget the sound of it
But six feet of snow in the snowbanks?
No thanks
Time's up come on out

Now I'm on my side
I'm on my side
Livin' life right
Dark was the night
But you know what?
Bright is the light as above, so below 
And through

You can let go
That weight you carry with ya (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Once and for all
Once and for all

You can let go
That weight you carry with ya (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Once and for all
Once and for all
