		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I loved your face, I loved your hair
Your T-shirts and your evening wear
As for the world, the job, the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who broke the heart and made it new
Who's moving on? 
Who's kidding who?

I loved your moods, I loved the way
They threatened every single day
Your beauty ruled me, though I knew
'Twas more hormonal than the view

Now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Queen of lilac, Queen of blue
Who's moving on? 
Who's kidding who?

I loved your face, I loved your hair
Your T-shirts and your evening wear
As for the world, the job, the war
I ditched them all to love you more

And now you're gone, now you're gone
As if there ever was a you
Who held me dying, pulled me through
Who's moving on
who's kidding who

Who's moving on? 
Who's kidding who?
