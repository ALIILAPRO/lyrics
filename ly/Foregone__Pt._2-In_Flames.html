		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you look in the mirror and don't like what's there
It's the one you despise with no tears to spare
(It's the one you despise with no tears to spare)

How did we end up here?
Burn all the empires and face what you fear
(Burn all the empires and face what you fear)

As the light passes, we watch the world corrode
Vampires in daylight, the condemned are here to stay

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The innocent at every breaking wave

Nothing is holy for the clouded eye
The tremors, the thunder, the lights go out
With all the lies, the ultimate consequence
We all know what's the end of this route

As the light passes, we watch the world corrode
Vampires in daylight, the condemned are here to stay

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The innocent at every breaking wave

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The innocent at every breaking wave

I don't see, I don't hear, are you even there?
I need you right now with all the troubles I've seen
I can't tell the beginning from the end
Call upon The innocent at every breaking wave
