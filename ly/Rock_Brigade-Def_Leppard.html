		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, in the middle of the night
And the early morning light
You can hear them a million miles away
They'll be bangin' on their drums
Bangin' on your door
Waving their flags telling you the score

Watch out for the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away, away

So when they hit your town
You better get down
I'm tellin' no lies to you, mister
'Cause they live for rock n' roll
They'll try to steal your soul
Might even try to steal your sister

Watch out for the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
Leading you away, away, away

So, in the middle of the night
Or the early morning light
If you hear them comin' your way
Well, you better watch your step
Don't step out of line
'Cause here they come, one more time

Watch out for the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Oh no, it's the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Look out for the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
You better watch for the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)

I say, watch for the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Keep your eyes on the rock brigade
(Rock brigade)
Don't let your eyes off the rock brigade
They'll be leading you away, away, away
