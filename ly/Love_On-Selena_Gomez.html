		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Qu'est-ce que je vais te nommer?
Je vais te nommer "l'amour"
"L'amour tendre"

Wait 'til I turn my love on
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on
I'm no cheap thrill
I'm a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell (baby, if you can't tell)
You're what I wanna love on, oh

This doesn't have to be some sort of mathematical equation
Slip off your jeans, slide in the sheets
Screaming "yes" in quotations
Clock in, baby, get to work
Night shift, but with all the perks
Time stamping when you fell in love
Time can't mess with us

Ooh, if you think about fallin'
Got you covered like garments
Ooh, I deserve an applause for
Keeping you up late 'til you can't see straight
Just wait, woo

Wait 'til I turn my love on
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on (wait 'til I turn my love on)
I'm no cheap thrill
I'm a roller coaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell (baby, if you can't tell)
You're what I wanna love on, oh
Wait 'til I turn my love on (wait 'til I turn my love on)
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on (wait 'til I turn my love on)
You'll get your thrill
Just promise you'll be patient with the outcome
Oh, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell (baby, if you can't tell)
You're what I wanna love on, oh

Why are we conversing over this steak tartare
When we could be somewhere other than here
Making out in the back of a car?
Or in the back of a bar
Or we could make a memoir, yeah
On the back wall of the last stall
In the bathroom at the bazaar

Ooh, if you think about fallin'
Got you covered like garments (I got you covered)
Ooh, I deserve an applause for
Keeping you up late 'til you can't see straight
Just wait, woo

Wait 'til I turn my love on
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on (wait 'til I turn my love on)
I'm no cheap thrill
I'm a rollercoaster ride, baby, jump on
Come on, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell (baby, if you can't tell)
You're what I wanna love on, oh
Wait 'til I turn my love on (wait 'til I turn my love on)
Wait 'til, wait 'til
Wait 'til I turn my love on (wait 'til I turn my love on)
You'll get your thrill
Just promise you'll be patient with the outcome
Oh, come on
'Cause, baby, if you can't tell (baby, if you can't tell)
You're what I wanna love on, oh

Wait 'til I, oh, yeah
Wait 'til I
Baby, if you can't tell
You're what I wanna love on, oh
