		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leave your past at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blisters, blisters, blisters

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, no (oh, no, no, no)
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out
Oh, no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out

Such a harsh tongue, used so easily
Never hear it much in front of me
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures

Oh, no (oh, no, no, no)
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out
Oh, no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out

Oh, no, no, no, no
I can't escape anything in this town
Knock yourself out
Oh, no, no, no
Can't escape anything in this town
Can't escape

Anything in this town (can't escape)
Anything in this town (can't escape)
Anything in this town (can't escape)
Anything in this town

Leave your past at the front door
And run away like you did before
Blisters, blisters, blisters

Let's consider a change of scenery
It's getting boring by the sea
Pictures, pictures, pictures
