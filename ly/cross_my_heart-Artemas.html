		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much history when we say goodbye, bye
Cross my heart and hope that when I die
It's with you, baby
Only you, baby

Feelin' used, baby, believe me, so am I
Fixed my broken heart so you could break it one more time
It's a broken record we play every night
Can't get you out my head, you're on my mind

Nothin' hurts like love, nothin' hurts like you
Mix it with the drugs and the Absolut
All these sleepless nights got me terrified
When you say you're leavin', you mean it this time

Too much history when we say goodbye, bye
Cross my heart and hope that when I die
It's with you, baby
Only you, baby
Need you with me on the other side-ide
Cross my heart and hope that when I die
It's with you, baby
Only you, baby

Only you, call it truce
Call me crazy, it's the truth
I'm just faded, I'm just jaded
And I've got nothin' to lose
Except for you, baby (for you)
Except for you, baby (for you)

Nothin' hurts like love, nothin' hurts like you
Mix it with the drugs and the Absolut
All these sleepless nights got me terrified
When you say, you're leavin', you mean it this time

Too much history when we say goodbye, bye
Cross my heart and hope that when I die
It's with you, baby
Only you, baby
Need you with me on the other side, side
Cross my heart and hope that when I die
It's with you, baby
Only you, baby

Too much history when we say goodbye (bye)
Cross my heart and hope that when I die (bye)
It's with you, baby (bye-bye)
Too-too much history (bye-bye)
With you, baby (bye-bye)
Goodbye
