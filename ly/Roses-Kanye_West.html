		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know it's past visiting hours
But can I please give her these flowers?
The doctor don't wanna take procedures
He claim her heart can't take the anesthesia
It'll send her body into a seizure
That lil' thing by the hospital bed, it'll stop beepin'
Hey, chick, I'm at a loss for words
What do you say at this time? Remember when I was nine?
Tell her everything gon' be fine, but I be lyin'
Her family cryin', they want her to live, and she tryin'
I'm arguin', like, "What kind of doctor can we fly in?"
You know the best medicine go to people that's paid
If Magic Johnson got a cure for AIDS
And all the broke motherfuckers passed away
You telling me if my grandma's in the NBA
Right now, she'd be okay?
But since she was just a secretary
Working for the church for thirty five years
Things supposed to stop right here?
My grandfather tryin' to pull it together, he strong
That's where I get my confidence from
I asked the nurse, "Did you do the research?"
She asked me, "Can you sign some t-shirts?"
"Bitch, is you smokin' reefer?
You don't see that we hurt?" But still

I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

They outside of the emergency room, room
You can feel my heartbeat, beat, beat
If she gon' pull through, we gon' find out soon
But right now, she 'sleep, sleep, sleep
My momma say they say she could pass away any day
Hey chick, what these doctors know anyway?
Let me see the X-rays, I ain't no expert, I'm just hurt
Cousin Kim took off of work
Plus, my Aunt Shirley, Aunt Beverly, Aunt Klaye and Aunt Jean
So many aunties we could have an Auntie Team
Feel like Amerie, it's just "1 Thing"
When they said that she made it, you see they eyes gleam
I think we at a all-time high
To get there, we run, we fly, we drive
'Cause with my family, we know where home is
So instead of sending flowers, we the roses

I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine, oh

I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I, can't wait for a sunny day (seeing it through your eyes)
Can't wait for the clouds to break

I smile when Rosie comes to see me
And I'm sad, when Rosie goes away
'Cause Rosie brings the sunshine (say)

Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I can't wait, no
Can't wait, I, can't wait
No, can't wait, for, for a sunny day
Momma can't wait, for the clouds to break
Mm mm mm mm-mm mm-mm
Oh oh oh oh no no, say
Tellin' you the truth now
Said I can't wait, uh uh
I won't wait, no
