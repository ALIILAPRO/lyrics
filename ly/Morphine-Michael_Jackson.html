		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He got flat, baby
Kick in the back, baby
A heart attack, baby
I need your body
A hot kiss, honey
He's just a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
So unrelying
I'm such a swine, baby
All down the line, daddy
I hate your kind, baby
So unreliable

A hot buzz, baby
He's one of us, baby
Another drug, baby
You so desire

Trust in me, trust in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine

Hoo

You got place, baby
Kicked in the face, baby
You hate your race, baby
You're not the liar
Your every lick, baby
Your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
You soul survivor
She never cut from me
She never cut, baby
I got to work, baby
You just a rival
Always to please, daddy
Right up and leave, daddy
You're throwing shame, daddy
So undesirable

Trust in me, just in me
Put all your trust in me
You're doin' morphine

Go on, babe

Relax
This won't hurt you
Before I put it in
Close your eyes and count to ten
Don't cry
I won't convert you
There's no need to dismay
Close your eyes and drift away

Demerol, Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Demerol, Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol

He's tried hard to convince her
To be over what he had
Today, he wants it twice as bad
Don't cry, I won't resent you
Yesterday, you had distrust
Today, he's taking twice as much

Demerol, Demerol
Oh God, he's taking Demerol
Hee-hee
Demerol, Demerol
Oh my, his God is Demerol
Hee, hoo
Oh

He got shit, baby
Your dog's a bitch, baby
You make me sick, baby
You are a liar
Is truth a game, daddy?
To win the fame, baby
It's all the same, baby
You're so reliable

Trust in me, trust in me
Put all your trust in me
She's doin' morphine

Hoo

You just sit around just talkin' nothing
You're takin' morphine
Hoo
Go on, baby
You just sit around just talking about it
You're takin' morphine
Hoo-hoo
Just sit around just talking nothing about it
You're takin' morphine
You just sit around just talking about it
You're taking morphine
Hoo-hoo
You just sit around just talkin' nothin'
And takin' morphine

Hoo-hoo
I'm going down baby
You're talkin' Morphine

Go on, baby
Hoo, hoo
Morphine
Do it, hoo
He's takin' morphine
Morphine
Morphine
