		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were running blind
Following your feet to try
And outrun your fate
Standing in a field of clouds
Cerebral voices the loudest
All hollering your name
Is it paradise?
Only if it blows your mind
And then blows you away

Sometimes you wheel, sometimes you deal
Sometimes you have to rob and steal

Call you a sinner man, or call it second sight
Now they treat 'em all the same
And it's the thinnest line they hung you out by
You were holding my hands and saying
What if I, only ever took what's mine
I wanted to tell them
That if I could have led a different life
Could have lived a different life
But now I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need somebody who can ease my mind
You know I, could have led a different life
Could have led a different life

Pulling me aside, giving me your last advice
And the whole house shakes
Say keep it in the family, hide
Don't make the mistakes that I did,
'Cause it will weigh your soul away
And I wouldn't have tried if only it was black and white
But it's bullet gray

Sometimes you wheel, sometimes you deal
Sometimes you have to rob and steal

Call you a sinner man, call it second sight
Now they treat 'em all the same
It's the thinnest line, to hang you by
Holding my hands you say
You know I only ever took what's mine
I wanted to tell them
That if I could have led a different life
Could have led a different life
But now I need somebody who can ease my mind
Need somebody who can ease my mind
You know I need the remedy to kill my past
Need the Valium to sleep at night, night

What if I, only ever took what's mine
I wanted to tell them
That if I could have led a different life
Could have led a different life
But now I, need somebody who can ease my mind
Need the remedy to kill my past
Need somebody that can ease my mind
