		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had to carry on it was another day
Was singing this one song
I couldn't get away and it just came upon
I got it on replay i have to carry on
Carry on carry on

I gotta tell you something
And it goes on and on and
I gotta tell you something
And it goes on and on and
I gotta sing along and
It just goes on and on and
I gotta tell you something
And it goes on and on and

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
(It just goes on and on and
It just goes on and on and
It goes on and on and)

I had to carry on it was another day
Was singing this one song
I couldn't get away and it just came upon
I got it on replay i have to carry on
Carry on carry on

I gotta tell you something
And it goes on and on and
I gotta tell you something
And it goes on and on and
I gotta sing along and
It just goes on and on and
I gotta tell you something
And it goes on and on and

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
(It just goes on and on and
It just goes on and on and
It goes on and on and)

Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Na na na na na na
