		<p>
		  Yeah they show upon in something
Every night when you let them in they let
You down when you call them up they
Call whenever they like it's the same act
I have done that (so good)

In the stars we were just
Hanging out for the rush you know that
I didn't expect this from you

You done good
I like it i could get used to this
So good don't mind it
I could make room for this
Look at what you started, baby
You get what you want

You done good i like it
I could get used to this

You saw me how i'm unlike anyone else
And the all we word i have passed you bye
But the way you get me hit's like nobody else
I'm not going back i have played that

In the stars we were just
Hanging out for the rush you know that
I didn't expect this from you

You done good
I like it i could get used to this
So good don't mind it
I could make room for this
Look at what you started, baby
You get what you want you done good
I like it i could get used to this

I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this

You done good i like it
I could get used to this so good
Don't mind it i could make room for this
Look at what you started, baby
You get what you want you done good
I like it

I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
I could get used to this
