		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run that shit
Yeah
Ohh
Yeah
I’m a stoned soul
I get high when I want to
High when I want to
I’m a stoned soul
It’s the life that I’m drawn to
If you didn’t know now you know baby
I’m a stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
Stoned
I’m a stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
I take my time
You take your time
We’re ready for tonight
Imma get you right
Imma get you right that's for sure for sure
Time passes by
Love me while I’m high and I’ll give you a ride
To a place no one can find
Let me show you the other side
Ohh
Yeah
I’m never alone
Even when you’re gone
Stoned soul so I see through your soul
You don’t need anyone
Girl I’m the one
Girl I’m the one
Babygirl I’m the one
I’m a stoned soul
I get high when I want to
High when I want to
I’m a stoned soul
It’s the life that I’m drawn to
If you didn’t know now you know baby
I’m a stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
Stoned
I’m a stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
I’m a stoned soul baby
You get me in my zone baby
You got it all
You just spent another stack on you
You don’t need the money but someone to keep you wet longer
Oh
Yeah
Screaming through the night
You don’t pop for everybody
Girl you keep it tight
Brought all your friends with you, y’all looking fine
Dressed in designer you show off all night
Baby you know cause you saw in my eyes
I don’t want nobody but you tonight
Red bottoms on you
Faded all summer
Tats on your skin
Never seen nothing like
Stoned soul yea yea
Imma take it slow yea yea
Baby move it slow mo and
Keep it on the low no promo yea
Baby they ain’t gotta know
I’m a stoned soul
I get high when I want to
High when I want to
I’m a stoned soul
It’s the life that I’m drawn to
If you didn’t know now you know baby
I’m a stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
Stoned
I’m a stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
Stoned
Stoned soul
