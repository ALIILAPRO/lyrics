		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, love me, oh
Love me, love me, love me
Love me, love me, ooh

Feels so good like that (like that)
When you hit it right like that (like that)
Go another round for the night (for the night)
Then three more times, like that, like, whoa
I know that you in love with the cat (cat)
It squeezing so tight, you can't let go
Know I got you hooked real bad
Why you lookin' at me like that?

Just tell me what you want and I'll give it to you
Just tell me what you need, I'll fulfill it for you
I make it feel so nice, make it last your whole life, oh
You can let it go in the bedroom, babe

Fuck your status (fuck your)
Fuck your, your status, it don't matter
Money, cars and, the diamonds, don't phase me, I been had it
Fuck your status (status)
I just, just wanna love you, baby
What you wanna do?

You gon' make me take it to the floor
You know how I like to turn you on
Think of me when you're alone
Know you wanna take me home
I'ma make you feel like, whoa
You gon' make me rock the boat
Make it so wet like a wave
I'ma make you feel a type of way

Countdown to the high
Climax of your life (love me, love me)
Rain down, while you let me ride, let me ride
Let me ride
Promise I'ma change your life (love me)
Nothing ever felt so nice (love me)
Nothing ever felt this right, right (love me)

Just tell me what you want and I'll give it to you (I'll give it to you, babe)
Just tell me what you need, I'll fulfill it for you
I make it feel so nice, make it last your whole life, oh
You can let it go in the bedroom, babe

Fuck your status (fuck your)
Fuck your, your status, it don't matter
Money, cars and, the diamonds, don't phase me, I been had it
Fuck your status, I just, just wanna love you, baby (I just wanna love you, babe)
What you wanna do? (Ooh)

You know I be giving what you wanting
Making love up, all up on the phone, and (love me, love me)
I know how to get you in the zone, and (love me)
You know I be giving what you wanting, oh (love me, love me)
Loving all the ways that you excite me (love me, excite me)
Squeeze me, you can touch me, you can bite me (love me, love me, bite me)
You know I'm the one and I'm the bestest (love me, love me)
Give you all the love, but can you handle it? (Ooh)

I just wanna be the one you trust
Baby, I just wanna be the one you love
And need, and need, and need
Wanna be the one you love, can I be the only one? (Can I?)
Wanna be the one you love, can I be the only one? (Can I be the only one?)
Wanna be the one you love
Can I be the one you love (baby, baby, baby)
And need, and need, and need? 
Baby, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you trust (trust)
Baby, I just wanna be the one you love 
And need, and need, and need
