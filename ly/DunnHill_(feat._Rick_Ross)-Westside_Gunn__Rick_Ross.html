		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo, I'm at the Intercontinental, baggin' up
Talk about your North Fly, nigga, bitch is, you dumb
Dunnhill, apron out and put a one on the one
Mini Tech on the lap, that's a gun on a
Back to back (?) with the top off
Poppy steak schnitzel with some hot sauce
Vick then ruff on the sawed off's
These niggas prayin' on my downfall
Nigga, grab the blush, blow him off (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Everybody hit him, that's the protocol
Hotel cars, eatin' shrimp like a boss
Nigga, rock a boss, tow a 40-carter car
Bitch thought she coming home with me, I'm a star
Little Russian model bitch, I fucked in the jawn
Two-fifty, easy on her arm, pick her arm
East side nigga, I could bag Nia Long
Roof at the view, you see the view of Milan
I've been pissin' Dom all week, I'm a don
Sean Don, yeah, yeah, spot him just don
Sippin' 99 fried rice with some prawns
Twenty on your head, you be gone by the morn' (boom, boom, boom, boom)
Only nigga in my city, back to back fawns
Fashion week, my white bitch, suckin' and snortin'
Me and Verdi out in Harajuku remorseless
Gucci trench, Gucci goggles on like I'm snorkelin'
Heated floors in my garage for the Porsche

Whoever said money don't change, they was lyin' (they was lying)
Wear Balmain, eating fine dine
I'm that nigga, all these niggas, they be tryin' (they be tryin')
I'm that nigga, bet the mac get to flyin'
Whoever said money don't change, they was lyin' (they was lying)
Wear Balmain, eating fine dine
I'm that nigga, all these niggas, they be tryin' (they be tryin', huh, M-M-M)
I'm that nigga, bet the mac get to flyin' (it's the biggest, Maybach Music)

Chanel boots, Lamborghini coupes
Shooters on the leash, time to let them loose
All these accusations, snitches in the news
Still in the Boobie Trap, I made a stripper my masseuse
Still be shoppin' Kellys (huh), million while in Paris (huh)
Mimosas for the moment, all the murders I done married (woo)
Watch three hundred carats, you should never wear it (huh)
All them niggas robbers, to be honest, they be jealous
Cars made of glass, Givenchys on the mask (huh)
Feds know to watch me, attorneys know the task
I still live a life that you can never grasp
Heavy on the ice (huh), Bellaire in the glass (M-M-M)

Whoever said money don't change, they was lyin' (they was lying)
Wear Balmain, eating fine dine
I'm that nigga, all these niggas, they be tryin' (they be tryin')
I'm that nigga, bet the mac get to flyin'
Whoever said money don't change, they was lyin' (they was lying)
Wear Balmain, eating fine dine
I'm that nigga, all these niggas, they be tryin' (they be tryin')
I'm that nigga, bet the mac get to flyin'

Whatever you niggas want to think, think what you want to think, nigga
Because I don't fuck with you niggas, no way
Come on, homie, what happened to that?
Man, fuck you niggas
Nigga, me and my team, whoever I got
Nigga, they ain't going nowhere
Nigga, I ain't got to prove nothing to them motherfuckers, nigga
