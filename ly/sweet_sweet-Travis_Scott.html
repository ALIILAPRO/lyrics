		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause you're sweet
Sak pase? (Wah yuah seh?)
Run it up, all this cake
Bag it up, then come right away
'Cause you're sweet, what's your status?
Might hit your address, if I'm on them Addys
Jet right to you, I can't do no traffic (skrrt, skrrt)
I can't do no lacking (skrrt, skrrt)

'Cause you're sweet like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco
Hangin' out with you is a no go
Yeah, yeah, straight up
'Cause you're sweet (sweet, sweet) like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco (sweet, sweet)
Hangin' out with you is a no go (sweet, sweet, sweet)
'Cause you're sweet

Like my time, like my juice (sweet)
We been downstairs in the basement with the moves (sweet, yeah)
Shout my town, shout my troops
Shout my jeweler, made my chain look like fruit loops (yeah, it's lit!)
Come get a taste, come get a scoop
I done made it out the hood through all the hoops (hula hoops)
I done finally found a way to make the loot
Link up all my niggas and my jewels
Link up, link up, yeah, link up, pour my syrup
Bad bitch, yeah they link up, link up
Go beserk, do some shit you think of (yeah, yeah)
Lean, lean, lean, all this lean, lean, lean
We might lean, lean, lean
Smoke all my shit, stop it, start again (yeah)

'Cause you're sweet like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco
Hangin' out with you is a no go
'Cause you're sweet

Sak pas√©? (Yeah) wah yeah seh? (Yeah, yeah)
Run it up (yeah), all this cake (yeah)
Bag it up (Bag it up), then come right away

When I ask who bigger
Ain't tryna argue with ya
I'm tryna figure (straight up!)
Who you with, who your team?
What your side?
How you, how you, how you ride? (How you ride?)
How you use me to survive? (Straight up!)
Yeah, 'cause we up, lit at five
At the crib goin' live, oh so live (yeah)
Eric keep the strippers, yeah, order V Live
Order wings, told em' hold it

'Cause you're sweet like cocoa (it's lit)
But all you wanna do is the coco (yeah, yeah)
Hangin' out with you is a no go, yeah, yeah, (straight up)
'Cause you're sweet like cocoa
But all you wanna do is the coco
Hangin' out with you is a no go
'Cause you're sweet
