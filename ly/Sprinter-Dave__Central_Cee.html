		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The mandem too inconsiderate
Five-star hotel, smoking cigarette
Mixin' codeine up with the phenergan
She got thick but she wanna get thin again
Drinkin' apple cider vinegar
Wearin' Skim 'cause she wanna be Kim and 'em
Uh, alright
I know that you're bad, stop actin' innocent

We ain't got generational wealth
It's only a year that I've had these millions
My whip could've been in the Tokyo Drift 'cause it's fast and furious
I went from the Toyota Yaris to Urus
They had their chance but blew it
Now this gyal want me in her uterus
Fuck it, I'm rich, let's do it (fuck it)

Take a look at these diamonds wrong
It's a life of squintin', can't just stare
With bae through thick and thin
She already thick, so I'm halfway there
Brown and bad
Couldn't change my mind, I was halfway there
One hundred meters, huh
I just put nine gyal in a Sprinter (uh)

One hundred eaters
They won't fit in one SUV (nah)
S-O-S, somebody rescue me
I got too many gyal, too many-many gyal, I got
They can last me the next two weeks (uh, huh)
Alright, like send the address through please

SUV, the outside white
The inside brown like Michael Jack
More time man build a line and trap
Spend like I don't even like my stack
Pistol came on a Irish ferry
Let go and it sound like a tap dance
The way that I ball
No yellow, the ref have to give me a black card
Who did what we're doin' with rap?
Man couldn't sell out his show after all them years of doin' the cap
Sprinter, two gyal in a van
Inter, two man in Milan
Heard one of my tings datin' P. Diddy
Need twenty percent of whatever she bags
Outside, my head in my hands

I told her my name is Cench
She said "no, the one on your birth certificate"
Your boyfriend ran from that diamond test
'Cause they wasn't legitimate (nah)
She Turkish-Cypriot but her curves Brazilian
I want her and bro wants her affiliate
I'm cheap, still hit a chick like "yo, can I borrow your Netflix?"
She a feminist, she think I'm sexist
Twistin' my words, I think she dyslexic
Give me my space, I'm intergalactic
Before I give you my Insta password
I'll give you the pin to my AmEx
Huh, alright
This ain't stainless steel, it's platinum
Dinner table, I got manners, huh
T-shirt tucked in, napkin
"Still loadin'" that's the caption
I've only amounted a minimal fraction
Eat good, I got indigestion
Bare snow in my hood, no Aspen
Can't get rid of my pain with Aspirin
Dave just came in a Aston, I'm makin' that Maybach Music (Maybach Music)
They're tryna insult my intelligence, sometimes I may act stupid
I never went Uni, I been on a campus selling cocaine to students
If bro let the drumstick beat
Then something gon' leak, we ain't playin' exclusives

Take a look at these diamonds wrong
It's a life of squintin', can't just stare
With bae through thick and thin
She already thick, so I'm halfway there
Brown and bad
Couldn't change my mind, I was halfway there
One hundred meters, huh
I just put nine gyal in a Sprinter

One hundred eaters
They won't fit in one SUV (nah)
S-O-S, somebody rescue me
I got too many gyal, too many-many gyal, I got
They can last me the next two weeks (uh, huh)
Alright, like send the address through please

Fire for a wife beater
Can't rock with that, I ain't wearin' a vest
Man have to send her therapy
She got a E cup bra, a lot on her chest
I'm in Jamaica, Oracabess'
Hit a lick, went Cash Converters
That don't work, it's pawn, no chess
I'm doin' more and talkin' less
I love chillin' with broke bitches
Man book one flight and they all impressed
I'm in the G63
The car hug me like a friend through twist and turns
Man livin' for nyash and dyin' for nyash, it's fucked
Don't know which one's worse, I'm fucked
Bags in his and hers
What's hers is hers, what's mine is too
Heard that girl is a gold digger
It can't be true if she dated you
AP baby blue, paper's pink
I'd probably hate me too
You ever spent six figures and stared at bae like 
"Look what you made me do"?
Yeah, (alright) started with a Q, didn't wait in line
Weird, I'm askin' my Blasian one 
"Why you so focused on your Asian side?"
I know that the jack boys pray that they get to the clubs and Dave's inside
