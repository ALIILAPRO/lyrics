		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, well
Uh
Well, well

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Well, well, see, uh, uh
Well, well
Come on now, uh, uh

Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me?
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me

So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible

Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you my baby

Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
That girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
She's invincible, she's invincible
Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
You see that girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible
She's invincible

Why ain't you feelin' me? She's invincible
I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
That girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
