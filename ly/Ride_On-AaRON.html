		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ghostly clothes worn as shields on the shoulders
All as an army of clones
Sleeping, dreaming, under influence
Sweet little boy
Drinking the world
Where are you going?
The bar clothes his shutter
In which way does your pretty chin
Has decided to point your burst?
Sweet little girl
Drinking the world

You wish on stars sealed in the pavement
'Cause money can't buy the ones above us
You ride with sadness inside your jeans
Lost in some dreams that have the size of your TV screen
And don't you dare walk all over me
Don't forget that once you were free

You wish on stars sealed in the sidewalks
'Cause money can't buy the ones above us
You ride with sadness inside your jeans
Holding on dreams that are the size of your TV screen

Don't forget that once you were free
So don't you dare walk all over me
