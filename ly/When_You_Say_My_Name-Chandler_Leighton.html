		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want to, I can be just like you
I can laugh at your jokes, convince you to take me home
Sayin' my type, anything to get inside your mind
Put a look on my face and back to your place
Using your words just to move up a base

You'll say what you want, but I can see you hand
I'm playing your game (huh)
And you're not winning it
I like the way your mouth moves
The way you say my name
'Cause when it's on your tongue
You're in love, what a shame
I wanna see your mouth move
You're such a pretty face 
Take the air right out your lungs
Be a drug, play a game
When you say my name

Does it scare you
That I already know what you're into?
You can say less, I bet I can guess
That'll you say whatever to get me undressed 
Double dare you, tell me two lies
Don't need no truths
'Cause I can see right through you
You're no good at pretend
I'm using your tricks that you use with your friends

You'll say what you want, but I can see your hand
You're playing my game
And you're not winning it
I like the way your mouth moves
The way you say my name
'Cause when it's on your tongue
You're in love, what a shame
I wanna see your mouth move
You're such a pretty face 
Take the air right out your lungs
Be a drug, play a game
When you say my name

Dadadadah, dadadadah, dadadadah (dah dah dah)
I wanna see your mouth move
Dadadadah, dadadadah-dah-dah-dah (dah dah dah)
When you say my name

When you say my name
I'll be in your head
Till you're dead, what a shame
When you say my name
Remember you got played
No, we're not the same
I just fake it out your game
When you say my name
