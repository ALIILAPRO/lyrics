		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You claim the heart in me
You're not the only one
Another thought so full of lies

You force my will to be
You're not the only one
Another night of pain and blood red skies

Leave, Leave
You gotta set me free
Leave, Leave

You must be here with me
You are one part of me
You won't let go, I won't let go
So every night you hear me say
You are one part of me
But I won't be you

Rework the mind in me
You're not the only one
Another thought so full of lies

You force my eyes to see (no!)
You're not the only one (no!)
Another night of pain and blood red skies

You must be here with me
You are one part of me
You won't let go, I won't let go
So every night you hear me say
You are one part of me
But I won't be you

Leave, Leave
Leave, Leave, 'cause I won't be you

Until the very last time
Until the very last time

You must be here with me
You are one part of me
You must be here with me
You are one part of me
You won't let go, I won't let go
So every night you hear me say
You must be here with me
You are one part of me
You must be here with me
But I won't be you

Leave, Leave
Leave, Leave, 'cause I won't be you
