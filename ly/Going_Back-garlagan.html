		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could you ever
Ever be ready at all?
Guess it's hard to know
All these signs are so off
Going up
Time goes up
Take it, leave it
You know you can't change it
No, no going back
Don't pretend this is to stop pretending, no
Know it's hard to guess
Wait a sec and now go
Going up
Time goes up
Take it, leave it
You know you can't change it
No, no going back
Pulling, fading
You know you can't stand it
No, no going back
How could you ever
Ever be ready at all?
How could you ever
Ever guess what's to know?
Slowing down
La la la
Take it, leave it
You know you can't change it
No, no going back
Pulling, fading
You know you can't stand it
No, no going back
