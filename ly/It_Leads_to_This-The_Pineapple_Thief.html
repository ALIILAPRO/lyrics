		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you see is no surprise
But it's not the half of it
Always there by your side
In the cold black center of your eyes
You made your mark, a life of toil
But that's irrelevant now
All the traces worn away
By the long march of your decay

So it leads to this
How could we get it so wrong?
For all this time, for all this progress
For all this time, for all this progress
For all this time, for all this progress

What you see is no surprise
But it's not the end of it
The future, what is left
Is right here standing by your side

So it leads to this
How could we get it so wrong?
For all this time, our so-called progress
So it leads to this
Oh, how you waited this long
For all this time, you were here with me
For all this time, you were here with me
For all this time, for all this progress
For all this time, I didn't notice you
