		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've never liked you from the day our eyes met
You're nothing but a burden to me
And I never cared for all the praise you received
Was told that I should be more like you
It tears me apart when I think I can live up to you
But I think I never will
All the pain we've shared
How I can stand you
All these goddamn years
They pass me by and I'm still right here

I never knew how much you could get under my skin
Like a thorn from inside
And I always hated the way you looked down upon me
Like I'm nothing to you
My father always said I'm just jealous of you
But I think this hate is real

All the pain we've shared
How I can stand you
All these goddamn years
They pass me by and I'm still right here

I pretend I care
Through these lost years
How I can't stand you
But I'm still right here

Lost years

All the pain we've shared
How I can't stand you
All these goddamn years
They pass me by and I'm still right here

I pretend I care
Through these lost years
How I can't stand you
But I'm still right here
