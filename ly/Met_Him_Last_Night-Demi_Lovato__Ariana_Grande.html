		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late at night
I'm sippin' as you pass me by
Red or white?
You pour another, say, "It's fine"

I don't believe in you
(I, I don't believe that)
'Cause I know just how you do
(I, I seen it right through)

I've seen the devil, yeah, I met him last night
Had conversation, yeah, I think he's alright
Seemed kinda funny, yeah, he kinda my type (kinda my type)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've seen the devil, yeah, I met him last night
One conversation, now he's spendin' the night
I think I love him, though I know it ain't right

You got me fucked up
I won't let this happen again
(Mm, yeah)
This the last time
You won't take advantage of my innocence (mm, yeah)

I don't believe in you
(I, I don't believe that)
Disguised but I see right through
(I, I seen it right through)

I've seen the devil, yeah, I met him last night
Had conversation, yeah, I think he's alright
Seemed kinda funny, yeah, he kinda my type (kinda my type)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've seen the devil, yeah, I met him last night
One conversation, now he's spendin' the night
I think I love him, though I know it ain't right
Though I know it ain't right

How can I ever believe him? (Yeah)
The one that could be so deceiving (yeah)
Boy, you were my only vice
I never feel this way
Won't be no hostage, I'm leavin' (yeah)
Boy, you just gave me a reason
No, I never thought I'd be the one
No, I never thought I'd be the one to fall
Watch me bounce before I give you my all
So I promise, tonight is the last call

I don't believe in you
(I, I don't believe that)
Disguised but I see right through
(I, I seen it right through)

I've seen the devil, yeah, I met him last night
Had conversation, yeah, I think he's alright
Seemed kinda funny, yeah, he kinda my type (kinda my type)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've seen the devil, yeah, I met him last night
One conversation, now he's spendin' the night
I think I love him, though I know it ain't right
(Ain't right, ain't right, ain't right, no)

(Mm-mm-mm) (oh, whoa)
(Mm-mm-mm)
(Mm-mm-mm)
Oh, hey, hey, yeah, yeah
