		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sosa, baby
GBE, baby
Bang
Bang-bang, bang
Bang
Beep, beep (beep)
Beep (beep)
Beep
Beep (what?)
Huh (what?)

Poppin' a pill still (huh, still, yeah)
Shawty on the block with me wearin' Chanel (bang) 
Too much dope in here, I can't smell, smell (too much dope)
Too many guns in here, I can't tattletale (tattletale, tattletale)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (I can't tattletale) 
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (tattletale)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (tattletale)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (what? Hold up, what? What?)
Uh-uh (what?)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (skrrt-skrrt)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Uh-uh (skrrt, hold up)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (what? Hol' up)

Heat in my hand, no oven mitt
Take your block and tumble it (tumble it)
Bitch, give me that cookie, I'm crumblin' (crumblin')
Uh-uh, you was lovin' that ho (lovin' that ho)
The way that go I never ever know
Rollin' up Ps 'cause I'm cappin' that O
Get sparked from the heat, that was definite though
You can try to run but you catchin' them though
Wanna fuck in these mouth like I'm M&Ms though
It's a hit-and-run, hit the ambulance, ho
Ice in my cup, December 24
Smoke get me higher than the airfield though
Mama told me, "Never ever fear though"
.45 bigger than a elephant though
Go to court smellin' like I sell elbows
Ha-ha, you was poppin' that shit (poppin' that shit)
Let the window down, start poppin' them sticks
Ha-ha, you was not with that shit (not with that shit)
You don't even know what come with that shit (with that shit, hey)
You better run, run, run up the blue bummers (bummers)
The bitch with me all in my arms, yeah (my arms, yeah)
After that I sent her home and I don't care (what?)
We want all the smoke, we got mob fare (mob fare)

Poppin' a pill still (huh, still, yeah)
Shawty on the block with me wearin' Chanel (bang) 
Too much dope in here, I can't smell, smell (too much dope)
Too many guns in here, I can't tattletale (tattletale, tattletale)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (I can't tattletale) 
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (tattletale)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (tattletale)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (what? Hold up, what? What?)
Uh-uh (what?)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (skrrt-skrrt)
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Uh-uh (skrrt, hold up)
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh (what? Hol' up)
