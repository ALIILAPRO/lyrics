		<p>
		  You know what the fuck going on
NLE muhfuckin' Choppa
The Top Shotta, you hear me?
I stand on top of shit
We doin' this shit, ayy (go, get him, go)

I whip the pack like Ike and Tina, I just copped me a Beamer (a Beamer)
Used to ridin' steamers (steam), I'm hot as jalape√±os
Bitch, I'm sellin' out arenas (I'm sellin' out), they say he entertain us (entertain)
Then if you try to tame us, I bet we leave you stained up (ayy)
Whole lotta sticks in the house, it's a gun show (brr, brr)
Bullets get him wet like a motherfuckin' poncho (brr, brr)
I don't think none of y'all niggas want gun smoke
Don't second guess this shit, I'm gon' blow (pussy)
Whole lotta shots when they come out the Drac'
Chop a nigga up, then put him in the lake (brrt)
Shiesty young nigga, they call me a snake
Ayy, fuck all that, Trick, shoot 'em in the face
Send a hit at five, he was dead by six (by six)
Got shot seven times but the eighth shot missed
Nine shots in the clip, coulda swore that it was ten (yeah, yeah)
Didn't fuck with 12, I was eleven again (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I need me a trophy, the best to sin
You niggas ain't straight, y'all lesbians
And fuck your dead homie, I'll say it again
If he come back to life, he dead again
Try to fight me, he gon' fight for his life (bitch)
Swing with what? I'ma swing with the pipe
(He's not cherishin' it)
Ayy, take his life, straight jacket music, I belong in asylum
Felonies and felonies, that what they keep on sellin' me (yeah, yeah)
This recipe is deadly, see, I be drippin' like relish me (yeah, yeah)
Ayy, ayy, shoot him in the head, shoulda had on a hard hat
We finish the beef as soon as you start that (ayy)
Bitch, I shoot first, why the fuck would I spark back?
If you really a thug, let me see where your heart at (ayy)
If I say catch a body, lil' nigga, you catchin' it?
If I tell you run out, is you really finessin' it? (Ayy)
If I give you a brick are you gon' sell that shit? (Ayy)
If you get in a jam, are you gon' start tellin' shit?
Where is the smoke, 'cause bitch, I'm inhalin' it
Just like the army, we got some artillery
Can they free my dawgs? I'm being sincerely
'Nother opp died, a nigga like, "Seriously?"
Damn, another one? Nigga, we shot him, and then we killed his brother
Damn, we might as well get the mother
Nigga say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em
If my brother don't like 'em, I don't
Somebody tell him he in trouble
I paid too much for my mothafuckin' guns for me to scuffle
Gangsta young nigga, I feel like Gucci
Fucked her so hard, left blood on the coochie
Made her say, "Ooh," put my thumb in the booty
I be damned, this dumbass ho just pooted
Who ain't with the murder? Lil' nigga, I kill
That night he died, that was my idea
Told my niggas slide, make sure he won't live
But that's a lil' secret, just keep it concealed
My metal a MAC and I bet I attack
It's a hunnid somethin' shots in this gat, so get back
He thought I was lyin', that shit was a fact
Got shot in his spine but you watchin' his back

(Nigga say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em)
Fuck you tal'm 'bout, haha
(Straight-straight jacket music, I belong in asylum)
Fuck they gon' do, fuck they thinkin', ayy
(Nigga say he don't like doing drills, I love 'em)
You know what I'm sayin'?
(Straight-straight jacket music, I belong in asylum)
Uh, uh, lil' Top Shoota, uh, uh, lil' Top Shotta, bitch
Fuck you talkin' about
