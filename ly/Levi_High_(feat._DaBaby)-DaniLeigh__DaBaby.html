		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

Levi high jeans, sittin' right, keep that ass up
Instagram flex, basic hoes gettin' gassed up
Niggas in my face, boy bye, nigga back up
I'm a city girl, it's only right that I act up
Yeah, hmm, it's the way I act up
Drink my water, ate my fruits, so everything be snatched up
Gettin' rich for dummies, you should read it and get your cash up
Ask me if I give a fuck, I wouldn't give my last fuck

Yeah (yeah, yeah)
Let's go
Wouldn't give my last fuck

Let's call this a boo check 
I just pulled with my new flex (yeah)
She love to call me bae 
Got her other nigga like, "Why you do that?" (let's go)
I know how to make niggas mad 
We hop out and swag, bitch, I got the bag
She got on them jeans that sit high on the waist
Like to throw up that four when I'm grabbin' her ass
Yeah, you know how I do, I done found a new bae
My new boo take like two or three showers a day
I'm still cool if I lose all my followers today
'Fore I knew about music, I found me a play
I told her to sneak my lil' gun in the club
Flirt with the security, act like he bae
You got them (huh)

Levi high jeans, sittin' right, keep that ass up (wow)
Instagram flex, basic hoes gettin' gassed up 
Niggas in my face, boy bye, nigga back up (yeah)
I'm a city girl, it's only that I act up (let's go, ah)
Yeah, it's the way I act up (okay)
Drink my water, ate my fruits, so everything be snatched up
Gettin' rich for dummies, you should read it and get your cash up
Ask me if I give a fuck, I wouldn't give my last fuck

(Hmm, hmm)
Don't act like you know who I am
I'm who I am, and you a fan
I'm up you not, that's where we stand
New AP watch, my wrist on glam
New rainbow diamonds, Toucan Sam
Don't want your nigga, come get your man
Don't want your nigga, come get your man

Levi high jeans, sittin' right, keep that ass up
Instagram flex, basic hoes gettin' gassed up
Niggas in my face, boy bye, nigga back up
I'm a city girl, it's only right that I act up (let's go)
Yeah, hmm, it's the way I act up
Drink my water, ate my fruits, so everything be snatched up
Gettin' rich for dummies, you should read it and get your cash up
Ask me if I give a fuck, I wouldn't give my last fuck 

Yeah, baby
(Daytrip took it to ten, hey)
Would-wouldn't even give you my last fuck
Ah, ah, ah
