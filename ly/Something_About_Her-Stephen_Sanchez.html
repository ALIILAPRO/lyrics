		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There must be something about her
That you love, don't you, dear?
Something about her

She was kinder to me than most girls would ever be
I'm over the moon, and I'm sad to see it end so soon
Oh, what have I done? I've never thought this way for love
Convinced that it is all because

There must be something about her that you love, don't you, dear?
Something about her terrifies all my fears
She sits in a smile, with eyes looking through
What's the point of all this music if I'm not here to dance with you?
There must be something about her

It'd be wiser for me to run away from all I see
I can't resist, what good is love if not to miss
Your hands or your eyes, or the way that yours just look in mine?
I'd die to live for any little part of this

There must be something about her that you love, don't you, dear?
Something about her terrifies all my fears
She sits in a smile, with eyes looking through
What's the point of all this music if I'm not here to dance with you?
There must be something about her

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Must be something about her
