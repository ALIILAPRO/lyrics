		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a Six Six Six
Triple six'n mother fucka
Demons coming
Try to touch me
Try to pull me under
Think that you could run up
I don't think that you
Could touch us
Pussy you a sinner
I'm a motha fuckin' lover
Yuh yuh
I'm shooting hollow tips
Up at yo crucifix
Cuz I love shooting shit
I think I'm losing it
That Lucy loosening my grip
Don't talk that stupid shit
I choke you straight to sleep
I hide yo body limp
You wake up drippin'
From the wrist
Aye fuck
This shit
You'd look better in a noose bitch
Think of the things
You would achieve
If you just
Shut yo loose lips
Useless
Be the mothafuckas that criticize The new shit
Proving that you're nothing
But a mothafuckin' nuisance
Creepin up outta gutter
I mutter the curse
Of the demons
I see em
Comin up under the graves of the One that stay on they team and
I tried to reach your fuckin god
But he never respond
Tell me why the fuck the devil Answer every knock
Hear these words
Hear my cry
Spirit from the other side
Come to me I summon thee
Cross now the great divide
Aye
Demon bless
From the kiss of death
And I'm boutta take the life
Of anyone left
Summon the darkness to
Vanquish my madness
The wickedly spirit has
Made its appearance
Demon shit
Wrists slit
Neck bit
What is this
Insidious bliss
In the abyss
Your eyes roll back into
Your fucking skull
Aye yuh
Imma blow my brains out
On these fucking walls
Aye yuh
The daemon says it takes it all
Aye yuh
It approaches with
The backwards crawl
Aye yuh
You see the devil in my eyes
Compromise
Any fucking ties
To that sucka life
On this planet he will never rise
I might catch on fire
Fuck yo god
Never lovin/ yall
I'm gon cock it back
Let it bang
To the mirror yah yah
I got four four fah
Bout to gun you down
Yeah that One Eight Seven
All up in my town
Gonna fold you up
Put you in the ground
Ain't gon make no noise
Ain't gon make a sound
I stare into the devils eyes
For the very last time
Of my fucking life
Of my fucking life
I break out from the void
Rip the fibers from reality
I'm bursting at the seams
Come face first to brutality
