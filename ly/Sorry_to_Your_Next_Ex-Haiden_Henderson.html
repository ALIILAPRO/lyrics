		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry to your next ex for the bar that I set
I might've been too perfect
Put with your bullshit
For a little bit too long
Now you're having trouble moving on

So go feed them whatever lies
To get yourself through, maybe look online
Somebody will love you
But will they love like I used to?

I don't mean to be in your mind
I can't seem to get out, must be all of the times
I made you happier than you are now
Bet they won't get you high enough to get over me

They may be tall
But don't stack up to me

Sorry to your next ex for the bar that I set
I might've been too perfect
Put up with your bullshit
For a little bit too long
Now you're having trouble moving on

So tell them I'm an asshole
Say that I was needy
I never made you laugh once
Whatever makes it easy
To find another perfect pawn
That's down to make up for your flaws

You're so see-through posting your fun
I could really care less 'cause you're still on the hunt
For someone better than the best
I didn't mean to make a mess out of everything

Guess I'm too good
Not to make a mess of things

So sorry to your next ex for the bar that I set
I even went into debt
For a honeymoon trip
And wasn't even twenty-one
Now I'm the one that's moving on

So tell them I'm an asshole
Say that I was greedy
I never got you off once
Whatever makes you happy
I'm sure you'll find a perfect pawn
And they'll be down to make up for your flaws

Good luck finding someone who
Can love you like I used to
Can't hurt me now that I'm gone, I'm gone

I hope you find a guy to fill the void
'Cause you and me know you'll never last without a toy

So hello to the next ex
Hope you like a train wreck
Maybe she'll be different
I wouldn't quite expect it
But for your sake, I hope I'm wrong
'Cause maybe then, I was the cause
