		  Bonjour

Ayo, you don't even speak English, I can tell that you mean it
(That you mean it, that you mean it, that you mean it, mean it)
You can put your legs up, you can choke me while I eat it
(While I eat it, while I eat it, while I eat it, eat it)
Hold hands by the Louvre, Eiffel Tower in the evening
(In the evening, in the evening, in the evening, evening)
We can laugh over French toast, but y'all don't call it French toast
(French toast, French toast, French toast, toast)
Don't worry 'bout me, bitch, I been dope
(I been dope, I been dope, I been dope, dope)
You see the roses in my intro
(In my intro, my intro, my intro, intro, intro)
Big V on you, that's for Valentino
(That's for Valentino, Valentino, Valentino, Valentino, 'tino)
Cocaine Spider, seats cappuccino
(Skr, cappuccino, cappuccino, cappuccino, cappuccino, 'puccino)
Heard you just killed 'em at the Raf show
(At the Raf show, at the Raf show, Raf show, Raf show)
Used to sell crack out the backdoor
(Out the backdoor, backdoor)

But now I'm out here in Paris, crushin' on you (crushin' on you)
Bitch, I'm out here in Paris
Just crushin' on you (crushin' on you)
Bitch, I'm out here in Paris
Just crushin' on you (crushin' on you)
Bitch, I'm out here in Paris (ayy)
Just crushin' on you (too sweet, crushin' on you)
Bitch (Folarin, yo, okay)

I'm sendin' shots, motherfucker, drink up
Your bars tender like umbrella in cup
Niggas never confront me, but on the humble, I can never hit you
'Cause you a broad, you just domestic as fuck, what's up? Yeah
Nobody'll miss you, what's up with the bitter? Yeah (brr)
I'm never gon' switch up, they all Eric Bischoff, yeah (grr)
My team special like we eleven, let's kick this shit off
I'm Steve Tasker in Buffalo, runnin', I'ma get you
I'm in Paris, ooh, yeah, I'm in Paris, yeah
You never been before, boo, don't embarrass yourself
I'm in love with my queens, I make her sing with your bitch
My chain look like it's Rue de Paris, that's where I get lit
I deserve all this money, I deserve every bitch
And we both pray for Paris, but mine ain't Paris kicks
Mine work for Rihanna, mine Fenty as shit
Mine workin' for Virgil like Dibiase but flipped
I just happen to rap, tap dancin' ain't with my legs
I'm out in France with Gunn, the fragrance est brick
I spray guns that blam, my raygun from damn
My SBs is old, your SBs is trash
And my Visa old, but my wings is fresh
Brought out Machine and Butcher, boy, we gon' need the bread
All my queens is gold, all my freaks still bad
Somehow I leave 'em open, like a screen from Shaq (yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)

But now I'm out here in Paris, crushin' on you (crushin' on you)
Bitch, I'm out here in Paris (boom, boom, boom, ba-boom)
Just crushin' on you (brr, crushin' on you)
Bitch, I'm out here in Paris (ayy, yeah)
Just crushin' on you (crushin' on you)
Bitch, I'm out here in Paris
Just crushin' on you (crushin' on you)
Bitch

You, you
Ooh, I got a crush on you
Crushin' on you (crushin' on you, crushin' on you)
You, uh, oh
Uh, look at what you do
Got me crushin' you
You, ooh, I got a crush on you (you)

Alright, I'll admit, I'll admit
I'm no singer
But what I am is a showstopper
The headliner
The main event, the icon
