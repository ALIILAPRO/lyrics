		<p>
		  Yeah
7:30 in the night, yeah
Ooh-ooh, ooh

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
It's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around (straight up)
When you throw that to the side, yeah (it's lit)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah

7-1-3 through the 2-8-1, yeah I'm ridin'
Why they on me?
Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I be sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text, kick game, knowledge
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all, yeah
When I'm with my squad I cannot do no wrong, yeah
Saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed, yeah
They gon' pull up on you (brrt, brrt, brrt)
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up off me (brrt, brrt, brrt)

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
It's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time

Uh, I wanna press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like
I wanna press my line, yeah
I wanna to take that ride, yeah
I'm gonna press my line
I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my
Mama, dear, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peelin' more residual
I can buy the building, burn the building, take your bitch
Rebuild the building just to fuck some more
I can justify my love for you 
And touch the sky for God to stop debatin' war
Put the pussy on a pedestal (ayy)
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter Piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard, the diamonds yours
The coupe forever
My best shot, just might shoot forever like (brrt)

I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb, yeah
It's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
