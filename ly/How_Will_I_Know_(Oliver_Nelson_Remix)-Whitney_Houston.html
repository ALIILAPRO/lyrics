		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm-hm
Oh, I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh-huh
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love?

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me, I'm shaking
I wish I had you near me now, uh-huh
Said there's no mistaking
What I feel is really love

Ooh, how will I know? (Don't trust your feelings)
How will I know?
How will I know? (Love can be deceiving)
How will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak?

Oh, wake me
Hey, how will I know?

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer beat
Beat, beat, heartbeat, beat
Beat, beat, heartbeat, beat
Beat, beat, heartbeat, beat
Beat, beat, heartbeat, beat
Beat, beat, beat, heartbeat
Beat, with every heartbeat

How will I know if he really loves me?
I say a prayer with every heartbeat
I fall in love whenever we meet
I'm asking you what you know about these things
How will I know if he's thinking of me?
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)
Falling in love is so bittersweet
This love is strong, why do I feel weak? Oh
