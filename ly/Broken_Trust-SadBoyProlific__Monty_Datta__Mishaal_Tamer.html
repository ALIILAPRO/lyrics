		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl how I love you, I can't love myself
Each day I wake up wish I'm someone else
Girl how I love you, I can't love myself
I can't love myself
I can't love myself, who I never could be
Wish I could be anybody, anybody but me
Wanna smile, but never wore it comfortably
Wish I could be loved, but you're running from me
Sometimes I hope I don't wake up from my sleep
Cause you see me with a haze, like Rutherford B
Feelin presidential, but it's nothing to me
Cause I don't feel your love and it's fuckin with me, yeah
Girl how I love you, I can't love myself
Each day I wake up wish I'm someone else
Girl how I love you, I can't love myself
Each day I wake up wish I'm someone else
And I've been patient, but your hate for me
Is taking me to my knee
Can't take it, girl you're breaking me
Afraid that there's no saving me
Cause you know I can't love halfway
All or nothing for you babe
You are my only escape
Happiness or end of days
Now there's no days left
Cross my heart and I hold my breath
You never cared of a word I said
So ima say bye with a broken chest, chest, chest
I can't love myself
Girl how I love you, I can't love myself
Each day I wake up wish I'm someone else
