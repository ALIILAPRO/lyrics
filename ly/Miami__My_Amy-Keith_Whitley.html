		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, everybody talks about the California 'quakes
But the first time I ever felt the earth shake
Was in Miami
When Amy touched me, oh, it shook me

I told her I loved her and I wanted to stay
But she said "Be sure, and I'll call you in LA"
Even in the taxi I could hear my telephone ring
Calling me from

Miami, my Amy
What took you so long? I thought you'd never call
Miami, my Amy
Miami, my Amy loves me after all

Now, Amy just called and said, "Please come back"
Said "I'm on my way, babe, ain't even unpacked"
"I want you, I love you", that's all she had to say
Goodbye LA

Now once again I'm Miami bound
Can't wait 'til this plane touches down
'Cause I know my Amy will be waitin'
At that Miami gate, I can't wait

Miami, my Amy
What took you so long? I thought you'd never call
Miami, oh, my Amy
Miami, my Amy loves me after all

Miami, my Amy loves me after all
