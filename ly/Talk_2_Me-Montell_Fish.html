		  Talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
Like you used to, you don't talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
Like you used to, you don't

Been in my, been in my bed
For way too long
Been in my, been in my head
Now five months on
You 've been gone, on and on
I am searching, on and on

Like you used to, you don't talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
Like you used to, you don't talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
Like you used to, you don't

I thought
That you were
The best thing
That ever happened to me
And I fell
From you, God
Please help me
Said now I see
All I need is you 

Talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
Like you used to, you don't talk to me
Why don't you talk to me?
Like you used to, you don't
