		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo ah mercy, mercy me
Ah, things ain't what they used to be.
No, no, where did all the blue skies go,
Poison is the wind that blows 
From the north and south and east 
Woo mercy, mercy me
 
Ah things ain't what they used to be, no, no
Oil wasted on the ocean and upon
Our seas fish full of mercury, ah. oh
 
Ah things ain't what they used to be
What about this over crowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
 
Oh mercy, mercy me.
Ah things ain't what they used to be.
No, no, no, radiation underground and in the sky;
Animals and birds who live near by are dying oh,
 
Oh mercy, mercy me.
Ah things ain't what they used to be.
No, no, no, radiation underground and in the sky;
Animals and land how much more abuse from man can she stand?
