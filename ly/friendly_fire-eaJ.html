		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Late night
Restless
I can smell the white lies on your breath
Words fly
Bullets ripping through our hearts straight out our chest

I heard whispers through the grapevine
Birds chirp they say that we're not fine
Crossed hearts crossed fingers and crossed lines
Caught in the crossfire

Lately
You and I are trading friendly fire
Falling to the pieces slowly
You and I are trading friendly fire
How did I turn you on me

Don't you forget how we used to be when we first met
Close call regrets
Lead us to this path that we both set

I heard whispers through the grapevine
Birds chirp they say that we're not fine
Crossed hearts crossed fingers and crossed lines
Caught in the crossfire

Lately
You and I are trading friendly fire
Falling to the pieces slowly
You and I are trading friendly fire
How did I turn you on me

Night after night
I know I need to let you go
Can't get back where we were before
I know I need to let you go
Night after night
I know I need to let you go
Can't get back where we were before
I know I need to let you go

You and I are trading friendly fire
Falling to the pieces slowly
You and I are trading friendly fire
How did I turn you on me
