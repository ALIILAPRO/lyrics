		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey you, I'm just now leaving
Can I come around later on this evening?
Or do you need time?
Yes, of course, that's fine
Hey you, good morning
I'm sure you're busy now, why else would you ignore me?
Or do you need space?
You can't help it if your mind has changed

So go ahead and break my heart again
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in
Are you the definition of insanity?
Or am I? Oh, it must be nice
To love someone who lets you break them twice

You're so blue, are you still breathin'?
Won't you tell me if you find that deeper meaning?
Do you think I've gone blind?
I know it's not the truth when you say, "I'm fine"

So go ahead and break my heart again
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in
Are you the definition of insanity?
Or am I? Oh, it must be nice
To love someone who lets you break them twice

Don't pretend that I'm the instigator
You were the one, but you were born to say, "Goodbye"
Kissed me half a decade later
That same perfume, those same sad eyes

Go ahead and break my heart again
Leave me wonderin' why the hell I ever let you in
Are you the definition of insanity?
Or am I? Or am I?
It must be nice
To love someone who lets you break them twice
