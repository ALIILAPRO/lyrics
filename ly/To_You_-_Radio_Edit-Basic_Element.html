		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We interrupt this radio program with a band that is that is that that is fantastic

(CHORUS 1)
Baby can you listen to me?
I wrote this to you
This time I'll be true
You know I can't live without you here
Is not in my world, not ever again
Will I be the one that's not your friend

(CHORUS 2)
You gonna bite the dust
Before it's gonna handle us
Spotlight technique fabulous
Feel the heat come see the rockshow (2x)

You gonna bite the dust
Before it's gonna handle us
Spotlight technique fabulous

Baby can you listen to me?
I wrote this to you
This time I'll be true
You know I can't live without you here
Is not in my world, not ever again
Will I be the one that's not your friend

I wrote this to you
This time I'll be true
You know I can't live without you here
Is not in my world, not ever again
Will I be the one that's not your friend

Baby can you listen to me? (Not ever again, you know I can't live without you here) I wrote this to you. Baby can you listen to me? (Not ever again)
Will I be the one that's not your friend.

You gonna bite the dust
Before it's gonna handle us
Spotlight technique fabulous
Feel the heat come see the rockshow (2x)

You gonna bite the dust
Before it's gonna handle us
Spotlight technique fabulous (fabulous, fabulous, fabulous)

We interrupt this radio program with a band that is that is that that is fantastic

You (5x)

Baby can you listen to me?
I wrote this to you
This time I'll be true
You know I can't live without you here
Is not in my world, not ever again
Will I be the one that's not your friend

I wrote this to you
This time I'll be true
You know I can't live without you here
Is not in my world, not ever again
Will I be the one that's not your friend

Baby can you listen to me?
