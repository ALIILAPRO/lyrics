		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're away
I'm feeling empty, I lose my mind
But when you're around
I take for granted most of our time

Honey, you say that I'm cold
And sometimes I'm out of control
Baby, you know how I am
At the end you are always mine, mine

I don't mean to when I hurt you
But I need you, I assure you
Just let me be when I'm crazy
At the end you're still my only

At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end, at the end

Right when you're gone
I really miss you, you got my heart
But when you come back
I just wanna kiss you and it tears you apart

Honey, do make us stay
Believe me, it's better this way
And baby, I'm true and I'm real
I'm giving you all that I feel

I don't mean to when I hurt you
But I need you, I assure you
Just let me be when I'm crazy
At the end you're still my only

I don't mean to when I hurt you
But I need you, I assure you
Just let me be when I'm crazy
At the end you're still my only

At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end
At the end, at the end, at the end, at the end

I don't mean to when I hurt you
But I need you, I assure you
Just let me be when I'm crazy
At the end you're still my only
