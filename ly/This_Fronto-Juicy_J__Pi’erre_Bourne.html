		<p>
		  This fronto got me high, so high, so high (uh-huh)
The Xans got me high, so high, so high (ayy)
The mollies got me high, so high, so high
The 'shrooms got me high, so high, so high (yeah, ho)
This fronto got me high, so high, so high
The Xans got me high, so high, so high (ayy)
The mollies got me high, so high, so high (so high, man)
These 'shrooms got me high (ayy), so high (ayy), so high (ayy)

Ruth Chris steakhouse, I just ordered me a stuffed chicken
'Cause I'm steaked out
Try me and I'll have them Glocks outside your house, staked out
Bussin' like the Greyhound
Moon rock got me spaced out
Fuck that bitch for forty minutes then I kick your bae out
Careful on the way down
I shot all my kids and now her face look like a playground
How I like 'em, face down
Ass in the air like a ostrich
Old school seas, all Auschwitz
Stake on me, nigga, I ain't boxin' (I ain't boxin')
Hold-ups on you, I ain't Jake Paul, nigga (mm-mm)
Doctor can't save you with a cape on, nigga (mm-mm)
Slide on you, slide off with your bitch
Now she in good hands like All-State, nigga
We ain't the same, need to stay in your lane
Fifty pointers on me, I'm the player of the game
Pop me a molly then fuck me a Barbie
And I only know shorty by Instagram name

This fronto got me high, so high, so high
The Xans got me high, so high, so high
The mollies got me high, so high, so high
The 'shrooms got me high, so high, so high (yeah, ho)
This fronto got me high, so high, so high
The Xans got me high, so high, so high
The mollies got me high, so high, so high
The 'shrooms got me high, so high, so high (yeah, ho)

So high in the sky (sky)
Birds flyin' by, cloud number nine
My pants Number (N)ine ((N)ine)
Only Japan, go shoppin' some times
Sossboy line (yeah)
Made in Paris, bitch, that's just mine
I can tell the future, all I see is dollar signs
My diamonds shine like the 4th of July
Yeah, she see I'm fine
Watch her work, her pussy fire
Married this money, my guap my bride
Skate team 'cause I'm on my grind
So much smoke, need a purifier
They know that Pi'erre fine
Niggas throw shots but they all misfired
If we pull our money out (out)
Guess who's stack up high? (high)
I can fuckin' retire
She give a treasure to Pi the Pirate
My little secret admirer
She go crazy when I get geeked up
Like her go, she mine, got her bands like, tire

This fronto got me high, so high, so high
The Xans got me high, so high, so high
The mollies got me high, so high, so high
The 'shrooms got me high, so high, so high (yeah, ho)
This fronto got me high, so high, so high (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The Xans got me high, so high, so high (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The mollies got me high, so high, so high (yeah, yeah, yeah)
These 'shrooms got me high, so high, so high (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ho)

So high, so high (yeah, ho, high)
So high, so high (yeah, ho, ooh)
So high, so high (yeah, ho)
So high, so high (yeah, ho)
So high, so high (yeah, ho)
So high, so high (yeah, ho)
So high, so high (yeah, ho)
