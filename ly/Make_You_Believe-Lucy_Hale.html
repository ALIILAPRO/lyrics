		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Plug in the mic open the curtain
Turn on the lights I'm through rehearsing
The feeling ignites I'm in control
The crowds in the palm of my hands
All my fans stand what is the truth?
What an illusion?
You're searching for proof
But are you certain?
Whatever you see is what you get
If words paint a picture then
I betcha i can getchs yes

I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be why you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I can make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything

I've got nothing to lose I've been exposed
I'm paying my dues playing the role
I'm breaking the rules flowing the flow
I've got the whole world nodding yes
Like some bobble heads

I'll break a sweat if you wanna
Confess all your sins You know you got em
The rooms in a spin the fevers pitched
I swear there's no doubt I'm legit I'm no counterfeit

I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be why you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I can make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything

You want from me
I'm not shy boy
I can be why you want
Your bright shiny toy
You just have to respond
The click never stops
But baby it's time
There's no doubt in my mind that I can make you believe

I can be what you want me be
Tonight is the night
Where I make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me be
Tonight is the night where u make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything

I'll make you believe in me
I can be what you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
I'll make you believe in me
I can be why you want me to be
Tonight is the night
Where I can make you see
That I can be anything, anything, anything
