		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be your baby
There's nothing better I'd rather do
I'm lost completely
I might as well be over the moon
I'd like it if you tried
Before you change my mind
Are you gonna be here with me
I know you better
This momentary ride
This fire by my side
Are you gonna be here with me
You know that
I'll be your baby
There's nothing better I'd rather do
I'm lost completely
I might as well be over the moon
You call me up at night
Imaginary lines
Are you gonna go back to sleep
I know you better
Than you know yourself
I'm only saying play your hand with someone else (someone else)
Don't tell me how to
Be your baby
There's nothing better I'd rather do
I'm lost completely
I might as well be over the moon
I might as well be over the moon
