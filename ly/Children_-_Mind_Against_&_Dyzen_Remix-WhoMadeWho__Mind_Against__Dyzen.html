		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are children of the rain
When every day is just the same
We run away to numb the pain

We are children of the moon
Flying on a silver spoon
Singing to a different tune
We are children of the moon

We are all the broken ones
Dance around our broken drums
Tripping on our broken sounds

Broken daughters broken sons
Magic words and Voodoo songs
Make us feel that we belong
Make us feel that we belong

We are children of the light
We reconnect and reunite
we dance our longing in the night

We are children of the dawn
Sharing it with everyone
Sharing it with everyone
Sharing it with everyone
Sharing it with everyone
