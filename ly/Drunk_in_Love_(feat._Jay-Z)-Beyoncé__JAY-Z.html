		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love, we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, in love, love
We be all night, in love, love

And we be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights, boy I'm drinking
Park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend, boy I'm drinking
Get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out, like washrags, he wet it up, boy I'm drinking
I'm singin' on the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood, grainin', grainin' on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?" Oh baby
Drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, in love, love
We be all night, in love, love (I'm nice right now, hold up)

That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' about you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' about you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side 
Ain't got the time to take drawers off on sight
Catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no I don't play
"Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!" Said, "Eat the cake, Anna Mae!" I'm nice
For y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast, we goin' in

We be all night (we be all night) in love, love
We be all night, in love, love

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing, that's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire
I've been drinkin', watermelon
I want your body right here, daddy, I want you, right now
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty, daddy, I want you

We be all night, in love, love
We be all night, in love, love
