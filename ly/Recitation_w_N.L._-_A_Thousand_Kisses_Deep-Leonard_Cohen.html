		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came to me this morning
And you handled me like meat
You'd have to be a man to know
How good that feels, how sweet

My mirrored twin, my next of kin
I'd know you in my sleep
And who but you would take me in 
A thousand kisses deep

I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I'm just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet

Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep

I know you had to lie to me
I know you had to cheat
To pose all hot and high
Behind the veils of sheer deceit

Our perfect porn aristocrat
So elegant and cheap
I'm old but I'm still into that
A thousand kisses deep

I'm good at love, I'm good at hate
It's in between I freeze
Been working out but it's too late 
It's been too late for years

But you look good, you really do
They love you on the street
If you were here I'd kneel for you
A thousand kisses deep

The autumn moved across your skin
Got something in my eye
A light that doesn't need to live 
And doesn't need to die

A riddle in the book of love
Obscure and obsolete
'Til witnessed here in time and blood
A thousand kisses deep

And I'm still working with the wine
Still dancing cheek to cheek
The band is playing Auld Lang Syne
But the heart will not retreat

I ran with Diz, I sang with Ray
I never had their sweet
But once or twice they let me play
A thousand kisses deep

I loved you when you opened
Like a lily to the heat
You see I'm just another snowman
Standing in the rain and sleet

Who loved you with his frozen love
His secondhand physique
With all he is and all he was
A thousand kisses deep

But you don't need to hear me now
And every word I speak
It counts against me anyhow
A thousand kisses deep
