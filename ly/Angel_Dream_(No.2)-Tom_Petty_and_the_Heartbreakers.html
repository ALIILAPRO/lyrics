		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamed you, 
I saw your face. 
Cut my lifeline when drifting through space. 

I saw an angel, 
I saw my fate.
I can only thank God it was not too late. 

Over mountains, 
I floated away. 
Cross an ocean, 
I dreamed her name. 

I followed an angel down through the gates. 
I can only thank God it was not too late. 

Sing a little song of loneliness, 
Sing one to make me smile. 
Another round for everyone, 
I'm here for a little while. 

Now I'm walkin'
This street on my own. 
But she's with me
Everywhere I go. 

Yeah, I found an angel, 
I found my place. 
I can only thank God it was not too late. 
I can only thank God it was not too late. 
I can only thank God it was not too late
