Oh-woah, oh, woah, oh-woah
(We Got London On Da Track)

Whole club sellin' out of here to doin' stadiums
Pussy niggas don't come around, they don't survive my radius
I keep it too real, for real and that's the shit that made me rich
Trappin', that's what made me rich
Hustlin', that's what made me rich
Ayy, whole club sellin' out of here to doin' stadiums
Small business don't come around, they don't survive my radius
Trappin' all I talk about and that's what really made me rich
Hustlin', that's what made me rich
Trappin', that's what made me rich
The whole club, ayy, ayy, ayy

McLaren way too wide to be shootin' at the opps
I'm sleepin' good night, see, the door don't got no locks
I fucked her to be spiteful, she best friends with the opps
And bitches that you buyin' bags, you need better stocks (ayy)
Standin' on my money, dawg, please, don't get the gun involved
Ain't nobody runnin' off, rules to the the basics
I can't be no son in law, I can't take the summer off
I make it look good and all but this is no vacation
All the goons they respect me and I know it
Watch your words and your tone, you're not a poet
My advice, please, don't try to be heroic
Niggas with me know they gone

Whole club sellin' out of here to doin' stadiums
Pussy niggas don't come around, they don't survive my radius
I keep it too real, for real and that's the shit that made me rich
Trappin', that's what made me rich
Hustlin', that's what made me rich
Ayy, whole club sellin' out of here to doin' stadiums
Small business don't come around, they don't survive my radius
Trappin' all I talk about and that's what really made me rich
Hustlin', that's what made me rich
Trappin', that's what made me rich
The whole club, ayy, ayy, ayy

I never had a mentor (hey, hey, hey)
I only watch Scarface (on God)
I met her at a strip club 
She twerk better when heart break (brrt, brrt, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ayy, ayy
Hood Nigga 1-0-1, I'm sellin' everything that I can sell (uh, uh, uh)
I'm prayin' for a Bentley and to never go to jail 
I'm fresh up out the gutter, I don't know if you can tell
I'm hustlin' for everything I do, I do for legacy
You can call me any type of dame, my dog, I never sleep
The only rule I got is we fuckin', don't embarrass me
I write down my problems then record it just for therapy (facts, why?)
Just for clarity (why?)

Whole club sellin' out of here to doin' stadiums
Pussy niggas don't come around, they don't survive my radius
I keep it too real, for real and that's the shit that made me rich
Trappin', that's what made me rich
Hustlin', that's what made me rich
Ayy, whole club sellin' out of here to doin' stadiums
Small business don't come around, they don't survive my radius
Trappin' all I talk about and that's what really made me rich
Hustlin', that's what made me rich
Trappin', that's what made me rich
The whole club
