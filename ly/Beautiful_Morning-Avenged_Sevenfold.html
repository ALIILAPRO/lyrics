		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I sit stoic
Touch of the divine upon my neck
Lay me gently
Take my body down, let me ascend

Help me to hear and hear me to save
And save me before I've gone too far
Let me inhale my passage to hell
While slowly exhaling the scar

You walk on water
But the water swallows you

I lay quiet
Floating in the stillness of this tomb
Headstone empty
Choking on the flowers as they bloom

No one to know and no where to hide
Nothing of me I've left behind
Silence of one the meaning of none
And letting it all go to be

You walk on water
But the water swallows you
You're like no other
You're the other one in view

Don't let it be
Don't let it be
Don't let it

It's a beautiful morning
It's a beautiful day
Everybody is smiling
A beautiful way

I took a walk to paint the flowers and the trees
The sun reflected, gazing fondly on me
I made a picture and I put it in the rays outside
It washed the paint away and carried me home
I have finally arrived

There's no one but you, two

Dressed in armor
Just the hollow shell I was before

Help me to turn my attention on me
So empty just as I was before
Let me exhale, concession to Hell
While slowly embracing the scar

You walk on water
But the water swallows you
And you're like no other
You're the other one in view
Don't let it be, don't let it be
(You walk on water) don't let it be
(But the water swallows you) don't let it be
Don't let it, don't let it
Don't let it be (and you're like no other) 
Don't let it be (you're the other one in view)
