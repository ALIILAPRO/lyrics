		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dance with me
And I'll sing to you
Symphony
Won't you kiss me
Shut me up, please
She's a Goddess, a wish from the stars
In my heart.......
Ohh yeah

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you
Symphony
Won't you kiss me
Shut me up, please
She's a Goddess, a wish from the stars

Dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Won't you kiss me
Shut me up, please
She's a Goddess, a wish from the stars

Dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Won't you kiss me
Shut me up, please
She's a Goddess, a wish from the stars

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you
Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance with me
And I'll sing to you
Symphony
Won't you kiss me
Shut me up, please
She's a Goddess, a wish from the stars

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Won't you

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you

Dance, dance with me, me
And I'll sing to you, sing to you
Symphony
Won't you
