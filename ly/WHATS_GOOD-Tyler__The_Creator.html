		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the sea shore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cop says my name, bitch, I'm Igor

Yeah, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo

Bitch, running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get gone, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same niggas like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get bucked

Yo, ayo
Uh, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch
Yeah

I see the light
Um, I see the light
I see the light 
(Uh, ah!) I see the light

Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit cool? Change the aperture
Hahahahaha I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that Claritin, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)

I see the light
I see the light
I see the light (don't touch, though, niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light (don't touch, though, niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light

That car crash couldn't take me (woo, ha)
Green hair angels all around me (uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint, like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver swingin' like new jack
Two of 'em, I total, Kim and Pam
Me and Death, universe plays middle man
Quit nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no stretch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one to one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the 
Light

I see the light 
(Woo)
I see the light 
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with it
