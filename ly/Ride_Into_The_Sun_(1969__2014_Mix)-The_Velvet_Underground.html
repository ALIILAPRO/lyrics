		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking for another chance for someone else to be
Looking for another place to ride into the sun

Ride into the sun, ride into the sun
Ride into the sun ride into the sun
Where -

everything seems so pretty
But if you're tired and you're sick of the city
Remember that it's just a flower, made out of clay
Oh, the city

Where everything seems so dirty
But if you're tired and you're filled with self-pity
Remember that you're just one more person who's there

It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city, oh - oh - oh
It's hard to live in the city, oh - wow - wow
It's hard to live in the city
