		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess all the mountains that I moved just weren't enough
And all those nights I walked you home 
From crowded bars when you were drunk
Well they meant nothing 'cause you up and walked away
And I just wonder what it'd take to make you stay

'Cause when you said jump I said how high
But when I jumped you said goodbye

I would've walked through hell
To find another way
I would've laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I would've crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight

What did you do with all that love you couldn't give
And do you need someone to help you tell you what to do with it
It must be nice to love someone who puts you first
Then walk away when they expect it in return

'Cause when you said jump I said how high
But when I jumped you said goodbye

I would've walked through hell
To find another way
I would've laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I would've crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight

You don't want me
Nothing I can do
'Cause you don't wanna try

I would've walked through hell
To find another way
I would've laid me down
If I knew that you would stay
I would've crossed the stars
To keep you in my life
But now I'm falling hard
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight
Without you here tonight

Without you here tonight
