		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picture perfect at the worst of you
Always say you know when you know and I knew
Never been so high or so blue
You say that you feel it too

So how could you, how could you go and fall for that?
How could she, how could she compare to what we had?

I hope you're unhappier
Think of me when you're in her
She's making you miss me more
I hope you are unhappier
So do you go back and forth
Like your heart's still stuck at war?
When sparks fly, I hope it burns
I hope you are unhappier

If she's your type then what was I?
Do you like her height and her bright blue eyes?
She's petite and so sweet, worst of all, she's not me
So how good can it really be?

So how could you, how could you go and fall for that?
How could she, how could she compare to what we had?

I hope you're unhappier
Think of me when you're in her
She's making you miss me more
I hope you are unhappier
So do you go back and forth
Like your heart's still stuck at war?
When sparks fly, I hope it burns
I hope you are unhappier

Oh, how could you
Want someone new?
You don't need to
I hope you are unhappier
Oh, how could you
Want someone new
Oh, if you do
I hope you are unhappier

I hope you're unhappier
Think of me when you're in her
She's making you miss me more
I hope you are unhappier
So do you go back and forth
Like your heart's still stuck at war?
When sparks fly, I hope it burns
I hope you are unhappier
