		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me over
Take me over now
When love is blind
You're out of sight
But never out of mind
Take me over 
Take me over now
Time will tell that I can't help myself 
When we're not sober
Cause I don't want to let go
I tell myself that I need you
When I see you
So take me through the night
Until the morning light
Come erase my mind
Cause I know that
In these blinding lights
We can shine so bright
So come erase my mind
Take me over 
Take me over now
My sweet delight
Dressed in white
With diamonds in your eyes
Take me over
Take me over now
One more taste so I can chase our love 
When we're not sober
Cause i don't want to let go
I tell myself that i need You
When I see you
So take me through the night
Until the morning light
Come erase my mind
Cause I know that
In these blinding lights
We can shine so bright
So come erase my mind
