		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  S-O-S she's in disguise
S-O-S she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl, that's all you ask of me
Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now, with eyes wide open
My body is craving, so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday
And Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused
Like a coffee machine in an office (uh)
So I'm gonna go somewhere closer
To get me a lover and tell you about it

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free (ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Sitting across the bar, staring right at her prey
It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single man
I've got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline
In case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos
Or rich city guys, who just want to enjoy (uh)
By having a very good time
And behave very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set her free (ah-ooh)
There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S-O-S she's in disguise
S-O-S she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

S-O-S she's in disguise
S-O-S she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

There's a she-wolf in your closet
Let it out so it can breathe
