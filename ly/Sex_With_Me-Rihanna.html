		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sex with me, so amazing
All this hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga, like a station
Sex with me, so amazing
Sex with me, so amazing

Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it (five fingers)
Hit it like you own it, I'ma hit it like I'm on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
(Shots, shots, shots, shots)
Baby, I'ma pick your poison
Ooh-wee, ah-yeah, you gon' need it
I'm off that la-la
I'ma get it wet like Jacuzzi 

And sex with me, so amazing
All this hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
So amazing, so amazing

You know I got the sauce (sauce), you know I'm saucy
And it's always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I'ma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
When I'm making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it'll feel alright
The sex doesn't get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I'm Monroe
Even if I'm alone

Sex with me, so amazing
All this hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Hit a switch on a fake nigga like a station
Sex with me so amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing

Sex with me, so amazing
