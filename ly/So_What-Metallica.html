		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So fucking what!

Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton
I've been to Eastbourne too
So what, so what
And I've been here, I've been there
I've been every fucking where
So what, so what
So what, so what, you boring little cunt

Well, who cares, who cares what you do
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you

Well, I've fucked the queen, I've fucked Bach
I've even sucked an old man's cock
So what, so what
And I've fucked a sheep, I've fucked a goat
I rammed my cock right down its throat
So what, so what
So what, so what, you boring little fuck

Well, who cares, who cares what you do
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you

And I've drunk that, I've drunk this
I've spewed up on a pint of piss
So what, so what
I've had scank, I've had speed
I've jacked up until I bleed
So what, so what
So what, so what, you boring little cunt

Well, who cares, who cares what you do
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you, you

A-hahaha!

Yeah!

I've had crabs, I've had lice
I've had the clap and that ain't nice
So what, so what
I've fucked this, I've fucked that
I've even fucked a school girl's twat
So what, so what
So what, so what, you boring little fuck

Well, who cares, who cares what you do
And, who cares, who cares about you, you, you, you, you, you

So fucking what!
Yeah
