		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel the rythm of the streets
Neon lights and neon dreams
Bloody fists they feel no pain
When there's so much more to gain
Hunting season if you will
Tell me where you'd rather be
I can hardly see the moon
Hope we'll get there pretty soon

Trying so hard to release
You're out of the misery
Hold on to your wishes
If you can't hold on to me

Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now

They will finally feel the flames
Flames that run down through my veins
I will make the city burn
We're not planning to return

Trying so hard to be free
To make you see what I see
Hold on to your wishes
If you can't hold on to me

Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now
Forgive me for letting you down
Forgive me for letting you down again
I guess I'm not strong enough
Right now

Oh, my love (let you down)
Love (oh, let you down)
Love (oh, let you down)
Oh, let you down (oh, let you down)
Oh, let you down (oh, let you down)
Let you down (let you down)
Oh let you down (oh, let you down)
