		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fucked up
Lost loving
Today I know ya gonna call me
I hate bad endings
On the low you got me feeling lonely
Love
I just can't entertain ya
Less small talk u know I fucking hate it
Wasted, faded, tell me what your name is
Lost stories, I don't wanna play and pretend

Yes love we'll go to that party
Another shut down I'll see ya in the morning
Give me reasons why I gotta focus
I don't wanna talk till I'm falling into pieces

Lipstick on my brand new T-shirt
Missed calls and I hate when you do it again
Chitchat but it all means nothing
Talk shit 'bout your friends won't you say it to them

Oh, oh, oh oh, way-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, way-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, way-oh-oh-oh
Bet you never say it to them

Goddamn, there's no time to talk left
My bad, I left all your texts on read
How many times have I heard you give excuses for things you said
But I got nothing left to give you girl
Like I said, I've had enough of you
And I bet you've been fucking these others dudes
Throw the dice to go all in just to lose

We fall apart, just the way that you wanted to
Broken heart with the weight on my shoulders
Tattoos cover up all the scars you left behind
But not this time

Lipstick on my brand new T-shirt
Missed calls and I hate when you do it again
Chitchat but it all means nothing
Talk shit 'bout your friends won't you say it to them

Oh, oh, oh oh, way-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, way-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, way-oh-oh-oh
Bet you never say it to them
