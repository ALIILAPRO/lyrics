		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so hard to look the other way
It's so hard to not pick up the phone
Bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day
It's so hard to look the other way
Tell me something that will push me away
Tell me something that will push me away
I took something for the pain, it never took it away, nah

It's only two and I took two today
Already took two today
But the truth is I never wanted you to stay
But you do what you want, yeah and I wanted it that way
Pushing through the city in my four by four
By two, yeah, barely fitted through the drive-thru
Wanna slide by you
So hard not to tell you he a sucker
So hard to see you suffer, let you see for yourself
Yeah, it's hard for me to trust ya
But I know this bust down Patek won't switch sides, yeah
I know this Lambo won't switch sides, yeah
I know my true fans won't switch sides
If I give my new bitch just a lil time, she'll be big time

And it'll be hard to look the other way
But it's still so hard to not pick up the phone
Bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day
It's so hard to look the other way
Tell me something that will push me away
Tell me something that will push me away
I took something for the pain, yeah
But it's still so hard to look the other way
So hard to not pick up the phone
Bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day, yeah
So hard to look the other way
Tell me something that will push me away
Tell me something that will push me away
I took something for the pain, it never took it away, nah, nah

Now my new thing ain't you but it feels good 'cause it's new
Don't have to check the 'gram to know your move
Yeah, I need a Khaled, gon' pop me another one
I need a Khaled, gon' find me another one (another one)
Gon' buy me another one
You could lie to the other one
Say something that will push me away
You brought out the beast, I can't put it away
Truth is, yeah, I wanted you to stay
But the door tryna close and my foot's in the way
Push me away, tell 'em I was unconditional
Tell 'em how I strengthened your spiritual
Tell 'em I know you like I invented you

That's why it's so hard to look the other way
It's so hard to not pick up the phone
Bang your line one time and ask 'bout your day
So hard to look the other way
Tell me something that will push me away
Tell me something that will push me away
I took something for the pain, it never took it away, nah, nah
