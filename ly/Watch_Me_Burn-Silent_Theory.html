		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this venom that you speak, condescending
No pretending
Vandalize the weak, ask for seconds
No repenting
Blood in my eyes so I guess it's okay

Burn the bridges, let them smolder
Every sorry sucker looking
Over their shoulder
For a little intuition and
A lazy superstition just to help this venom
With a little exposure
There's mud in my veins just
To help me get by

So help my lie, lie, lie

Now I'm stuck here waiting for the
Flames to burn me down
It's like plucking off the wings of a
Fly just to watch it drown
Now my hands are bound and
My head keeps spinning
If I just keep calm maybe I'll keep grinning
Yeah the haze is thick but
It seems it's thinning
And I still can't see the sun

When you kick the nest that holds the hornet
It stings the flesh
A toxin borne with no regret
Absorb the thorn, preach the hate
Yet beg for more
Pay for the ways that you helped decay
The shame I can blame but the price
To pay is a hefty one a lonely one
I find the vigilante with the loaded gun

It was funny now but then it seems so fake
You would think that a fool
Has a lot at stake
But tides change and lies fade but
I will never go away
Now I don't have time to help you get by

So help my lie, lie, lie

Now I'm stuck here waiting for the
Flames to burn me down
It's like plucking off the wings of a
Fly just to watch it drown
Now my hands are bound and
My head keeps spinning
If I just keep calm maybe I'll keep grinning
Yeah the haze is thick but
It seems it's thinning
And I still can't see the sun

Now my hands are bound and I'm spinning
(spinning)

Better pick it up quick, better get it now
This severed chain that I can claim what
You could never find I found
Now no one run, he's got a gun
They're shooting kids, they're having fun
They're product placed with a double face
They've changed the way they play the game

There's an oversaturation of
A desperate situation
Should we emphasis exposure maybe
Place a limitation maybe it's an epidemic
We're deserving what we're getting
Are we destined for
Destruction or reconciliation?

Now I'm stuck here waiting for the
Flames to burn me down
It's like plucking off the wings of a
Fly just to watch it drown
Now my hands are bound and
My head keeps spinning
If I just keep calm maybe I'll keep grinning
Yeah the haze is thick but
It seems it's thinning
And I still can't see the sun

(My hands are bound and
My head keeps spinning)
Still can't see the sun
(If I just keep calm
Maybe I'll keep grinning)
Still can't see the sun
(Now I'm stuck here waiting for the
Flames to burn me down)
