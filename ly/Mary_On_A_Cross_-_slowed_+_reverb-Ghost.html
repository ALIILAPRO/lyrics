		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were speeding together down the dark avenues
But besides all the stardom, all we got was blues
But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go
We were scanning the cities, rocking to pay their dues
But besides all the glamour, all we got was bruised
But through all the sorrow, we've been riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

We were searching for reasons to play by the rules
But we quickly found it was just for fools
Now through all the sorrow, we'll be riding high
And the truth of the matter is I never let you go, let you go

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Not just another bloody Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a

You go down just like Holy Mary
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
Your beauty never ever scared me
Mary on a, Mary on a cross
If you choose to run away with me
I will tickle you internally
And I see nothing wrong with that

(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
Nothing wrong with that
(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
(Mary on a) Mary on a cross
