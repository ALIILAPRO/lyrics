		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And once again I've walked away
From the part of me
That I'm scared to fight 
That I didn't want to find
That I didn't want to face 

Now and then I look for you
Even though you're gone
I just get through the day
Dream that things will change
But they always stay the same
I can't reason with the pain 

Seems like you're broken
Silence in motion
By dark emotions I can see
The void is left open
I can see it as it is
The loneliness lived 
But it's too late right now
I can see it as it is
Your emptiness lived 
And if you listen closely you can hear
A quiet commotion

The darkest stars absorb the night 
And you were one
Burnt out to become 
A fragile human light  
The living left behind 

This silent battle born from loss 
Hidden away 
The memories I will save
Forgiveness found a way 
Living with this change 
Courage breaks the pain

Seems like you're broken
Silence in motion
By dark emotions I can see
The void is left open
I can see it as it is
The loneliness lived 
Just a memory now
I can see it as it is
Your emptiness lived 
And if you listen closely you can hear
A quiet commotion
