		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye always starts with hello
That's why I don't trust anyone that walks through the door
But I'll throw that out the window
I'm just gonna pretend that this gon' end on a good note

But it's not a good note, it's never a good note
But I'll keep my eyes closed

I can't see the end, so I pretend it's sweet
Until it crashes down, I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out for me
No, no, no, I don't wanna see
It all come crashin' down, I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out

Hello always ends with goodbye
How would I know this time's not different if I don't even try?
They'll make believe it's fun sometimes
So I'll just keep pretending this will end on a good note

But it's not a good note, it's never a good note
But I'll keep my eyes closed
Pretend like I don't know how this is gonna go
'Cause it's not a good note, it's never a good note

I can't see the end, so I pretend it's sweet
Until it crashes down, I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out for me
No, no, no, I don't wanna see
It all come crashin' down, I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out

(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

I can't see the end, so I pretend it's sweet
Until it crashes down, I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out for me
No, no, no, I don't wanna see
It all come crashin' down, I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out
