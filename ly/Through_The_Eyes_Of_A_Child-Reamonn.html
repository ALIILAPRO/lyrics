		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet innocent child, with your open eyes
You've seen us for who 
We really are 
And I know that we will be tomorrow
So that hope can have it's glory day
And I wish that this world will embrace you from magic stars and mystery
My open heart

Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child

I know you, I've seen your face before you brought me 
To this open door, afraid to walk through 
Please take my hand 

And I know that we will be tomorrow
So that hope can have it's glory day
And I wish that this world embrace you from magic stars and mystery
My open heart

Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child

And I see where we'll go from here
'Cause love doesn't break
With the right amount of care
In your hands is whom you've choosen to be
Life is a freedom
Now go out there and be free

Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child
Why did we make it so hard, this life is so complicated 
Until we see it through the eyes of a child
