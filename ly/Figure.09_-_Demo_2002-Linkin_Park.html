		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happenin'
It's like nothing I can do would distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
'Cause from the infinite words I can say I
Put all pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of setting it free I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

(Never goes away)
(Never goes away)

And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

Hearing your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to 'em and everyday
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see that I
Took what I hated and made it a part of me

(Never goes away)
(Never goes away)

And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

(Never goes away)
(Never goes away)
(It never goes away)
(It never goes away)
(Get away from me)

Give me my space back you gotta just (go)
Everything comes down the memories of (you)
I've kept it in without letting you (know)
I've let you go so get away from (me)
Give me my space back you gotta just (go)
Everything comes down the memories of (you)
I've kept it in without letting you (know)
I've let you go

And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you

I've let myself become you
I've let myself become
Lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you
