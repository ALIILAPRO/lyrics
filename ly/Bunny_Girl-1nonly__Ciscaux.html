That lil' bitch she bad
I told her hold up
I cannot love no thot
She playing like controller
All I want is fucking bands
Counting commas
Shout out Greedo
Now I'm selling shows
At a five star casino

Tell that bitch to stop
Now drop
Throw it back
If you talking shit 
I'ma fold you like a Mac
That lil' bitch a goth girl
Yeah, that's where it's at
You be under pressure 
No snot, that's a fact

That lil' bitch she bad
I told her hold up
I cannot love no thot
She playing like controller
All I want is fucking bands
Counting commas
Shout out Greedo
Now I'm selling shows
At a five star casino

Tell that bitch to stop
Now drop
Throw it back
If you talking shit 
I'ma fold you like a Mac
That lil' bitch a goth girl
Yeah, that's where it's at
You be under pressure 
No snot, that's a fact

Hold up
Baby, I be under pressure
With my homies smoking pressure
I can do this with no effort 
In the backseat tearing leather
Baby rubbing on my Ksubis
She just wanna feel the texture
My bro came an tried to warn me
She might play me if I let her
But she sweet just like a Rolo
Go ahead stop and do it slow mo'
Yeah, let's make this last forever
Baby, go and take a photo
Shorty got me taking risks
I feel like Drake I'm yelling yolo
Got me hypnotized 
The way she bring it back just like a yoyo
Y'all be saying that they hard
But I be thinking that they so so
If you try and do me dirty
I'ma do you Fabuloso
Shoutout Rico that's the bro bro
I cant switch, yo that's the bro code
That girl tryna play these games
But she a thot, oh, that's a no go
Fuck it one, two, come through
Baby girl, I want you
I been running through the city
But I'ma be home soon
Three, four out the door 
Skrrt off like Aventador
That lil' bitch she bad
She got me going up in all the stores
Five, six, seven, eight hit it like the renegade
We been waiting on this
For a minute time to celebrate
Now it's time for me to dash
Sign off like the autograph
I might take her to the pad
Wanna know why 
'Cause that lil' bitch she bad

I told her hold up
I cannot love no thot
She playing like controller
All I want is fucking bands
Counting commas
Shout out Greedo
Now I'm selling shows
At a five star casino

Tell that bitch to stop
Now drop
Throw it back
If you talking shit 
I'ma fold you like a Mac
That lil' bitch a goth girl
Yeah, that's where it's at
You be under pressure 
No snot, that's a fact

That lil' bitch she bad
I told her hold up
I cannot love no thot
She playing like controller
All I want is fucking bands
Counting commas
Shout out Greedo
Now I'm selling shows
At a five star casino

Tell that bitch to stop
Now drop
Throw it back
If you talking shit 
I'ma fold you like a Mac
That lil' bitch a goth girl
Yeah, that's where it's at
You be under pressure 
No snot, that's a fact

The world is yours
