		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, I touched a M, I just went insane
(Yeah) i just went and bought that Rollie
Filled that bitch with rain (Yeah)
That bitch pull up, suck on
Give me Helmut Lang (Yeah)
Bitch, we rich and you not, no
We not the same (Not the same)

That boy broke, no, he not (Uh)
That boy broke as hell nah, he not gang
(Yeah) all these racks I made off codeine
Might go buy a chain (Yeah)
Half of these niggas
They really owe me but I'm
Rich so can't complain
Yeah, nigga, free my brothers out that chain
(Out that chain) yeah, hell nah
I ain't even talkin' Johnny Dang
Yеah, your lil' ho too basic, yeah
She plain (That ho plain)
Fill my wrist up with them racks
It cost a privatе plane (Private plane)
Yeah, not even for a ho
I can't stop the drank (Yeah)
Yeah, I just told my bitch
I need another break (Yeah)
I just fucked her friend 'cause
All these bitches fake (Ayy! Uh)
Passed that ho to twin 'cause
All these hoes the same
I just drop top coupe the Benz, bitch
I know this shit insane
His bitch on my dick
I bought that ho some Cane's
Me and my brother in the trap
That bitch just like the bank
We gon' send that nigga up
Just like my fuckin' rank
Free my brother out that pen
You know he keep a shank
We got chickens in the den
We got racks for days
Bitch, that Draco hit his kid
That shit was no mistake, yeah
All my twins, they duckin' 12
Take 'em on a chase
SOD just like Big Draco, think I need a rake
OVO and TwizzyRich, lil' bitch, yeah
Shoutout Drake
Really rich, I fuck them racks up
Yeah, right in the Wraith, ha
Double R shit, go ask your bitch, yeah
'cause we not the same

Yeah, go 'head
Go ask your bitch how the hell I taste
I went and ran up a M or two, bitch
All I got is them blue face
I'm on the side of the Lamb'
I'm on the side of the plane
I told the pilot to land
Just know that we ain't the same
I went in YSL
Bought them denims jeans and a shirt or two
(Ooh, huh)
Yeah, you talkin' like you damn rich
We ain't never heard of you (Ooh, huh)
Yeah, hunnids on hunnids on hunnids
I'm at the top with the GM (Ooh, huh)
I got hundreds of hundreds of toppers
All them bitch in my DM (Ooh, huh)
Yeah, I'm on the bean, I'm on the neon
(Yeah) yeah, I need some lean
I need some Wock' I can lean on (Yeah)
Yeah, but bitch you a fiend
We don't got nothin' you be on
I just pulled up, I step
In the Margiela, yeah
And I put the Celine on

Bitch, I touched a M, I just went insane
(Yeah) i just went and bought that Rollie
Filled that bitch with rain (Yeah)
That bitch pull up, suck on
Give me Helmut Lang (Yeah)
Bitch, we rich and you not, no
We not the same (Not the same)

That boy broke, no, he not (Uh)
That boy broke as hell nah, he not gang
