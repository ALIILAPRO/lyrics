		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  New beginnings
Wishful thinking
All the wheels are spinning in my head 
And I'm craving that nervous feeling 

Like the one that comes and goes so fast 
But, I want this one to linger
So keep on holding me close like that
Tell me how my name echoes through your brain
And, all I know is I'm thinking of you tonight and I'm ready now to take the leap
Cause with the way you're looking at me
You're making me fall
Making me fall in deep
You're making me fall in deep

Tragic endings
From mindless dreaming
Yeah, all these fears are reeling in my head 
And I'm praying that your love is different 

From the ones that come and go so fast
Yeah, I want this one to linger
So keep on holding me close like that 
Tell me how my name echoes through your brain
And, all I know is I'm thinking of you tonight and I'm ready now to take the leap 
Cause with the way you're looking at me
You're making me fall
Making me fall in deep 
You're making me fall in deep

Ohhhhhhhh 

Yeah I'm sinking fast in uncharted waters
But I tell myself you're not like the others 
It's treacherous this game we play
When cruel intentions get in the way 
But, I'm ready now to let go of all my fears
I pray you won't
Pray you won't disappear 
So tell me now that you'll stay right here and not be just like 

All the ones that come
And go so fast
Yeah, I want this love to be the one that lasts 

Not like the ones that come and go so fast
No, I want this one to linger
So keep on holding me close like that
Tell me how my name echoes through your brain
And, all I know is I'm thinking of you tonight and I'm ready now to take the leap
Cause with the way you're looking at me
You're making me fall, making me fall
Cause with the way you're looking at me 
You're making me fall in deep

New beginnings
