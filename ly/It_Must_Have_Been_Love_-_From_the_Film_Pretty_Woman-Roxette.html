		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It must have been love
But it's over now

Lay a whisper on my pillow 
Leave the winter on the ground 
I wake up lonely, this air of silence 
In the bedroom and all around 

Touch me now
I close my eyes 
And dream away

It must have been love
But it's over now 
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow 
It must have been love
But it's over now 
From the moment we touched 
'Til the time had run out 

Make believing 
We're together 
That I'm sheltered
By your heart 
But in and outside
I turn to water 
Like a teardrop 
In your palm 

And it's a hard 
Winter's day 
I dream away

It must have been love (it must have been love) 
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted 
Now I'm living without 
It must have been love
But it's over now 
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows 

It must have been love (it must have been love) 
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It must have been good
But I lost it somehow 
It must have been love (it must have been love) 
But it's over now (but it's over now)
From the moment we touched 
'Til the time had run out

Yeah, It must have been love (it must have been love) 
But it's over now (but it's over now)
It was all that I wanted 
Now I'm living without 
It must have been love
But it's over now 
It's where the water flows
It's where the wind blows 

Oh
It must have been love 
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Now 
Must have been love (it must have been love) 
But it's over now (but it's over now)
Now
