Sell your soul, give them everything you own (everything you own)
Keep your eyes on your TV and your phone (and your phone)
Poison in the water, everybody knows (everybody knows)
Go to work and sell your motherfuckin' soul (fuck your soul)
Never (?) With the devil would you turn the fuck up (turn the fuck up)
Everyone lies, everybody tryna turn the fuck up

Get to the racks, get to the stacks, motherfucker

You all want the same thing, let my nuts hangs, dangle and swang (yeah)
Pinky ring size of a plane, uh
Spider gang, Lil' Darkie on that shit that make your mama faint, uh
In the whip (skrrt), fuckin' up the paint, uh
Fake people actin' real, but I know that you ain't, uh
I know that you fake, uh, I can see the signs (yeah)
Sell your souls and both your eyes so that you go blind

Money, power, fame, money, power, fame, money, power
Money, power, fame, money, power, fame, money, power
Money, power, fame, money, power, fame, money, power
Money, power, fame, money, power, fame, money, power
