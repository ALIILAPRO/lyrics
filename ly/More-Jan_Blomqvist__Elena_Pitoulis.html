		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna get old
Don't wanna die young
I'm buyin' their cold, void satisfaction
Our poison each day, no reason to stay
New feelings in store

Alright, gimme more

We could have been the ones who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones who turned machines at once
We could have been the ones who left the scene at once
We could have been the ones who took the streets at once

We could have been the ones who left the scene at once
Could have been the ones who took the streets at once

Never gets old, my sad addiction
Let us now hold the satisfaction
Don't wanna buy gold, don't wanna buy love
'Cause now it is all sold
There's never enough
It's never enough

We could have been the ones who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones who turned machines at once
We could have been the ones who left the scene at once
We could have been the ones (ones, ones) who took the streets at once

We could have been the ones who cut the screen at once
We should have seen the ones who turned machines at once
You could have been the one
