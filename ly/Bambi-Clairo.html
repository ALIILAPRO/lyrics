		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh
Ooh

I'm stepping inside a universe
Designed against my own beliefs
They're toying with me and tapping their feet
The work's laid out, cut out to the seams

It's not that I crave
Any more company
I'd like to say, say a few things
Clearing your throat while I count to three
Keep hold of my hand
We both know I can leave

Ooh
Ooh

I don't like to cry, before I know why
But honestly, I might
You pick a new fight, wiping tears from the night
Blue ribbon ties while emotions are high

I told all my friends
They were glad to see
Sat in a circle, in front of my Claud's tapestry
In a dorm less than three
Minutes to drive
We both can always

Take it or leave it
The moments here
And you should believe it
Know that you should

I pull until I'm left with the burns
Blisters and the dirt left in-between my fingers
Rushing so I can beat the line
But what if all I want is conversation and time?
I move so I don't have to think twice
I drift and float through counties with my one sided climb

Once, I oughta make a choice to move forward
I'll take, I'll take a picture for your locker
