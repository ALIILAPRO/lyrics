		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See my scars
They come from the other half
The drowning god
My words are bouncing off the ground
I see them all around
But your back was turned
My heart had to learn

These years, what a theft
I'm forty-six now
How many left?

Recall the red sun burning
Over the avenues and into our view
Radiance that signified
Magnified divergent hue

I see the last day turning
Straight into emptiness
How did it get so late?
Your little voice is shadow now
Sowing the seeds to segregate

Opaline, saw the trail of the fleeting twin
Through last years grass
With the curtain closing in a bit
I will go where I see fit
Love me not
For I was never one to pass the test, no
All for the best, you're heading east
If you go now, I go west

I see the last day turning
Straight into emptiness
How did it get so late?
Your little voice is shadow now
Sowing the seeds to segregate

Gliding weightless
Through the vapor
Off the map and into loss
No more wisdom here to gather
No more boundaries to cross

I see the last day turning
Straight into emptiness
How did it get so late?
Your little voice is shadow now
Sowing the seeds to segregate

I had a futile dream
It rose from loving you
But the debt has broken my back
There's no need to retaliate
As your train has left our track
