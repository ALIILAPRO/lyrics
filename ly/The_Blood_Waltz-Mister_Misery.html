		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so black

To the graveyard I'm bound
Cause here it's so lonely
Is there nothing to live or to die for anymore?
Will I find peace below?

It's so black
Nothing can be seen
It's so black
Yeah now I can't feel

In death is where I'll be
And this song will play forever

Would you wipe my tears when they fall?
Help when I crumble down?
Would you lick the blood from my arms?
All the blood from my arms

It's so black

Stark and stale my body rots away
(Yeah it rots away)
Reality is not a fairytale, it's a twisted game
I'm bound to the other side

Now it's so black
Nothing can be seen
It's so black
Yeah now I can't feel

In death is where I'll be
And this song will play forever

Would you wipe my tears when they fall?
Help when I crumble down?
Would you lick the blood from my arms?
All the blood from my arms (all the blood)
When it all comes crashing down
Would you lick the blood from my arms?
All the blood from my arms (all the blood)

I know how it feels to break
Now I can't hear a sound
It's so black, black, black
And so lonely
In the blood, the blood waltz
(Now the blood runs on)
I know how it feels to break
Now I can't hear a sound (No I can't)

If death is what you seek
Then cut your wrists up deeper

Would you wipe my tears when they fall?
Help when I crumble down?
Would you lick the blood from my arms?
All the blood from my arms (all the blood)

Would you lick the blood from my arms?
All the blood from my arms?
It's so black
