		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You thought that I would be so hurt 
And guess I was for maybe a week or so, it's
Kinda crazy what I learned
Shoulda listened to your exes when they said, "don't"

You take all your issues
Blame 'em on everyone else
I'll bet that if you
Could, you'd
Go on a date with yourself

Oh, you think that you're so fucking cool (so cool)
Got a new girl and some new tattoos
Yeah, way too fucking cool (too cool)
But all your best friends really hate you too

Every time I hear your name, why's it make me sick?
Ooh, it's driving me insane that I'm not over it
I can't seem to get away from you (from you)
I would say, "hi", but you're way too fucking cool

Hit me up on my birthday
I didn't ask, but you told me you're doing well, yeah
Any way to control me, uh
Making up feelings you never felt

You take all your issues
Blame 'em on everyone else
I'll bet that if you
Could, you'd
Go on a date with yourself

Oh, you think that you're so fucking cool (so cool)
Got a new girl and some new tattoos
Yeah, way too fucking cool (too cool)
But all your best friends really hate you too

Every time I hear your name, why's it make me sick?
Ooh, it's driving me insane that I'm not over it
I can't seem to get away from you (from you)
I would say, "hi", but you're way too fucking cool

I can't believe you made me think
Something so good could last
Stupid me
Was so na√Øve to think you'd ever come back

Oh, you think that you're so fucking cool (so cool)
Got a new girl and some new tattoos
Yeah, way too fucking cool (too cool)
But all your best friends really hate you too

Every time I hear your name, why's it make me sick? (why's it make me sick?)
Ooh, it's driving me insane that I'm not over it (that I'm not over it)
I can't seem to get away from you (from you)
I would say, "hi", but you're way too fucking cool
