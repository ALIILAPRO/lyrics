		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah listen the flow
Is killing your monsters
I am supposed to take it all, yeah
Jump on your floor
His word on your door
Remember the words, I'm the king of the North

Dust and fire, hey, hey
Bite like a tiger, hey, hey, hey
We make it together, hey, hey
This is the blow ya,, hey, hey, hey
Dust and fire, bite like a tiger
We make it together, this is the blow ya
Dust and fire, bite like a tiger
We make it together, this is the blow ya
Listen to my, listen to my
Listen to my, and are you ready for
Rata, rata, rata, rata, rata-ta-ta-ta

Ride a benzo, get your bands up
Ride a benzo, get your bands up
Ride a benzo, get your bands up
And are you ready for radio dancehall?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
For the the dance of the night, for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
For the the dance of the night, for the dance of the night?
Drive your benzo, get your bands up
Drive your benzo, get your bands up
Drive your benzo, get your bands up

The golden boy, the youngest glory
I want no money but write the story
I bet you're sorry
Don't fuck my homies
I got the notice, my kingdom's coming
Rata-ta-ta-ta, homie, the youngest glory
I want no money but write the story
I bet you're sorry
Don't fuck my homies
I got the notice, my kingdom's coming

Dust and fire, hey, hey
Bite like a tiger, hey, hey, hey
We make it together, hey, hey
This is the blow ya,, hey, hey, hey
Dust and fire, bite like a tiger
We make it together, this is the blow ya
Dust and fire, bite like a tiger
We make it together, this is the blow ya
Listen to my, listen to my
Listen to my, and are you ready for
Rata, rata, rata, rata, rata-ta-ta-ta

Ride a benzo, get your bands up
Ride a benzo, get your bands up
Ride a benzo, get your bands up
And are you ready for radio dancehall?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
For the the dance of the night, for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
So are you ready for the dance of the night?
For the dance of the night, for the dance of the night
