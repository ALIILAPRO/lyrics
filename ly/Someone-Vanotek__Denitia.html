		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling apart under avenue lights
All of these streets don’t look right

Fall into your arms every single night
Only when i close my eyes

Tell me that you really want me
Tell me that you really changed
Tell me that you got a reason
Tell me that you wanna stay

Tell me that you realize it
Tell me that you made mistakes
Tell me baby i’ll believe you
Tell me that I'll find a place

Somewhere I can run
Someone I can trust
Someone I can hold on
With all of my heart

I know it’s useless but I can’t forget
Days when you were on my side

Tell me what’s out there that you cannot get
Right here in my loving arms

Tell me that you really want me
Tell me that you really changed
Tell me that you got a reason
Tell me that you wanna stay

Tell me that you realize it
Tell me that you made mistakes
Tell me baby I’ll believe you
Tell me that I'll find a place

Somewhere I can run
Someone i can trust
Someone i can hold on
With all of my heart

Everything I do
I do for you
Everywhere I go
I know I am a fool
Trying for so long
Waiting here for you
Don't know what to do

Somewhere I can run
Someone I can trust
Someone I can hold on
With all of my heart
