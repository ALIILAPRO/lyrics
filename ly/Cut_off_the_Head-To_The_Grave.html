		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slaves to the saw
Bloodshed on red carpets
Roll 'em out, every sick dog marked a target
Shove all your help
Shoveling shit on my shoulders
And cracking their belts

Cancer cut from the meat
Tumor torn from their teeth
I've taken bigger shits than their band
You'll learn to snitch, learn to burn every bridge
Open every decade old slit on the wrist
Hold out your hands

Here's some advice, stop
Not much left after they've taken their cuts
Give up
Cunts that can't hack it and kids that won't make the

Sliced necks
Kill all your friends
Do anything to get a head
What the fuck is the message again?
All pretend, no substance
Cut them down to size
Ties are severed, severed, severed
They said over my dead body
I said my fucking pleasure
Deathcore is dead

Cut off the head
Too sick to save
Don't speak its name
Rip out the page, rip out the page

Slaves to the grave
Oh yes, we're making a killing
Got 'em all hooked, dragged into the sheds for the milking
Get the message yet?
Take a fucking hint
The truth, hard to stomach
Cut your shoot, this is your bit, yuck

Killing for the sake of killing
I'll save you some time, I've checked
There's nothing new in the lyrics
You're all just maggots swarming on my meat
Defecate on your dinner plates
Already morbid obese
Still, they ordered a feast

Advice? Stop
Puppets have tangled their strings
Dying in nooses they made
Too many flies on the wall, might need to fumigate

Sliced necks
Kill all your friends
Do anything to get a head
What the fuck is the message again?
All weakness, no justice
Cut them down to size
Ties are severed, severed, severed
They said "over my dead body"
I said my fucking pleasure
Deathcore is dead

They're teaching violence to their offspring
Carve a meat chart right into their fucking soft skin
Just to help them never forget the side they picked
Given a birds-eye view through chain-link
Armed and active, it's target practice
Look what the rat dragged in

Dying, weak
In the bin
