		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, darling, darling, darling
Why did you shoot yourself in the foot again?

Darling, darling, darling, darling
I shot myself in the foot again (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Drumming, drumming, drumming, drumming (brrap, bap)
Fell through the roof again
What a day, what a day (ooh)

I'm bothered by my illusions of nightmares of werewolves
What a day, what a day
I'm cornered by your delusion that I might be an angel
Where are your wings?
Where are the wings?

I'm mister
Mister, mister
I'm Mr. Insanity
I'm sorry, I messed up
Messed up, messed up
I paid for your sanity

Darling, darling, darling, darling
The walls are turning red again (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Bawling, bawling, bawling, bawling
My tears are on the roof again
What a day, what a day (oh)

I'm bothered by my illusions of nightmares of werewolves
What a day, what a day
I'm cornered by your delusion that I might be an angel
Where are your wings?
Where are the wings?

I'm mister
Mister, mister
I'm Mr. Insanity
I'm sorry, I messed up
Messed up, messed up
I paid for your sanity (hey)

Do you see the stars?
Do you see the lights?
Pouring out my eyes
They're pouring out your lies

Do you see the stars?
Do you see the lights?
Pouring out my eyes
They're pouring out your lies

Oh, I'm mister
Mister, mister
I'm Mr. Insanity
I'm sorry, I messed up
Messed up, messed up
I paid for your sanity
