		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come baby, come baby
My body needs your body baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Tonight we gonna be makin' babies
Come baby, come baby
My body needs your body baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Tonight we gonna be makin' babies

You're so beautiful bad in your clothes
Let me take em' off
Elevate you from the floor
Give you what you need
I don't want nobody but you, oh
On the radio 69, go
Then we change the mood super libido
I'll give you what you need
First there's something you gotta do, mmm

Come into my bed (yeah)
Come baby, come baby (yeah)
My body needs your body baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, oh baby this is where I wanna be
With you in my bed (yeah)
Come baby, come baby (yeah)
My body needs your body baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, oh baby this is where I wanna be
(tonight we gonna be makin' babies)

Ready, steady, go work the cardio
I'mma beat that drum
Like it's rock n roll (yeah)
I'll give you what you need
'Cause I don't want nobody but you, no
Let's make a video make a TV show
No, we never stop let the camera roll
I'll give you what you need
Cause I don't want nobody but you, mmm

Come into my bed (yeah)
Come baby, come baby (yeah)
My body needs your body baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, oh baby this is where I wanna be
(now we're gonna be makin' babies)
With you in my bed (yeah)
Come baby come baby (yeah)
My body needs your body baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, oh baby this is where I wanna be
(tonight we gonna be makin' babies)
With you in my bed with you in my bed

Come into my bed (yeah)
Come baby, come baby (yeah)
My body needs your body baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, oh baby this is where I wanna be
(now we're gonna be makin' babies)
With you in my bed (yeah)
Come baby come baby (yeah)
My body needs your body baby (yeah, yeah)
Oh baby, oh baby this is where I wanna be
(tonight we gonna be makin' babies)
With you in my bed
In my bed, in my bed, in my bed
With you in my bed, in my bed, in my bed
Come baby so come baby, come to my bed
In my bed, in my bed
Every single day in my bed, in my bed
With you in my bed, in my bed, in my bed
This is where I wanna be with you in my bed
