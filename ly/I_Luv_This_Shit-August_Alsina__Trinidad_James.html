		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Man, I love this shit
Man, I love this shit
Man, I love this shit
Man, I love this shit
And I love this shit
And I love this shit
And I love this shit

It's 2 O'clock and I'm faded
This kush feeling amazing
Got a voice mail on my phone
From a lil' breezy feeling X-rated
She told a nigga she hurtin'
I'm in the car and I'm swervin'
I walked into her bedroom
I put it down that's certain
Man I stay on that Ciroc
Man I stay taken shots
May your girl be on my jock

Maybe because I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
No snitch nigga Ima real nigga that's real nigga
I'm just trying to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too high to be trippin' like this
I'm way too young to be livin' like this
Ask me why I do it?
I'ma put it like this
God dammit

I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
God dammit I love it
I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
So I'ma keep on drinking 'cause I love this shit
And Ima keep on smoking 'cause I love this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin' 'cause I love this shit
She tell me keep fuckin' 'cause she love this shit
And I love it

Rollin through my hood rolling up some good
Shorty be rolling on the wood
Damn she rode it good
Rollin over I ain't sleepin' over
Now she rollin' the eye
Rollin on the floor laughing
Cause she looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block
And I been on that Ciroc
Got your man circling the block

Maybe because I'm everything you're not
See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
No snitch nigga I'ma real nigga that's real nigga
I'm just trying to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too high to be trippin' like this
I'm way too young to be livin' like this
Ask me why I do it?
I'ma put it like this
God dammit

I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
God dammit I love it
I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
So I'ma keep on drinking 'cause I love this shit
And Ima keep on smoking 'cause I love this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin' 'cause I love this shit
She tell me keep fuckin' 'cause she love this shit
And I love it

What you know about love?
Well love know about you
When I try something new
You refuse to believe that my love is true (God damn)
So I use all I got to prove to you
But the proof ain't enough so you move onto the next dude like
What he gon' do? (Ha)
I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
Looking for a real nigga
Like in all the wrong places
And all the wrong ways
They don't care, they don't change cause
She gon' do what she want
And that is okay
And he gon' do what he want
And that is okay
I said I love it, love it, love it, love it (love it, love it)
He nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing about it
Lil' bitch

I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
God dammit I love it
I love it, I love it
I love it, I love it
So I'ma keep on drinking 'cause I love this shit
And I'ma keep on smoking 'cause I love this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin' 'cause I love this shit
She tell me keep fuckin' 'cause she love this shit
And I love it
