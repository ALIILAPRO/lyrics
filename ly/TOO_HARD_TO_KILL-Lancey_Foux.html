		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, yeah

You're too hard, too hard, you're too hard to kill (it's me against me, it's me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, I'm too hard to kill (it's me against me, it's me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, too hard to kill (it's me against me, it's me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, I'm too hard to kill (it's me against me, it's me against me, me against me)

And I hate myself, there's another part of me
I can't hide, go stealth
Ah, but I end up right beneath it
I stand in the mirror, I'm so confused, two faces that I keep seein' (yeah)
Two people in my body and they both competin' for the main seat
Everyday's halloween, when I meet someone new, feels like I'm playin' trick or treat
I told her I love her, I show her I love her, but she gon' be mad at me
I know that I must be an angel or demon, but I just wanna be me
I've been trapped inside of my mind, yeah-yeah, I just wanna be free

You're too hard, too hard, you're too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, I'm too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)
You're too hard, too hard, you're too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, I'm too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)

And I love my wife but a chick getting hit it if a young nigga like her
And I love my niggas, but a nigga getting split cut if I feel like it (chyeah)
And I'm always reminded, time to decide, I be so indecisive
And I'm constantly fighting, that's what my life is, clash of the titans
I'm praying to God Almighty, shine, shine your starlight on me
Shine your starlight on me, I wanna leave my body
Oh, lord, have mercy, I-I just wanna see better days
Sign of the cross on my body
I just, I just, I just wanna separate

You're too hard, too hard, you're too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, I'm too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)
You're too hard, too hard, you're too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)
Too hard, too hard, I'm too hard to kill (it's me against me, me against me, me against me)

It's me against me, me against me, me against me (I'm too hard to kill)
It's me against me, me against me, me against me (you're too hard to kill)
It's me against me, me against me, me against me (too hard to kill)
It's me against me, me against me, me against me (oh-oh)
