		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Know you hate to confess)
(But baby, ooh, you needed me)
Uh, yeah

Go and tell your friends I lost it
If you tell 'em, tell 'em often
Twelve weeks in a cold room
This might be my fuckin' coffin
If I smoke it, then I'm coughin'
Unknown people tryna walk in
Don't speak, I don't know you
Your opinion, it means nothin' (yeah)

I've been like this for a year now
Uppin' like I've never been down
I've been smokin', got me sky high
Shit is finally getting clear now, fuck

Cold nights, callin', new wave, yeah
Cold nights, new wave, wait
Cold nights, callin', new wave, yeah
Cold nights, new wave
Cold nights, callin', new wave
Cold nights, new wave

They don't wanna see me fallin' (fallin')
I'll be sober by the mornin'
You can find me in the backroom
Look at me, I'm fuckin' rollin' (rollin')
Hit the bottle, now I'm stallin'
Vivid pictures on the wall and
Don't be talkin' like I know you
I could send you to the floor, man

I've been like this for a year now
Uppin' like I've never been down
I've been smokin', got me sky high
Shit is finally getting clear now, yeah

Cold nights, callin', new wave
Cold nights, new wave
Cold nights, callin', new wave
Cold nights, callin', new wave
Cold nights, new wave, yeah

Look at me, stashin' the drugs in the cemetery
All of the shit that was never seen
All of the nights we were missin' sleep, yeah, woah
Countin' the money instead of sheep
Accountable people surround me
So I count on my accountant that we'll settle deeds
Yeah, I keep the Devil as company
I keep the blade in the Louis V
I keep on keepin' my promises
Fuck a hypothesis, bury it seven deep
Who let the dogs off the fuckin' leash?
We were the boys in the back of the Mitsubishi
Doin' donuts while blowin' trees
Someone play "Pick up the phone," baby, please (yeah)
