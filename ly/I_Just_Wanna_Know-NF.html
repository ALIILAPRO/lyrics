		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, only time you ever call me is when you feelin' like don't nobody else wanna listen
When's the last time you saw me
You probably don't remember that 'cause that was back then you were different
I don't wanna hear the sorry's
I'm tired of all the talkin' to be honest I would rather see a difference
Yeah, you pass me in the hallway
But you ain't say a word to me
Lately all I ever feel is distant
You don't care that you lost me
What's wrong with ya
Had a picture of you sittin' on the dash in the car with me
Now it's in my closet with the other ones sittin' in a box
I don't wanna open up
You took it all from me
You told me you would die for me
Yeah, all you ever do is lie to me
Wish that I could say that this has come as surprise to me
Tell me that I never took the time and now you ain't got the time for me, yeah

I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don't you see me

Yeah, we used to talk like best friends
I remember that I guess I don't know what happened to us
Now you got me questionin' what trust is
You told me you would be there for me
Yeah, but you ain't really mean it did ya
Now you wanna jump ship
Leave me here alone
Well, I'm used to it
Everybody else did
Who you havin' fun with
Don't tell me I don't wanna know every time I ask I just feel sick
You're the one that jumped in
Told me you had some feelins
Now you tryin' to tell me that is not true
I ain't gotta clue
Who I'm lookin' at right now, but I know the person that I'm lookin' at is not you
Yeah
They say that you are who you hang with
Maybe that's the reason you been changin'
Maybe that's the reason why I'm feelin' like you're dangerous
And every time we talk it's like I'm talkin' to a stranger

I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold oh, oh, oh
What happened to your soul oh oh oh
Don't you see me
I thought that we were close 
But now that door is closed 
When did we lose control 
Guess you don't need me
I just wanna know oh, oh, oh, oh
When did you get so cold
What happened to your soul 
Don't you see me
I thought that we were close 
But now that door is closed
When did we lose control
Guess you don't need me
