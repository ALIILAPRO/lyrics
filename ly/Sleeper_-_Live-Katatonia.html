		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  O my your fever's high
I lay my hands upon you
O my haven't you heard
The truth is untrue

Now I'm breathing
I could not breath until you did
I'm one second after you
Just a second after you

Someone inside your room
Who is it there behind you
What does he want from you

Sleeper what did you see
I close the window to the street
Paren't died and left their child
Unattented for a while

Sleeper's song will you listen to me sing
The bird is here I can see the edge of his wing
If you die now how can I then live on
Don't give up you must live on
