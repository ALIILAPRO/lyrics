		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch is scared of me
They hate to make me want to fight and shit (pesky turtles)
I can tell by the-
I can tell by the- (out of my way)

Bitch is scared of me, they hate to make me want to fight and shit
I can tell by the smell, I can tell by the smell
Bitch is scared of me, they hate to make me want to fight and shit
I can tell by the smell, she been busy all night
Bitch is scared of me, they hate to make me want to fight and shit
I can tell by the smell, she been busy all night
Bitch is scared of me, they hate to make me want to fight and shit
I can tell by the smell, I can tell by the smell

Bitch is scared of me, b-b-b-b-bitch is scared of me
Bitch is scared of me, b-b-b-b-bitch is scared of me

(Bitch is scared of me, b-b-b-b-bitch is scared of me)
(I can tell by the smell, she been busy all-)
(Bitch is scared of me, b-b-b-b-bitch is scared of me)
(She been busy all night, she been busy all night)
(Bitch is scared of me, b-b-b-b-bitch is scared of me)
(I can tell by the smell, she been busy all night)
(Bitch is scared of me, b-b-b-b-bitch is scared of me)
(She been busy all night, she been busy all night)

Bitch is scared of me, they hate to make we wanna fight and shit
