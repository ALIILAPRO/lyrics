		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am living without you
You think everything will be fine
I find making it hard to lie
Realize nothing is left inside

I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Going to lose my mind
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Feel I'm feeling fine
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
No, it won't be fine
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off

My lie is going to hurt you
My faith is not going to wait this time
I play games just to spite you
I know you're gonna believe this time

I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Going to lose my mind
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Feel I'm feeling fine
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
No, it won't be fine
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off

Feel me as I'm laughing
Leaving, eating, fucking
Hating all this bullshit, raping
I can't stand this
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck
Fuck, fuck
I can't stand this, fuck

I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Going to lose my mind
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Feel I'm feeling fine
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
No, it won't be fine
I'm 'bout to break some fuckin' off
Off
Off
Off
Off
