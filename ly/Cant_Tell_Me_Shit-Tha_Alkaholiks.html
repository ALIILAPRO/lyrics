		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stop by the club, 'cause it ain't shit else to do it 
I'm on the guest list, it's E-Swift plus two 
Stepped to the bar, 'cause, it's a bad habit 
Open mic night, so, the Liks gots to grab it 
Check the mic, it sounds tight so 
I guess we might rock the motherfucker all night yo 
The niggas went wild, the hoes went crazy 
We dropped the microphone than we Swayze 

Ooh don't I sound great when I down a black eighth 
My style is much hotter than the enchilada plate 
My name is James but the girls call me God when I'm humpin'
I should get a gold medal for broad jumpin' 
Rappers, talkin' bout, back to the old school 
You never shoulda left in the first place fool 
Now everybody wants to be a prophet 
But I won't quit rhymin' bout my dick so get off it 
You put a rhyme together but I only dismantle it 
So gimme a high-five cause you juts can't handle it 
If rap was a swimming pool I'd climb to the top 
Plus a triple-back, hand me the mic and watch the belly flop 
Dagnabit, I got a bad habit 
It don't matter where I'm at I seen a booty and I grab it 
So niggas step back before you get lit 
I'm a grown motherfuckin' man and you can't tell me shit 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit

I rock you like Lenny Kravitz, or Nirvana 
I'm puttin' suckers on pause like a comma 
I never ape crazy act but I got the yapes a superhero 
From the ghetto puttin' creases in my capes 
(Up up up and away, J-Ro!!) 
I got more hoes than a canyon got echoes 
I'm rougher than Bluto, tougher than a callous 
My number one football team is Dallas 
Cowboys, now boys, can't you see I'm greater than 
Your grandpops is my number one fan 
You get ran on the court you dribble like Manute Bol 
You try to take it to the hole *crowd roars* get that shit outta here 
I'm more gifted than Christmas morning 
I pull out a pen and write a rhyme when I'm boning 
Me I'm tripping, let me light my Phillie blunt 
Oh there goes my beeper, what the hell do Billy want 
(Yo whassup J?] Man I quit selling weed 

(No I need a funky break)
Well I got what you need 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit

You hittin' corners with the Alkies seen you pull-out 'cause you great 
The crew who got another tape that's bumpin' harder, save it! 
Rhythm and blues blew a fuse, and now it ain't the same 
They put a lot of Funky Drummers out the game 
They samplin' the fresh hip-hop breaks, just to make a hit 
That's why to me, R&B, really ain't shit 
So peace to all the real hip-hop niggyroles 
The ones who knows about flows and rockin' shows 
I want to say whats up to the ladies 
I gotsta say whats up to the ladies 
From the Atlantic, to the Pacific 
I gotsta be specific, they know I'm terrific 
I'm pushin' up to the bars, got em screamin' Alkahols 
Oh gosh call me Josh cause I'm bringin' down the walls 
MC extraordinaire, J-Ro came to set it straight 
I never hesitate to grab the mic and meditate 
In LA, most niggas walk the same 
Act the same, talk the same, drive the same 
Dress the same, shoot the same, fuck the same 
But this is Ro and I got my own game 
I drive through lyrics like I'm riding on the freeway 
And I don't give rappers, no kind of leeway 
Chumps be hittin' ejects cause I break necks when I flex 
I be housin' mo niggas than the projects 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit 

You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me a hot damn thing 
You can't tell me shit, you can't tell me shit

Yeah, this goes out to King Tee 
DJ Pooh, yo the whole crew 
Yo D-Pimp for makin' the track 
That nigga Tash 
Deadly Threat 
This is J-Ro and E-Swift 
Tha Alkaholiks, and it's like that
