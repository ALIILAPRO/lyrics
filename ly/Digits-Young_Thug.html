		  Thugger! YSL for life
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
We ran up them digits we ran up the money
(We got London on da Track)

Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin' (yeah)
You can lose your life but it gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'? (Yeah)
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say 

We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money (sheesh, sheesh)
We ran up them digits, we ran up the money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money

I'm leanin' like I'm on a fifth of the Henny
I talk lots of shit like my bitches and digits
They didn't know me well so I left 'em with wishes
You know its a drought when you grind and can't flip it
I'm livin' big, I swear to God I'm Liu Kang kickin'
Montana
Mama gon' slime, hustle
Dopeboy, hair grey like a grandma
You know my ice blingin', light up just like a candle
Rollie pollie, I can control shawty like a channel
My racks are squeakin', I'm not fartin'
I hop in that 'Rari, I crank up like Warren

Nigga, hustlers don't stop, they keep goin' (yeah)
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'? (yeah)
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say 

We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money

I'ma move me some dope like I'm Future
I'ma go in that bitch with a ruler
I'ma toast me a nigga like Strudels
I'ma keep a red flag 'cause I'm boolin'
I now some roller spaces, I could duly
Yeah, yeah, I'm screamin', "Oh my God" like Cooly
When I snort it, I feel like I was aborted
If I ever adore you, bae, you better drive this foreign 
I've been gettin' money before the million, fuck Pandora
I just do this shit when I get bored

Nigga hustlers don't stop, they keep goin' (yeah)
You can lose your life but it's gon' keep goin'
Why not risk life when it's gon' keep goin'? (Yeah)
When you die somebody else was born
But at least we got to say

We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money
We ran up them digits, we ran up that money (run it up, run it up)
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money
We ran up them digits, we ran up some money

(We got London on da Track)
