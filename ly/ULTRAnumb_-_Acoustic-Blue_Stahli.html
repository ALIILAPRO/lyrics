		  (ULTRAnumb)

(Three)
(Two)
(One)

You want it all right now!
(ULTRAnumb)
Right now!

Three, two, one
(ULTRAnumb)
(One)
(One)

Three, two, one
You want it full frontal, over-stimulation

So say a benediction
For a new addiction
In voyeuristic overdrive

(Here comes the countdown)
(Three) This is the new flesh
(Two) This is the open door
(One) We've got everything you wanted

You want it all right now
(ULTRAnumb)
Right now

(Three, two, one)
Violated
So degraded
The show has just begun

(Three, two, one)
Dominated
By all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb
(Three, two, one)

Three, two, one
Reality's a plague
We're the medication

A new manipulation
Oversaturation
Take advantage of what you deny

(Here comes the countdown)
(Three) So step right up and see
(Two) The possibilities
(One) We are everything you wanted

You want it all right now
(ULTRAnumb)
Right now

(Three, two, one)
Violated
So degraded
The show has just begun

(Three, two, one)
Dominated
By all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb
(Three, two, one)

One
Confession (Confession)
Is such
Perfection (Perfection)
Your sweet
Repression (Repression)
Can't hide
Who you really are

Say you love it
Say you hate it
Doesn't matter 'cause you're all the same

Say you want it
Say you need it
Come and get it 'cause we love the shame

Say you love it
Say you hate it
Just another one to suck the fame

Don't pretend that you're better than this
Malevolence goes both ways

Three, two, one
(ULTRAnumb)
(One)

(Three, two, one)
Violated
So degraded
The show has just begun

(Three, two, one)
Dominated
By all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb

(Three, two, one)
Violated
So degraded
The show has just begun

(Three, two, one)
Dominated
By all you hated
This will make you ULTRAnumb
