		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big girl in the red dress
She's just trying to impress us
She's got the barley fever
But she doesn't make a sound
She's just hanging around
She's just hanging around

Down the court road early
With the hustlers big and burly
There's a million of 'em selling
And the buyers can be found
They're just hanging around
They're just hanging around

Christ, he told his mother
He told her not to bother
'Cause he's alright in the city
He's high above the ground
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)

One of 'em comes over
Got a monkey on his shoulder
And the monkey's getting grinner
But his eyes are on the ground
He's just hanging around
He's just hanging around

I'm moving to the Lenny
With the leather all around me
And the sweat is getting steamy
But their eyes are on the ground
They're just hanging around
They're just hanging around

Christ, he told his mother
He told her not to bother
'Cause he's alright in the city
He's high above the ground
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)

Christ, he told his mother
He told her not to bother
'Cause he's alright in the city
He's high above the ground
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)

He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
He's just hanging around (hanging around)
(Hanging around)
(Hanging around)
