		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

It's just that I fell in love with a war
Nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill

It's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow
