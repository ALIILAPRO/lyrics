		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Ive been thinkin?bout you]
[The way I feel about you]

I had you on my mind
Way we met it all happened so fast
It was love in your eyes
When we touched there was love, so lets make it last

[Sometimes you cant tell if love is real]
If love is real
[There aint no doubt about the way I feel]
The way I feel, yeah

[Ive been thinkin?bout you]
And there aint no doubt about it, Im in love
[The way I feel about you]
There just aint no doubt about it, Im in love

[Im in love]
[Im in love]

I woke up late last night
Visions of you real they seem
Needed you by my side
Now with you in my life I can live in this dream

[Sometimes you cant tell if love is real]
If love is real
[There aint no doubt about the way I feel]
The way I feel

[Ive been thinkin?bout you]
And there aint no doubt about it, Im in love
[The way I feel about you]
There just aint no doubt about it, Im in love

[Im in love] Im in love, yeah...hey...yeah...
[Im in love, Im in love, Im in love]
[Love, oh...]

[Ive been thinkin?bout you]
[The way I feel about you]

[Im in love]
Im in love, love, love, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Ive been thinkin?bout you] Baby
And there aint no doubt about it, Im in love
[The way I feel about you]
There just aint no doubt about it, Im in love

[Im in love]
Im in love, ah
[Im in love]
Im in love, ooh

[Ive been thinkin?bout you] Ooh
And there aint no doubt about it, Im in love
[The way I feel about you]
Way I feel about you, there aint no doubt about it

[Im in love]
No, no, Im in love
