		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I come from scientists and atheists and White men who kill God
They make technology high quality complex physiological
Experiments and sacrilege in the name of public good
They taught me everything
Just like a daddy should

And you were beautiful and vulnerable
And power and success
God damn I fell for you your flamethrowers
Your tunnels and your tech
I studied code because I wanted
To do something great like you
And the real tragedy is half of it was true

But we've been fucking mean
We're elitist
We're as flawed as any Church
And this faux rad west coast dogma
Has a higher fucking net worth
I bit the apple 'cuz I trusted you
But it tastes like Thomas Malthus
Your proposal is immodest and insane
And I hope someday Selmers rides her fucking train

I loved you
I loved you
I loved you it's true
I wanted to be you
And do what you do
I lived here
I loved here
I thought it was true
I feel so stupid
I feel so used
I feel so used

I was your baby
Your first born
The hot girl in your comp sci class
And I was Darwin's prep school dream
Bred born and raised to kick your ass
I fell for circuit boards
Rocket ships
Pictures of the stars
If you could only be what you pretend you are

When I said take me to the moon
I never meant take me alone
I thought if mankind toured the sky
It meant all of us could go
But I don't want to see the stars if they're just
One more piece of land for you to colonize
For us to turn to sand

Because we're so fucking mean
We're so elitist
We're as fucked as any church
And this bullshit west coast dogma
Has a higher fucking net worth
I bit the apple 'cuz I loved you
And why would you lie
And then I realized
You're just as naive as I am
You're so traumatized it makes me wanna cry

You dumb bitch
I loved you
I loved you
I loved you it's true
I wanted to be you
And do what you do
I lived here
I loved here
I bought it it's true
I'm so embarrassed
I feel abused

Well I don't wanna eat the rich
I'd have to eat my hero's first
And my tuition's paid by blood
I might deserve your fate or worse
But I don't need your goddamn money
I don't need jack shit from you
So when I speak you bet your life my words are true

Let me level with you man
As someone guilty of the game
I took the help I took the cash
I would've taken your last name
So if any girl on earth
Should get to make a call about this
It would be me and as I see it
You're a dick

So fuck your tunnels fuck your cars
Fuck your rockets fuck your cars again
You promised you'd be Tesla
But you're just another Edison
Because Tesla broke a patent
All you ever broke were hearts
I can't believe you tore humanity apart
With the very same machines
That could've been our brand new start

And the worst part is
I loved you
I loved you
I loved you it's true
And sometimes I feel like
I still fucking do
I lived here
I loved here
I thought it was true
I'm so embarrassed
I feel abused

I feel so used
I feel so used
Take me to the moon
Because I feel so used
I feel so used
