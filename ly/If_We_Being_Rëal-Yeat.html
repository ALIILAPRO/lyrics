		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had to let a lil' off
Yeah, I had to cut the pill off
Yeah, but if we being real though
Yeah, no, I won't never feel nothin' (yeah, yeah)

I'm steady jumping the gun, yeah, like I do it for fun
You act like you do it for real but no, you is not one of us
You never could come inside of this building we run
Inside of this world we run, we do it for us
No, we don't fuck with one of them at all, at all
We don't fuck with you at all
No
No, I won't pickup your calls
No, I don't like you at all
I kinda wanna see you fall
I keep on chasing the highs, I know that I could never get back so I'm always on low
And I got eyes on the back of my head, I got eyes everywhere so I know where you go
I could drop ties in this bitch
Drop like flies in this bitch
I'll cut ties in this bitch
I'll cut ties in your face
Yeah, cut you like a lace
Nothing I do can be replaced
That's why I live in outer space

I take the money to another level
I take the plane to another level
I take the heights to a new level
I take getting high to a new level
Keep digging your grave, I'll pass you the shovel, yeah
I ain't mean to burst your bubble, but
I ain't into making change, I'ma stay the same, bring it to my level

If we being real
I don't know how to feel
I been overseas (I been overseas)
You been on your knees
You been begging, "Please" (you been begging, "Please")
It's nothing left to see
Nothing left to feel
Why you in the field? (Why you in the field?)
Why you so real? (Why you so real?)
Tell me how you feel (tell me how you feel)
Why you make me feel the way I feel
Will you make me feel better? (Will you make me feel better?)
Always clashing heads, yeah
With somebody who think they know better (think they know better)

Who the fuck is you?
Got better things to do
I don't got time to waste
I just need my space
It's a couple things that I can feel, but I can't feel my face
It's a couple things that I wish I could, but I can't replace
I think it's a sickness
Being so selfish, yeah
I'm in need of a witness
They always tell me (yeah), "Never forget this"
I forget everything, I don't even know where my tip is
And I'll change everything
I don't even know how I'll top this
