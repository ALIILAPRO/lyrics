		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sat alone in the back of the bar
I hear a song that used to be ours
And all the memories start racin'
You were lightning in the dark
I was trying to catch a spark
Too blind to see the risk I was takin'

I can't get you out of my head
And the drinks, they won't help me forget
When you said

Just close the door
Let it go, 'cause words won't change it
And you already know
That our song is slowly fading
You'll always be on my mind
Every time my body starts to move
'Cause I don't ever wanna be
Dancing without you

So did you ever find your dreams
In the city that never sleeps?
And all the missing parts you were chasing
And do you ever think of me?
In our bittersweet melody
Every time the band starts playing

I can't get you out of my head
And the drinks, they won't help me forget
When you said

Just close the door
Let it go, 'cause words won't change it
And you already know
That our song is slowly fading
You'll always be on my mind
Every time my body starts to move
'Cause I don't ever wanna be
Dancing without you

Without you, without you
Don't wanna dance without you
Without you, without you
Don't wanna dance without you

Just close the door
Let it go, 'cause words won't change it
And you already know
That our song is slowly fading
And you'll always be on my mind
Every time my body starts to move
'Cause I don't ever wanna be
Dancing without you

Just close the door (the door)
Let it go (let go), 'cause words won't change it
And you already know ( you know)
That our song (our song) is slowly fading
And you'll always be on my mind (my mind)
Every time (every time) my body starts to move
'Cause I don't ever wanna be
Dancing without you

Without you, without you
Don't wanna dance without you
Without you, without you
Don't wanna dance without you
You'll always be on my mind (my mind)
Every time (every time) my body starts to move
'Cause I don't ever wanna be
Dancing without you
