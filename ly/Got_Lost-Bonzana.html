		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be

Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be

Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
Well we weren't meant to be, were we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be

Are we then meant to be, are we meant to be
Are we meant to be, are we meant to be
What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool

What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool
What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool

What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool
What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool

What you say to me and what you do
You've been playing me like a fool
