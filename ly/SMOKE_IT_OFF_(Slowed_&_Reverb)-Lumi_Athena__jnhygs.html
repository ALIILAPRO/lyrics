		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do this all the time
You d-do this all the time
And you back up, in my mind
And you back up, in my mind

She just scared of the dark sometimes
I just feel like I need that vibe
I feel bad when I'm in my mind
You say that you want it, okay
I just feel fun to get some way
Why didn't you told me wouldn't be nothing?
I used to rage
You're a joke, look at your face (bye-bye)

You d-do this all the time
You d-do this all the time
And you backed up, in my mind
And you backed up, in my mind
Girls, they just wanna have fun
Havin' parties and gettin' fucked up
Havin' parties and gettin' fucked up
Havin' parties and gettin' fucked up (bye-bye)
You d-do this all the time
And you b-back up, in my mind
Y-Y-You wish I was tryin'
Y-Y-You wish I was fine
Girls, they just want to have fun
Have parties and gettin' fucked up
Have parties and gettin' fucked up
Have parties and gettin' fucked up

I live in my
I live in my dreams and I live in my nightmares, I live in my dreams
I live in my- I live in my
I live in my dreams and I live in my nightmares, I live in my dreams
I live in my- I live in my
You want to fight but you know we don't fight fair
You want to fight but you know we don't
Y-Y-You want to fight but you know we don't fight fair
You want to fight but you know we don't fight fair

I live in my
I live in my dreams and I live in my nightmares
You wanna fight but you know we don't fight fair
Everybody wants smoke until they get steam
She say she love me, whatever that mean
All this fake love, I know you a groupie
I-I-I get hoes and pass them to Lumi
I heard your music, it do not move me
Your head got big, I'd think you was Stewie
You begging me to stop, I show no mercy
Shaking her hips, I thought she was from Jersey
"Aren't you the guys from KURXXED?"
No, I'm the nigga that'll put you in dirt today (bye-bye)
Please don't get me started
Lumi said he got the pole in his skirt today
Why you running away?
I swear, I do not play

You d-do this all the time
You d-do this all the time
And you back up, in my mind
And you back up, in my mind
Girls, they just wanna have fun
Having parties, gettin' fucked up
Having parties, gettin' fucked up
Having parties, gettin' fucked up
Y-Y-You d-do this all the time
And you back up, in my mind
Y-Y-You wish I was tryin'
Y-Y-You wish I was fine
Girls, they just wanna have fun
Have parties and gettin' fucked up
Have parties and gettin' fucked up
Have parties and gettin' fucked up (bye-bye)
