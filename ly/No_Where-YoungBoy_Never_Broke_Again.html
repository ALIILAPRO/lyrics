		  (Pipe that shit up, TnT)
(Dmac on the fuckin' track)
(Tuned Up)

I don't wanna go nowhere, no 
Think it's best if we just stay at home
Might as well leave out because your friends can't come 'round
I wanted it to be just me and you all alone
You don't want me, I see, oh, la-di-da-di
All night, singin' the same song, lonely, singin' the same song
Oh, she all that I need, why don't she don't see?
All night, takin' my pain, was strong, all night, tryna see what's wrong

I know that I be trippin' when I tell you things I don't mean at all
It ain't my fault you thugged me, I'ma tell you this honestly
Don't believe that it ain't someone out there to love me
Hate that my feelings got involved
'Cause you just wanna shame me, you just wanna blame me
No shit you do can't troll me, damn, I miss the old me
So high that I might OD, wish you was here to hold me
Don't wan' leave, just wan' stay here and think

I don't wanna go nowhere, no 
Think it's best if we just stay at home
Might as well leave out because your friends can't come 'round
I wanted it to be just me and you all alone
You don't want me, I see, oh, la-di-da-di
All night, singin' the same song, lonely, singin' the same song
Oh, she all that I need, why don't she don't see?
All night, takin' my pain, was strong, all night, tryna see what's wrong

All my cars push-start, don't play with me, no pushover
Why she drive me wild like rollercoaster?
Youngboy tote that green flag, heart skip a beat, see you way too loaded
Lied and tried me, tried me over and over

And you know you down bad for that (oh yeah)
Know I'm on your ass for that (oh yeah)
I ain't throwin' no jabs, that's facts
Know you can't have me back
I'll always have your back
Still think that I love your ass
I don't want you if after me 
Any nigga ever say that they smashed (I don't wan' go nowhere)

I don't wanna go nowhere, no 
Think it's best if we just stay at home
Might as well leave out because your friends can't come 'round
I wanted it to be just me and you all alone
You don't want me, I see, oh, la-di-da-di
All night, singin' the same song, lonely, singin' the same song
Oh, she all that I need, why don't she don't see?
All night, takin' my pain, was strong, all night, tryna see what's wrong
