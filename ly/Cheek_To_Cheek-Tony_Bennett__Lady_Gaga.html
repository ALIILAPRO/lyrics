		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek

Oh, I love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak (me too)
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

And I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

To Heaven (Heaven), yes, I'm in Heaven (I'm in Heaven)
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Go

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through

To Heaven, I'm in Heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
Oh baby, when we're out together dancing
(Out together dancing)
Out together dancing cheek to cheek
