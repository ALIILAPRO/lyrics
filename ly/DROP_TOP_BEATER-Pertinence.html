		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said show me the carfax 
Dent on the hood and the dash cracked
Smell lingering from the ash tray
Need new gears and it don’t got airbags 
What’s else 
Trunk don’t pop, but the wheels still roll
And the headlights broke but show go on 
She peep the mistique on my jenesequa
Not talking about whips I’m taking bout moi 
Droptop beater
Quarters in the meter
Cranking up the heater
Cause the AC doesn’t work 
Damn
Drop top beater 
Parker, call me Peter
Asked to bring a friend
Sorry love I’m a two seater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater
Drop top beater 
Drop top 
Pawn shop
Will i sell it 
Hell nah 
Four wheels ten toes stress low 
Relax eight tracks in the console 
Geese, drive round offa endo
Please, keep that on the down low
I got no fancy features 
Fuzzy dice, couple speakers
Radio no receiver 
Gas light on but I don’t believe it
Road trips and a cappacino
Spilled a coke bag of Cheetos
Engine gon blow like a pack of c4 
Blowing out smoke so the boy a steamboat
Big dreams  never sleep though 
Bed gon hop like an el Caminos
Modified my bitch illegal 
parts come cheap down in Puerto Rico 
Droptop beater
Quarters in the meter
Cranking up the heater
Cause the AC doesn’t work 
Damn
Drop top beater 
Parker, call me Peter
Asked to bring a friend
Sorry love I’m a two seater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater
Drop top beater 
Crooked cops
Spin the block 
Will i stop 
Hell nah 
Nothing lavish or special bout it 
I bout it used at 100,000
Over heat on summer evenings 
She want a title it can’t be salvaged
7 deep, shit super crowded 
Go A to b I don’t do rerouting 
Love the stick she drifting round it
Got Velvet trim yea real nostalgic 
Play the beat in my 03 
Recline the seats and then a smoke ounce 
Got Window downs whip round n round 
Them 12’s loud they fucking pounding 
Damn 
That beater whip, I’m on tha aux, just need permission
Turn the key ignite the ignition 
Dashboard backseat switch positions 
Droptop beater
Quarters in the meter
Cranking up the heater
Cause the AC doesn’t work 
Damn
Drop top beater 
Parker, call me Peter
Asked to bring a friend
Sorry love I’m a two seater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater 
Drop top beater
Drop top beater
