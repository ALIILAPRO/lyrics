		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a moth into a flame
I'm hypnotized and like a stone
I'm paralyzed 'cause I can't look away
You find your way under my skin
And I'm trying not to love you
But I hate the way I keep on giving
In to you like I always do, no matter how I try
Or maybe could it be that you're the part of me
That's keeping me alive!

How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under?
I'm so addicted to the pain
Got your poison running through my veins
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back
I can't get enough
I can't go without you

I could fight you 'til the end
But I would lose you if I win
So I guess I'll just keep on giving
In to you like I always do, no matter how I try
Or maybe could it be that you're the part of me
That's keeping me alive!

How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under?
I'm so addicted to the pain
Got your poison running through my veins
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back
I can't get enough
I can't go without you

This feeling is far from sober
There's beauty buried deep inside
You're the only one who gets me high
And I know it's far from over
As you can see, you're the part of me that's keeping me alive

How am I supposed to break this spell you got me under?
I'm so addicted to the pain
Got your poison running through my veins
The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back
I can't get enough
I can't go without

The way you pull me in
The way you chew me up
The way you spit me out
I keep coming back!
I can't get enough!
I can't go without!

Oh, I keep coming back!
I can't get enough!
I can't go without you!
