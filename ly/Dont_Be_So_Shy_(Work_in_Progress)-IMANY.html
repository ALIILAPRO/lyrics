		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a breath
Rest your head
Close your eyes
You are right
Just lay down
Turn my side
Do you feel my heat
On your skin
Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right
Take off my clothes
Oh bless me father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right
Home, I stay
I'm in, come in
Can you feel my hips
In your hands
And I'm laying down
By your side
I taste the sweet
Of your skin
Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right
Take off my clothes
Oh bless me father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right
In my heart dress
Race so much faster
I drawn myself in holy water
And both my eyes
Just got so much brighter
And I saw God
Oh yeah so much closer
In the dark
I see your smile
Do you feel my heat
On my skin
Take off your clothes
Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right
Take off my clothes
Oh bless me father
Don't ask me why
You're right
You're right
Take off your clothes

Blow out the fire
Don't be so shy
You're right
You're right
Take off my clothes
And bless me father
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why
