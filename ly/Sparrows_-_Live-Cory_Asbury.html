		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sparrow's not worried 'bout tomorrow
Or the troubles to come
The lily's not thinking 'bout the seasons
The drought or the flood
A tree that's planted by the water
Isn't fazed by the fire
So why should I be?

'Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Yeah, You take good care of me

The sun's not worried 'bout the winter
'Cause soon it will pass
The light's not thinking 'bout the darkness
Or the shadow it casts
A heart that's planted in forgiveness
Doesn't dwell in the past
So why should I be?

'Cause You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
And You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Yeah, You take good care of me

I know there must be more
But I can't get past Your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness
I know there must be more
But I can't get past Your kindness
I know there's got to be more
But I can't get past Your goodness

You take good care of me
You take good care of me
You know what I need before I even ask a thing
You hold me in Your hands
With a kindness that never ends
I'm carried in Your love no matter what the future brings
Oh, You take good care of me
