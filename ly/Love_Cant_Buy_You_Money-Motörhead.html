		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You dare to tell me what to do
You have a lot of nerve
Watch your mouth or you might get
The dentist you deserve

You´re leaving soon, your awful doom
Example to us all
You be so far back you won´t
Hear the hound-dogs call

Go Go, whaddya know
I know what the deal is
You might try to cop a feel
And I know what a feel is

You go out and you go down
Some might think it´s funny
Prostitute, destitute
Love can´t buy you money

Don´t you know the way is slow
And you´ve run out of time
Watch your feet or you might fall
And it´s been quite a climb

Breaks my heart to say good-bye
But that´s the way it goes
Don´t you see, the hanging tree
Get up on your toes

Well here we are among the stars
Dizzy from the rush
We can´t see your face no more
Behind that burning bush

Your Bible hits the floor as we
Exchange our fond good-byes
Turned around & falling down
Funny how time flies
