		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I first saw you
You had on blue jeans
Your eyes couldn't hide
Anything
I saw you leaving, oh
I saw you staring out in space
I next saw you
You were at the party
Thought you was a dream
Oh so flirty
I came against
Didn't say excuse
Knew what I was doing
We looked very fine
As we were leaving
Just like saint Joan
Doing a cool jerk
Oh, I want you
Like a kangaroo
