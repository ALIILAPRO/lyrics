		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our conversations have been honest lately
But when it comes to us, your words are hazy
Making me a little lost
Don't know how to make it stop
Making me a little lost
I wanna ask you how you're doing, baby
When I don't hear from you, it drives me crazy
Yeah, I feel a little lost
Don't know how to make it stop
Guess I feel a little lost

Dreaming is how you keep me from leaving
All of the words that I'm wanting you to say
Make me wanna stay, but waiting is a waste

Our situation has been changing lately (our situation)
There is a tension, do you feel it, baby?
Making it a little tough
When you don't share enough
Making it a little tough

Bringing it up, tell me you feel the same
Then we laugh it off, say it's all fun and games
Cause I'm

Dreaming is how you keep me from leaving
All of the words that I'm wanting you to say
Make me wanna stay, but waiting is a waste

Bringing it up, tell me you feel the same
Then we laugh it off, say it's all fun and games
We take it back 'cause we don't wanna ruin
What we've always had, so I'm just left here

Dreaming
Dreaming all of the words that I'm wanting you to say
Make me wanna stay, but waiting is a waste

Bringing it up, tell me you feel the same
Then we laugh it off, say it's all fun and games
We take it back 'cause we don't wanna ruin
What we've always had, so I'm just left here
