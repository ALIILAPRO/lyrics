		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could try to go
But in the end I'd never follow
I
Was never meant to be by your side
Is this even a game
If in the end I let you kill me?
I
Was never meant to be by your side
But in the end I won't escape from the sight of you
Half of me is half of you now
I'll have to cut myself in two
You sit so high
Like a cranium that rests on the spine
Darling its alright
You do the thinking and I'll do the holding
But that game is through
Can you feel me buckling beneath you?
I
Was never meant to keep us aligned
But in the end I won't escape from the sight of you
Half of me is half of you now
I'll have to cut myself in two
I cannot escape from the sight of you
Half of me is half of you now
I'll have to cut myself in two
