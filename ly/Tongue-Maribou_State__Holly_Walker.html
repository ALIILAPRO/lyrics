		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No light when I ask you, that's a shame
No high better than you, easy
I'm tripping over my own tongue

Lie!
Desire, like an illness, chokes me
You lit me up so smoke me oh

You made it so obvious that you're not in love
You never gave a damn bout us 'cause you're not in love

No time to regret this, what we've done
Still I second guess it, cold feet
I'm tripping over my own tongue
Lie!
Love has been and gone and now I'm numb

You made it so obvious that you're not in love
You never gave a damn bout us 'cause you're not in love

Rolling down into the wildest dream
You, ha ha ha ha

Rolling down into the wildest dream
You sent my soul downstream

You made it so obvious 
You never gave a damn bout us 

You made it so obvious that you're not in love
You never gave a damn bout us 'cause you're not in love
