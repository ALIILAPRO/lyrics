		  Sunday ceiling spinning
Like it won't stop (no way around it)
Every night with you is
The cherry on top (how do I live without it?)

Stars get a little bit crossed
And wires get tangled in the dark
Can't hold on to the light
I got a little bit lost
But I swear we've still got time
'Cause you'll always be my

Tangerine
On my mind forever
Got me spinning between now and never
Tangerine
We go so good together
A lot can happen between now and never

Woke up in your orbit
Now where do I start? (No way around it)
With gravity like that
Oh, how did I get so far?
Yeah, you should know that

Stars get a little bit crossed
And wires get tangled in the dark
Can't hold on to the light
I got a little bit lost
But I swear we've still got time
'Cause you'll always be my

Tangerine
On my mind forever
Got me spinning between now and never
Tangerine
We go so good together
A lot can happen between now and never

Doo-doo-doo-doo (tangerine)
Doo-doo-doo-doo (you'll always be my)
Doo-doo-doo-doo (tangerine)
Doo-doo-doo-doo

Is there something I could say?
Something I could do?
'Cause you'll always be my
Something in my brain
Telling me it's true
You'll always be my

Tangerine
On my mind forever
Got me spinning between now and never
Tangerine
We go so good together (good together)
A lot can happen between now and never (yeah, yeah, woo, woo)

Doo-doo-doo-doo (tangerine)
Doo-doo-doo-doo (you'll always be my)
Doo-doo-doo-doo (tangerine)
Doo-doo-doo-doo (you'll always be my)
