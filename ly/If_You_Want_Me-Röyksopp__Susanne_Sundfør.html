		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As the evening's dying down
I will tend my weary mind
I must rest this heavy head
Getting tired

All these complicated fears
Equal complicated tears
Through a misty veil of black
I am blinded

The quiet in this room
All this suffocating gloom
When the darkness pulls me in
I am drowning

All the things that might have been
There were signs I should have seen
Oh, these thoughts will weigh me down
'Til I'm broken

Will you keep me hanging high?
Will you bleed me out to die?
I will tear myself apart
You belong here

Like a phototrophic spark
I will perish in the dark
When all light is washed away
It's all ending

There are things you ought to know
Certain things I should have shown
There's so much I want to say
If you let me

Will you keep me hanging high?
Will you bleed me out to die?
I will tear myself apart
You belong here

Draw the line out in the sand
If you want me, here I am
We were destined from the start
We're forever
