		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You’re the last thing I wanna lose
Heights uncover my
Lies, but I’ll be here
Waiting for you to be back on my side
Falling right back into you
Can’t you see I’m out of tune
You’re the last thing I wanna lose
And now you know
What I’ve been through
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
And know you know
What I’ve been through
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
And know you know
What I’ve been through
So I steer
Your way, hate it over here
I’m not ready to be on my own
Now I’m
Falling right back into you
Can’t you see I’m out of tune
You’re the last thing I wanna lose
And now you know
What I’ve been through
What I’ve been through
Ohh
And now you know
What I’ve been through
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
And know you know
What I’ve been through
Ohh
Ohh
Ohh
And know you know
What I’ve been through
