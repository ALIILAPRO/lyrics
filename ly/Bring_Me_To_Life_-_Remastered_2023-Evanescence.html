		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core 
Where I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and lead it back home

(Wake me up) wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me 
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring (bring) me (me) to life

(Wake me up) wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Frozen (frozen) inside without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only (only) you are the life among the dead

All of this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul 
Don't let me die here
(There must be something more) bring me to life

(Wake me up) wake me up inside (I can't wake up)
Wake me up inside (save me)
Call my name and save me from the dark (wake me up)
Bid my blood to run (I can't wake up)
Before I come undone (save me)
Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life
I've been living a lie
There's nothing inside
Bring me to life
