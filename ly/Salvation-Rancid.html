		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation 

There's a neighborhood called Blackhawk
Where all the rich people hide
I was down on my luck working for the Salvation Army
The shelter is where I reside
Everyday we drive into Blackhawk 
And we pick up the offerings
Microwave, refrigerator for the suffering

Come on baby wont you show me what you got
I want your salvation

I can't believe these people live like kings
Hidden estates and diamond rings
I'm a rat out on a mission
I'm in your front yard under suspicion 

Come on baby won't you show me what you got
I want your salvation
