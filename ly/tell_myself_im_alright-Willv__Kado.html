		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait till I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost

I've been running from my fears all tonight
And there's no end in sight
Oh, I try so hard to be alright but
I keep going right back to where I began

And I wish I could just tell you I'm fine
But I don't wanna lie
Oh, I have your face burned in my mind
But, I guess it was the right place at the wrong time

And I'll do all it takes
Cause I don't wanna be stuck in the same old space
Trying so hard to win this game the pieces don't fall into place

And I'm singing to the same old melody
Wish that you were here with me
Angel standing right by my side so heavenly
So I hope the stars align
Cause I need you for life

I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait till I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm

Drowning my days till I realize that you're gone
Baby, I can't stand to
See you fall out of my arms where did we go wrong
All these thoughts I can't lose
I, waste my time
Chasing lies
I tell myself that I'm better
Off, when you right
I get high to hide the pain

Maybe I'm just crazy
Or maybe I'm just crazy when it's you
Our light is slowly fading
But not if I pretend we made it through

I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait till I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost

I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait till I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
