		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hope you know what you did to me
I'm grateful for what you did for me
You showed me that you ain't shit, and these bitches is dangerous
Now I do 'em just how you did to me
And I know you see the pain in my eyes, every secret and lie
Got a reason to cry 'fore I sleep at night
I need my peace of mind, I see you fine
But I'm far from that, so

Now, I'ma be savage
And you made it happen
And you made a habit
I get it now
I wonder what happened?
I thought we would last
'Stead we turned into ashes
Burning and crashing
Why can't I get past it?
Why can't I get past?
Damn girl, you changed up the best one
I just feel sorry for my next one

'Cause I'ma be selfish
I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish
I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be bad, bad, bad
Because I just can't
Do this again
Don't wanna feel like this again
So she has to

Now I'm up in LA, I'm with a bitch from the Bay
I'm telling her that I love her, but my feelings are fake
Because I found another, and I'll tell her the same
Knowing that I don't mean a thing I say

Now I'ma be savage
But you made it happen
And you made a habit
I get it now
I wonder what happened?
I thought we would last
'Stead we turned into ashes
Burning and crashing
Why can't I get past it?
Why can't I get past?
Damn girl, you changed up the best one
I just feel sorry for my next one

'Cause I'ma be selfish
I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be selfish
I'm gon' be selfish
And no one can change my mind
No one can help me
Oh, I'm gon' be

(Help me, don't give up one me)
