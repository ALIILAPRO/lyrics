		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate you
I hate you 
Shut up
Shut up

You think that I'm the one to blame
Everything I lose is just a piece of what there is to gain
You think it's cool and all is fine
Now is the day when you pay, this is my time

I feel for you nothing but pain
I am what you will be, you are dying in me
I love you, I hate you
I miss you

You're always thinking you're so perfect
Those thoughts drove me away from home
But if you put me through your tests
Then I will fail

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around, comes around

Comes around (shut up)
Comes around (shut up)
Comes around (shut up)
Comes around (shut up)

Your stupid face just makes me sick
I see you changing every day to fit into the newest clique
I know you, but everything you do
Is just a part of you, you'll never see the truth

I hate the way you make me feel
I hate the way you think you're real
You one voice it destroys
My one choice

You're always thinking you're so perfect
Those thoughts drove me away from home
But if you put me through these tests
Then I will fail

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around, comes around

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around, comes around
Comes around

Tu vida
Es mía
Your fear
Is living here in me

Es que no entiendo cómo la vida puedes hacer
La paz entre nosotros, ¿cuándo lo vas a decir?
Y la gratitud que tú nunca vas a ver
Has now turned to hate

(I have nothing to say)
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around, comes around

I have nothing to say
But I feel like my mouth is open
Everything that is real
Comes around, comes around
Comes around (shut up)
