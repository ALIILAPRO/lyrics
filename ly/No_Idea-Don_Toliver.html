		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  I know, I know, I know that you're drunk (yeah)
Tell me what you want after this club (oh-oh)
You know I get nasty (know I get nasty)
Uber ride to my house, you caught a taxi (Uber ride to my house, yeah)

I'm picky with my women, I'm decidin' (oh)
Call me to your crib and I'ma slide in (yeah)
I'm picky with my women, I'm decidin' (oh)
Call me to your crib and I'ma slide in (call me to your crib and I'ma)

First things first let me get that introduction (let me get that introduc-)
We on a long road to self-destruction (self-destruction)
You were so in love, you weren't gon' tell me nothin' (you were so in love)
Let me get this clear (uh-huh), 'cause I had no idea (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Feelin' like I did too much (much)
I'm feelin' like I did too much (much)
Well, let's get naughtier (naughtier)
Yeah, I need all of ya (all of ya)
I'm feelin' like I did too much (much)
I'm feeling like I did too much (much)
Yeah, let's party, ya (party, ya)
Yeah, I need all of ya (all of ya)

First things first let me get that introduction
We on a long road to self-destruction
You were so in love, you weren't gon' tell me nothin'
Let me get this clear, 'cause I had no idea

Feelin' like I did too much (much)
I'm feelin' like I did too much (much)
Well, let's get naughtier (naughtier)
Yeah, I need all of ya (all of ya)
I'm feelin' like I did too much 
I'm feeling like I did too much
Yeah, let's party, ya (party, ya)
Yeah, I need all of ya (all of ya)

Since you've been gone, I've been just okay
I know you mad, you didn't see it my way
Since I've been gone, I've been out of space
I let lil' shawty, come here, take your place

Ooh, you got it (got it)
You couldn't keep my love, you too exotic (couldn't keep my love, yeah)
You want a paper plane, I don't mind it (you want a paper plane, yeah)
You wonder why your girl always whining (wonder why your girl, yeah)
