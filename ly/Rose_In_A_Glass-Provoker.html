		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Verse)
Walk around photo in my hand
Ask around until someone says I know her
I saw her

Sitting down by the laundromat
Rose in a glass she had track marks all over 
Looking older

(Chorus)
When the nights and the lies keep growing
I don’t know if I can do it again
She's gone
Am I ready to go down that road

I’ve been known to leave no stone unturned
But the missing people report’s stacking again
At my resources end I’m out of luck

Got a call from someone unknown
Hung a threat over my life then hung up the phone 
Can’t imagine what you’re feeling like you’re all alone
Only seen a single picture but feel like I know her

(Verse)
Smith & Wesson in my duster coat
got a tip hidden in a manila folder
A loaner 

Turned around thought I saw a ghost
I see the glow when I smell the smoke I’m closer
To getting closure

(Chorus)
When the nights and the lies keep growing
I don’t know if I can do it again
She's gone
Am I ready to go down that road

I’ve been known to leave no stone unturned
But the missing people report’s stacking again
At my resources end I’m out of luck

Got a call from someone unknown
Hung a threat over my life then hung up the phone 
Can’t imagine what you’re feeling like you’re all alone
Only seen a single picture but feel like I know her
