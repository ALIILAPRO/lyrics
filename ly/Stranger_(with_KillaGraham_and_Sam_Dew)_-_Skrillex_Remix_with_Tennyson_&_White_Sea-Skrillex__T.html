		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here in the dark I can see where you are
I see so clearly
The beat of my heart just stops and starts
Whenever you're near me
I just gotta thank you, all the love I gave you
Came and you took it all away
And now there is no pain, there's everything to gain here
Now that I'm lost I think I'll stay

In hell, there's comfort in these flames and I don't feel the pain
In hell, I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger (Become a stranger)

I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger

(You'll become a stranger)

I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger

(You'll become a stranger)

Here in the dark I can see where you are
I see so clearly
The beat of my heart just stops and starts
Whenever you're near me
I just gotta thank you, all the love I gave you
Came and you took it all away
And now there is no pain, there's everything to gain here
Now that I'm lost I think I'll stay (Stranger)

In hell, there's comfort in these flames and I don't feel the pain
In hell, I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger

In hell, there's comfort in these flames and I don't feel the pain
In hell, I'll forget your name here, you'll become a stranger (Become a stranger)
