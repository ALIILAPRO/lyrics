		  (PD)

Had it all arranged like magic
Had it arranged like magic
I was on my pace and counting
Was on my pace and counting
But you just showed up and
Priorities were bummed and
Might as well fight my emotion
Might as well fight my emotion, oh no

But when you come, you
Got my vision in a blur, no no
Be like I forget wetin I go do
Got me feeling lost, got me feeling lost, oh
But when you come, you
Got my vision in a blur, no no
Be like I forget wetin I go do
(Oh, 'cause ever you're on my mind, oh)

Baby, what do you want? Ahn
Feeling all you got is distracting
Telling me that it's not, ahn
Gotta put myself as the captain
Even now, I no wan loose guard
No wan follow you go, forget my path
Steady thinking about how you be one chance
'Cause I'm spotting a system, e be red flag, no

But when you come, you
Got my vision in a blur, no no
Be like I forget wetin I go do
Got me feeling lost, got me feeling lost, oh
But when you come, you
Got my vision in a blur, no no
Be like I forget wetin I go do
(Oh, 'cause ever you're on my mind, oh)

But when you come, you
Got my vision in a blur, no no
Be like I forget wetin I go do
Got me feeling lost, got me feeling lost, oh
But when you come, you
Got my vision in a blur, no no
Be like I forget wetin I go do
