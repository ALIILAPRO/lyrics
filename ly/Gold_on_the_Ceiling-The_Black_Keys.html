		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Down in the waves
She screams again
Roar at the door
My mind can't take much more
I could never drown in

They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright
Ain't no blood in my eye

Clouds covered love's
Barbed-wire fence
Strung up, strung out
I just can't go without
I could never drown in

They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright
Ain't no blood in my eye

They wanna get my
They wanna get my
Gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright
Ain't no blood in my eye

Gold on the ceiling
I ain't blind
Just a matter of time
Before you steal it
It's alright
Ain't no blood in my eye
