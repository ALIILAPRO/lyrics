		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's always a way
To hide
But I'm not gonna wait
For my fate
This time
Imma welcome the pain
In my shell, in my heart
I was numb, feeling safe
In my cell, left apart
I kept dreaming in the haze
I'm done with that
I'm not alone
I see a million ways ahead
I'm done with vows
And wishes, cause
All the stars are dead
All the stars are dead
And I know,
There's something inside you, keeping things
The way they are cause you are scared
What's real about this is you can't
Decide what will then remain
But it's ok, it's alright
May this leap revive your fire
Yeah it's worth it, you'll be alright
When you see what's out of sight
There's always a way
To hide
But I'm not gonna wait
For my fate
This time
All the stars are dead
All the stars are dead
Won't try, no, to change myself
Won't try, no more, to change myself
