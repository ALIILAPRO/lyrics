		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (There they go again but they never break up)
(Everyday a fight, and then they kiss and make up)
[Kisses and tears, that's all our love is]
[It's nothing but kisses and tears]
You don't seem to need the slightest reason
To chase that sunshine and bring on the rainy season
(Though the years)
Unless you trust me, whenever a doubt appears
[Your future with me will continue to be kisses and tears]
You're crying again, you're sighing again
Can't we patch it up this time?
And I guess it's allright, we've finished our fight, and now...
(It's just about kiss-time)
You shouldn't be kissed, I oughta resist
(That's all that love is)
Oh watsa matter, baby?
You don't seem to need the slightest reason
(To chase the sunshine and bring on, bring on the rainy season)
Kisses and tears, it's up to you
If we laugh or if we cry through the years
Unless you trust me [whenever a doubt appears]
[Your future with me will continue to be}
Loving and crying, continually
[Our future will be just kisses and tears]
(Kisses and tears!)
