		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's harder to see
With my head in the clouds but my feet on the floor
I can't seem to keep
Any wolves from my door

The funny thing is
You wait for a sign and then ten come along
A swing and a miss
It never rains but it pours

Drowning in the water
Against the current, I can barely hold on
But one thing that I remember
It's always darkest before the dawn

In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm (in the eye, in the eye)

One thing that keeps me going
More than you'll ever know
In the eye of the storm (in the eye, in the eye)

On the horizon
Scars are dark, worse than ever before
The sun isn't rising
So I can't see a shore

But one thing that I remember
It's always darkest before the dawn

In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm (in the eye, in the eye)

One thing that keeps me going
More than you'll ever know
In the eye of the storm (in the eye, in the eye)

I remember, I remember
It's always darkest before the dawn
And that one thing will keep me going
More than you will ever, ever know

In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm
Oh, in the eye of the storm, oh (in the eye, in the eye)

It's that one thing that keeps me going
More than you'll ever know
In the eye of the storm (in the eye, in the eye)
