		<p>
		  Lay it down but if you wanna lay it
Bring a bag, cause you gon have to pay it
Shoot it up, Imma need you to spray it
Talk my shit, you don't have to say it
Dreamdoll, im a pop a demand, 
sweating me like he poppin a Xan
Give me an hour I'll spend your advance
Bad bitch with them bands

Don't waste time
Get you a taste
He blowing a ticket
I made up my mind
Sit on his face

He just wanna lick it
You know how I like it 
Baby just go with the flow 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Baby just give me some mo 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down 

Side to side 
She moving her waist 
All on my body
She Rubbing her Thighs 
like give me a Taste 
Talk to me Naughty 
You know i how i like it

Baby just go with the flow 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Baby just give me some mo 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down

Bad B on the floor and she shaking it
To my music she vibin and breaking it
Claiming they raw, but them niggas are faking it
Me, I keep it one hundred I stay in it
Giving me sloppy, lil baddie, she taking it, raking it
Beat up the pussy all day and shit
Back in days when the girlies try take the piss
Now the girlies want me cause I'm making it

Don't waste time 
Come give me a chase
I like it real dirty
so, don't be shy
Put me in my place
Ice the cake
Boy, you know how i like it 

Baby just go with the flow 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Baby just give me some mo 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down 

Side to side 
She moving her waist 
All on my body
She rubbing her thighs 
like give me a taste 
Talk to me naughty 
You know i how i like it

Baby just go with the flow 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Baby just give me some mo 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down

You know I been that, you know I'm pricey, you gotta spend that
Take my cash app, and send that
He don't act right, where his friend at
Put a seat right where his chin at
Yeah, I block haters, and spend that
I'm the one baby, I been that and that's big facts - Dream

She shaking her back cause she making it clap
She giving me brain while I'm counting my stack
I'm telling lil hottie got a WAP
Aye and that pussy really fat
Run up a check, baby on point cause she fuck with the best
Probably get blocked if they giving me stress
I'm feeling bored, I might bust a PATEK
Aye, oooh
Run up a check, baby on point cause she fuck with the best
Prolly get blocked if they giving me stress
I'm feeling bored, I might bust a PATEK

Don't waste time 
Come give me a chase
I like it real dirty
so, don't be shy
Put me in my place
Ice the cake
Boy, you know how i like it 

Baby just go with the flow 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Baby just give me some mo 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down 

Side to side 
She moving her waist 
All on my body
She Rubbing her Thighs 
like give me a Taste 
Talk to me Naughty 
You know i how i like it

Baby just go with the flow 
Lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down, lay it down
Baby just give me some mo 
Lay it down, lay it down
