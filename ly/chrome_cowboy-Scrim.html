		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)
Yeah
(You did good, $lick) ayy

I'ma just talk my shit, ayy (yeah)
I'ma do what it take to win
Shawty, I'm way too sick, ayy
Why I'm sippin' on medicine
I don't trust none of these lames (let's get it)
They probably gon' tell again
I don't trust none of these hoes
Kick 'em out like a gentleman (let's get it)
Ride around with my 3s up
Gang tellin' me to ease up
Hellcat got my speed up
Fuckboys, they can't keep up
Pull up, they gon' freeze up
Too high, they can't reach us (let's get it)
Trailer park shawty (let's go)
But them white folks think I'm Jesus (let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)

They tryna do the most, ayy
Ain't really down to die about it
Block that bitch, went ghost, ayy
Fuck it, I let her cry about it
Heard them boys went broke, ayy (yeah)
Instagram, they still lying about it
Fuck it, I pour some more, ayy
Wok here by the line a thousand
Daytime, pullin' up pickup
Night time pullin' up foreign (skrrt)
Told my bitch I can't pick up (sorry)
I'm too busy out tourin' (Turn me up)
Nodding off while I sit up
Peace that I've been longing for
She tryna cry 'bout love, ayy
Bitch, I heard that song before
Drugs, they don't get tired of me
Them boys don't get high to me (okay)
White boy from the hood, bitch, I'm different, a dichotomy
I'm fulfilling prophecy
Don't want your camaraderie
I'm tryna get this money, take my family outta poverty
Too lame, you can't rock with me (let's get it)
They just wanna ride for free
Getting straight to the money
Fuck them bitches, my philosophy
Fuck 'em like pornography
Fuck 'em like they lied to me
Wondering why I'm paranoid, fuck, because I gotta be
Ruby's got that 9 on me
They call me a prodigy (Young Wetto)
Grey*59, that's 'til I die, don't matter my geography
Chest out I got God with me
Alien biology
Stay the fuck out my way, you can keep all them apologies

I'ma just talk my shit, ayy (yeah)
I'ma do what it take to win
Shawty, I'm way too sick, ayy (okay)
Why I'm sippin' on medicine
I don't trust none of these lames
They probably gon' tell again
I don't trust none of these hoes (yeah, yeah)
Kick 'em out like a gentleman (let's go, let's go, let's go)
Ride around with my 3s up
Gang tellin' me to ease up (okay)
Hellcat got my speed up (okay)
Fuckboys, they can't keep up (okay)
Pull up, they gon' freeze up (okay)
Too high, they can't reach us (let's get it)
Trailer park shawty (let's go)
But them white folks think I'm Jesus (let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go)
