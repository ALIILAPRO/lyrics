		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling me

Death in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to me

Who made you God to say
"I'll take your life from you"

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames

Wait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the end

Sweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend

My fingers grip with fear
What I am doing here?

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames

Someone help me
Oh please, God, help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Someone help me
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die

Time moving slow
The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see

How true is this?
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be

Wakened by the horrid scream
Freed from the frightening dream

Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
