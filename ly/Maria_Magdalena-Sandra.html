		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You take my love
You want my soul
I would be crazy to share your life
Why can't you see what I am?
Sharpen your senses and turn the knife
Hurt me and you'll understand

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

Why must I lie?
Find alibis
When will you wake up and realize
I can't surrender to you?
Play for affection and win the prize
I know those party games, too

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight)
(You need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

I'll never be Maria Magdalena
(You're a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You're a victim of the fight
(You need love)
Promise me delight
