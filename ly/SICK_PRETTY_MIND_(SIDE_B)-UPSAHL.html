		<p>
		  (My sick pretty mind)

I hate the way I talk
But all I do is talk
Sometimes I wish I'd just shut up
I hate the way I look, but everybody look
Like show and tell when I show up

Don't bring up my feelings
That's my way of dealing
No one here is ever okay, mm
Spend the night in my brain
Shadows on the wall say

Welcome to my, my
My sick pretty mind, mind
It's twisted and dark, but it's kind of a vibe, uh
You fight to get out then come back every night
Dance until you die in my sick pretty mind

Someone hang the DJ
He's spinning second thoughts
Wasted on the weekday, look what I forgot
Mirror on the ceiling, but don't look too long
So you're tryna get deep then?
I'm like "Let's just not"

Don't bring up my feelings
That's my way of dealing
No one here is ever okay (okay, okay)
Spend the night in my brain
Shadows on the wall say

Welcome to my, my
My sick pretty mind, mind
It's twisted and dark, but it's kind of a vibe, uh
You fight to get out then come back every night
Dance until you die in my sick pretty mind

(Na-na-na-na)
(Dance until you die in my sick pretty mind, yeah)
(You wanna dance until you die in my sick pretty mind, yeah)

Welcome to my, my
My sick pretty mind, mind
It's twisted and dark, but it's kind of a vibe, uh
You fight to get out then come back every night
You'll dance until you die in my sick pretty mind
