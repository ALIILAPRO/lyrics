		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now you are here
Again, beside me
Now, I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed

You will live papa, you're going to live!
It's too soon to ever say goodbye

Yes, Cosette
Forbid me now to die
I'll obey I will try

On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of those who always loved you

Your mother gave her life for you and gave you to my keeping

Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last, behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy

Forgive me all my trespasses and take me to Your glory

Take my hand
And lead me to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting

And remember The truth that once was spoken

To love another person is to see the face of God!

Do you hear the people sing?
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light

For the wretched of the Earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise

They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
They will walk behind the ploughshare
They will put away the sword

The chain will be broken and all men will have their reward

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Will you join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?

Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Aah, aah, aah
Tomorrow comes!
