		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm countin' everyday now
All my favorites haven't sound the same to me nah
Set the stage for all my haters gotta ball out
All mine all mine all mine I gotta show out
Oh my they gotta love it I can't slow down
Poison runnin' through my veins like I don't feel now
No I can't feel now yeah

Cause everyone's sick
Strung on a stick
I know what it is
Chasing that carrot you buggin' and buggin' again
You lying again
Rude now
Fuck it you cool now
Two bust downs
Couple of years now it's fatal to shop on wish cause you cashed out
Lambo trucks with all the body rots
Servin' up with the gold flakes caviar
Sick of all the stories it's a lie
Shady pull the curtains they can't hide
I'm rollin' in rollin' in rollin' in all right
I keep droppin' them droppin' them droppin' them that fire
Illuminate the dummies with the light
28 we live it till' we die

Ball out
All mine all mine all mine I gotta show out
Oh my they gotta love it I can't slow down
Poison runnin' through my veins like I don't feel now
No I can't feel now yeah

745 in a casket
Mixing up the liquor that's the basic
They shoot it out shoot it out shoot it out
Scribbles on your face but you can't face it
Fuck you fuck you I'm doin' my shit
The throne is for the taking I've been restless
I'm keepin' all my promises I can't miss
So watch me watch me I'll take it all
I do this for the love so fuck the hate shit
I put the work in all myself so save it
I'mma keep on ridin' for the ones I love the most
Oh if we die tomorrow for the family Imma ball out

All mine all mine all mine I gotta show out
Oh my they gotta love it I can't slow down
Poison runnin' through my veins like I don't feel now
No I can't feel now yeah
