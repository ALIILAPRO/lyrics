		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He thinks that man is me
He knew him at a glance
That stranger he has found
This man could be my chance

Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?
When I have come so far
And struggled for so long?

If I speak, I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned

I am the master of hundreds of workers
They all look to me
Can I abandon them, how would they live
If I am not free?

If I speak, I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned

Who am I?
Can I condemn this man to slavery?
Pretend I do not feel his agony?
This innocent who wears my face
Who goes to judgement in my place

Who am I?
Can I conceal myself for evermore?
Pretend I'm not the man I was before?
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi?

Must I lie?
How can I ever face my fellow men?
How can I ever face myself again?
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago

He gave me hope, when hope was gone
He gave me strength to journey on

Who am I?
Who am I?
I'm Jean Valjean

And so Javert, you see it's true
That man bears no more guilt than you
Who am I? 
Two- four- six- zero- one!
