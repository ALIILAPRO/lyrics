		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could light a bunch of candles and dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop, I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth 
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true , for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (save you a seat)

Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover
