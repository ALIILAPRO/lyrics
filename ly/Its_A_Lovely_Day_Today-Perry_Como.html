		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a lovely day today,
So whatever you've got to do,
You've got a lovely day to do it in
That's true!

And I hope whatever you've got to do,
It's somethin' that can be done by two,
For I'd really like to stay!

It's a lovely day today,
And whatever you've got to do,
I'd be so happy to be doin' it
With you!

But if you've got somethin' that must be done
An' it can only be done by one,
There is nothin' more to say,
Except it's a lovely day for sayin'
It's a lovely day!

It's a lovely day today,
So whatever you've got to do,
You've got a lovely day to do it in
That's true!

And I hope whatever you've got to do,
It's something that can be done by two,
For I'd really like to stay!

It's a lovely day today,
And whatever you've got to do,
I'd be so happy to be doin' it
With you!

But if you've got somethin' that must be done
And it can only be done by one,
There is nothin' more to say,
Except it's a lovely day for sayin'
It's a lovely day!

But if you've got somethin' that must be done
An' it can only be done by one,
There is nothing more to say,
Except it's a lovely day for sayin'

What a lovely day for saying!

It's a lovely day for sayin'
It's a lovely day!
