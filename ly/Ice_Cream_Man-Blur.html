		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the ice-cream man
Parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze

Scribble, chocolate chip, umbrella and his white glove and
Shade from the sun was his intention

Here comes the ice-cream man bouncing up the hill
With a whip the pumpkin lit, happy valley clumsy fill
All the lantern men, marching down 'til dawn
Falling come, before I'm gone

Something new
Something new
Something new

Here comes the ice-cream man
Parked at the end of the road
With a swish of his magic whip
All the people in the party froze

I was only twenty-one
When I watched it on T.V.
I was racing in my heart

Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new

Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
Something new
