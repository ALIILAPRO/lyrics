		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a look in your eyes
That says you want to be care free tonight
Just like in days gone by
When we were wild
Darling I'm not so uptight
And I can still put my mind on the flip side
Cause I'm not so resigned to a mundane line

Why be so ordinary, why just conform?
Let's rip the night in half and forget it all
So keep the engines running under the stars
I feel release is coming, tonight it's ours

We shouldn't fight the way we feel
When it comes from somewhere real
A garden always in full bloom
That's how I think of me and you
And if escape is what we need
When it comes to you and me
We should just surrender
Stay wild forever

It's like a secret we hold
And the adventures we go on are untold
You've got to lose yourself
To find your way back home

Why be so ordinary, why just conform?
Let's rip the night in half and forget it all
So keep the engine running under the stars
I feel release is coming, tonight it's ours

We shouldn't fight the way we feel
When it comes from somewhere real
A garden always in full bloom
That's how I think of me and you
And if escape is what we need
When it comes to you and me
We should just surrender
Stay wild forever

We just have to surrender 
We just have to surrender

We just have to surrender 
We just have to surrender 

We shouldn't fight the way we feel
When it comes from somewhere real
A garden always in full bloom
That's how I think of me and you
And if escape is what we need
When it comes to you and me
We should just surrender
Stay wild forever

We know, we know
We just have to surrender 
We just have to surrender 
We just have to surrender 
We just have to surrender, we know, we know
We just have to surrender 
We just have to surrender, we know, we know
We just have to surrender
