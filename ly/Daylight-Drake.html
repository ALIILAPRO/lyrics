		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're all a bunch of fucking assholes
You know why?
You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be
You need people like me
You need people like me so you can point your fuckin' fingers
And say that's the bad guy
Yeah (808 Mafia)
Grah

Treat all my exes like Jehovah's witnesses
Free all the dogs and fuck all the witnesses
They sittin' down, we standin' on business
Ayy, standin' on business
Standin' on business
Standin' on business
Standin' on, ooh
I'm tryna fuck all the bitches that look like my ex
I'm makin' her vex, I'm too complex
I carry a whole lotta gold on my neck
He talkin' down, he get put in a lake
Capo the type to show up to the wake

I'm geekin' hard, don't know what to take
Don't know what I took
My doggy got booked for actin' like Book
Shot 'em in, ayy

Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight (shot 'em, shot 'em, what? Shot 'em, what?)
Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight (broad day)

She went to Jung and bought the body
I wasn't there when they caught the body
TPS think that I bought the body
Internet swear that I bought the body
Take more than that to go pop somebody
Them niggas talk about everybody
So lowkey, I'm happy they got somebody, nigga, what?
Like what's in your shoe? We sockin' niggas
Like what's on your wrist? We clockin' niggas
Like anyone home? We knockin' niggas
We clumsy as fuck, we droppin' niggas
Like Lenny Kravitz show, we rockin' niggas
Like tennis indoors, we squashin' niggas
Like combo number one, we whoppin' niggas, nigga, what?
We grabbin' his girl and we leavin' a note
She broke up with him and deleted a post
She said she was vegan, she eatin' a goat, what

I'm geekin' hard, I know how it look
Don't know what to take, don't know what I took
My doggy got booked for actin' like Book
Shot 'em in (what?)

Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight (shot 'em, shot 'em, what? Shot 'em, what?)
Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight
Shot 'em in daylight (broad)

Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you make it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
Don't talk to my man like that
I like it when you like it
My, my, my, my man
My, my, my, my man
You know which one you want
I don't care which one you want
You can take whatever
I don't care what you do
I will always watch 'em for you
