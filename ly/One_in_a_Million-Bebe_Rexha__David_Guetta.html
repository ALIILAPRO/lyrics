		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, you're my

You're my one, one, one in a million
It's like someone picked you out of the sky
Maybe I met you for a reason
And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time
Is this heaven now? Am I dreamin' out? Am I dreamin'?
You're my one, one, one in a million
And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time

And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time

(Ah)
You got me speedin' through the red lights
Yeah, I'm on my way
We do it 'cause it feels right
Yeah, you got me so

High
I tripped and found paradise
No lie
I tripped and found paradise in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes
In your eyes, in your eyes (in your eyes, in your eyes)
In your eyes

You're my one, one, one in a million
It's like someone picked you out of the sky (someone picked you out of the sky)
Maybe I met you for a reason
And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time
Is this heaven now? Am I dreamin' out? Am I dreamin'?
You're my one, one, one in a million
And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time

Is this heaven now? Am I dreamin' out?
Is this heaven now? Am I dreamin'?
You're my one, one, one in a million
And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time

You're my one, one, one in a million
And I can't believe that we're both alive at the same time
