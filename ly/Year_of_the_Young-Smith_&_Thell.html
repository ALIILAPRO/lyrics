		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna say what you said
I'm gonna do what you did
I won't remember you died
I will remember you lived
You said
"Don't you stand by my grave, no don't you stand there and cry"
I'm the trees and the birds
I'm the soft stars that shine at night
'Cause I'm not there I did not die
No I'm not there I did not die

This year we lost more than we can count
The ashes we laid in the ground
Oh this was the year of the young
This year we look up towards the sun
And wonder where everyone's gone
Oh this was the year of the young

I'm gonna stand by your words
I'm gonna learn to forgive
You said you'd rather go young than to be dead while you live
You said: "I know you're old in your soul
But always run like a kid"
I'm the rain, I'm the grass
I'm the soft blowing summer winds

'Cause I'm not there I did not die
No I'm not there I did not die

This year we lost more than we can count
The ashes we laid in the ground
Oh this was the year of the young
This year we look up towards the sun
And wonder where everyone's gone
Oh this was the year of the young
