		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something special 'bout me, you can already tell the energy is different
Confidence is at the highest level, I don't ever see it dippin'
Try me if you wanna, guarantee though you goin' wish you hadn't did it
That's a war that you could never win, but hey, I like the optimism
Given over half my life to this, I think I made a good decision
Trust my gut I hear it talkin', then I know it's time for me to listen
Mastermind consistent, matching my commitment, that's not realistic
Ayy, feature presentation what they came to see, I open up the curtain (whoa)

Oh my, pandemonium it's showtime
Got they noses up, I know why
Jealous of me, 'cause the flow nice
Did it all without a cosign
Shoot, I always hit the bullseye
Barely even put an effort in this, effortless imagine if I did try (whoa)

Acknowledge me or not
That don't really make no difference to me I
Operate the same no matter who's around me
Who's around me is important to me I
Keep my enemies at arm's length but
Close enough to make me feel safe my
Diligence can't be competed with an easy win for me, this just a small taste of (what)

What I'm capable of doing with my talent
Stretching my imagination
Watch it turn a small idea into something that you have to (what)

Tip your hat to when you see it, the whole package
Ain't got nothin' missin', check off every box it's
Unavoidable at this point don't you act like (what)
You don't see me out here makin' waves
I gotta air about me, I don't play the game the way they want me to 
They tell me take a left, I take a (what)

Right, I'm not the one to pick a fight with
Try and bully me make you regret it quick
The only person I allow to push me around is my self
Body language, read it well
It's written on your face, I'm flipping through your pages
You don't have to scream and yell
It's clear to me, yeah, I can tell
The front you put on isn't real
That poker face ain't hidin' nothin' new 
The hand you had before the cards were dealt

I got what they lack, first in every class
Never come in last, game is on my back
Wifey on my lap, she my better half
Heavy when I step, pockets getting fat
Passion never left, say it with my chest
Got a problem? Yes
Meet me in the flesh, you don't cut the check
I don't do the set, not a fan of threats
Always been direct

Nothing but the best, rarely do the press
Promise me the world? Not holdin' my breath
They want me to fail, haven't done it yet
Stackin' up the bread, thankful 'cause I'm blessed
Sharpest in the shed, pen is cutting edge
I get in the booth, perfect nothin' less
Key to my success, keep a level head
We want something fresh?
What you think this is?

What you think this is? Deadly with the raps
How could you forget? Thought I might of left
Thought I might of quit, thought I hung it up
Thought I, think again, petty that depends
What's the latest trend? I don't have a clue
I don't follow them, they just follow me
Keep 'em on the edge, keep 'em on they toes
Keep 'em wondering, keep 'em wanting more
Eating out my hand, don't look at the score
Don't look in the stands, focused on my goals
Execute the plan, beat me at my game
Never not a chance, walk you through my pain
Show you who I am, don't care what it pays
Loyal to my brand, foot is off the breaks
Steppin' on the gas, no one at my pace
Catch me if you can

Far from done got so much left to give you
Not the man I was, that person detrimental
2020 me could never hold a candle
To the present day me standin' here before you
Overstep destroy, you give up can't afford to
Keep my standards high ain't changin' that for that no one
Digging deep still got the hunger press record, yeah
Hear it in my voice, can't let the fame and fortune
Get the best of me see clearly what's important
Not impressed with me? Ain't looking for endorsements
Dropping masterpieces left and right ignore the
Hate life testin' me passin' with flying colors
Always been unique, can't be no dime a dozen
I take pride in this won't catch me cuttin' corners
Have no tolerance for ignorance, I heard ya
Lost your confidence in me this should restore it, can't ignore-
