		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could be my silver spring
Blue-green colors flashin'
I would be your only dream
Your shinin' autumn ocean crashin' 
Don't say that she's pretty 
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

So I'll begin not to love you 
Turn around, see me runnin'
I'll say I loved you years ago 
Tell myself you never loved me, no 
Don't say that she's pretty 
And did you say that she loved you?
Baby, I don't want to know

Oh no
And can you tell me was it worth it?
Baby, I don't want to know

Time cast a spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could have loved you
But you would not let me 

Time cast a spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could've loved you, but you would not let me 
I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice will haunt you 
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you

Was I such a fool?
I'll follow you down til' the sound of my voice will haunt you
Give me just a chance
You'll never get away from the sound of the woman that loves you
Time cast a spell on you, but you won't forget me
I know I could've loved you, but you would not let me
I'll follow you down 'til the sound of my voice
