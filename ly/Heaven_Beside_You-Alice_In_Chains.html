		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be what you want to be 
See what you came to see 
Been what you want to be 
I don't like what I see 

Like the coldest winter chill 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
Like the coldest winter chill 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
Like the coldest winter will 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
And you think you have it still, heaven inside you 

So there's problems in your life 
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind 
I'm just see through faded, super jaded 
Out of my mind 

Do what you want to do 
Go out and seek your truth 
When I'm down and blue 
Rather be me than you 

Like the coldest winter chill 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
Like the coldest winter chill 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
Like the coldest winter will 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
And you wish you had it still, heaven inside you 

So there's problems in your life 
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind 
I'm just see through faded, super jaded 
Out of my mind 

Like the coldest winter chill 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
Like the coldest winter chill 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
Like the coldest winter will 
Heaven beside you, hell within 
And you know you have it still, heaven inside you 

So there's problems in your life 
That's fucked up, but you're not blind 
You're just see through faded, overrated 
Out of your mind
