		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cause I was still unsure
But it's something I'm used to
And I can tell by your face
No one's ever been rude to you
But I can tell you things
That I can't say to anyone
And you came home today
But you didn't stay very long

Now it's like the world owes you
Walking around like everybody should know you
I wanna be like we used to
But now you're worried cause that means we'd lose you

And I had no idea
What that feeling could do to you
And I could tell you changed
By the people around you
I used to take the long way
Just so I could walk past your door
I used to wait outside
But I guess I won't anymore

There's so much I wanna tell you
So much I wanna tell you
