		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gently my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life
My past life
Life as I know it know
And whatever may come, it slowly disappears
To somewhere in the back of my mind
It will remain there until I wish to retrieve it

Yes I will stay here for a while for I need the break
A break from the pressures of life
And everything that lay in the palm of life's hands, life's hands

This mode is incredible
It's out of this world
Too bad I must always leave it
But that's life

That's life (yeah)
That's life (yeah)
That's life (yeah)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, oh yes
