		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oompa loompa doompety doo
I've got a tragic tale for you
Oompa loompa doompety dee
If you are wise, you'll listen to me

Here in Loompa land, it's both luscious and green
But not conducive to growing the bean
My job was guarding what little we got
You came along and pinched the lot
Hey, why didn't you say something?
Well, perhaps I drifted off

Oompa loompa doompety day
When I awoke, they sent me away
I'm disgraced, cast out in the cold
'Til I've paid my friends back a thousand fold
A thousand fold? You gotta be kidding me
I repeat, a thousand fold
