		  Who the fuck are you? Ayy
Who the fuck are you? Ayy
Who the fuck are you?

First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
Why you walk so cool, ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Hunnid on my jewels, ayy, I got all these groupies
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy

Why you walk so cool? Ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Fuck bitches in twos, ayy
Fuck bitches in twos, ayy

Fucked that bitch on Monday, fuck her sister Tuesday
You is not gon' do a thing, with my squad like Wu-Tang, ayy
I'm gonna nuck if I buck
Let a lil' nigga try us
Hit a nigga with a truck
Leave a lil nigga so stuck
Brittney turned me to a slut
Brittney turned me to a slut
Brittney turned me to a slut
Hit the bitch all on her back, ayy, never put it in her butt, ayy
Put that shit all in her pussy, ayy, leave that shit all in her gut, ayy

First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
Why you walk so cool, ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Hunnid on my jewels, ayy, I got all these groupies
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top ayy, then I swerve my coupe ayy
Counting all these bands ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy

Sometimes Fear of God, ayy
Saint Laurent the boots, ayy
I feel like I'm Dro, ayy, car ain't got no roof, ayy
That bitch kinda cute, ayy, blow me like a flute, ayy
Diamonds dripping they so wet, I gotta wipe my jewels, ayy
I can't wife no fool, ayy, got no time for mood swings
Spent like fifty on the ring and I bought two rings
Remember that bitch ain't want fuck me
Now that bitch wanna just fuck me
Remember that bitch said I'm dusty
Look at that hoe like you ugly, ayy
Your man ain't got no money, ayy
I just be smoking the dope, Skeme be smoking the clove
My brother whipping the stove
Jump in the crowd at my show, fucked the bitch in the front row

First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
Why you walk so cool, ayy, thousand dollar shoes, ayy
Hunnid on my jewels, ayy, I got all these groupies
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy
First I drop my top, ayy, then I swerve my coupe, ayy
Counting all these bands, ayy, who the fuck are you? Ayy

Cannon, Cannon went crazy
Treez, what up Treez?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, uh
Hotel party for these bad hoes
For these bad hoes, that trip
Ayy, ayy
