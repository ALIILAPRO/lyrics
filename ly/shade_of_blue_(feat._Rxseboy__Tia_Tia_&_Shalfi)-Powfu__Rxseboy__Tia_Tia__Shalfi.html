		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spin a shade of blue
I don't know what to do
But I'll see you in the morning
Baby, I'm no fool

Yeah, you don't seem to care
Quite like you used to do
But I'll see you in the morning
Baby, I'm no fool

Ay, baby, why you been so foolish?
Don't gotta put me through this
Laying on the dirt floor
Missing all the tulips
Brushing on my cheeks
Flying free, now I'm locked down
Still call you my princess
'Cause I don't wanna stop now
Grew up in a small town
Life was always good enough
All we had was friends sipping pop at the cinema
Then we took a turn for the worst
Yelling out our conversations
Once in month became every day shit
Ya lets face it, got no patience
Can't erase this
Alcohol was added, toxifying our relation
Ship sink, can't think, water in my ears
It's hard to end a story we been living in for years, yeah

I spin a shade of blue
I don't know what to do
But I'll see you in the morning
Baby, I'm no fool

Yeah, you don't seem to care
Quite like you used to do
But I'll see you in the morning (ay, no fool)
Baby, I'm no fool (ay)

Yo, baby, can you tell me why I'm blue again?
You acting like a hooligan, I do resent
The way you choosing quick with who you fooling with
I'm too convinced that you just wanted me because I'm cool as shit
Honda Civic you crashing it, brand new Beamer I'm cruising in
Listen up, why you talk a lot when you don't risk enough?
The jig is up, now I've been moving on, we getting into stuff
She natural, only into women with no nipple tuck
And, girl, I did a lot for you, so how did I not give a-
Falling like there's part of the floor gone
Until I hit the ground and knew I couldn't be more wrong
I only liked the image I created when we met in the past
And, yeah, I found that sticky note that said we never could last (we didn't)

I spin a shade of blue
I don't know what to do
But I'll see you in the morning
Baby, I'm no fool

Yeah, you don't seem to care
Quite like you used to do
But I'll see you in the morning
Baby, I'm no fool
