		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear, love is a burning fire
Stay, 'cause then the flames grow higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why we cannot live together
Try, don't let him take your love from me

You're no good, can't you see Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set her free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover

Stay, 'cause this boy wants to gamble
Stay, love is more than he can handle, girl
Oh, come on stay by me forever, ever
Why does he go on pretending
That, his love is never ending fate
Don't let him steal your love from me

You're no good, can't you see Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love, set her free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover

Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She is undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, doing what he's doing
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover

Brother Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
