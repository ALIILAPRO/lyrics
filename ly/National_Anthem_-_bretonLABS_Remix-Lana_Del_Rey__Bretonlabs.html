		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money is the anthem, of success, so before we go out
What's your address?

I'm your national anthem, God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool but, I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" (yes, yes)

Tell me I'm your national anthem 
(Ooh yeah, baby, bow down, makin' me say, "Wow," now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem 
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue's in the sky, summer's in the air 
And baby, Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact, kiss, kiss

I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me, or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool but, I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?

Tell me I'm your national anthem 
(Ooh yeah, baby, bow down, makin' me say, "Wow," now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem 
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue's in the sky, summer's in the air 
And baby, Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

It's a love story for the new age
For the six-page, we're on a quick, sick rampage
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin', excessive buyin'
Overdose and dyin' on our drugs and our love 
And our dreams and our rage
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his Bell Tower Hotel

Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress

I'm your national anthem, boy put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed, babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, queen of Saigon

Tell me I'm your national anthem 
(Ooh yeah, baby, bow down, makin' me say, "Wow," now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem 
(Sugar, sugar, how now, take your body downtown)
Red, white, blue's in the sky, summer's in the air 
And baby, Heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem

Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
