		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not usually one to enjoy the cold of the winter
Or manouvering through crowds in amsterdam
I'm not one to enjoy laying still for hours on end
A cute dinner with candlelight ain't really my thing
I thought a lover of mine could never make me sing
I was sure I'm not one that true love understands
I've never quite been a fan
Of sharing my secrets and holding hands
But darling with you, I am
Dumb conversations 'bout nothing at all
You make fun of the way that I talk
But I can't help but love all the words flowing out of your lips
Watching movies you know a little too much about
Like the extended desolation of smaug
You were giving a break-down of each and every clip
But darling I never do mind
I'd happily listen to you all night
Till both of us are left with sharing dreams
That voice in the back of our minds
Surely don't always see eye to eye
But on one thing we always agree
Darling with you, I am
And forever with you, I'll be
