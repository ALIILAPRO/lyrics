		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm cold, I'm ugly
I'm always confused by everything
I can stare into a thousand eyes
But every smile hides a bold-faced lie

It itches, it seethes, it festers and breathes
My heroes are dead, they died in my head
Thin out the herd, squeeze out the pain
Something inside me has opened up again

Thoughts of me exemplified
All the little flaws I have denied
Forget today, forget whatever happened
Everyday I see a little more of overall deficiencies
I'm nothing short of being one complete catastrophe

What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?

I save all the bullets from ignorant minds
Your insults get stuck in my teeth as they grind
Way past good taste, on our way to bad omens
I decrease, while my symptoms increase

God what the fuck is wrong?
You act like you knew it all along
Your timing sucks, your silence is a blessing

All I ever wanted out of you was
Something you could never be
Now take a real good look at
What you've fucking done to me

What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?

(I haven't got time for living)
(I haven't got time for living)

Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy)
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (boy)
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch)
Gimme any reason why I'd need you
Gimme any reason why I'd need you (bitch)
Gimme any reason not to fuck you up

I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me
I see you in me, I see you in me

I keep my scars from prying eyes
Incapable of ever knowing why
Somebody breathe, I've got to have an answer
Why am I so fascinated by
Bigger pictures, better things?
But I don't care what you think
You'll never understand me

What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
What the hell did I do to deserve all of this?
Fuck (dilute, dilute)
