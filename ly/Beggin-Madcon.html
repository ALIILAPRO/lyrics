		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin'

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

Riding high, when I was king
Played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
Walked away, wonderin' then
But easy come and easy go
And it would end

So ah, any time I need ya, let me go
Every time I reach, you get me low
Every time I seek, you let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm (beggin')
'Cause I don't wanna lose (you)
I got my arms all spread
I hope that my heart gets fed
Matter of fact, girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

I need you (yeah) to understand
Tried so hard (hey) to be your man
The kind of man (oh) you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

An empty shell I used to be
Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's chance to win my soul

What we doing? What we chasing?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're on a runway track from the good
I wanna paint in a picture telling where we could be at
Like the heart ain't attached where it should
You done give it away, I had it 'til you took it back
But I keep walking on, keep opening doors
Keep hoping for that the call is yours
Keep hoes on hold
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin' (beggin', beggin')

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

I'm fighting hard (yeah)
To hold my own (hold my own)
Just can't make it
All alone (all alone)

I'm holding on (yeah)
Can't fall back (no, I'm fallin')
I'm just a con (yeah)
'Bout to fade to black

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling

Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
Beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, darling
