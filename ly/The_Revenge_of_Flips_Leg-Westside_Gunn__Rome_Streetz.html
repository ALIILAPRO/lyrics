		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Con-conductor

Aimin' fire at your favorite (bow-bow)
Bum-ass niggas is fugazi, I spit in all of they faces (hahahahahaha)
Flagarant, was pushin' percoects on the pavement
Now we in Paris posin' in Prada like it's the Vogue pages (Conductor, uh-huh)
All praise is due, I teach you niggas like I'm Noble Drew
We global, you not even close to notable (you niggas trash)
We eatin' Nobu, blowin' C-notes, get paid for quotables
Take notice, I'm a star, like the logo on golden goose
Allergic to broke, my only focus is foldin' loot
Got my funds, doin' fraud, had boulders for your noses too
Bowls from Oakland but fuckin' hoes in front of ocean views
They want the likes more than the loot, livin' life confused
A fallen angle that God blessed
In a fast foreign car, keep a firearm in the armrest
Foreign broads flirtin' with the God, they want sex (uh-huh)
But lately, I'm these hoes heartthrob and they conquest
Dusty ass dollar store niggas no contest (whatever)
Mixed Denim Tears with Dior's, a calm flex
Hold the devil's heart in my palm and take his horns next (rrr)
Pose with my foot on his neck, motherfucker

Glory to the king
Glory to the king
He has been good, He's so good
Glory to the king

Ayo, stepped in my dope spot, Lord
I had the door swinging, broom sweeping up residue
I seen Bruce fiendin', said he need three more dollars (ahahaha)
I told him, "Boom, keep it" (Conductor)
Sherell shot in the calf, she jumped up screamin'
Landed on the third floor eatin' Thai, rockin' furs
Shit gettin' dry, I use my passport to get them birds
Hear me out, we break 'em all down, go to Jackson
Plus Sherell go to Jackson state, we could tax 'em
Wait till' homecoming, rob some niggas for some furniture (ah)
Fifty-yard line max small with the muggler
Ski mask hell would look short put it on the scale
Three more stops of Greyhound with darkskin Jerrel
Prada Jelly's Celine bag, Coke Makaveli
Hit the stove straight to plate
Make sure the tops Kelly
Jump off for two months
No vacancy money prompts you holding two pumps
Could see he got two trunks (skrrt)
Last night I had a dream, Sly was out the feds
And Flip hit the lotto and bought a new leg

Glory to the king
Glory to the king
He has been good, He's so good
Glory to the king

Shouldn't be on your phone anyway
You should be practicing on your art
