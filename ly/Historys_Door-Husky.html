		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two hearts burning
On a hillside turning
Round the blazing sun
Fever burning
In her head that's turning
Round the things she's done
"Free your heart
That is the hardest part",
He says, "Your heart won't lie."

Find your hope forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him

Don't look back
There is no use in wondering
Just how or why
If you leave now
You might just make it home
Before the morning light
Tired and poor
You kneel at history's door
Tonight

Find your hope forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him
[x2]

Wooh ahhh ohhh

Find your hope forget your home
Heed that feeling in your bones
For your heart knows you'll never win
Until you're free from him
[x2]

Wooh ahhh ohhh
