		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

Whoa-whoa, I- I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away

I should've walked away

Whoa-whoa, I- I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away

Whoa-whoa, I- I just died in your arms tonight
Whoa-whoa, I- I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away

I should've walked away

Whoa-whoa, I- I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away
I should've walked away
