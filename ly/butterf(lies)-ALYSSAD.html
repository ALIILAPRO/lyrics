		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If there's nothing to say, is there nothing to lose
Left with this mess, no one left to accuse
Heated decisions and blinding affection
Beautiful, toxic and beautifully tragic
We die
Trapped in our tomb 'til there's no more of me to consume
How do I
Had I told you would it be different
Had I kissed you would you still be mine
Had I agreed would we still bleed
Could we spare the butterflies
With nothing to break, is there nothing to save
Can you keep your soul, when it's only the b roll
Desire burns brighter, and flames licking higher
Keep me forever
Oh no, what a liar
We die
Trapped in this tomb there's no more of me to consume
What did I
Had I told you would it be different
Had I kissed you would you still be mine
Had I agreed would we still bleed
Could we spare the butterflies
Had I told you would it be different
Had I kissed you would you still be mine
Had I agreed would we still bleed
Can we spare your little lies
Please kill the butterflies
