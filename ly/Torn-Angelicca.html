		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always been in awe with you
Ohh
Can't you see I'm torn yeah
I still want you gone but
I can't get enough
Ex, Inhale
One moment for myself
I'm in need of self reflecting
I can't tell
Whether what you say
Is truthful or just playing games but
I know what I feel
I want you here with me
But you said we were over
Our fire's in the sea
Baby I'm still missing
Yeah I'm reminiscing
Always been in awe with you
Ohh
Can't you see I'm torn yeah
I still want you gone but
i can't get enough
Always been in love with you
Ohh
I still feel we're far apart
But baby I can't get enough
A moment crossed the other
My flowers are in need of water
All pretend
But it's the promises that you can't keep yeah
I know what is real
Yet still I am denying
I know what to fear yeah
But still I keep on diving
But baby I've
Always been in awe with you
Ohh
Can't you see I'm torn yeah
I still want you gone but
i can't get enough
Always been in love with you
Ohh
I still feel we're far apart
But baby I can't get enough
