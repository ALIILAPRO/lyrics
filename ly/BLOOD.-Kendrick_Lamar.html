		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it wickedness?
Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?

So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman, a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?

"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"

She replied
"Oh yes, you have lost something, you've lost your life"

Is it wickedness?

Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views
Uh, Lamar stated his views

Uh, Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song
Quote "and we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'"
Oh please, ugh, I don't like it
