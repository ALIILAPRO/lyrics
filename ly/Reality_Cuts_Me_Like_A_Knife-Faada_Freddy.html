		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is on fire
My strength in vain
I'm no more inspired
To live pain again
I feel waves of tears
Crunching over my chest
Breathless, I fall on ground 

Inside of me
Inside of me
The answer is inside of me
Inside of me

I thought a little money
Could make my day
I did not have any time to go down and brave
Now I need to gather all my strength
And struggle against the life
I feel tired

Inside of me
Inside of me
The answer is inside of me
Inside of me

But now I do
I thought a little money
Could make my day
I did not have any time to go down and brave
Now I need to gather all my strength
And struggle against the life
I feel tired

(I don't want to doubt tonight)
Now I do 'cause reality cuts me like a knife
(I don't want to doubt the life)
The answer is inside of me

Inside of me
Inside of me
The answer is inside of me
Inside of me

All that glitters is not gold
Life is made of highs and lows
You know the rule
When you fall down
Pick yourself up
Keep stepping on
Not much too long
On the dark side
I'm turning onto the light
Now I realized that 
Deep answer to my destiny was inside of me
