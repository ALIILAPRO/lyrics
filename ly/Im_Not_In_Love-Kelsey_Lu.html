		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not in love so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

I'm not in love, no, no
It's because

I like to see you, but then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us

I'm not in love, no, no
It's because

(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)
(Big boys don't cry)

Keep your picture up on the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

I'm not in love, no, no
It's because

Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
Just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

Do not let somebody else's problem become yours
