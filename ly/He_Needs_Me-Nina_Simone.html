		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He needs me
He doesn't know it, but he needs me
And so no matter where he goes
Though he doesn't care
He knows that I'm here

He needs me
I ought to leave him, but he needs me
I know that I ain't very bright
Just to tag along
Oh, but right or wrong
I'm his and I'm here
And I'm gonna be his friends or his lover

Cause my one ambition is
To wake him and make him discover
That he needs me
Ive got to follow where he leads me
Or else hell never know that I need him
Just as he needs me
