		  I got a plan for you and I
Let's journey across the Venetian skies
Can I have some of your cookies?
Can I have some of your pie?
May I cut the first slice? So won't you

Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right

Intoxicated with desire
And you're the designated driver, yeah
Im not afraid cause Im a rider, yeah
Ain't nothing wrong with feeling right, so wont you

Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right

I love it babe, got me here doing things I don't ever do
Can't hold me down,
That's why I'm here making sure things are up for you
Get it? Like a getaway, when the lights go off, you turn on
I love yo' place 'cause I can hear the echo when you make me
Oh
Ooh

Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right (show you it feels good)

In the car, at the party
Got his hands on your body
Dont fight it, ooh
If you like it, ooh

In your room, on the rooftop
Feels good, don't stop
Don't fight it, (don't you fight it, ooh)
If you like it, ooh
Why don't you scream!

Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right
Scream!
At the top of your lungs if your body's feeling right

Uh, if you love me girl, why don't you (scream)
If it feels good then why don't you (sing it) (scream)
Uh, if you love me girl, why don't you (scream)

Ooh
'Cause when it feels good
Don't fight it
If you like it, ooh

Yeah
Don't fight it, ooh (yeah)
If you like it, ooh
Break

Don't you like that?
It feels so good, don't it?
Grab my hand baby
Let's take a walk on the beach
Let's clear our minds

Hold your screaming here
Don't you like that beat?
You do?
What else you like?
Hmm
I can accommodate that
Oh, you like my swagger?
You like how I changed it up?
I like it too baby
But for now
I think the beat is going a little bit too long
Oh, you like it this long? Hmm!
That means you like to make love long, yeah
I feel that
I like how you shaking your hips to it, uh
It's about to end baby but don't you stop
Keep it going
Keep it going
Keep it going
And bring it over here
Sit on my lap
Kiss me
No no no, right here, yeah, ha
Ooh, I like that
Ooh, I like that, uh, ooh
Let me stop bullshittin'
