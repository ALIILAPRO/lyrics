		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby join me in death
We are so young
Our lives have just begun
That's already we are considering
Escape from this world

And we've waited for so long
For this moment to come
Was so anxious to be together
Together in death

Oh oh oh
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
Would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death

This world is so cruel
Placing were here only to lose
So before life tears us apart, let
Death bless me with you

Oh oh oh
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
So would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
Join me in death

oh oh oh
This life ain't worth living.
Join me, join me, join me,
Join me, join me, join me

This life ain't worth living
Oh oh oh
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death
So would you die?
Baby join me in death
Would you die tonight for love?
Baby join me in death

Baby join me in death.
