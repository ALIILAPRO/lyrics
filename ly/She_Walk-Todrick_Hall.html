		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She walk
She walk
She walk
She walk
She walk
She walk

She got her nails did
She got a cute wig
She got her jewels on
Put on a cute fit
She got some new heels
Call up her homos
They said, “If you can strut it out, do it in slow-mo.”

She walk (she walk)
She beat (she beat)
She werk (she werk)
She eat (she eat)
She slay (she slay)
All week (all week)
She twirl (twirl)
Repeat (let’s go)

She walk
She walk
She walk (walk, honey)
She walk
She walk
She walk (clear the runway)
Oh, she walk
She walk
She walk (strut, bitch)
She walk
She walk
She walk

She’s rockin’ all black
She’s servin’ hot pink
It’s givin’ sweatpants
And a Starbucks drink
She got her shades on
Check out her new purse
She ‘bout to slay but she gotta beat her face first

(B-b-b-beat that face, honey)

She walk (she walk)
She beat (she beat)
She werk (she werk)
She eat (she eat)
She slay (she slay)
All week (all week)
She twirl (twirl)
Repeat (let’s go)

She walk
She walk
She walk (she do)
She walk
She walk
She walk (?)
Oh, she walk
She walk
She walk (no crumbs)
She walk
She walk
She walk

One pump in front of the other
They don’t got her number but they call her mother
Ssh, she don’t deal wit the backtalk
Purrr, meow, get into the catwalk
She walk, she walk, she walk (one pump in front of the other)
She walk, she walk, she walk (they don’t got her number but the call her mother)
She walk, she walk, she walk (ssh, she don’t deal wit the backtalk)
She walk, she walk, she walk (purrr, meow, get into the catwalk)

She walk (she walk)
She beat (she beat)
She werk (she werk)
She eat (she eat)
She slay (she slay)
All week (all week)
She twirl (twirl)
Repeat (let’s go)

She walk
She walk
She walk (walk, baby)
She walk
She walk
She walk (strut)
Oh, she walk
She walk
She walk (f**k it up)
She walk
She walk
She walk
