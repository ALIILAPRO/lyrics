		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel your presence amongst us
You cannot hide in the darkness
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?

I know your soul is not tainted
Even though you've been told so
Can you hear the rumble?
Can you hear the rumble that's calling?

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you

A candle casting a faint glow
You and I see eye to eye
Can you hear the thunder?
How can you hear the thunder that's breaking?

Now there is nothing between us
From now our merge is eternal
Can't you see that you're lost?
Can't you see that you're lost without me?

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you

Can't you see that you're lost without me?

I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
I can feel the thunder that's breaking in your heart
I can see through the scars inside you
