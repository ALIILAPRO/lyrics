		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna be a rock and roll star
Gotta groove from night to day
Gotta blow my honey jar
Gonna blow my blues away
I'm gonna make a stand
Gonna make a million
Gonna make it with you
I'm gonna be wild my friend
I gotta push it through
Oh, yeah!

It's electric
It's electric
Yeah, It's electric, yeah
It's electric, whoa yeah!

I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my brow
Make it in a rock and roll show
Oh yeah

Yeah, it's electric
It's electric
Yo! it's electric, yeah
It's electric
Whoa

I stop on red but I leave on amber
Danger paves my way
I'm gonna make it my friend
Gonna make it today
Gonna get this dust from my heels
Down the highway I go
Gonna get the stars from my brow
Make it in a rock and roll show
Oh

It's electric, yeah
It's electric
Yeah, it's electric, yeah
It's electric
Yeah, it's electric
It's electric
Yo, Whoa, Yeah!
