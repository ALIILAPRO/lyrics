		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I broke you in the canyon 
I drowned you in the lake 
You a snake that I would trample 
Only thing I'd not embrace 

Oh, you couldn't dam that river 
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway 
So you couldn't dam that river 
And it washed me so far away 

I pushed and then you stumbled 
I kicked you in the face 
You stare at me so hollow 
Got to keep that killin' pace 

Oh, you couldn't dam that river 
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway 
So you couldn't dam that river 
And it washed me so far away 

I burned the place around you 
I hit you with a rake 
You piss upon my candle 
So proving you're a fake 

Oh, you couldn't dam that river 
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway 
So you couldn't dam that river 
And it washed me so far away
