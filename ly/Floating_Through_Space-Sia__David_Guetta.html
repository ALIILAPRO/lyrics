		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You made it through another day
You made it through another day
You did it, let's celebrate, oh, oh
Some days you feel you'll break
But you made it through another day
Yeah, you did it, let's celebrate, oh

24/7 and 365
You made another day, made it alive
Made another day, made it alive (yeah)
24/7 and 365
You made another day, made it alive
Made another day, made it alive

So today, baby, remember it's okay
We're all floating through space (floating through)
Today, baby, remember you're okay
We're all floating through space (floating through)
Floating through, floating through
Floating through space (floating through)
We're floating through space, we're floating through space
We're floating through space (floating through)

We are like grains of sand, better to be holding hands
Better to be holding hands, oh
We are like grains of sand, better to be holding hands
Better to be holding hands, yeah

24/7 and 365
You made another day, made it alive
Made another day, made it alive (yeah)
24/7 and 365
You made another day, made it alive
Made another day, made it alive (yeah)

So today, baby, remember it's okay
We're all floating through space (floating through)
Today, baby, remember you're okay
We're all floating through space

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

So today, baby, remember it's okay (yeah, yeah)
We're all floating through space (floating through)
Today, baby, remember you're okay (yeah, yeah)
We're all floating through space (floating through)
Floating through, floating through
Floating through space (floating through)
