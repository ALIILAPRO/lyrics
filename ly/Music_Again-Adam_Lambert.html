		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want your body, mind, soul, etcetera
And one day you'll see, you should give it to me
And I don't want anyone instead of ya
Oh babe I'm goin crazy, come on and give it to me 
Oh babe I'm goin' crazy, come on and give it to me
And I ain't never met nobody betterer
You're someone else's baby
I'm so sick of living for other people

Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya, I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine and
Look into my eyes very eyes
Oh you make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah you make me wanna listen to music again

There had been many moons before I met ya
And I ain't going nowhere
And now you give me back my raisin d'etre
And I'm inspired again

And I know in some ways I'm kinda evil
Got my roots in you, got ties
But my heart's no stranger to upheaval
Put your little hand in mine and
Look into my eyes very eyes

Oh you make me wanna listen to music again
Yeah you make me wanna listen to music again
Ah music again
Look in to my eyes very eyes
I just wanna listen to music again
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah woo oh hey!

I'm so sick of living for other people
Took meeting you to realize
I don't wanna lose ya, I wanna keep ya
Put your little hand in mine and
Look into my eyes very eyes whoa

Oh you make me wanna listen to music again whoa
Yeah you make me wanna listen to music again whoa
Oh you make me wanna listen to music again whoa
Yeah you make me wanna listen to music again
