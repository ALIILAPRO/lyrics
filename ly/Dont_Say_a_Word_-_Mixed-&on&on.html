		  Just shut up
Just shut up
Don't say a 
Just shut up
Just shut up
Don't say a
Just shut up
Just shut up
Don't say a
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door

Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door

Just shut up
Don't say a word
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door

Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I heard enough from you last night to last me a lifetime
Just shut up
Don't say a word
I'm about to walk out that door
