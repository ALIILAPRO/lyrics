		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't see me
In this crowded room
I don't know you
Like I used to

We've gone from sharing the world
To sharing beds with others, it's fine
I'm fine

I'm lonely for you only
Come hold me
There's nobody with their body
Who unfolds me

I'm lonely for you only
Come hold me
There's nobody with their body
Who unfolds me

Can I call you?
I'll hold it back this time
I need your voice
If you don't mind

We've gone from talking all night
To your cold and numb surface, it's fine
I'm fine

I'm lonely for you only
Come hold me
There's nobody with their body
Who unfolds me

I'm lonely for you only
Come hold me
There's nobody with their body
Who unfolds me

I'll forever stay lonely
If you only hold me one last time
Come see me one more time
I need you one last time

I'm lonely for you only
Come hold me
There's nobody with their body
Who unfolds me

I'm lonely for you only
Come hold me
There's nobody with their body
Who unfolds me
