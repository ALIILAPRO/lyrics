		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feeling so dead that it's just not me
Smoke inside of my lungs and I cannot breath
'Til the drugs fuck me up turn me to a fiend
Choke her out while she sad 'til she cannot breath
Turn my head to another and I don't know why
I can never forget so I can waste my time
Shall we holdout together or will you take my life
I can feel your torment I just wanna die
Voices in my head always telling me to go
Everybody 'nother yes man thinking that they know
Layed up on the asphalt
With a blade inside your neck
Smell of your blood
Got me itching I gon' wreck yeah
Double triple on the dash
Every murder 'nother gash
Living life so fucking fast
Will I know when I surpass
Turn this shit into a fucking moshpit like it's fallout
Feeling like a demon from the well and I'm in hell now
She said I can go all night but I know she won't hold out
Trying to take me under I can hear the demons call out
Voices in my head always telling me to go
Everybody 'nother yes man thinking that they know
Layed up on the asphalt
With a blade inside your neck
Smell of your blood
Got me itching I gon' wreck yeah
Double triple on the dash
Every murder 'nother gash
Living life so fucking fast
Will I know when I surpass
