		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah (Durel made the beat, I'ma rock with it)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Mmm, mmm, ooh

Don't nothin' change but the chains (whoa)
We on your head like a bang (bang)
All double Rs, no Range (Range)
Big stain came with a name (stain)
Got all eyes on my gang (gang)
Hundred-thousand, kiss the ring (ring)
Foreign exchange the chain (foreign)
Foreign exchange the chain (foreign, foreign)

Run it up, that's it (run it up)
M&M's, whole tick (Whole tick)
Don't mind if I do it, I get it, I love my brothers, I split it (split it)
Lil' nigga, mind ya business, cause I got some guns, they hidden (hidden)
Jump out the bando, just choppin' the chickens, and now I'm on top of the city (city)
Designer mismatching, yeah, the money do backflips, yeah
I flipped the mattress, (flip it) I fog up my glasses, yeah
I upped the status, now she lookin' like a actress, yeah (woo)
That's a big go-bag, now we gon' fuck up Magic (yeah)
And we got a hunnid round mag, (shoot) to clear out the madness (rahh)
I'm the Huncho to my people and I cannot go out the saddest (no)
Don't need no money counter, 'cause I think my fingers count the fastest (cash)
No, I'm not Bruce Wayne, but I keep the fire like a dragon (fire)
Stackin' up loose change and I turned the shit into a mansion (mansion)
Boarding a new plane, one phone call when we landing (landing)
Know the crew came from the northside of the planet (northside)
She see the new chain, she gon' jump right out of her panties (jump out, out of her panties)
Before the trap turned golden, I was stacking in the pantry (stacking the pantry)
Ain't nothin' Hollywood but the name, I gotta tell 'em that

Don't nothin' change but the chains (whoa)
We on your head like a bang (bang)
All double Rs, no Range (Range)
Big stain came with a name (stain)
Got all eyes on my gang (gang)
Hundred-thousand, kiss the ring (ring)
Foreign exchange the chain (foreign)
Foreign exchange the chain (foreign, foreign)

Foreign exchange the chain (chain)
Fame came with the chain (chain)
You get a stripe for a stain (stripe)
You 'bout to crash out your lane (skkr)
The umbrella out of the Rolls was Cullinan
Know it came with the rain (Cullinan)
No letterman, I been a veteran
Nigga do anything for a name (anything)
When you start getting a lil' change
Watch how your partners and everything change (change)
And when you step foot in that field
Make sure you're strapped and make sure you got aim (grah)
My niggas, they shooting to live
I seen some niggas, they shooting for fame (nah)
They don't know that this shit real
That's how you end up getting blowed out your brains (brrt)
The money, the car, the chains and fame
I give up everything (why?)
To see my grandma, just to see my peak at the
Drugs can't heal all the pain (no cap)
I get you knocked off of Earth, you play with my body
You play with my name (play with it)
I wet 'em up like he surf, if he looking strange
I pop at his brain (don't play with me)
I'm rocking a watch with no diamonds in it
It cost me a ticket, it's plain
I put baguettes in the Patek, what time is it?
And it cost me a Rolls, insane (Rolls)
I don't post pics with sticks and shit, that's how them boys get framed (fool)
I been the same since a jit, lil' bitch, when they see me they say

Don't nothin' change but the chains (Takeoff, whoa)
We on your head like a bang (bang)
All double Rs, no Range (Range)
Big stain came with a name (stain)
Got all eyes on my gang (gang)
Hundred-thousand, kiss the ring (ring)
Foreign exchange the chain (foreign)
Foreign exchange the chain (foreign, foreign)

(Durel made the beat, I'ma rock with it)
