		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been lost in a dark desert hoping you'd come and just be more open with me
You swore up and down, you promised that it wouldn't be the same
Funny how nothing has changed
As I opened up, you removed all of my senses, took everything away from me
You swore up and down it wouldn't be this way, funny how nothing has changed
It got to me
I can't clear my head when you're filling it all up with smoke
You just have to tell me everything as though it's true, and I don't know what to do
But you just can't force-feed me everything and say it's true
So what do I do with you? 
How do I let you know it got to me?
