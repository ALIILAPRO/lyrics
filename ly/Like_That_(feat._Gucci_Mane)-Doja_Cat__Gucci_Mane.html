		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  CÃ¡llate, Mike Crook (ooh)
Burr, burr
Gucci (don't stop), Doja, got away (no)
Yeah (don't stop)

That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way

Yeah
I said, "Do that, do that, baby, all night long"
And I'ma turn off all my phones
You know I hate it when I'm left on read
But he make it all up in the bed
And he take me out, dinin' on nothin' but the best
He got Off-White on right, damn, he can dress
Makin' plans from the East, makin' bands in the West
Rock star, Black Beatle type, bands on his bread
And baby, I want it, and I just be honest
'Cause I just can't front when I look at you
Just keep it one hunnid when I throw these hunnids
I hope that your ass gon' know what to do

That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it (huh?)
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid (Wop)
Just like that, come my way

Gucci El Dorado, we in Rome, I'm a model (Rome)
Gucci Mane and Doja Cat, call me El Gato (Gato)
I'm the big boss and I got big bread (yeah)
I'm gettin' big-headed and I like good head (shh)
I'm not cheap, baby, and I'm sure not selfish (no)
Shakin' like Elvis, damn near broke my pelvis (sheesh)
Jumpin' off the top rope, got 'em tag teamin' (tag)
Putting' on a show, I got the whole crowd screamin'
Bougie with the bread, I'll knock a top-notch freak (freak)
Act like I'm a treat when a dog see me
Like a thief in the night, just like she stole my green
Got me walkin' off the scene like a whole in my jeans (damn, Gucci)

That's my shit, that's my wave (yeah)
Do it like that and I'll repay it (huh?)
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid (huh?)
Just like that, come my way
That's my shit, that's my wave
Do it like that and I'll repay it
Don't be scared, I ain't afraid
Just like that, come my way

Said I like it, I like it
I like it, I like it like that
Said I like it, I like it (ooh)
I like it, I like it like that
That's my shit
