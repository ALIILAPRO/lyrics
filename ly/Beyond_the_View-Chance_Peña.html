		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you through a telescope
A million miles away in the night
A partial glimpse of subtleties 
Far beyond the view of naked eyes

I mapped the course of shooting stars
Sent from you as hints of who you are
But I lost sight of you in the black, caught up searching For the traits you lack

But the distance is the lesser crime done

I know this hurts
It's not the first
But it is the worst
And you deserve

More than me
I hope you see
Love is lost
And I can't be

The saving light
Of your life
In the dark
I must hide

To keep you safe
Far from hate
I hope you know

You deserve better, better
You deserve, you deserve better
You deserve better, better
You deserve, you deserve better
Than me

What I'm searching for I do not know
Maybe I can't comprehend your light
Oh my head, round and round it goes
Looking back I wish we took our time

But it's not a waste
This game we play
It's all for what we learn

And if we choose to break
Or hesitate
Take it for what it's worth

But the distance is the lesser crime done

You deserve
You deserve
You deserve
You deserve better
