		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be giving up, oh

Home is where the heart is
And I gave it to you in a paper bag
Even though it's tarnished
You told me it's the best you ever had
You got my secret combination
And I don't be giving that out easily
With my deep dedication
You can tell that you were brought the same for me

So please don't let go
'Cause you know
Exactly what we found
So please don't let go
My darling
You keep me hooked up underground
It's gonna be you
And me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who
And me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be

We're meant to be

Rolling with the punches
So they won't get inside our happiness
Love is always hunted
But you're white rose is soaring through my tear
'Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

So please don't let go
'Cause you know
Exactly what we found
So please don't let go
My darling
You keep me hooked up underground
It's gonna be you
And me
It's gonna be everything you've ever dreamed
It's gonna be who
And me
It's gonna be everything and everything, we're meant to be

In you're big house on the hills
Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will
Know you will, know you will, know you will
I know you will
