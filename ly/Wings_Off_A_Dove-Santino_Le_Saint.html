		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't let you fall in love
Girl I don't need you to save me
I'll cut the wings off a Dove
I don't mind if you hate me
I just can't let you fall in love
Say I'm problematic and crazy
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you baby
Just don't fall in love

No I can't give you my heart I've committed to
A lifestyle that I bleed for unconditionally
So what you're getting after that is just residual matter
There's poison on the dart and one edge on the dagger
Say I'm a psycho babe
Just say what you're gonna say
To help you ease the pain
I'll give you gas for the flame
I was lonely when I promised you us
Now I'm asking you to call my bluff

I just can't let you fall in love
Girl I don't need you to save me
I'll cut the wings off a Dove
I don't mind if you hate me
I just can't let you fall in love
Say I'm problematic and crazy
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you baby, yeah

And as time passes by you'll find a good one with an honest job
And the truth is I don't practice what I preach baby I'm not the one
I rather see you hate me than love just to resent it later
Now you see my cards out on this table
Say that im crazy babe
Just say what you're gunna say
To help you ease the pain
I'll give you gas for the flame
I may be savage but I speak from the heart
And I'd do anything to spare more scars

I just can't let you fall in love
Girl I don't need you to save me
I'll cut the wings off a Dove
I don't mind if you hate me
I just can't let you fall in love
Say I'm problematic and crazy
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you baby

I can't let you fall in love
Girl I don't need you to save me
I'll cut the wings off a Dove
I don't mind if you hate me
I just can't let you fall in love
Say I'm problematic and crazy
Whatever helps you sleep at night
Whatever helps you baby
Just don't fall in love
