		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It is about what you feel, what you do
How you choose to present yourself when the situation requires you
It is about what you're looking for, what you search for
It is not about fulfillment, but it is about what is missing
How do you improve? How do you progress?
Are you searching?

It is about the mind
How it grows progressively
What do you feed it?
How do you cultivate the mind?

It is about the galaxies and the stars
But not so much about the moon as much as it is about you

It is about choices much is it about decisions
But it is about having the bravery and the strength
To make those things come to fruition
What is it you're searching for?

It is about a pause, a break
A interruption in the transmission
A stop in the space-time continuum
A choice that you will always make
A moment in being when you realise
That you are what you are searching for
So, I will ask: what is it you are searching for?

It is about infinite tomorrows
But is also about yesterdays and how the past repeats itself
So how will you choose to repeat yourself in their lives?

It is about now
It is about then
What is it you are searching for?
What is it you are searching for?
Is it the now? Is it the no? Is it the yes?
Is it that subsequent I love you that you need?
What is it you are searching for?
What is it you are searching for?
