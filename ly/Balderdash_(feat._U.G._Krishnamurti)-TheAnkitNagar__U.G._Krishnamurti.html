		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They did not mean the illusion in the sense of which you see, the English word is used
"Maya" means to measure
The Sanskrit word means, to measure
So you cannot measure anything
Unless you have a point, hmm
So if the center is absent, there is no circumference at all
This point has no continuity
This point comes into being in response to the demands of the situation
The demands of the situation creates this point
The subject does not at all exist there
Hmm
It is the object that creates the subject
It runs counter to the whole philosophical thinking of man in India
So, this subject comes and goes, and comes and goes
In response to the things that are happening there
And, it is the object that creates the subject and not the subject that creates the object
This is a simple physiological phenomenon which can be tested
There is light
If the light is not there, you have no way, of looking at anything
The light falls on that
And the reflection of that light activates the optic nerves
Hmm
And that in its turn activates the memory cells
Hmm
When once, you see, the memory cells are activated
All the knowledge you have about it comes into operation
So, it is that thing that is happening there
That has created this subject
Which is the knowledge you have about that
So, when you reduce it to that, you see
You feel the absurdity of talking about the self, lower self, higher self
And knowing, and self-knowing, self-knowledge
Knowing from moment-to-moment
Is absolute rubbish
Balderdash
You know, you can indulge in such absolute nonsense
And, you see, build philosophical theories
But there is no subject there at all at any time
It's not the subject which creates the object
There is no permanent entity there at all
What is there is only
What you call 'I'
Is only a first-person singular pronoun
Nothing else
And if you don't want to use that 'I'
To prove you are a man without 'I'
It is, hehe, your privilege
