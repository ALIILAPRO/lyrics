		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know it breaks my heart
To see you standing in the dark
Alone waiting there for me to come back
I'm too afraid to show

If it's coming over you
Like it's coming over me
I'm crashing like a tidal wave
That drags me out to sea
I want to be with you
If you want to be with me
Crashing like a tidal wave
I don't want to be
Stranded
Stranded
Stranded
So baby come back to me [Stranded]
So baby come back to me [Stranded]

I can only take so much
These tears are turning me to rust
I know you're waiting there for me to come back
I'm too afraid to show

If it's coming over you
Like it's coming over me
I'm crashing like a tidal wave
That drags me out to sea
I want to be with you
If you want to be with me
Crashing like a tidal wave
I don't want to be
Stranded
Stranded
Stranded
So baby come back to me [Stranded]
So baby come back to me [Stranded]

I miss you
I miss you
Without you
I'm stranded
I love you
So come back
I'm not afraid to show

Crashing like a tidal wave
Drags me out to sea
I want to be with you
You want to be with me
Crashing like a tidal wave
I don't want to be
Stranded
It's coming over you [Stranded]
It's coming over you [Stranded]
It's coming over you [Stranded]

So baby come back to me [Stranded]
So baby come back to me [Stranded]

Coming over you
Coming over me

So baby come back to me
So baby come back to me
