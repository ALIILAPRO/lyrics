		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo, Rvssian, you're a space cadet with this one
(Ayy, Rvssian)

I checked my bank account, it was negative
I checked again, I had me some M&Ms
I ain't fuckin' on a ho if she regular
I'm putting bad bitches on the schedule
They dropped the sauce, they mad I levelled up
Shine in the dark, I'm holdin' my Rollies up
I'm from the streets, I got my portfolio
They talkin' bad, they don't even know me though
I got this game I got from the corner store
Gotta be in it, cannot be on you though
I used to serve for real like a Domino's
I sip the syrup for real, my momma know
Hit from the back, I stand on my tippie-toes
Now I'm so smooth, roll through like a finger roll
They'll never understand all this lingo
I get them bricks in like a gringo

Ho hoppin', tote poppin'
Keep a nigga main bitch throat poppin'
Keep the squares in the hood like I know papi
Chop 'em down like I teach karate
My lil' niggas run up in there like robots
Trap bunkin', I got four spots
Automatic twelve gauge, that's a door stopper
Catch 'em slippin', we gon' throw 'em out
If it's four of us, we got four choppers
If it's three of us, we got three choppers
Do you get the point? Man, we keep choppers
We gon' fold 'em up like some Reeboks
Turn a Glock .40 to a beat box
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa, pow-pow-pow-pow-pow
When it's beef I ain't hear a peep out ya
If they kill me, they gon' creep 'bout ya
I'm a God in my hood, you can read 'bout it
I put shooters on payroll, I feed goblins
Every nigga around me ain't gon' need nothin'
Fly the homies in town, they gon' crease somethin'
While I sit back and have me a threesome
Got these old head niggas in they feelings
They gon' really be mad when I fuck they bitches

I checked my bank account, it was negative
I checked again, I had me some M&Ms
I ain't fuckin' on a ho if she regular
I'm putting bad bitches on the schedule
They dropped the sauce, they mad I levelled up
Shine in the dark, I'm holdin' my Rollies up
I'm from the streets, I got my portfolio
They talkin' bad, they don't even know me though
I got this game I got from the corner store
Gotta be in it, cannot be on you though
I used to serve for real like a Domino's
I sip the syrup for real, my momma know
Hit from the back, I stand on my tippie-toes
Now I'm so smooth, roll through like a finger roll
They'll never understand all this lingo
I get them bricks in like a gringo

In the streets, Pluto bigger than Jigga
Got racks to my ear, nah, I can't hear you
Come to the jeweler, it come to this mula
You might as well call me Godzilla
I got these thotties and hotties, exotics
Exotics got bodies on bodies, what's up?
Real, I'm a rock star but way triller
I fucked on a pop star then hit a stripper
I rock Cavalli, man, fuck bein' modest
Just looked at my arm, that's a new Maserati
I'm overseas on you lil' bitty shrimps
Somebody country and I'm higher than a blimp
I fucked a rapper bitch and had her star struck
Man, I damn near should've been a pimp
I put her in Tom Ford googles
When she go down to give a nigga lip
I'm over-quoted, I'm worse than Ebola
Coco Chanel, got them straight out the corner
Pitch black, see I'm lit up, Baguette
I slice a average like a machete
Flyer than a parachute, never forget it
You niggas some hoes, don't ever forget it

I checked my bank account, it was negative
I checked again, I had me some M&Ms
I ain't fuckin' on a ho if she regular
I'm putting bad bitches on the schedule
They dropped the sauce, they mad I levelled up
Shine in the dark, I'm holdin' my Rollies up
I'm from the streets, I got my portfolio
They talkin' bad, they don't even know me though
I got this game I got from the corner store
Gotta be in it, cannot be on you though
I used to serve for real like a Domino's
I sip the syrup for real, my momma know
Hit from the back, I stand on my tippie-toes
Now I'm so smooth, roll through like a finger roll
They'll never understand all this lingo
I get them bricks in like a gringo

You know how the niggas comin' 'bout Rvssian
Whole lotta FreeBandz, whole lotta money
You know what I'm sayin'?
Whole lotta shottas, don't play with them
