		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Adoration 
We crawl on our knees 
for wrongful answers 
Kept on our leash 
Controlled 

Condemnation 
We followed your lead 
But the end times 
The end times await
The end times, the end times
They wait, they wait, they wait
for you and me 

We could have had it all, it all  
But we sold our good fate 
and imposed their ill grace 
When they burn us all
Say, They chose the best way 
Come behold our best days

I was misguided by your pain 
I don't need redemption 
I don't need your grace 

No one could save me from their reign 
I don't need ascension 
Nor your condescension

I won't be guided by your pain 
I don't seek redemption 
I don't seek your grace

No one will save me from their reign â€¨
I don't need ascension 
I will meet my fate 

Domination 
With blood on our knees 
To keep them happy 
We pull our own leash 

But the end times 
The end times await
The end times, the end times
They wait, they wait, they wait
for you and me 

We could have had it all, it all  
But we sold our good fate 
and imposed their ill grace 
When they burn us all
Say, They chose the best way 
Come behold our best days
