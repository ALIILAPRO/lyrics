		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies, are you ready? 
Ladies, are you ready? 

I got you online, I got you on time 
I'll keep you online until the sun rise! 
I got you locked down because of right sound 
Just turn it loud! 

You call it hot line, you got me on time 
And give it last night and I got you on fire 
I got you locked down because of right sound 
Just turn it loud! 

Lonely! A-a-another day! Don't keep me lonely 
Lonely! A-a-another day! Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 
Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 
Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 

You call it hot line, you got me on time 
I give it last night, I got your love fight! 
I got your love till because of my sound 
Just turn it 

Lonely! A-a-another day! Don't keep me lonely 
Lonely! A-a-another day! Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 
Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 
Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 

Ladies, are you ready? You're ready to crazy loop? 
Ladies, are you ready? You know what you wanna do? 
Ladies, are you ready? You're ready to crazy loop? 
Ladies, are you ready you know what you wanna do? 

Lonely! A-a-another day! Don't keep me lonely 
Lonely! A-a-another day! Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 
Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day! 
Don't keep me lonely in this lonely day!
