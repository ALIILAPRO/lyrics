		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i remember the first words that you ever said
they were soft like seeds deep in my chest
I wanna know who you are
I wanna know who you are

Hands like winter, eyes like wings
and the first kiss cut like ice in the spring
I wanna know who you are 
I sleep deep in the dark

come and take it all, leave a note for the world
I'll be back when from the sky when the red earth cries for the girls

Stumble into love like a challenge above but I ache with the fear that my fate is to yell and to yearn 

The white roses at the front door
Our legs intertwined when it rains on the porch
I wanna know who you are
I hunt for blood like a shark

So i'm running back to the lock of your arms
baby you know I never hit the mark
I wanna know who you are
you're the reason I've come so far

I leave it up to all the will that lives inside me but I'd kill to keep you here right next to me
There's something in the way I'm lifted when I hear your name there's nothing that can touch what you have made 

come and take it all, leave a note for the world
I'll be back when from the sky when the red earth cries for the girls
