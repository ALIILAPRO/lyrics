		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mine, mine, mine, mine (They hate you)
(They love you but then they hate you) Mine
(They love you but then they hate you) Mine
(They love you but then they hate you) Mine
(They love you but then they hate you) Mine

I know that I want you but is this enough? (Is this enough?)
My feelings aren't changing, put this in your mouth (Put this in your mouth)
Just feels right when you go with me
Bet you never knew me like that (Like that)
Make me smile when you come to me
Bet you never knew I was bad
Let me know what you want with me (Want with me)
Won't ever be shady, won't lie to my baby
Won't ever be shady, won't lie to my baby

You touch my mind when you talk to me
You do it all the time when you close
If this feels right when you talk to me
Then do me like you know I'm yours
You touch my mind when you talk to me
You do it all the time when you close
If this feels right when you talk to me
Then do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
(I love you, but it)

I see you called (I see you called)
I see you called just yesterday, why?
See you called (Why?)
See you called just yesterday
I know you expect me to cry (Cry)
Expect me to see other guys (Guys)
You calling me solo, but baby you don't know
I'm really not solo, I'm really not solo
They calling my phone though (Calling my phone though)
But baby, you don't know (Baby you don't know)
I only let you, I only let you, I only let you come inside

You touch my mind when you talk to me
You do it all the time when you close
If this feels right when you talk to me
Then do me like you know I'm yours
You touch my mind when you talk to me
You do it all the time when you close
If this feels right when you talk to me
Then do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
(I love you, but it)

I crawl with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I lick with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I walk with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I lick with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I crawl with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I lick with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I walk with the strength of your spirit in my heart
I dance with the strength of your spirit in my heart

You touch my mind when you talk to me
You do it all the time when you close
If this feels right when you talk to me
Then do me like you know I'm yours
You touch my mind when you talk to me
You do it all the time when you close
If this feels right when you talk to me
Then do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
Do me like you know I'm yours
I'm yours when you talk to me
(I love you, but it)
