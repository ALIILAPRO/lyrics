		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know why we here
You know what we came to do

When I go buc buc, you better buc back
(Buc buc buc buc buc buc buc buc)
So put yo middle fingers up
Niggas say fuck that
(Fuck that, fuck that! Fuck that, fuck that)

When shit pop off, niggas ain't never around
We pop off, we don't care whoever's in town
Never trust
It's never us if the cops ask questions
Never trust a nigga, even pop my best friend
Your end's coming near
Your niggas come in here
With that tough guy shit, the tough die quick
So wake the fuck up from the dead
You bitch niggas or get your hair done
Roll with official wig splitters
The kick back from the pistol
Will break your wrist
Then I'll put you six feet in
The ground and take a piss
I'm disrespectful, yeah, I know, but fuck you
I know a couple niggas that'll kill
You for a buck or two
For five bucks they get live as fuck
Five years on the island
Can't survive the cuts
So buc back, put yo middle fingers niggas up
And fuck that if you feel just like me


When I buc back
Y'all niggas running like bitches
Im like fuck that
Always keep a gun in my britches
It's none of your business, nigga
Where the fuck Sticky been?
I show up at your place
Of business with fifty men
Better let Sticky in, â€˜fore I get ticked off
Pockets get ripped off, jewelry slipped off
I screw face niggas when I walk by them
Those two faced niggas
They won't even try him
Cause niggas know, I ain't taking a short
Fuck a witness
He won't even make it to court
Yeah, Forte Green, Big House is Brownsville
From here on out, nigga, it's all downhill
My four pound feels heavy as a motherfucker
And you don't wanna test it
So when I go buc buc you better buc back
I hope you get the message!
