		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet (take a look at yourself)
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord 
Somebody uh (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 

I work (he works hard) hard every day of my life
I work 'til I ache my bones
At the end (at the end of the day) I take home my hard earned pay all on my own 
I go down on my knees
And I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes
Lord, somebody uh (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 

(He works hard) everyday (everyday)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, Lord
Somebody uh (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me somebody to love? 

(Can anybody find me somebody to love?)
Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm alright, I'm alright (he's alright)
I ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Somebody (somebody) somebody (somebody)
Somebody find me, somebody find me somebody to love 
Can anybody find me 
Somebody to come on, love, yeah

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody, somebody, somebody to love (find me somebody to love)
Find me, find me, find me, find me uh somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (anybody, anywhere)
Somebody, somebody to love yeah yeah oh (find me somebody to love)
