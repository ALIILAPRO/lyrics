		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen to this track, bitch

Girl the way you're movin', got me in a trance 
DJ turn me up, ladies, this yo' jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you 'gon lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (leggo)
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way yo' booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (Flocka, Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka)

All that ass in yo' jeans
Can Wale beat? Can Roscoe skeet?
Long hair, she don't care
When she walk she get stares
Brown skin or a yellow-bone
DJ, this my favorite song
So I'ma make it thunderstorm
Bud, want it Flocka, yeah
Blow it, fuck it, I don't care
Chests' flyin' everywhere
Tap my partner Roscoe, like
"Bruh, I'm drunk as hell, can't you tell?"
Threw seventy bands, bet fifty stacks, oh fuckin' well
I'm tryna hit the hotel with two girls that swallow me
Take this dick, wanna swallow, Pink Moscato got her freaky
Ayy, you got me in a trance, please take off yo' pants
Pussy pop on a handstand, you got me sweatin'
Please pass me a fan, damn (Flocka, Waka Flocka, Waka Flocka)

Girl the way you're movin', got me in a trance 
DJ turn me up, ladies, this yo' jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you 'gon lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (leggo)
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way yo' booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move (ayy, ayy)
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (Wale, uh)

She said, "Look ma, no hands"
She said, "Look ma, no hands"
And, no darling, I don't dance
And I'm with Roscoe, I'm with Waka
I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad mothafucka, go n' ask them mothafuckas
A young handsome mothafucka
I sling that wood, I just nunchuck 'em
And who you wit'? And what's yo' name?
And you not hip? Boo, I'm Wale
And that D.C. shit, I rep all day
And my eyes red 'cause of all that haze
Don't blow my high, let me shine
Drumma on the beat, let me take my time
Nigga want beef? We can take it outside
Fight for what broad? These hoes ain't mine
Is you out yo' mind? You out yo' league
I sweat no bitches, just sweat out weaves
Wear out tracks, let me do my thing
I got sixteen for this Roscoe thing
But I'm almost done, let me get back to it
Whole lotta loud in a lil' Backwood
Whole lotta money, big tip, I would
I put her on the train, little engine could, bitch

Girl the way you're movin', got me in a trance 
DJ turn me up, ladies, this yo' jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you 'gon lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands (leggo)
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way yo' booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash
Roscoe Dash, okay (leggo)

R-O-S-C-O-E (O-E)
Mr. Shawty Put It On Me (please)
I be goin' ham (ham)
Shorty upgrade from bologna (please)
Them niggas tippin' good, girl, but I can make it flood (I can)
'Cause I walk around with pockets bigger that are than my bus (whoa)
"Rain, rain go away" that's what all my haters say
My pockets stuck on overload, my rain never evaporates (never)
No need to elaborate (never), most of these ducks exaggerate (they do)
But I'ma get money, nigga, every day stuntin', nigga
Ducks might get a chance after me (go)
Bitch, I'm ballin' like I'm comin' off of free throws
Just ahead of the game, no cheat codes
Lambo' Roscoe, no street code (skrrt)
And your booty got me lost like Nemo
Go, go, go, go-gon' and do yo' dance (right now)
And, I'ma throw this money
While you do it wit' no hands (I'm gon')

Girl the way you're movin', got me in a trance 
DJ turn me up, ladies, this yo' jam (come on)
I'ma sip Moscato and you 'gon lose them pants
Then I'ma throw this money while you do it with no hands
Girl, drop it to the floor
I love the way yo' booty go
All I wanna do is sit back and watch you move
And I'll proceed to throw this cash (wow, wow, wow, wow)

Leggo
