		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love comes and love goes 
Love fades and sometimes it grows 
Who knows? 
 
Feels like just yesterday 
You were a brand new face 
But that goes away 
 
Maybe in another life 
You'd find someone else and so would I 
And so would I 
But if one day we'd meet  
Would your heart skip a beat? 
Cause I know I lose my mind 
 
And even after all these fights 
Long nights, ups and downs, 
Walking out, and turnin' around 
It's you 
It's always always always always you 
 
Love comes and love goes 
Love fades and sometimes it grows 
Who knows 
Feels like just yesterday 
You were a brand new face 
That goes away 
 
Maybe in another life 
You'd find someone else and so would I 
And so would I 
And if it wasn't you and me, 
Would you know it would you see 
Cause I know I'd lose my mind 
 
And even after all these fights 
Long nights, ups and downs, 
Walking out, and turnin' around 
It's you, it's always always always 
 
Maybe in another life 
You'd find someone else and so would I 
So would I 
But if one day we meet  
Would your heart skip a beat? 
Cause I know I'd lose my mind 
And even after all these fights 
Long nights, ups and downs, 
Walking out, and turnin' around 
It's you 
It's always always always always you  
It's always always always you 
It's always, always you
