		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take my fingerprints
And smile
This is the only thing
That I will leave in here
In here

The world goes too fast
I walk way too slow
How could I contrast landscapes out of hope
Landscapes out of hope

I got to kill the killer that's inside
And I got to heal the healer that's inside
It's a dead end road

Some things never end and
Some things never die
I'll take the wind for company
'cause you and me will never be one

Pursued by the radiance of her eyes
Telling me that there is no need to cry
There is no need to cry
(Watch me shivering at your door
Begging for a space on your floor)

I got to heal the healer that's inside
And
I got to kill the killer that's inside
It's a dead end road

Take the time to read the wrinkles on one's face
As an open book of what has been his life
I'll tell you what has been his life

How can they decide for the blood that is mine
I'm part of you as I am part of the stars
You are the beat inside my heart

I got to kill the killer that's inside
It's a dead end road
