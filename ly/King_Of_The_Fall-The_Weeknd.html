		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm addied up, added up
I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dying
The shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (ow)
My flight too private, my show's so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city to the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't flying (oh, ohh)

And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (know I might)
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (know I might)
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (know I might)
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (oh, ohh)
Baby girl, you know what I like, baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like (like, like, like, like, like)

Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She make her own luck
She don't give a fuck
She trying to have fun
Take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call to the fall, you can like it or not
Nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain't with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain't complimenting, nigga, you offending
I been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time investment
Them fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'mma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain't been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I'd be sober in the first place

And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (know I might like)
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (know I might like)
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (know I might)
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it (hey)
Baby girl, you know what I like, baby, you know just what I like (no, no, no)
Baby, you know what I like (like like like like like)

Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like, mmm, mmm, mm
I just passed that liquor, fell off stage
I just sold out the 02 at my own pace
I can say that I'm attached to nobody
I been getting paper while these niggas tryin' a stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that's a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now the word out that we back on
Some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be sounding like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO, mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This is my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
'Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street, nigga, making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to "The Boy" broke bread on tour
Man, it's all love now
Shout out my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Man he popping more bottles then us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain't shit funny, can't nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
All of, all of
All of them swallow
All of them swallow
I make all of them swallow
