		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby baby, sweet baby
There's something that I just got to say
Baby baby, sweet baby
You left me hurtin' in a real cold way

Speak your name
And I'll feel a thrill
You said I do
And I said I will

I tell you that I'll stay true
And give you just a little time
Wait on me baby
I want you to be all of mine
I just get so blue

Since you've been gone, baby
(Why'd you do it, why'd you have to do it)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it, why'd you have to do it)

Baby baby, sweet baby
I didn't mean to run you away
It was pride on my lips
But not in my heart
To say the things that made you stray
But ah, babe
Hear me now (hear me)

I don't know what I'm gonna do (hear me)
Got to get you back somehow (hear me now)
Ooh, take me back
Consider me please
If you walk in that door
I can get up off my knees
I just been so blue

Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it, why'd you have to do it)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it, why'd you have to do it)
Well I've been so lonely
(Sweet sweet, sweet sweet baby)
Baby, since you've been gone
(Sweet sweet, sweet sweet baby)
I've been so lonely
(Why'd you do it, why'd you have to do it)
Since you've been gone
(Why'd you do it, why'd you have to do it)
Baby baby baby
