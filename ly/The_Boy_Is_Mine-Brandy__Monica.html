		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine, the boy is mine
The boy is mine

Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
Uh huh sure, you know, you look kinda familiar
Yeah, you do to, but I just wanted to know do you know somebody named?
You-you know his name
Oh yeah definitely, I know his name
Well I just want to let you that he's mine
Huh no, no he's mine

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Think it's time we got this straight
Sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?

You see I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me

See I tried to hesitate
I didn't want to say what he told me
He said without me he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?

But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (confused, oh)
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true

I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside

You can say what you wanna say
What we have you can't take
From the truth you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake

When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (enough)
It's not hard to see (to see)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up (ooh)
Had about enough (had about enough)
It's not hard to see (he's mine, he's mine, he's mine, he's mine)
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry)
Seem to be confused (you seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine

You can't destroy this love I found
Your silly games I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel

What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up (give it on up)
Had about enough
It's not hard to see (the boy is mine, oh)
The boy is mine 
I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (no, no)

You need to give it up (you need to give it up)
Had about enough ('bout enough)
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (mine, oh)
Seem to be confused (seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (he belongs to me)
The boy is mine (the boy is mine)

You need to give it up (not yours, but mine)
Had about enough (not yours, but mine)
It's not hard to see (not yours, but mine)
The boy is mine

I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
