		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God is a dancer, yeah, I heard on the radio
That she always goes harder
'Cause she keepin' you on your toes
And she's perfectly focused
She's lost in the moment
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Are you feelin' that fire?
'Cause the music is on the way
If you wanna be higher
Wanna move to the break of day, yeah
Whoa, better go, better watch it
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that left, right, left, leave 'em coming back for more
You got that step-by-step when you come out on the floor
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that

Body that's rockin', let's put it all on ya
Let 'em know you're coming for that
Ain't nothin' to it, it's natural for ya, yeah
Oh my, oh my, oh my
You got the answer
You won't stop for nada, yeah
Talk to ya
Keep that pace
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that left, right, left, leave 'em coming back for more
Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that left, right, left, leave 'em coming back for more
Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that

Won't you give me that step by step?
Won't you give me that step by step? Aye
Won't you give me that left, right, left?
Won't you give me that left, right, left? Aye
Won't you give me that step by step
Won't you give me that step by step? Aye
Won't you give me that left, right, left?
Won't you give me that left, right, left? Aye

God is a dancer 'cause I heard on the radio
And she always goes harder
She's keepin' you on your toes
Perfectly focused
Lost in the moment
Ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na

Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that left, right, left, leave 'em coming back for more
Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that left, right, left, leave 'em coming back for more
Just take it step by step when you come out on the floor
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that ooh-na-na-na-na-na
You got that

Won't you give me that step by step?
Won't you give me that step by step? Aye
