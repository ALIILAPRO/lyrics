		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pale beats the heart of this bystander
Shutting down, fog on lens
A drab moon to match my lowering standards
Suspended in deceptive light

Blind and reckless towards my own condition
Memorized the endless city
Woe to you, my suspicion
Always there to say goodbye but come again

Low I go, compromised
But never enough it seems
Low I go, go, go
Spiraling down
Never enough to pay
Don't have means to stay
Resilient

To see Saturn ascending
To trade my cold sharp nights
Oh, my beloved
To find you this evening
Oh, the prettiest eyes locked with mine

I have waited, waited, waited
Couldn't find another reason to live on
But you shake my blood like a raging sea
So I'm bound for the joy of sorrow
If you go there with me

Low I go, compromised
But never enough it seems
Low I go, go, go
Spiraling down
Never enough to pay
Don't have means to stay
Resilient

Oh, just one more thing
I hope it doesn't go unnoticed
That my body wants to sing
Oh, just one more thing
I hope it doesn't go unnoticed
That my body needs to sing with you
Call out

I have waited, waited, waited
Couldn't find another reason to live on
But you shake my blood like a raging sea
So I'm bound for the joy of sorrow
If you go there with me
