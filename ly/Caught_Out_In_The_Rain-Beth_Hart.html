		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm under your spell
Ain't nobody's business
I'm already there
It ain't nobody's business

Baby.. say..

Every time he walks out the door
I wonder if he's ever coming back
I can't help but love the taste of danger baby
And the how and the when and the roughness baby

I got caught out in the rain
If I die I don't care, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with this man
I got caught out, caught out
Caught out in the rain

I heard him crying in his sleep last night
No man wants to be told he been crying
When he wakes up I tell him it's gonna be alright
But I know that he knows that I'm just relyin
I heard he shot a man down in the street
And it torn his soul apart
Last night when he was making love to me
There was a, another woman in his house

I got caught out in the rain
If I die I don't care, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love with this man
I got caught out, caught out
Caught out in the rain
In the rain..

I got caught out in the rain
If I die I don't care, I don't care
I'm in love, I'm in love
I got caught out, caught out
Caught out in the rain
In the rain..

His name
His pain

Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody nobody nobody business

I won't kiss and tell
I got a spell
