		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck you mean? Bitch, I'm Baby Keem
Two-phone Baby Keem, fuck me if you want, ayy
Yes, I like you, girl, I don't want to front
Lay you in the bed, bae
Let's cuddle up, uh, yeah

I'm gon' fuck this nigga bitch 'cause
She got what I like, ooh
Morning, I chill with the plug, then
We get up at night, ooh
Diamonds do the Macarena, that's
Fourth of July, ooh
(Fourth of July)
She gon' play with the nana when she wake up
(Bae, wake up)
We gon' have a good day, get your nails done
What's your favorite color? Oh
That's mine too
Just to get that pussy, I'm gon' lie to you
I'm a young nigga, I'm irresponsible, ayy
Big money off in the desert, woah
Assist your ho, no pressure, woah
My bitch need no effort, woah
I heard your bitch wear Skechers, woah
Promised I won't tell it, woah
I got me a cheekbone fetish, woah
That made my smart bitch jealous, woah
Straight to the curb, she headed, woah
I just took that nigga pack
Won't give it back, ooh
I just took that nigga bitch, I gave it back
Ooh unapologetic, I run up the racks
(I run up the racks)
Offend you when I say it
I won't take it back
Ayy, seven figures, she like seven figures
Had to run up in her, had her in the sprinter
Now she all on Twitter
Claimin' I'm her nigga
She won't get a text back, I'm
On ten and she mad, ayy

Fuck you mean? Bitch, I'm Baby Keem
Two-phone Baby Keem, fuck me if you want, ayy
Yes, I like you, girl, I don't want to front
Lay you in the bed, bae
Let's cuddle up, uh, yeah
Fuck you mean? Bitch, I'm Baby Keem
Two-phone Baby Keem, fuck me if you want, ayy
Yes, I like you, girl, I don't want to front
Lay you in the bed, bae
Let's cuddle up, uh, yeah

Shoot through your car door
Shoutout to Cardo he's not done yet, nigga
Who the fuck told you we was done, nigga?
We levelin' up
Nigga, meet me in Transylvania, nigga
We goin' for the re-up
You already know what that means
