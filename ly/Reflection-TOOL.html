		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have come curiously close to the end, though
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole
Defeated, I concede and move closer
I may find comfort here
I may find peace within the emptiness
How pitiful

It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me (calling me)
It's calling me

And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping
The moon tells me a secret, a confidant
As full and bright as I am
This light is not my own and
A million light reflections pass over me

The source is bright and endless
She resuscitates the hopeless
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting

And as I pull my head out, I am without one doubt
Don't want to be down here soothing my narcissism
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late
I pray the light lifts me out

Before I pine away (pine away)
Before I pine away (pine away)
Before I pine away (pine away)
Before I pine away

So crucify the ego, before it's far too late
And leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical
And you will come to find that we are all one mind
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable
So let the light touch you
So let the words spill through
And let them pass right through
Bringing out our hope and reason

Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away (pine away)
Before we pine away
