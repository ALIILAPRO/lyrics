		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you say you know me, I know you know you think you different
I know you think you gettin' a lot of money, you don't got no women (woo)
I know you say you got them finest cars, you ain't got no engines (woo, woo)
You say you got this lifestyle but Lyfestyle ain't with it
I know you know, you think you know, you know better
I know you know, you think you know, you know better
I know you know, you think you know, you know better (ooh, ah)
I think by now, at least, you should know better

Don't talk 'bout me, yeah, I'm a fiend, I need
Everything, money, cars, rings, I need
I could help you see, I could help you breathe, I could
But I don't give no fucks 'bout nobody but me 'cause I should
And I could if I would (woo, woo)
In a pit with some snakes, and they bite (woo)
And I would if I could (woo, woo)
If I may, could I ask if I should? (Woo)
On this life, you could never get enough (woo, woo)
On a pill, you could never feel numb (woo)
Making money, it feels so good (woo, woo)
Doing things that you never should

I just went rogue, yeah, don't call up my phone
Don't text me 'bout shit, yeah, I don't wanna know
No, I don't wanna know how far you could go, how low you could go
I don't wanna hear if you live like me, then you lose control
I don't wanna hear if you in 2093, we all know
I don't wanna hear if you're near me, no, I won't hear your soul
Soul (let it go)

I know you say you know me, I know you know you think you different
I know you think you gettin' a lot of money, you don't got no women (woo)
I know you say you got them finest cars, you ain't got no engines
You say you got this lifestyle but Lyfestyle ain't with it
I know you know, you think you know, you know better
I know you know, you think you know, you know better
I know you know, you think you know, you know better (ooh, ah)
I think by now, at least, you should know better

And I could if I would (woo, woo)
In a pit with some snakes, and they bite (woo)
And I would if I could (woo, woo)
If I may, could I ask if I should? (Woo)
On this life, you could never get enough (woo, woo)
On a pill, you could never feel numb (woo)
Making money, it feels so good (woo, woo)
Doing things that you never should
