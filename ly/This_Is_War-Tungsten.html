		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hatred is all I see
Darkness, violence and agony
Keeps on going ´til the end of time
Madness consumes their mind
Soulless lives, a crimson kind
That slowly fades away

Save yourself from the enemy
Look upon the stars
Do you see what you want to see?
Or just a soul with scars?

Rise up and receive the light and you will be free
Rise up and restore your life before it’s too late

(Gaze up to the sky)
Time to make them shiver and cry
(Gaze up to the sky)
Let me hear you scream, This is war!

(Gaze up to the sky)
Time to make them shiver and cry
(Gaze up to the sky)
Let me hear you scream, This is war!

Everyone that I saw is gone
Lost to the void, a forgotten tomb
A prison so dark with no light in sight

Lift your head, look into my eyes
And listen to my words
Everyone that you know is dead
Prepare to save yourself

(Gaze up to the sky)
Time to make them shiver and cry
(Gaze up to the sky)
Let me hear you scream, This is war!

(Gaze up to the sky)
Time to make them shiver and cry
(Gaze up to the sky)
Let me hear you scream, This is war!
