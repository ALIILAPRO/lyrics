		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Closed doors brings open minds
(And I don't want to see you)

See you smile inside
(And I don't want to know you)

Faces and I've fallen
(And I don't want to hear you)

Wonder why I'm here now
In asylum don't you see?
In asylum don't you see?

Doors close and feelings flow
Through my mind I feel his

Pictures and I've fallen
Wonder why I'm here now

Curse your soul I don't wanna know you
(And I) curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
(And I) curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
(And I) curse your soul, I don't wanna know you
