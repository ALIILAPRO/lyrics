		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So it seems I was living a fucking lie
(Yeah)
Always thinking that everything was alright
(Yeah)
And all the things that you promised
All the things that I thought you knew
Kept me waiting until you ran out of time
(Yeah)
We were living an illusion, yeah
Surfing channels deep in my mind
Reliving the things you said to me
Made me feel like I was crazy
Take your medicine
Take your medicine
And all the things that you promised
And all the things that I thought you knew
Kept me waiting until you ran out of time
We were living an illusion
And all the things that you promised
And all the things that I thought you knew
We were living an illusion, yeah
