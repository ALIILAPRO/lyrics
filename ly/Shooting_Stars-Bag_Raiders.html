		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's late and I'm awake
Staring at the wall
Open up my window
Head falls out the door

No one else around
And a shimmer takes my eye
I lift my head
Blinded by the sky

Feel my weight in front
Following the sound
Moves away so fast
Falling to the ground

I know what is more to come
Jump back to my feet
Now I only see ahead of me
Chasing down the street (down the street, down the street, down the street)

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

I'm in love with a shooting star
But she moves so fast
When she falls then
I'll be waiting

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

I'm in love with a shooting star
But she moves so fast
When she falls then
I'll be waiting

Gave my love to a shooting star
But she moves so fast
That I can't keep up
I'm chasing

I'm in love with a shooting star
But she moves so fast
When she falls then
I'll be waiting
