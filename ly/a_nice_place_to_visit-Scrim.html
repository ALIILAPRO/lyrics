		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Yeah, had to go back out West
Yeah, fuck it
Let's get it (yeah)

Had to go back out West
Had to keep my bags light
Chemicals in my psyche (my psyche)
Why this shit feel so right? (So right)
She was up in my arms
Now she up on a flight
Said you will never leave my side (my side)
Said it was to the grave, yeah
I been tryna change my ways
Swear, I been tryna change my life (my life)
They don't know what it's like (they don't)
Laying awake all night, yeah
Runnin' away from love (From love)
Runnin' straight to my cup (my cup)
Time to head back out West (out West)
Maybe I'll be in touch

Yeah, covered my heart in gold
Put a smile on for the shows
When they ask me how I'm doin' never been happier I'm told (I guess)
They tryna bring me home, I just need one more high (let's go)
Promise it's not a lie when I say I'm done forever this time (yeah)
I got pain inside, but feel like why, why should I cry? (Fuck)
Thinkin' about my dead homies like why, why didn't I die?
How can I feel love when I can't even feel okay?
How can I feel anything when I, I can't feel my face?
Givin' away my heart, ayy, prolly ain't too much left (yeah)
But for you, I'd give my last piece, don't need none for myself
Drinkin' my way to Hell, tryna find my way to Heaven
So make this moment count, I could be gone at any second
Doc going through my wreckage, hopin' he find a message
But every time we talk, I'm only left with just more questions
Emotionally never present
Do I hide or grab my weapons?
Only peace I know is when I'm high or in the desert

Had to go back out West
Had to keep my bags light
Chemicals in my psyche (my psyche)
Why this shit feel so right? (So right)
She was up in my arms
Now she up on a flight
Said you will never leave my side (my side)
Said it was to the grave, yeah
I been tryna change my ways
Swear, I been tryna change my life (my life)
They don't know what it's like (they don't)
Laying awake all night, yeah
Runnin' away from love (From love)
Runnin' straight to my cup (my cup)
Time to head back out West (out West)
Maybe I'll be in touch
