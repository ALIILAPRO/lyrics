		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't ever have much
Shit changed
People all around me Disdain
Held me under where
Thought I'd never make it out
Till I came from the bottom like a shit stain
I ain't ever have much
Till it quit raining
People all around me
Big lame
Tryna fuck with my mental
If god sent you
why the hell you acting like the devil
I know the cycle
Fuck with my brain
Know the motors don't like you
I'm whipping my chains
Spitting em flames
Guess you should call me the ghost rider
Cause You trapped in a cage
You ain't no saint
Probably should pray
Cause no one escapes
There's hunger in games
When you mocking my name
And I'm off to the races
I'm shameless
When standing up for all the shit
I believe in
I'm angry
I might just go off in a minute
You beef and I'm hunting in season
Don't worry about taste
When I bring out the
Tens, Twentyâ€™s, Fifties, Hundreds
Got you running from me
I ain't worry bout nothing
Timbs, Louie, Gucci, Prada
I been spending reckless
Like I only wear designer
Still ain't treat me right
Cause I think I got a problem
I been moving them bricks
Into new places
Who's pacing Me
when I got on them blue laces
New face
And it ain't rearranging
Corrupt from the pressure society putting
Erupt had enough and he's dying
He couldn't
Grow up and mature
Cause he's tryna be cool
Throw up from the poison he's put himself through
But he thinks that it's worth it
Impressing these people
Who do not deserve him
Then when he falls off
They gone really dessert him
Who hurt him
It's always the closest
That treat you like burdens
So close it
They all tryna find they way in
They won't ever find you again
They say suicide is a sin
Damn
They pushing your ass to the edge
Then try to say that they're a friend
Damn that's a good joke
Try and tell me something
I don't really fucking know
You see I don't get it
If you got my back
Tell me why you ain't near it
I'm hearing you talk
But don't look in the mirror
Your appearance
It ain't what you think
You never been shot
You just taking a drink
Your life is a fantasy
Living a dream
And that's why I'm dragging you
Into the sink
When you under the water
I'm drowning the bottles
Got you looking up to me
Ain't no role model
I'm living free inside your brain
Need remodel
If you disrespect me
Take three and we on em
Grabbing the bat man
So we just be Robin
I keep on sonning you
Just like a condom
I don't be hating
Just do what I gotta
I guess I'm an asshole
With nothing but problems
Oh my I ain't got no invites
I get what I been like
I got loads of issues in my head
I'd Rather
stay away from them fights
Too much to worry bout
They tryna hurry me
I'm in a rush
And they talking bout urgency
I'm out here making a name for myself
I'm out here fixing the rain for myself
I'm out here taking the reigns
For my health
Then my family
Wealth
And my sanity
Planning on damaging
Anyone standing in front of me
Man enough
don't give a fuck
You ain't standing here
I'm on a whole another level
I'm better off lonely
Can't no one control me
Cause I'm slowly slipping
I'm losing my grip on reality
My only wish
No more being paid hourly
I let the numbers keep talking
I don't got too many options
If I did there ain't no way you could stop me
But I keep on working alone in my office
Better watch the rise
I'm optimised
My lif'es on the line
But I work through exhaustion
Can't take no more losses
Now I'm at the edge
And I'm made for these moments
That I can't let go of
Cause if I do
I just don't if I'll go on
And I think
I'm losing control of my focus
I'm making it through everything
I'm the chosen one
