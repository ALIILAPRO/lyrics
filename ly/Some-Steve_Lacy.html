		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby
I want some of your (love)
(Your love) your love (your love)
Baby (baby)
Can I have some of your (love?)
(Your love) your love

I know there's lots of love in your heart
But who you gonna give it to?
I'm sure there's lots of guys that you see
But, I swear they're not as cool as me
Girl, I can take you where you wanna go
If you wanna ride
We could watch a movie, hit the beach
Or just chill and get high
We can do whatever you wanna do

Baby
I want some of your (love)
(Your love) your love (your love)
Baby (baby)
Can I have some of your (love?)
(Your love) your love
