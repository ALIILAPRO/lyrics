		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me

I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now, that I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden
Offered to us by the world
And though I burn
How could I fall?
When I am lifted by every word you say to me

If anything could fall at all
It's the world that falls away from me

You have me floating like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered what was holding up the ground
I can see that all along, love
It was you all the way down
Leave it now, I am sky-bound
If you need to 
Darling, lean your weight to me

We'll float away
But if we fall, I only pray
Don't fall away from me

I do not have wings, love
I never will
Soaring over a world you are carrying
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own
Icarian carrion

If the wind turns
If I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
If I should fall on that day
I only pray
Don't fall away from me
