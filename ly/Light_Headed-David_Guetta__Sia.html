		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm ready for you, I'm ready for life
I trust that I will be alright
I'm ready for us, I'm ready tonight
Catch me, I'm your butterfly
The feeling is right
And it can't be wrong
It's what I've been searching for
I think you're the one, I think you're the one
The one that I've been dreaming of

You take my breath away
You got me feeling fate

I feel so high, you touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, you touch me tonight
I can't feel my heart
I feel so high, you touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed

In your embrace I close my eyes
I'll admit it feels divine
I feel the heat of your skin on mine
You and I are one tonight

You take my breath away
You got me feeling fate

I feel so high, you touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, you touch me tonight
Can't feel my heart
I feel so high, you touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed

I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
