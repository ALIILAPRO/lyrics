		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sorry

Last night we had a fight
Said some things I wish I'd never
The black marks from last night
The tears you cried still on my sweater
I step over the plate that you broke last night
I pick up your clothes that I threw outside
In the cold light of day we can leave it behind
Out of our minds

I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me
Bad enough to think about losing you
But even as I walk away
And I say I'm gonna stay
Only takes a moment or two
Cause you and I both know the truth
I'm crazy for you, whoa
I'm crazy for you

A thousand flowers
The power of saying sorry
So you don't have to call
To find out you know you got me
Even when you hurt me the way you have
Even though you know I can treat you bad
But we're drawn once again
Like a moth to a flame
Yeah it's like that

I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me
Bad enough to think about losing you
But even as I walk away
And I say I'm gonna stay
Only takes a moment or two
Cause you and I both know the truth
I'm crazy for you, whoa
I'm crazy for you

Yeah
Takes a little fire to keep things hot
Takes a little loss to know what you've got
Forgiving and forgetting takes a lot
But we know what we've got

I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me
Bad enough to think about losing you

I guess we get a little bit crazy
I guess we get a little bit cruel
But this is how crazy you make me
Bad enough to think about losing you
But even as I walk away
And I say I'm gonna stay
It only takes a moment or two
Cause you and I both know the truth
I'm crazy for you (yeah)
Whoa and I'm crazy for you
I'm crazy for you
