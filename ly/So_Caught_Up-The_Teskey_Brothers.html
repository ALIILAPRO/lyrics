		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you
I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you

Even if I tried to change it 
I can't
My memory's caught on you
Even if I try to think of something new 
I can't 
They're all of you

I'm denying 
The feeling of my mind
The feeling of change
There's only one thing I can be certain
It's true
I'm still caught on you

'Cause I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you
I'm so caught up, baby
I'm so caught up on you

Oh yeah
Oh yeah (so caught up on you)

Every time I try to shake it 
I can't
It's impossible to do
Even if I try to break it
No I can't
A broken memory of you
I've been to two hundred cities 
Not known where I am 
I've walked in the same direction 
Again and again
Oh, baby
You making me crazy

You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind, yeah

'Cause I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you
I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you 

I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you
I'm so caught up
I'm so caught up on you
