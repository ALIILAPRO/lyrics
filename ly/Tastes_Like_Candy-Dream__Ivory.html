		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I haven’t worked out in months
Don’t know if I’m bigger or all my clothes shrunk 
Does it make a difference? 
Haven’t touched shit on my to do list

I’m going out of my mind
I’m starting not to care but at times I do miss,
When I could figure it out
All the problems in the world were mine to fix 


Think it’s time for inspiration 
Deep down, I know I’m changing
But


I don’t know why I’ve been a fool to myself
I don’t mind it ‘cause it tastes like candy
It’s a rare sight, I’ve been away from the crowd
I don’t like it but it tastes like candy


Another invite to go outside
I can’t help but think I’m wasting time 
I think I’m fine
I’m not fine 

God I wanna change but I’ll have time on another day
It’s a dangerous cycle but I’m willing to pay 


Think it’s time for inspiration 
Deep down, I know I’m changing
But


Today I wanna go and lay in my bed
It’s too late to do all of the things that I planned 
God I’m lazy out my mind but maybe it’s not so bad
Wanna be like the other kids but I’ll just stay in my bed

Today I wanna go and lay in my bed
It’s too late to do all of the things that I planned 
God I’m lazy out my mind but maybe it’s not so bad
Wanna be like the other kids but I’ll just stay in my bed


I don’t know why I’ve been a fool to myself
I don’t mind it ‘cause it tastes like candy
It’s a rare sight, I’ve been away from the crowd
I don’t like it but it tastes like candy
