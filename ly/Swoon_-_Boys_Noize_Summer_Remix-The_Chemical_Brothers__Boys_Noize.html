There's nothing else
There's nothing else

Just remember to fall in love
There's nothing else
There's nothing else

Just remember to fall in love
There's nothing else

Just remember to fall in love
There's nothing else
There's nothing else

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
