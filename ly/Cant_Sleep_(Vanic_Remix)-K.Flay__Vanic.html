		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I've been slipping back, heading south, carsick on a Tuesday
Missing cash, blacking out, heartless in a few ways
Shit for luck, elbows shredded, I held things steady like too late
Please calm the fuck down, I'll do whatever you say
I get it, I get it, I'm living too hard and it's time that I stop it
But rising on up and then tumbling down well it's part of the process
Bar tabs on a hot night in a cold basement
You say I'm crazy but I feel amazing

My mother told me that the world has got it's plans
I wanna hold 'em 'til they burn right through my hands
Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing
And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change

I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake
'Cause I've been running, running, running all day
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me

I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake
'Cause I've been running, running, running all day
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 

Maybe I've been freaking out, moving quick, burning the wick at both ends
Screaming loud, stupid shit, scaring all of my old friends
Fell down on Bedford, hope that it's not broken
Safe to say I might have had too much of some of these potions
I love you so much, I'm staying here all night
Don't want to get up, I don't want to stop, I don't want to close my eyes
I'd rather not give a fuck and end up with some scars
The night's just long enough for me to build it all and let it fall apart

My mother told me that the world has got it's plans
I wanna hold 'em 'til they burn right through my hands
Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing
And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change

I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake
'Cause I've been running, running, running all day
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me

I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake
'Cause I've been running, running, running all day
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 

I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 
I can't sleep 

My mother told me that the world has got it's plans
I wanna hold 'em 'til they burn right through my hands
