		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby let me see you move it
Move your body to the music
Coz I love the way you're groovin 
We can dance until the morning comes around
Baby let me see you move it
Move your body to the music 
Coz I love the way you're groovin
We can dance until the morning comes around

Met you at the club while we were lil drunk
One look at your face and I knew you were the one
Tried to keep it cool with my crew on the down low
But one look at you and I knew it was over
Ooh, let me tell you what you mean,
Out of all the girls, you're the only one I see
Ya, pour another shot with me,
Wanna make it last, you're the woman of my dreams
Ooh, not gonna lie I'm little wasted
Hands around your waist, and I'm tasting
Lips so sugar sweet they be glistening
Whisper in my ear girl I'm listening
Not gonna lie I'm little faded
Hands around your hips, I been waiting
For so damn long, I been chasing 

Baby let me see you move it
Move your body to the music
Coz I love the way you're groovin 
We can dance until the morning comes around
Baby let me see you move it
Move your body to the music 
Coz I love the way you're groovin
We can dance until the morning comes around

Until the morning comes around
Can we pretend that we'll be here forever, ooh
Tonight it's just me and you
Now it's just me and you
Come put your body on me
Love how you're moving so sensually
Come put your body on me


Baby let me see you move it
Move your body to the music
Coz I love the way you're groovin 
We can dance until the morning comes around
Baby let me see you move it
Move your body to the music 
Coz I love the way you're groovin
We can dance until the morning comes around
