		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walk this Earth all by myself
I'm doing drugs but they don't help
My voice is nothing when I'm screaming out for help
I stretch my hand but my grip just gives out

Nobody gives a fuck about me
That's what I think to myself
When I'm alone in the city
I walk around the mall
But there's nobody with me
What do I say when there's nobody listening?

I walk this Earth all by myself
I'm doing drugs but they don't help
My voice is nothing when I'm screaming out for help
I stretch my hand but my grip just gives out

I walk this Earth all by myself
I'm doing drugs but they don't help
My voice is nothing when I'm screaming out for help
I stretch my hand but my grip just gives out
