		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Zandshee
You're all gonna die
Get 'em

This has happened too many times
I survived but I am dead inside
But I cant cry thats what they like
So I just carry my knife and wait

Never let them see me cry
I'll spit the pain back in their eyes
I'll carve my name out with my knife
They'll never know what it feels like

Wound me once, I'll end you twice
You're all b-bark and no b-bite
No sucky? Feel unlucky?
Zandshee pull up in your dream tonight!
Banshee go CHOP and Z go SLICE
Decapitatey! Very nice
If this dude thinks he's suffering then he should see the other guy!
He thought he could deface me just to bust a nut
So I made that motherfucker face me when I spilled his guts
"That's messed up!"
Messed up?
Oh, you wanna see messed up?
Well step up cunt
'Cos we snuffin' alla these heads up
No dress up

You know who are
Fuck you all
Would you still feel powerful if I pulled up and slit your throats
Ya

You know what you are, fucking choke
Will you still feel macho when
I turn your skin into a coat?

Wrap your car around a tree tonight
If I see you on the streets again ill take your fuckin life
Ya

Got no pulse at all, that's just right
If you dare to show your face again
Prepare to pay the price
