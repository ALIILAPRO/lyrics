		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay on me, lay on me
Lay on me, lay on me (with your hand)

One look at your eyes and I cave in
One taste of the life now I crave it

It's not too late to die for a reason
Fall down on the sword you were swinging

I wanted to dress a blade up in red with both our of necks
But I wasn't able, and I wasn't stable
I guess
But nevertheless I'm fucking depressed
I hide it with sex, and drink till it's fatal
It's so fucking painful
It's a mess

So give me something beautiful
So give me something else
I need another miracle
I really need some help, I need a miracle

Who's left when we're all for the taking?
No lives left to bet on obeying
What are we calling it?
And what does it cost?
What are we calling it?
And what does it cost?
In over my head when you found me
I love you to death, but I'm drowning
What are we calling it?
And what does it cost?
What are we calling it?
And what does it cost?

So give me something beautiful
So give me something else
I need another miracle
I need some fucking help (I need a miracle)

You're just the company you keep
And trouble tends to follow me
I didn't care, now I'm fucking scared
And if you're not you're gonna be

So give me something beautiful
So give me something else
I need a fucking miracle
I need some fucking help

So give me something beautiful
So give me something else
I need another miracle
I need some fucking help (I need a miracle, need a miracle)

I wanted to dress a blade up in red with both our of necks
But I wasn't able, and I wasn't stable
I guess
But nevertheless I'm fucking depressed
I hide it with sex, and drink till it's fatal
It's so fucking painful
It's a mess

I need a miracle
