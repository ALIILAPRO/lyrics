		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
This is Tha Carter mothafucka, yeah
And in my building I must keep it real

And man I miss the times
We would shine, you would keep on your side
You would teach me how to ride
And you would teach me how to pride
Then we'd get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position
And that's when you changed position, shit
I never changed and I miss ya, and it's strange
But I never forget ya
Though that ain't you with them bitches homie
And I know that ain't you with that dissin' on me
that's why I never replied and never will, just let 'em live phony
If you ever died, I swear to God, I got yo kids homie
What's mine is theirs, I gotta give homie, and yeah
We still a army in this bitch, homie
Yeah Cash Money still the shit homie, shit, homie
What's really real is you feelin' me nigga
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word to giggity nigga
And I ain't got time to speak the history
I miss you and I know you missin' me, Gizzle, but

Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club hoppin'
Many nights we were blowin' trees, many nights we were hustling
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you to the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club hoppin'
Many nights we were blowin' trees, many nights we were hustling
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you to the very end, for only you I'll sin again

And I remember when you came to the clique
I had already made my name in the clique
But you got famous and shit
I got my soldier rag and dangled my shit
I was honored just to hang with you, shit
And I banged to the boogie-bang-bang with your clique
And I ain't even from the 3, my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post with the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin' for a nigga to jump, see I was patient
But was ready to dump, 'cause you my brother, chump
Real G's never buckle up
But every family ain't filled with gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back
Or turn you down, even if you turned around, muthafucka
But history is history
I miss you and I know you missin' me, Juvie, but

Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club hoppin'
Many nights we were blowin' trees, many nights we were hustling
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you to the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club hoppin'
Many nights we were blowin' trees, many nights we were hustling
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you to the very end, for only you I'll sin again

You was my nigga, my nerve, my joy, my hurt
My main mothafuckin' man Turk (oh)
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left?
And we stayed out of trouble 'cause we stayed to our self
'Member Slim and B would leave and hand the keys over?
Tell us not to go Uptown and we went straight to the Nolia
While I watched you reunite with your soldiers
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the Stunna
Yeah, those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I eye my brother
Yeah, nigga, Semaj my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The niggas you left behind is my brothers

Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club hoppin'
Many nights we were blowin' trees, many nights we were hustling
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you to the very end, for only you I'll sin again
Man, I miss my dawgs, many nights club hoppin'
Many nights we were blowin' trees, many nights we were hustling
Man I miss my dawgs, me and you through thick and thin
Me and you to the very end, for only you I'll sin again
