		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm living a lie
And it's not the best thing for me
But anyone and everyone is gonna hear another story
I'm building a house
Of murderous intention
To keep it all from coming down
I've gotta focus my attention
Cause confidence is key
When violating trust
I'm making sure that I believe
I'm doing what I must
Which is attempting to kill
The little boy inside
But as hard as I try
The child will not die

Now I'm burning alive, just like you
Now I'm burning alive, just like you

I'm irrelevant
And I'm living down in the shit
I follow these pigs around
But I never get used to it
'Cause they keep building and building
Their feculent franchise
I wish I could see this filth
Through someone else's eyes
Cause ignorance was bliss
But now I must adjust
These animals, they operate
On jealousy and lust
I'm taking back what was lost
And I will not be denied
I'm crawling my way to the surface outside

Now I'm burning alive, just like you
Now I'm burning alive, just like you

Just like you
Just like you
Just like you

Now I'm burning alive, just like you
Now I'm burning alive, just like you

Now I'm burning alive, just like you (just like you)
Now I'm burning alive, just like you (just like you)

Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
