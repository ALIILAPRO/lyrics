Juice
(Juice)
Juice

There you go
Shakin' and it's doin' somethin' to me
Doin' somethin' to me (ohh oh to me)
Play my role, baby, when you walk up to me
Walk up to me (ohh oh, to me)
Give her this liquor, this hit of this blunt
Take it from me as much as you want (ay)
Get this money, I'll give it to you right now, baby
Right now, baby, go 'head

You got the juice right now (oh)
You got the juice right now (ohh oh-oh)
Pull up on you right now (oh)
I'ma pull up on you right now (ohh oh-oh)
Girl, you got the moves right now (now)
Baby, got the moves right now (ohh oh-oh)
Oh, no, no, you takin' me up, down
You wakin' me up now
Come give it to me (hol' up)

She don't usually do these things for anybody
She know how to play those games, yeah, with her body
You better, uh-uh, you better
You better, uh-uh, you better
You better, uh-uh, you better
Better give me that juice (juice)

How much, girl? I'll put it up
Movin' slow, I got 16 in my cup (oh, ay)
Ha, know you wanna sip it
Put this shit on your lips (haha)
Yup, that'll do it for me (for me)
One more is all you need (you need, ha)
I know you wanna freak somebody (ha)
So gon' do it to me (me, oh)
Why you makin' it hard for them girls to compete?
I know you know this is where I wanna be (ow!)
So put it right there, girl, become a part of me (huh, oh)
And girl, give me something I can screech, ooh yeah

You got the juice right now (oh)
You got the juice right now (ohh oh-oh)
Pull up on you right now (oh)
I'ma pull up on you right now (ohh oh-oh)
Girl, you got the moves right now (now)
Baby, got the moves right now (ohh oh-oh)
Oh, no, no, you takin' me up, down
You wakin' me up now
Come give it to me (give it to me)

Oh no no 
(Give it to me) 
(Hol' up)

Can you hear me, girl? Give me all that (hey)
Give me some, give me some more (hey)
Don't be stingy, girl, you know what I came for (hey)
Put the kitty down low, don't stop (ow!)
I mash it up one time, rude boy, bloodclaat (hey)
That pum pum gonna take my heart
You make it easy to forget because you're playin' with my heart

She don't usually do these things for anybody
She know how to play those games with her body
She don't even know my name
And she know that I feel the same, oh ohh

You got the juice right now (oh)
You got the juice right now (woo! Ohh oh-oh)
Pull up on you right now (pull up on you)
I'ma pull up on you right now (pull up on you, ohh oh-oh)
Girl, you got the moves right now
(You got the moves, you shakin' your body right now)
Baby, got the moves right now (ohh oh-oh)
Oh, no, no, you takin' me up, down
You wakin' me up now
Come give it to me (ohh ooh ooh)

Ha, no, she don't, don't
Play those games, ohh yeah
You better, uh-uh, you better (ooh)
You better, uh-uh, you better (ooh)
You better, uh-uh, you better (ooh, ooh)
Better give me that juice (juice)
