		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too much poppin' in my life baby, I just really need some time, baby
Come and check up on my line baby, out of time baby, ah no
Fell in love with the lifestyle, black shades, night clout
She want to fuck but she don't love me
Lifestyle, lifestyle
Strapped up but I'm iced down, all white crib with the black towel
She don't want to love me
Lifestyle, lifestyle

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
Ah, ah, never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (never really loved me)
It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle

Lil' mama fell in love with the lifestyle
Four bad bitches on a white couch
Last night, she tried to pipe down
Told her hol' up, let me put the pipe down
Touchdown, I ain't even ate yet
Serve it on a platter in a red dress
Chinchilla, turn that bitch to Mona Lisa
All she want to do is fuck and hit the beach
Sand from her toes out the Lambo
Hit 30k golds for your sandals
Thirty round clip for the wrong day
Drivin' in the whip, up the wrong way

Extra luv, extra luv, extra luv
Extra luv
Lifestyle, lifestyle

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (never really loved me)
Ah, ah, never really loved me (never really loved me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (You ain't never loved me)
It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle (Hol' up, hol' up)

It's back-back when I come through (back up)
Come through the back when I come through (back up)
Got the bag, that's a fact when I come through
It go brrat when I come through
Mansion in the hills and my neighbors is so nosy
Only Maybach in Bompton so I'm sliding with the forty
Gotta keep it on me cause I iced out the Rollie
My diamonds on disco and they dancin', hokie pokie
Put my left wrist in, you see that bitch blinged out
Put my right wrist in, you see that bitch blinged out
Put 'em both together, that's two hundred on me, ouch
(That's what my lifestyle about)
No you ain't never loved me (never), now you want to fuck me (want to fuck me)
Gotta deal with all this fake shit
Damn I'm so lucky, come here and fuck me girl, I need

Extra luv, extra luv, extra luv
Extra luv
Lifestyle, lifestyle (four hunnid)
Extra luv, extra luv, extra luv
Extra luv (hol' up)
Lifestyle, lifestyle (It's YG, four hunnid)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (never really loved me)
Ah, ah, never really loved me (never really loved me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (never really loved me)
It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle

Too much poppin' in my life baby, I just really need some time baby
Come and check up on my line baby, all the time baby, ah no
Too much drugs in my life baby, I just really need some time baby
Runnin' from ya, out of time baby, come and find me baby, ah no

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (never really loved me)
Ah, ah, never really loved me (never really loved me)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Never really loved me (never really loved me)
It's my lifestyle, it's my lifestyle
