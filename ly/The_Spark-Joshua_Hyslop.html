		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on
It's too late tonight
I've been kicking at the wall
You've been looking for a fight

Come on
Hold fast again
Wipe the dust from your eyes
'Cause you're mean and steady, yeah

Honey, I don't know
If we'll get through the night
'Cause we're barely holding on
And we're losing the light

Honey, all I know
All that keeps me alive
Is the hint of the spark
To set our hearts on fire

So come on
We could turn this around
You cannot give up
When you get knocked down

Come on then
Give me your hands
I will lift you back up
Oh and hold fast again

But honey, I don't know
If we'll get through the night
'Cause we're barely holding on
And we're losing the light

Honey, all I know
All that keeps me alive
Is the hint of the spark
To set our hearts on fire

Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh

So come on
Oh, I know you are tired
The hint of the spark
That set our hearts on fire
