		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Three hundred and seventy million, back to Francois' client
At Three hundred and seventy million dollars, ladies and gentlemen
Four hundred million
Four hundred million is the bid
Here in the sale room at four hundred million with Alex Rotter
The bid is here at four hundred million dollars
For the Salvatore Mundi at four hundred million
Francois is out, are you sure, Francois?
At four hundred million then, thank you for your bidding here and on the telephone to my left
And of course here, Lo√Øc and Francois, it is with Alex Rotter
At four hundred million Leonardo, Salvatore Mundi
Selling here at Christie's, four hundred million dollars is the bid
And the piece is sold
