		  Bite your own teeth
Bite your own teeth
Don't cry, just bite your own
Bite your own teeth
Bite your own teeth
Don't cry, just bite your own

Don't cry, keep on tryin'
Don't cry, keep on tryna bite
Don't cry, keep on tryin'
Don't cry, keep on
Tryna
Bite

Bite your own teeth
Bite your own teeth
Don't ever, ever cry
Just bite your own
Bite your own teeth
Bite your own teeth
Don't ever, ever cry
Just bite your own

Bite your own teeth
Bite your own teeth
Don't cry
Just bite your own
Bite your own teeth
Bite your own teeth
Don't cry
Just bite your own

Don't cry, keep on tryin'
Don't cry, keep on tryna bite
Don't cry, keep on tryin'
Don't cry, keep on
Tryna

Creeps are creepin'
Teeth are sinkin'
Into my teeth

Go
