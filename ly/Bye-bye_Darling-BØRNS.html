		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goodbye to the paperback age
I'll miss your touch
To flip you, crease you, lay underneath you, fall asleep to
Bye-bye darling I'll miss you so much

Goodbye to the telephone age
I'll miss your voice
To listen to, laugh to, talk in the bath to
Bye-bye darling we don't have a choice

We had a run good run darling don't you cry
I know in the end it's gonna be just fine
Bye-bye darling

Goodbye to the accident age
I'll miss the chance
To meet you on the street, sweep you off your feet, you know
Bye-bye darling, goodbye in advance

We had a run good run darling now don't you cry
I know in the end it's gonna be just fine
In the end it all feels like a dream
Someday we'll find out what it means
Bye-bye darling

Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

And every time I think of you I'm so glad
What we had they'll never know
Every summer night we stayed up late
Blowing smoke into figure eights
