		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So goddamn easy to write this
You make it spill on the page
So drunk on yourself, self-righteous
A laughing stock of your own fucking stage

Oh but I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfuckin' invitation
The only one you could ever need
This is a motherfuckin' invitation
You try me

Just one time you got a reason
Heard you had nothing to lose
A blind preacher for the pin-eyed congregation
It must be easy to lose

Oh but I ain't one to call names
Or throw stones in a house of glass
You try me

This is a motherfuckin' invitation
The only one you could ever need
This a motherfuckin' invitation
You try me

You can tell the same lie a thousand times
But it never gets any more true
So close your eyes once more and once more believe
That they all still believe in you

Just one time
This is a motherfuckin' imitation
The only one you could ever need
This a motherfuckin' invitation
Just one time

This is a motherfuckin' invitation
Ya' try me

Just one time (ya' try me)
Just one time (ya' try me)
Ya' try me
