		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She want it I can tell she want it
Want me to push up on it
Fore she know when I'm all on it
We get the party going liquor flowing this is fire
50 and Jeremih number one there's nothing higher
(Won't you go and)
Get it get it (I see you baby)
Work it work it
(Won't you, just put it down)
Get it get it
Work it work it
Break it break it down

OK she headed to the dance floor
And she slowly start to poppin' it
Something like my wrist
'Cause everybody got to watching it
Girl you go that secret treasure
I'm gon put that lock on it
Don't care what they say
I would be stupid to be not on it
Heard you go that sticky
Lets go and take nine shots
We'll just call it fifty
And I'm gon lick it lick it lick it
Till her hicky have her Rev running
Keep you running til you wit me
(Bang bang bang bang)
Oh you look so sweet
What you work in Paris
Look at your physique
Girl you are a beauty well I am a beast
They must have been trippin' to let me off the leash

I love the way you grind that booty on me
Shawty you a dime why you looking lonely
We'll buy another round and it's all on me
As long as I'm around put it down on me
Just put it down on me
Put it down on me
Down down on me
Put it down on me
Don't throw it off the mound
Show me how its gon' be
Girl all I really want is you down on me
Put it down on me

Systems thumping party jumping
Shawty she's a perfect ten
She rock her hips than roll her hips
Than drop it down like it's nothing
She shaped just like an hour glass
She see how fast an hour passed
Time flies when I'm on that ass
But I won't put our shit on blast
Work it like a pro pro pro
Sit and watch it go go go
Do her thing all on the floor
She bounce it fast and shake it slow
So sexual incredible
She beautiful she edible
I got her I won't let her go
I ain't seen nothing better yo
Look at how she twerk it
The way she work it
Make me wanna hit it hit it
Heaven when I'm in it in it
If I do not fit, I'm gonna make it
Girl you can take it
Don't stop get it get it

I love the way you grind that booty on me
Shawty you a dime why you looking lonely
We'll buy another round and it's all on me
As long as I'm around put it down on me
Just put it down on me
Put it down on me
Down down on me
Put it down on me
Don't throw it off the mound
Show me how its gon' be
Girl all I really want is you down on me
Put it down on me

Say you independent
Get it from your momma
Tell me if you with it
Do you really wanna (wanna)
Baby when you see me
You know I be on it
Can you keep it up
Put it all up on me

Say you independent
Get it from your momma
Tell me if you with it
Do you really wanna (wanna)
Baby when you see me
You know I be on it
Can you keep it up
Put it all up on me

Down with that booty on me
Shawty you a dime why you looking lonely
Oh baby we can go low, low, low yeah

I love the way you grind that booty on me
Shawty you a dime why you looking lonely
We'll buy another round and it's all on me
As long as I'm around put it down on me
Just put it down on me
Put it down on me
Down down on me
Put it down on me
Don't throw it off the mound
Show me how its gon' be
Girl all I really want is you down on me
Put it down on me
