		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please you must excuse me
I cannot help but think I've
Overstayed my welcome
Please she said
It's hardly a bother
The company's quite nice on
Crimson nights like these
Then he exits
To the street below
Knowing he has no intention to return
Well I think that I've gotta go and I don't know why
But I need you to promise that you won't cry
Cuz you'll be fine, and so will I
So just let the thought of me die
And please let me know
Let those old memories go
Feed me to the crows
Please
Understand that I
Will find a brand new life
My golden second try
Suddenly, in the mirrors of the windows that night
He found the man before him had died
Well I think that I've gotta go and I don't know why
But I need you to promise that you won't cry
Cause you'll be fine and so will I
So just let me out of your mind
In the morning you'll learn I disappeared off into the night so quietly
That your love for me will vanish too
