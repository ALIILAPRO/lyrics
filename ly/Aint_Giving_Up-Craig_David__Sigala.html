		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're sober, laugh
Sometimes you gotta take a chance to break through
And when the world is not enough
That's what gives you everything or breaks you

Feeling empty, feeling used
It's like we're running off fumes
A little broken, confused
But one thing I know for sure

Ain't giving up on you, ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you, ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh, ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh, ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh, ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't giving up on you

When the going gets tough
Just remember it's me and you for life
And when the world is not enough
Baby, are we worth the fight?

Feeling empty, feeling used
It's like we're running off fumes
A little broken, confused
But one thing I know for sure

Ain't giving up on you, ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you, ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh, ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh, ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh, ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you
Oh, oh, oh
Ain't giving up on you
