		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's really over, I can't believe that I died
I do not exist, I am no longer alive
The world turn to stone, right before my eyes
And now i'm a memory inside of everyone's mind

I crossed the other side, I am on the other side
Will I meet god? was I a matter of time?
Was my whole life was a facade? where is my mom?
I can't believe that I died, I can't believe died

Wait damn, I can't even say goodbye to my daughter 
I wanna hold her right now and I wanna tell her I love her
I would give everything, I mean every single thing 
If it means I could hug her

Thats a moment I won't get, I'm feeling so much regret
Life came and went 
I wish I would of appreciated every moment we spent
Nothing is left, damn

My life crashed and burned
Gone forever, I'll never return
I can't imagine the agony my mom is feeling
I know that she is gunna hurt
So will my dad, I know he's gon' break
Damn I know he's gon' break
Not telling both of my you how much I love you 
Was probably my biggest mistake

If I could go back in time, I would of did everything different
I would appreciate life, and would of actually lived it
I'd take my anger inside and give my enemies forgiveness
The anger I held inside, made my life feel like a prison

I would of stayed off my phone, I wasted all of my time scrolling
Living my life thru a screen, when I should of lived in the moment
Now I'm feeling this regret and honesty I can't control it 
Cuz I know that motherfucking life is over and it kills me to know it

And I'm hurt, yo all of this hurts
My daughter needs me, But I'm not around
I lie in the dirt, They always say, don't take life for granted
But It's to late, I no longer have it
And yeah we can pray 
But there's no seconds chances 

But I'm praying, sorry i'm outta line
But I need my life! I'm begging you please 
She gunna be traumatized
The moment she walks up and she sees
A coffin, where her father lies 
And She's going to scream and she's gunna weep
And I don't wanna see her cry 

I can't believe that I died 
I reach the end, damn, I never imagined this
The world I'm in, stopped, it really went stringent 
I'm so perplexed, shocked, don't know handle it
Knowing, knowing that I wont get a chance again 
Damn 

Standing on the other side, I'm by myself
Missing you, realizing that my tears won't help 
Always depressed, who saw the best in me
Now that I'm gone, I rest in peace
My life pasted before my eyes
I'm wishing for one last time
I Never saw my demise 
I can't believe I died
