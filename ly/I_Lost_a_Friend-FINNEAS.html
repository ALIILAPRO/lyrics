		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost a friend
Like keys in a sofa
Like a wallet in the back seat
Like ice in the summer heat
I lost a friend
Like sleep on a red-eye
Like money on a bad bet
Like time worryin' about
Every bad thing that hasn't happened yet

I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I'll be lying awake
Countin' all the mistakes I've made
Replayin' fights
I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I lost a friend, I lost a friend

I lost my mind
And nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad"
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about him
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?
Never had

I'm on the mend
Like I'm wearin' a neck brace
Like I'm sleepin' at my own place
Like I'm pullin' all the stitches out of my own face
I'm on the mend
Like I'm icing a new sprain
Like I'm walkin' on a new cane
Like it's been a couple days
Since I slipped and said somethin' sorta like your name

I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I'll be lying awake
Countin' all the mistakes I've made
Replayin' fights
I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I'm on the mend, but I lost a friend

I lost my mind
And nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad"
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about him
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?

I'd apologize
If I thought it might make a difference
Or make you listen
I'd apologize
If it was black and white, but life is different
Just try to listen to me now

I know I'll be alright
But I'm not tonight
I lost a friend, I lost a friend

I lost my mind
And nobody believes me
Say, "I know that he don't need me
'Cause he made a little too much money to be twenty and sad"
And I'll be fine without him
But all I do is write about him
How the hell did I lose a friend I never had?
Never had
