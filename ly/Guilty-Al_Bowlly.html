		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Though you've decided that our love is wrong
And think that we should part
It seems as though I have loved you so long
You'll always be in my heart

Is it a sin
Is it a crime
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you

Maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you
Dreaming the lonely night through
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of dreaming of you

What can I do
What can I say
After I've taken the blame?
You say we're through
You'll go your way
But I'll always feel just the same

Maybe I'm right
Maybe I'm wrong
Loving you dear like I do
If it's a crime then I'm guilty
Guilty of loving you
