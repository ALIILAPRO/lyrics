		  (I, oh, don't need to say a word)

I just wanted you
To know that you are really special
By the way, the way, the way

I just wanted you
To know that you are really special
By the way, I just wanted you
I just wanted you

I just wanted you
To know that you are really special
By the way, the way, the way

I just wanted you
To know that you are really special
By the way, I just wanted you
I just wanted (I just wanted you)
