		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Autumn in New York, why does it seem so inviting?
Autumn in New York, it spells the thrill of first-nighting
Glittering crowds and shimmering clouds in canyons of steel
They're making me feel I'm home

It's autumn in New York that brings the promise of new love 
Autumn in New York is often mingled with pain
Dreamers with empty hands may sigh for exotic lands
It's autumn in New York
It's good to live it again

Autumn in New York, the gleaming rooftops at sundown
Autumn in New York, it lifts you up when you're let down
Jaded rou√©s and gay divorces who lunch at the Ritz 
Will tell you that it's devine

It's autumn in New York transforms the slums into Mayfair
Autumn in New York, you'll need no castle in Spain
Lovers that bless the dark
On benches in Central Park
Greet autumn in New York
It's good to live it again
