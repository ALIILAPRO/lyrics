		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Disappointment takes us by surprise
Even though by now I think we should have realized
Everyone is dumb (dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)

(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
La la la la la la la
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
Everyone is dumb
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
La la la la la la la
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
Everyone is

There must be something in the corn flakes
Making it hard for us to think straight
I just wanna go from here
Close my eyes and disappear (disappear)
I just wanna be the comic relief
Making jokes, not taking any responsibilities (knock knock)
It's waking up inside of the dream (who's there?)
You don't know what to believe (woo)

But maybe that's why

Disappointment takes us by surprise
Even though by now I think we should have realized
Everyone is dumb (dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)

(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
La la la la la la la
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
Everyone is dumb
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
La la la la la la la
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
Everyone is dumb
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
La la la la la la la
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
(Everyone is) everyone is dumb
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
La la la la la la la
(Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb)
(Everyone is) everyone is
