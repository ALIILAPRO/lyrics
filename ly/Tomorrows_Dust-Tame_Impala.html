		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no use trying to relate
To that older soul
And no use trying to debate
That they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love
When you're on your own
And no use crying outside
If nobody's home

There's no use flying to the moon
If they won't believe
So why do I go wrong
On repeat?

I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be learnin' fast
And the day will come, and then it will pass

I taught you wrong
When I say I won't
And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust

There's no use trying to relate
To that older soul
And no use biding your time
If the bell has tolled

I was blinded by a memory
Like it's someone else, like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be movin' fast
And the day will come, and then it will pass

Sympathy for the fauna
Fragile life in the sauna
In the sea getting warmer
Endlessly 'round the corner

And though I try, I do the same as though I must
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
