		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I pulled in to Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past dead
I just need some place where I can lay my head
"Hey mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"
He just grinned and shook my hand, ``No'' was all he said

Take a load off, Fanny
Take a load for free
Take a load off, Fanny
And you put the load right on me

I picked up my bag, I went looking for a place to hide
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walking side by side
I said ``Hey Carmen, come on, let's go downtown''
She said ``I gotta go but my friend can stick around''

Go down Miss Moses, there's nothing you can say
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on the judgement day
``Well, Luke my friend, what about young Anna-Lee?''
He said ``Do me a favour son, won't you stay and keep Anna-Lee company?''

Crazy Chester followed me and he caught me in the fog
He said ``I will fix your rat if you'll take Jack my dog''
I said ``Wait a minute Chester, you know I'm a peaceful man''
He said ``That's okay boy, won't you feed him when you can?''

Catch a cannonball now to take me down the line
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone
