		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it's a god-given fact
(That you can't go back)
It's a god-given law that
You're gonna lose your maw
It's a god-given fact you gotta
Buy'em by the sack

It's a god-given law that
You're gonna get small
May be just another rap but
You're running out of sap
Well you better take the rap
Dying under daddy's cap

It's at the top of the list
That you can't get pissed
It's rule number one living right isn't fun
Time-tested and true you
Gotta pooty poo-poo
