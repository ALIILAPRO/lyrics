		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I hit it in the morning
Ooh, in the bed, in the shower
Just tell me where you want it
Hmm, go slow, make me numb one time
When the sun rise, I won't let you down
Pick you up, I won't lay you down
Scream my name when I hit it in the morning

Wake up with you next to me
I love it when you tell me things, dirty things
Climb on top of me
Make you moan, make you sing, make you cum, come sun rise
Shorty, let me lay you down
Shorty, let me lay you down, oh
Yeah, you know my favorite sound
My name coming out your mouth, no-oh

Good morning, would you like to
Get some moaning, would you like to
Wake up, wake up
Baby, won't you scream my name

When I hit it in the morning
Ooh, in the bed, in the shower
Just tell me where you want it
Hmm, go slow, make me numb one time
When the sun rise, I won't let you down
Take you up, I won't lay you down
Scream my name when I hit it in the morning

(When I hit it in the morning)

Girl, you're my Angela, can I be your umbrella?
Finna killer, miss ya dance, oh
Girl, you be my formula, stand near my antenna
Whine slow, baby, oh
She give me loving and peace of mind
Only your love fi to change my life
This one I love wey dey make me high, high
Morning, early in de morning
You dey murder girl, you dey murder
You the one that I'm wanting
Kissing and touching
Come here, cah jam ya bumba

When I hit it in the morning
Ooh, in the bed, in the shower
Just tell me where you want it
Hmm, go slow, make me numb one time
When the sun rise, I won't let you down
Take you up, I won't lay you down
Scream my name when I hit it in the morning

(When I hit it in the morning)
