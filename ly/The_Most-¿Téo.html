		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outta my mind, out on the road
Carry a load, keep on the low
Shout out my bro, he do the most
Carry it close, not for the trolls
I hope you're not one of those

My gang always running a tri-logy
Body double when I'm drained in my energy
Six legs in the bed and they killing me
Seven figures by the time I was seventeen
How is that?
That's cause I'm kickin' it how you livin'
Run up the city like I'm the villain
I be up on the roof, I don't know a ceiling

Diamond dancing like a rock-a-fella
Teo chain swinging heavy metal
Need a kini and I'm bout to get her
That's for the record like acapella
Latin lover when I really wanna
High o's on me all summer
Fuck with my hoodie on if you wanna
I let her keep it like Thug and Gunna

Different day I feel like Billy Ray
I wanna hit the hey but hey I'm on the come up
Who the fuck will tell you how you want it
I made the money but had it frontin'
Pick up the chick and I had a run in
Keep it a hundred went out in public
Mamacita want me bad as bunny
Speaking the lingo but got it from me
Speaking the lingo but got it fro-

Outta my mind, out on the road
Carry a load, keep on the low
Shout out my bro's, they do the most (they do the most)
Carry it close, not for the trolls
I hope you're not one of those
