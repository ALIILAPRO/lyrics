		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a barbie girl
In a barbie world
Gettin' ratchet
It's fantastic
You could be my Ken
If you wanna spend
Gimme cash now
Making Barbie racks now
I'm a barbie girl
In a barbie world
Gettin' ratchet
It's fantastic
You could be my Ken
If you wanna spend
Gimme cash now
Making Barbie racks now
Groupies hit me on the gram
Cause they all want my malibooty
Water on my wrist
I'm out here looking like a buoy, oohy
Catch me on my pink yacht
That's what I call baewatch, won't stop
I wake up and get paid
It's a brand that you can't afford
I'm a barbie girl
In a barbie world
Gettin' ratchet
It's fantastic
You could be my Ken
If you wanna spend
Gimme cash now
Making Barbie racks now
Come on barbie let's go party
Buss it down, barbie wow
Come on barbie let's go party
Come on barbie let's go party
Buss it down barbie
Come on barbie let's go party
Kenny
I'm the main event and you just one of my accessories
Louis, Gucci, Fendi big bags like I'm hefty
Test me
Cut you off like testes
Me and all my besties, yes please
I wake up and get paid
It's a brand that you can't afford
I'm a barbie girl
In a barbie world
Gettin' ratchet
It's fantastic
You could be my Ken
If you wanna spend
Gimme cash now
Making Barbie racks now
Come on barbie let's go party
Buss it down, barbie wow
Come on barbie let's go party
Come on barbie let's go party
Buss it down barbie
Come on barbie let's go party
