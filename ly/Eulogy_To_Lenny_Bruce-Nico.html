		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've lost a friend
And I don't know why
But never again
Will we get together to die.
And why after every last shot
Was there always another ?
Why after all you hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother ?

And Honey Harlow
The singer burlesque queen
How did she know
You needed morphine ?
Why didn't you listen
To the warning words of your friends
While they told you so ?
I know you couldn't listen
To people talk about
What they didn't know.

I've lost a friend
And I don't know why
But never again
Will we get together to die.
And why after every last shot
Was there always another ?
Why after all you hadn't got
Did you leave your life to your mother ?
