		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk with the flowers, talk with me for hours
Tell me all that brings you grace
Tell me 'bout your powers, I'll give you all my power
Something to rewind today
Let's walk with the flowers, talk with me for hours
Tell me all that brings you grace
Tell me 'bout your powers, I'll give you all my power
Something to rewind today
'Cause you could say you hate me
And I would say I love you
You could fucking hate me (hate me)
And I would say I love you

'Cause you could fucking hate me, and I would say I love you
You could act just like that, I'm right here
You could fucking hate me, and I would say I love you
You could act just like that, I'm not scared
You could fucking hate me, and I would say I love you
You could act just like that, I'm right here
You can try to break me, and I would say I love you
I know I'm fucking broken, I'm right here, oh

Walk with the flowers, talk with me for hours
You could make me walk through flames
Tell me when it's over, swear we're never sober
Sun is burning on my face
I'll tell you 'til we're older, I'm never getting over
The way you made me feel that day
This will make you hate me
But you could never break me

'Cause you could fucking hate me, and I would say I love you
You could act just like that, I'm right here
You could fucking hate me, and I would say I love you
You could act just like that, I'm not scared
You could fucking hate me, and I would say I love you
You could act just like that, I'm right here
You can try to break me, and I would say I love you
I know I'm fucking broken, I'm right here, oh

Walking with flowers, talking for hours
Tell me what brings you grace
Telling my powers, giving my powers
Rewinding today
