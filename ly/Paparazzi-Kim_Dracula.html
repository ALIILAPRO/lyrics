		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the crowd
We're c-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you
It's so magical
We'd be so fantastical
Yeah, yea-yeah

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us, it don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind 
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I think you should know that I see other people and they see me looking back
Baby, don't you break my heart I told you that it's made of glass
I'ma make it fast, step it up, I'll step my foot on the gas
Look at the past blast, I'ma make you fall on your ass
Suck it up and pacify, but it's irrelevant
Y'all motherfuckers do it for the hell of it
Say you care if I cry, you lie
If I put 'em side by side, you sigh
(Ah) care if I cry, you lie
If I put 'em side by side, you die
(Ah) care if I cry, you lie
If I put 'em side by side, side by side

I'm your biggest fan, I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
Baby, there's no other superstar, you know that I'll be
Your papa-paparazzi
Promise I'll be kind 
But I won't stop until that boy is mine
Baby, you'll be famous, chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
