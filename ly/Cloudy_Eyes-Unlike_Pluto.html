		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I've got cloudy eyes
Sunshine in my life
Now I've got anchors no more
You can say I'm blind but I see from the sky
And I'll keep going higher

One day, my feet took off the ground
Feels like my weight is shedding now
Sunshine in the sky starts cutting through
Always starts cutting through
Kaleidoscope of butterflies
This is where I wanna be
But then the colors change
The blue turns into grey

Lightning then thunder, oh no
I think I need to let it go
But if I just keep pushing through
Oh oh, yeah

And I've got cloudy eyes
Sunshine in my life
And I've got anchors no more
You can say I'm blind but I see from the sky
And I'll keep going higher

No clue what's right in front of me
Close view shadows surprising me
And then the rain turns into ice
Hitting my skin like little knives
And when things finally calm
I realize I'm in the eye of the storm

Lightning then thunder, oh no
I think I need to let it go
But if I just keep pushing through
Oh oh, yeah

And I've got cloudy eyes
Sunshine in my life
And I've got anchors no more
You can say I'm blind but I see from the sky
And I'll keep going higher

And I've got cloudy eyes
Sunshine in my life
And I've got cloudy eyes
Sunshine in my life
