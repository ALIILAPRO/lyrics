		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've left the windows open
See what the air may bring
Sun and light my days but Sunday didn't know me

Small whispers filled with worry
Mindful sins I'd bring
We'd speak if the room would match my thoughtfulness

Lies, once I said bye
Held my waters, safe and hide
Crossed the bridge, said my lines
Ninety nine, I want no surprise
No details, no deep ends
How come I never see you
What was I to do?
What was I to do?

I need to take time to persuade my ends
Always
Write my number so you care for me
All day

I need to take time to persuade my ends
Always
Write my number so you care for me
All day (So you care for me)
