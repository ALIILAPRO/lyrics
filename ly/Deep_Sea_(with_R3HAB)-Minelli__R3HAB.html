		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can offer you more than illusions
I would give you my heart, perfection, no draft
And I can help you have another vision
Heal your past, a new start, mmm

Oh my, oh my, oh my-y
If you will b-be mine
I'll set the tone, I'll be both the rhythm and rhyme
I'll give you all my time
I'll share with you what's mine
I'll set the tone, I'll be both the rhythm and rhyme

Why don't you just clo-close your eyes
Open up your mind
And then follow me, follow me, deep sea
You will see I'm right
Open up your mind
You just follow me, follow me, deep sea

Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
You should follow me, follow me, deep sea
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
You should follow me, follow me, deep sea

Trust me when I say I'll be here every single day
I can help you find a way
And don't let me be misunderstood
'Cause I want us, want this to be good
Babe, I won't let you down

My, oh my, oh my-y
If you will b-be mine
I'll set the tone, I'll be both the rhythm and rhyme
I'll give you all my time
I'll share with you what's mine
I'll set the tone, I'll be both the rhythm and rhyme

Why don't you just clo-close your eyes
Open up your mind
And then follow me, follow me, deep sea
You will see I'm right
Open up your mind
You just follow me, follow me, deep sea

Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
You should follow me, follow me, deep sea
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
You should follow me, follow me, deep sea

Clo-close your eyes, clo-close your eyes
You should follow me, follow me, deep sea
Clo-close your eyes, clo-close your eyes
You should follow me, follow me, deep sea
