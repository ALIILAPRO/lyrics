		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
This girl she got me shook 
With her pretty brown eyes
Sexy little thighs 
The way she moves just gets to me 
Keeps shakin' that thing, your making me sing 
She got just what I like 
Every day of the week, my baby's so sweet 
Come over here and turn off the lights 
We'll do it all night, your game is so tight 
This girl she got me shook 

On my way to catch a flick 
Just me and my click 
Stand in line we're already late 
Cause the movie started at eight 
Look around trying to compass a seat 
Take the first one that I see 
Sit down and look beside, next to me this girl she blew my mind 
Can't concentrate, feeling sweaty, getting butterflies, getting dizzy 
Gotta keep it cool, gotta keep it slick, and remember she's just a chick 
Tell me what is this I feel inside, never felt this way before all right 
But I gotta keep it real tonight 

[Chorus]

Front row of the fashion show 
Lights down they're ready to go 
Lookin up at the runway 
Saw the girl from the other day 
She was sportin some silky gown 
Didn't expect her to be here 
Victoria's got a secret, she's the one I want to be with 
Can't concentrate, feeling sweaty, getting butterflies, getting dizzy 
Gotta keep it cool, gotta keep it slick, and remember she's just a chick 
Tell me what is this I feel inside, never felt this way before all right 
But I gotta keep it real tonight 

[Chorus]

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, girl you got me singing 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sing the chorus for me 

[Chorus: x2]
