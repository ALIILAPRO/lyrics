		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn I don't even know how I got here
Fucking done with this shit though
Shout out my boys
All these fucking games that I don't want to play
Can't focus I got all these hoes in my brain
I tried to give you space
I was balling and I damn near took it to the paint
But you put me in my place
And then you ran a fucking way
I wake up in the crib
But it feels like I'm in space
Oh my god it's a Martian
Roses in my garden
But not the one of Eden
Please give me a reason
And you caught me be surprise
Don't be fucking lying I can see it in your eyes
Read ur fucking mind
I can stop the fucking time
I know things that they don't wanna tell you
They always fucking doubt us
But don't forget about us
And I stay still while the world spins around us
Yeah the city lights are bright and I think they fucking found us
Up in the clouds I'm high bitch
Hands on the clock I'm timeless
Feel alone in the crowd can't find me
I promise you I tried
