		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
(It's Eezy)

Shorty bad, slim thick
She my drug, she my fix
And I'm all up in her mix
She be mixing with the wrist
She the plug, she finesse
She the one they call the GOAT
She don't stress, she don't trip 
And she fuck with all my bros

So if I 
Gotta choose someone (choose someone)
Then it must be her 
She been here since day one (day one)
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess we gon' have to go hit London
Paris, and Montego Bay
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess she gon' have to scream my name
Now every time that she come to the crib
I'ma break her back like I break that bank

I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae

I guess, I guess, I guess
It's about time that you get what you need and what you deserve
This love been buzzing like bees
I'm thinking the end, we been through the worst
My sign match your sign
I gotta thank God for the universe
Ain't had a nigga like me this is new to her
Girlfriends like, "Sheesh, what he do to her?"
I'm on (I'm on), yeah I'm on (I'm on)
Bless that song, can't do wrong
I'm sure your ass could agree
She my right hand no pledge of allegiance
Goat yeah she the GOAT (she the GOAT)
I brag and I boast
Niggas tryna pass, wanna take my place
'Til they play dumb I'ma call her bae, y'ah't I mean?

So if I 
Gotta choose someone (choose someone)
Then it must be her 
She been here since day one (day one)
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess we gon' have to go hit London
Paris, and Montego Bay
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess she gon' have to scream my name
Now every time that she come to the crib
I'ma break her back like I break that bank

I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae

She the GOAT, she the GOAT (oh yeah)
She the GOAT, she the GOAT (baby the GOAT yeah)
Greatest of all time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gucci on all the time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She the GOAT, she the GOAT (yeah)
She the GOAT, she the GOAT (ohh)
Greatest of all time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gucci on all the time
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Shorty bad, slim thick
She my drug, she my fix
And I'm all up in her mix
She be mixing with the wrist
She the plug, she finesse
She the one they call the GOAT
She don't stress, she don't trip 
And she fuck with all my bros (It's Eezy)

(That was litty, that was litty, that was litty)

(Mix)
