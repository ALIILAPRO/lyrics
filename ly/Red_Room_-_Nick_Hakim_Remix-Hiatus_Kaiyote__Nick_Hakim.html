		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
It feels like I'm inside a flower
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
It feels like I'm inside a flower
It feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here

I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
It feels like I'm inside a flower
It feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here

I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
It feels like I'm inside a flower
It feels like I'm inside my eyelids
And I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here
I don't wanna be
Anywhere but here

I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room
It is the red hour when the sun sets in my bedroom
I got a red room, I got a red room
