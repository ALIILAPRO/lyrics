		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This may come
This may come as some surprise
But I miss you
I could see through
All of your lies
And still I miss you

He takes her love
But it doesn't feel like mine
He tastes her kiss
Her kisses are not mine, they're not mine

He takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now
She takes, but surely she doesn't know how

Is it a crime?
Is it a crime
That I still want you
And I want you to want me too?

My love is wider
Wider than Victoria Lake
My love is taller
Taller than the Empire State

It dives and it jumps
And it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that
Surely you want me back

Is it a crime?
Is it a crime?
I still want you
And I want you to want me too

My love is wider than Victoria Lake
Taller than the Empire State
It dives and it jumps
I can't give you more than that
Surely you want me back

Is it a crime?
Is it a crime
That I still want you
And I want you to want me too?

It dives and jumps
And it ripples like the
Deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that
Surely you want it back

Tell me
Is it 
A crime
