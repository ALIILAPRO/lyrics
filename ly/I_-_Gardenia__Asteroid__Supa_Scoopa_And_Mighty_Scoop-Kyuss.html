		  I. GARDENIA

One blow â€˜till I take you down, I'll take you down
One smoke and your head spins around and around
Chrome mags, a million drags, it never lags,
And old transform queen momma you've never seen

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a burnin' fuel
Push it over baby
Oh makin' love (un)to you

Power booster, I'm talkin' to God and more
Crank it up and above my head
Smell my shit eatin' grin on the skids of my world
Six hundred sixty six miles per hour

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a burnin' fuel
Push it over baby
Oh makin' love.....

Hear a purrin' motor
And she's a burnin' fuel
Oh baby burnin'
Push it over baby
Oh makin' love (un)to you
Makin' love (un)to you
Makin'

Get back, get back a rolling
Get back, get back a rolling
Get back, get back a rolling
Get back, get back the motherfucker
Get back, get back a rolling
Get back, get back the motherfucker
Get back, get back the motherfucker	




ASTEROID

[Instrumental]




SUPA SCOOPA AND MIGHTY SCOOP

Don't try to take me away,
Like I can't live without you,
Today, makin' love tomorrow,
So way, swooping you're so fragile,
Die today, you disgrace the mortal.

Fight me lately,
Tried to someone,
We've been laughing,
Since you've been gone,
And I want to know,
Did you all enjoy the show?
It's so sad to see you go

And you know.

Hanging low today,
I replace the highway,
Love the only way,
Linking hands the wrong way,
So I bare to see you go,
It's so sad to see you go,
I just thought I'd let you know

And you know.
