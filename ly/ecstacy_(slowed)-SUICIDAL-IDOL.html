		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna be your sweetheart
Fucking come here, give me your heart
Just you and me to infinity
I can't fucking breathe, too much ecstasy

Kiss me on the lips, choke me the floor
Drag me around, push me right against your door
I'm your little doll, come and play with me
Dying all my hair, we could be in the scene
Lights out, you don't tap out
You're so crazy, manipulate me
Fucking chase me, fucking break me
You're my everything, please, just rape me

I just wanna be your sweetheart
Fucking come here, give me your heart
Just you and me to infinity
I can't fucking breathe, too much ecstasy

Piercing on your lip, it's perfect
Never seen another girl this perfect
Sticking out your tongue for the picture
You're so pretty, you're so popular

I just wanna be your sweetheart
Fucking come here, give me your heart
Just you and me to infinity
I can't fucking breathe, too much ecstasy
