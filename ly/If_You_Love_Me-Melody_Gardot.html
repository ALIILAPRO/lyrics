		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you love me let me know
Tell my heart which way to go
Come in close but come in slowly, now
If you love me let me know

Other hearts may fly away
But my hope is that you'll stay
We're two weary hearts aglow now
If you love me let me know

Once the moon should take her bow
Maybe you'll find the words to say
Still I've often thought that words
Would only get into your way

So if you love me let me know
Tell my heart which way to go
Come in close but come in slowly, now
If you love me let me know

Once the moon should take her bow
Maybe you'll find the words to say
Still I've often thought that words
Would only get into your way

So if you love me let me know
Tell my heart which way to go
Come in close but come in slowly, now
If you love me let me know, mmm

If you love me let me know
If you love me let me know
