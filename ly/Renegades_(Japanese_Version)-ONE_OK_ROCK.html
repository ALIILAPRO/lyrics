		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a fire in my soul
I've lost my faith in this broken system
Got love for my home
But if we cry, is there anyone listening?
We're the forgotten generation
We want an open conversation
Follow me on this road
You know we gotta let go

For all of the times that they said it's impossible
They built the hurdles, the walls and the obstacles
When we're together you know we're unstoppable now

I'm not afraid
To tear it down and build it up again (up again)
It's not our fate (hey)
We could be the renegades
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again (hey)
We could be the renegades

Whoa oh oh oh

They've been holding us down
They've been telling us to change our voices
But we're not part of that crowd
We made our bed and we'll make our own choices
We may be underestimated
But I know one day we will make it
Time to say it out loud
We are young and we're proud

すり込まれ塗り重ねられた
嘘は僕等を飲み込んだ
We got a fight for our rights and the things we love now

I'm not afraid
To tear it down and build it up again (up again)
It's not our fate (hey)
We could be the renegades
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again (hey)
We could be the renegades

Whoa oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh

We could be the renegades

Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready
Take a deep breath, close your eyes and get ready to fly

I'm not afraid
To tear it down and build it up again
It's not our fate (hey)
We could be the renegades
I'm here for you, ooh
Are you here for me too?
Let's start again (hey)
We could be the renegades (we could be the renegades)

Whoa oh oh oh

(We could be the, we could be the) we could be the renegades
Whoa oh oh oh oh
