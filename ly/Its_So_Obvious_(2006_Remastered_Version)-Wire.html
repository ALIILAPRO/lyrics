		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so obvious, it's here, it's there
It's not just the colour
It must be more, at Least seventeen-threescore
This is seventy-seven, nearly heaven
It's black, white, and pink, just think
There's more to come
Hum-hum, hum-hum
It's so obvious
Well it's alright, listen
Can't wait for seventy-eight
God those RPM, can't wait for them
Don't just watch, hours happen
Get in there kid and snap them
