		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Godamn, man child
You fucked me so good that I almost said, "I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that and I can't change your mood
Ah-ah, oh

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

Goddamn, man child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Can-you-know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you?
You

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue

You make me blue
Blue, blue 
Blue, blue, blue, blue
