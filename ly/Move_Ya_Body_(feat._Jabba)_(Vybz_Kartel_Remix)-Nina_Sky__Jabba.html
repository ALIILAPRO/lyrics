		  Alright, right about now massive and crew! 
Yuh dun know see a Jabba pass through
Alright now we have di biggest group singers here right now 
Brand new inna di market, mi seh everybody worldwide 
Get use to dat group yah yuh dun know 
So right now girls, hey! 

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Roll up in the club, looking fly (Yuh know) 
Made your first approach then caught his eye (Wah!) 
So they move your way towards the dance floor 
(Everybody touch di dance floor) 
Grab her hand and she leads first 
Whole night has gotten through, stand behind me let me grind on you 
If I lick my lips I'm probably feelin' you 
I'm a make you go, oooh! 

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Whoa! (You feelin' it now)
Take it slow (You turning me on) 
Club get warmer (Warmer) your body moves closer (Closer) 
One with the rhythm (Rhythm) don't stop movin' you're makin' me hot 
From head to toe, I feel your flow 
Vibes get stronger (Stronger) party seems longer (Longer) 
And makes me really want ya, don't stop movin' you're makin' me hot 

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Ooh, move your body girl

The way you ride it girl

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Can you feel the beat, can you, can you feel the beat (can you feel it?)
Can you feel the beat, can you, can you feel the beat 
Can you feel the beat within my heart 
Can you see my love shines through the dark, can you feel the beat 
Can you feel the beat within my heart 
Can't you see my love shines through the dark 
Can't you see that you must be a part, of that beat in my heart 

Slow wine, slow wine, slow wine, slow wine! 
Slow wine, slow wine, slow wine, slow wine! 
Fast wine, fast wine, fast wine, fat wine! 
Move your body, move your body, move your body, move your body! 

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go

Ooh, move your body girl
Makes the fellas go
The way you ride it girl
Makes the fellas go
