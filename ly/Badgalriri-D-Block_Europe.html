		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know I'm sayin'
Dbe in the field, NFL-type shit, man
Been humble for too long

Runnin' the trenches, didn't sit on no benches
Runnin' from jakes tryna dodge the arrest
Mind on my block, I'm on top of what's left
I had to switch up the show to the stans
Used to dream 'bout Lambos, APs while I bag out
Now, I blew a million on watches this month
Scopes on deck, we just stoppin' for lunch
She order a pornstar, I mix my lean up
Rich nigga, roll 'round town in a convoy
Rider lil' bitch with me dressed like a tomboy
Eight different Goyards one day, and I Snapped it
Still cum too fast in her pussy, it's magic
I need a freaky lil' bitch that can hack it
Platinum Rollies, still got on the plastic
Strokin' on her G-spot, my middle finger tatted
Comfy in public 'cause me and my nigga patterned
Quarter million Euros in a stash spot in Paris
Just a left the galleries, 10K in jackets
Bad like a bandit but humble with manners
When I get out of bed and turn my camera on, I'm braggin'

Mmh, I just want a hundred P's
Need a little little diva that can beat it, yeah
Mmh, need her to receive it
Bad like Bad Gyal Riri (oh)
Bad like Riri
Bad like Bad Gyal Riri
Louis all season (okay)
I'ma make sure that she receive it

Catch me slidin' in the Brabus (Brabus)
My nigga in the passy, he will cut you like the barbers (barbers)
If it's Audi then it's RS (RS)
Have 'em duck down, wonky knee, sittin' in a harness
They are sons, we are fathers (fathers)
Said she'll never fuck a rapper, said she'll never fuck a artist (artist)
I ain't get it retail, but I charge it (charge it)
With the bricks resale, it's a bargain (bargain)
Beezo got birds for sale
She could take a little dick, but she prefer the girls (uh-uh)
V12, yeah, they heard me well
I turned a hood bitch straight into a Herm√®s girl (yeah)
Half a zip in my cup, hit my cleaner, can bag it
Louis V rugs, no Aladdin
Pourin' lean, I keep sleepin' in traffic
When I get out of bed and turn my camera on, I'm braggin'

Mmh, I just want a hundred P's
Need a little little diva that can beat it, yeah
Mmh, need her to receive it
Bad like Bad Gyal Riri (oh)
Bad like Riri
Bad like Bad Gyal Riri
Louis all season
I'ma make sure that she receive it
