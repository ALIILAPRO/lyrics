		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I walked longer
It didn't go my way
today's a foggy night
My steps lead to new path
more you do that My shadow grows

Never forget far away
crazy shining city light
grains of sand that were 
out of reach may be now
I know

like a statue I was silent 
It was that I'm comfortable
I breath out closed my eyes
smile again dark and bright
I'm colored

tip of my hand that's swirling around
pour out a lot of emotions oh yeah
I take another step more forward 
into the fire 
I know that fact that it's coming to end
focus on me me me
and I'm not fine
Go back before it is too late
To you looking at me in the mirror

I walked longer
It didn't go my way
today's a foggy night
My steps lead to new path
more you do that My shadow grows

Never forget far away
crazy shining city light
grains of sand that were 
out of reach may be now
I know

like a statue I was silent 
It was that I'm comfortable
I breath out closed my eyes
smile again dark and bright
I'm colored

tip of my hand that's swirling around
pour out a lot of emotions oh yeah
I take another step more forward 
into the fire 
I know that fact that it's coming to end
focus on me me me
and I'm not fine
Go back before it is too late
To you looking at me in the mirror
me me
another step more forward 
into the fire 
I know that fact that it's coming to end
focus on me me me

another step more forward 
into the fire 
I know that fact that it's coming to end
