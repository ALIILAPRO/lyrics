		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel strange
As I'm changing
Twist and turn me inside out
I'm aching

Satisfy
What you want
What you need
I can tell you're starving, break a piece off of me
I've never seen such a pretty wicked thing
When did love get so many teeth

I should know better, I should know better
Nails on my neck, you should mark me with a red letter
Shame on me for second chances
I won't forget this, I won't forget this

I won't hesitate, to put you in your place
I'll say it to your face
Stay the fuck away from me
This isn't love
You're just a drug
I've had enough
I won't satisfy
What you want
What you need
I can tell you're starving, go ahead and starve then
I'll make you beg, like you did to me
Leave you in a mess
All you'll get is nothing

I should know better, I should know better
Nails on my neck, you should mark me with a red letter
Shame on me for second chances
Burn me out, burn me down
Leave me in the ashes

I should know better, I should know better
Nails on my neck, you should mark me with a red letter
Shame on me for second chances
Burn me out, burn me down
Leave me in the ashes

I feel strange
I feel strange
I feel strange
This isn't love
You're just a drug
I've had enough
I won't satisfy
