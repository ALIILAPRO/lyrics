		  You are not ready
Go
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh

John Cena, the way I'm big chillin'
Bitch can't rap, it's best you stay hidden
We off the ice, vanilla, I stay with it
Talk your shit, we get it, you don't get it
This the theme song, turn the beat on
Just picked up your mama in a Nissan
She call me Ben 10, got the green on
I pass her to the homie, turn the the heat on
I am not your average rapper
Wear a lotta feelings, but I'm not a capper
Booty-slapper, candy wrapper
Crisp like a KitKat, yeah, let me get that

Get down and get low, I'm laid out
Cut two checks, no label, we paid out
It's two players, it's co-op, it's split-screen
I'm OP, my shell blue, your shell's green

Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get

Uh, John Cena, the way I fill seats
Don't talk biz if you want the beef
Money cash cow is getting real steep
Don't go camping 'cause the bag don't sleep
Turn the heat on, spark that shit
JVB with the hits on hits
Drip down, I got fits on fits
Call me Han Solo, I don't miss

Uh, get down, we going wild with a knife
Hit the ground, don't get it wrong, get it right
Demon, more like I'm a thief in the night
Break the beat, get back, it's off sight
Gym shorts, no shirt like Cena
Punks in the ring, step in the arena
Going for the belt, it's gonna be a knockout
Lil' bruh need a attitude adjustment, yuh

Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh
Get down and get low, get with it, uh

You are not ready
