		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh

We puttin' them boys on mute, mute, mute, mute
These boys, they think they're cute, cute, cute, cute
Too thirsty, need a juice, juice, juice, juice
So keep puttin' them boys on mute

Huh? What did you say?
Huh? What did you say?
I can't hear you
Huh? What did you say?
Huh? What did you say?
I can't hear you

Can you, please, just leave a message when you hear the tone?
Can you, please? Can you, please?
'Cause I really can't
(Message when you hear the tone, message when you hear the tone)

We puttin' them boys on mute, mute, mute, mute
These boys, they think they're cute, cute, cute, cute
Too thirsty, need a juice, juice, juice, juice
So keep puttin' them boys on mute

I think he's goin' down
He ain't famous since I left town
Wonderin' what I'm doin' now
Bad girl but a good time
Dial star sixty-seven
He keep tryna play me
He be on me if I let him
But I put him in my pocket, baby

Tease him, leave him
Keep it on lock, I'm on DND
I don't need him
Phone vibrate so I let it ring
I put these boys on mute, mute, mute, mute
That's what I'm gonna do to you too

We puttin' them boys on mute (pourquoi tu m'appelles?)
These boys, they think they're cute (pourquoi tu m'appelles?)
too thirsty, need that juice (pourquoi tu m'appelles?)
So I keep puttin' them boys on mute (pourquoi tu m'appelles?)

Huh-huh? What did you say?
Huh? What did you say?
I can't hear you
Huh-huh? What did you say?
Huh? What did you say?
I can't hear you
Huh? What did you say?
Huh? What did you say?
I can't hear you
