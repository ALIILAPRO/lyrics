		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're fittin' to take your town
You know we wear the crown
Just got to mess around
Leave your daughters and your sisters with me
Down
Down for that fattest sound
We're comin' to your town
Breaking some ground
Someone's got to do it

Can you slow down?
(Just can't be)
Gotta have a fat sound
(From S.B.)
Motherfucker said
Is your soul found?
(Can't you see?)
And we're comin' to your town
Break it
Smash it
Motherfuckin' snot

Snot
We're fittin' to take your town
You know we wear the crown
Just got to mess around
Leave your daughters and your sisters with me
Down
Down for that fattest sound
We're comin' to your town
Breaking some ground
Someone's got to do it

Can you slow down?
(Just can't be)
Gotta have a fat sound
(From S.B.)
Motherfucker said
Is your soul found?
(Can't you see?)
And we're comin' to your town

Someone's got to do it
Snot
You always knew this
Yeah snot crew
We're undisputed
Yeah snot
Though we rule your world
Clockin' all them girls
We're takin' yours and no 
We'll never stop

Well snot
I've got to tell you once again
Don't try and play my crew cause you just can't win
I like to hear the sound when your skull cracks
If you talk back feel us attack y'all
We're fixin' to take you down with a fat, funky sound
Gonna steal your crown
Not gonna mess around
I know you hear my voice 'cause you got no choice
The volume of my crew still undisputed

If you don't move
We're gonna roll right over motherfucker
Down with this crew
Yes everything's gonna be alright
I've got to wow the crowd with a sound so loud
Try and front but you know I'm gonna get down
I've got the mic that's right what's at stake is
Afraid you'll hear the truth
You can't take this

Slow down
(Just can't be)
Gotta have a fat sound
(From S.B.)
Motherfucker said
Is your soul found?
(Can't you see?)
And we're comin' to your town

Yeah snot
We're fittin' to take your town
You know we wear the crown
Just got to mess around
Leave your daughters and your sisters with me
Down
Down for that fattest sound
We're comin' to your town
Breaking some ground
Someone's got to do it
Snot
You always knew this
Yeah Snot crew
We're undisputed
Yeah snot
Though we rule your world
Clockin' all them girls
Don't you know we're gonna
Break it
Smash it
Gonna get it
