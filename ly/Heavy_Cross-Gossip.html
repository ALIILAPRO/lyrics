		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a cruel, cruel world to face on your own
A heavy cross to carry along
The lights are on but everyone's gone
And it's cruel

It's a funny way to make ends meet
When the lights are out on every street
It feels alright but never complete
Without joy

I checked you
If it's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it

On the rainy nights, even the coldest days
You're moments ago but seconds away
The principal of nature, it's true but
It's a cruel world

We can play it safe or play it cool
Follow the leader or make up all the rules
Whatever you want, the choice is yours
So choose

I checked you
If it's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it

I trust you
It's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it

I checked you
If it's already been done, undo it
It takes two
It's up to me and you to prove it

I trust you
