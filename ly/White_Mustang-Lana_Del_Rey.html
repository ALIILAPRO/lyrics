		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Packing all my things for the summer
Lying on my bed it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer, but I
Couldn't stop the way I was feeling the day
Your record dropped

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white mustang

Caught up in my dreams and forgetting
I've been acting like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for loving and leaving
I was such a fool for believing that you
Could change all the ways you've been living
But you just couldn't stop

The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white mustang

You're revving and revving and revving it up
And the sound, it was frightening
And you were getting a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightening

White mustang
Your white mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild Mustang

You're gonna hit me like lightning
You're gonna hit me like lightning
