		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas

(Roll up on ya, roll up on ya)
(Roll up on ya, roll up on ya)

Yo, yo, eight mil' on that new thing, tied up like my shoe string
Ain't fucking with you bitch niggas, and that's real rap but I do sing
Make room when I come by, ain't speaking, I'm dumb high
Just heard niggas got jokes, it's a matter of time before one dies
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know when they talk slick that I'm winning fresh, they'll get chewed out
'Cause them dudes out and them tools out, all sixes like school's out
Niggas know when they talk slick that I'm winning fresh, they'll get chewed out
Their shit ain't regular rich, so they end up in a ditch
I'm not a regular bitch, so when niggas see me, they jump on my dick
He not a regular shooter, so when you see me, salute-a
Ain't got a knife in my hand, but I'm choppin' it up with some niggas from Cuba

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I'ma run around with them real niggas

(Roll upon ya, rull upon ya)
(Roll upon ya, rull upon ya)

Ask Jay who he married, eighty thousand in Paris
Stadiums with Queen B and that selfie, got 'em aggy
These bitches is light-weight, I'm always at fight-weight
Wrist game is on ice skate, 'cause we move work through that Tri-State
'Cause them boys out, and them toys out, still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time or that Mayweather like Floyd's out
'Cause them boys out, and them toys out, still banging that noise out
You could get it in the winter-time or that Mayweather like Floyd's out
All of these bitches in pocket, I'm 'bout to make a deposit
Tell 'em to go 'head and gossip, as long as your house is the size of my closet
Anybody I call, they picks up, even if they was gettin' they dick sucked
These niggas don't make a mix-up, tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up
Tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up, (tell 'em niggas go step they bricks up)

On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I run around with them real niggas
Got real sons, I need a real sitter
When I leave niggas, they get real bitter
On a real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I'ma run around with them real niggas

(Roll upon ya, roll upon ya)
(Roll upon ya, roll upon ya)

When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
Shanghai, Shanghai, Shanghai
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai, yeah
When we bang, bye
Pop pills, now we Shanghai, yeah
