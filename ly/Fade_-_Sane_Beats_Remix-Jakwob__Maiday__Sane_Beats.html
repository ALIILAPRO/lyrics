		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find myself picking up the pieces of me that you discarded
So this what they talk about when they say broken hearted
Thought I was a together kind of person the type who had it handled
As fate would have it I'm exploding, like a roman candle, oh

And it's pretty in the sky
Such a beautiful way to die
But I want my sparkle back
Why does it always fade to black?

I broke down ignition when I'm thinking in of something
Really don't keep going in unless it's onto nothing
You could have had anything you wanted from me, I'm a catch
I looked up to you so much, it's a shame you never noticed that

Oh, and it's pretty in the sky
Such a beautiful way to die
But I want my sparkle back
Why does it always fade to black?

We never said goodbye,
At least you don't get to see me cry
Cry
Cry
At least you don't get to see me cry

Even if it's wrong enough, I just wanted to be loved
Even if it's wrong enough, I just wanted to be loved
Even if it's wrong enough, I just wanted to be loved
Loved, loved, I just wanted to be loved
Loved, loved, I just wanted to be loved
Loved, loved, I just wanted to be loved

And it's pretty in the sky
Such a beautiful way to die
But I want my sparkle back
Why does it always fade to black?
