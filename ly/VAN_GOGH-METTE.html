		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm motivated by the way you move
Got me fixated on everything you do, yeah
Ain't no bussin' to the music without you
I could be Van Gogh, shawty, if you, if you

Fizz it up like pink champagne
How you make me make it rain
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
When I got you next to me
I'm hatchin' a masterpiece 
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah

I see you toss your hips, sway, then dip in slow motion
You got your edges laid down like queen Janet Jackson
No fucks to give, go on, cast spells like a mystic
I don't wanna miss it

Tonight, I'm (ooh)
I'm motivated by the way you move
Got me fixated on everything you do, yeah
Ain't no bussin' to the music without you
I could be Van Gogh, shawty, if you'd be my muse
Don't go dressin' up for anyone but me
You got poet dreams in every word you speakin'
I could go skyrocket if you light the fuse
I could be Van Gogh, shawty, if you'd be my muse

Let's go

I know, I'm comin' off strong
These feelings are gettin' heavy for you
And I know
You're my new vice, the whipped cream and the cherry on top
(I like my cherries on top)

I said
"Between now and then, I'ma need you forever"
She said
"I don't know, I'm hot and cold, depends on the weather"
I guess
I'm gonna have to think fast and pull it together
'Cause it's now or never

Tonight, I'm (ooh)
I'm motivated by the way you move
Got me fixated on everything you do, yeah
Ain't no bussin' to the music without you
I could be Van Gogh, shawty, if you'd be my muse
Don't go dressin' up for anyone but me
You got poet dreams in every word you speakin'
I could go skyrocket if you light the fuse
I could be Van Gogh, Van Gogh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
When you turn around, I'm crushin' like that
Work it out, I'm crushin' like that
Hit me now, like that

I'm motivated by the way you move (I'm motivated, baby)
Got me fixated on everything you do, yeah
Ain't no bussin' to the music without you
I could be Van Gogh, sh-

Dance, dance (I could be Van) 
Dance, dance (Van Gogh, Gogh, Gogh)
