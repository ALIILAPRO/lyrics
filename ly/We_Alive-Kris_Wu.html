		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause some lie, you feel the vibe
Always lie, yeah we alive
On the side, we hold it down
Never lies, yeah we alive
Yeah we come alive, you feel the vibe
Live it up I feel alive
On a ride, gon' be a night
Never lies, yeah we alive

Sobe up, man up
Phone ring, pick up (sic)
No competition, I'm on the high
You ain't got nothin' on me
No competition, we're on the like
We ran that up
Coming up, coming up I remember that role yeah
I was livin' at home yeah
Wasn't it too long ago
Oh na na na na, we're on a ride
It's like I'm always on the roll
But they love me back at home

Cause some lie, you feel the vibe
Always lie, yeah we alive
On the side we hold it down
Never lies, yeah we alive
Yeah we come alive, you feel the vibe
Live it up, I feel alive
On a ride, gon be a night
Never lies, yeah we alive

New money on status
My lyrics say you're sadist
Always knew 've been had it
I still can't break old habits
These new rappers fugazin'
They all fade but can't fake me
Funny say they made me
I'm unfazed, they can't face me
This life been a movie
Always meant to be and I never lose
Always meant to be and I make the rules
Say we're getting up but we never do
They all know I'm in the city
I give back where I come from
Got my back where I come from
You are summonin' nothing

Yeah we come alive, you feel the vibe
Live it up I feel alive
On a ride, gon' be a night
Never lies, yeah we alive
Hold it, hold it, hold it
Yeah we come alive, you feel the vibe
Live it up I feel alive
On a ride, gon' be a night
Never lies, yeah we alive
