		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thug
Baby, pass me the hookah (these niggas scrubs)
Baby, pass me the hookah (I make love)
Baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, just pass me the hookah

Tearin' up the place
I'm a rich nigga, got Chanel on my waist
Run up on me playin', I'ma aim it at ya face
And that go for anybody, anyway
Ayy, I'm a rich Blood, by the way
And I'm havin' swag, Rollie old like a tape
Fish scale, yeah, I got these bitches on the bait
Don't wanna talk, man, they say, I need some space
Woop, woop, woop, my new car geeked up
I just paid a cop, now I'm runnin' out of court
Panoramic top, I'ma put it on the rocks
Crawl, walk and hop, got all of these bitches shocked
Ayy, stone molly whiter than my socks
I don't, I don't wanna talk if it ain't 'bout guap
Clone, clone a young nigga and still flop
I buy pints by the two, no Pac

Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, just pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, pass me the hookah
Pass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah

Ah, rubbin' on my chain, blowin' cloudmatic
Smoke somethin' with a G and bend that ass backwards
Lay back, relax and talk mathematics
Later on, we test a little sex practice
Write my name on the wall
Money in the mattress, bet she wanna get involved
She hopped on the blunt, say, "Where the hookah y'all?"
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set
Mozart art on the block, so wet
I got her where I want her and I ain't done yet
Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah
Tell them bitches, "Hmm, fuck that"
You with Aladdin, bet I got a magic carpet for that ass, yes
I'm also on one, got two Olsen's on me
Big homie, Young Thugger Thugger, rollin'
Rolls Royce so shorty

Baby, pass me the hookah (ah, yeah)
Baby, pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, just pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, pass me the hookah
Pass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah

Ah, Ben Frank baddies in the Benz Wagon
You know she want a ride home, hop on the band wagon
I got the chain saggy, you know that life lavish
Lifestyles like this, gon' need Magnums
Pass baby, welcome to rich class, baby
You all Maybelline, with ya new Celine
Audemars on lean, cars on sheen
You white girl, but black girl ghetto fly thing
It's verified, they ain't on your sea level
Watered eyes, don't cry, inhale and breathe regular
My baby on it, high in the crack of dawnin'
Body shape, figure eight, like Picasso draw ya
Oh, yes, I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'
Like, like, for no reason, let's get closer, closed in
Remove your clothes, we close friends
Don't get choked smokin' OG Oakland, shout out Oakland

Baby, pass me the hookah (ah, yeah)
Baby, pass me the hookah (yeah)
Baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, just pass me the hookah
Baby, pass me the hookah (yeah)
Ayy, baby, pass me the hookah
Ayy, baby, pass me the hookah
Pass me the hookah, pass the hookah, pass the hookah

Ah, yeah
For all my bitches that smoke hookah, yeah
