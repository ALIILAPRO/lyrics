		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before, "goodbye"
But I came back again

I love you so, oh
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I thought that you would realize
That if I run away from you
That you would want me to
But I got a big surprise
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend

I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave
Oh, ho, oh, ho, oh

You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
