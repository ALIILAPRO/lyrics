		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunlight failed but only for a while
In the moonlight pale someone made me smile
The shining almost took me but I made it through that night
And in the morning life it graced me and I ran for miles
(Sunlight) In a billion dreams that are lost and won
(Moonlight) In spite of all you've seen there's only one way out

(Say you will love me until I leave the world)
In a billion dreams that are lost and won
(Say you will love me until I leave the world)
In spite of all you've seen there's only one way out
