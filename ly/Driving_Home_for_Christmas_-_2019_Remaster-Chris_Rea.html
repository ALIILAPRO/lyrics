		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm driving home for Christmas
Oh, I can't wait to see those faces
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Well, I'm moving down that line

And it's been so long
But I will be there
I sing this song
To pass the time away

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas

It's gonna take some time but I'll get there
Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
But soon there'll be a freeway, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
And feel you near me

Driving in my car
I'm driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
Just the same

Top to toe in tailbacks
Oh, I got red lights all around
I'm driving home for Christmas, yeah
Get my feet on holy ground

So I sing for you
Though you can't hear me
When I get through
Oh and feel you near me

Driving in my car
Driving home for Christmas
Driving home for Christmas
With a thousand memories

I take look at the driver next to me
He's just the same
He's driving home, driving home
Driving home for Christmas
