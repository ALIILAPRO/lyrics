		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our mother God we hold the sword in holy times
We are the war, we never see the light
The order call, we all will take more human wine
And we toast to the night

We fold our hands, we keep the bible in our minds
Our father God, we are the hordes of cain
And though you run we will take you and we find
Any type, any vein

We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins

Our father Lord, we are the demons of the wild
When all we pray, stand the fight as one
We tame the storm, we are the martyrs in the light
Take your soul when you run
We are the dark, we are the saints of blood at night
We hear the call, when the moon shines red
We grab your body, in the morning all we are
Satisfied when you are dead

We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red
We drink your blood
And we open your veins

We drink, we drink, we drink your blood
Kyrie eleison
We drink, we drink, we drink your blood
Kyrie eleison

We drink your blood, we drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red (We drink your blood)
We drink your blood
And we call the sanguine saints (We drink your blood)
We drink your blood
When the midnight sky is red (We drink your blood)
We drink your blood
And we open your veins (We drink your blood)
