		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
I don't believe in destiny
I just do what's best for me
Don't listen to my enemies
They're just full of jealousy

(Yeah)
This legacy
You gon' see what's left of me
You gon' see success in me
You ain't seen the rest of me

I just wanna be the best at what I know
Better than the rest just watch me grow
Put me to the test and watch me go
This is my quest I'ma make it known

They call me obsessive oh I know
Call me selective with my notes
Call me aggressive with my flow
Call me offensive even though

Yo I ain't gonna lie life's tough
Try to get by lifes rough
Try to do right it's not enough
Even though you try still mess up

But I'm still gonna fight for what I love
Still gonna die for what I love
Still gonna try I won't give up
Still gonna fight until I've won

They say I'm way too obsessed
And I've got nothing left
And I'm not quite there yet
But those words they'll regret

'Cause I've got something left
And I'm not giving in
I will not let them win
I won't stop 'til the end no

I've been through some injuries
Mentally and physically
Studied them religiously
So I don't repeat history

And people won't admit to me
They don't want a victory
Bad enough to get it see
They'd rather just go leave it be

And oh
This journey
I've been on since thirteen
Working hard and learning
Never stopping searching
(Yeah)
It's burning
All this passion hurts me
I took action working
Writing down these words see

No I'm not okay
I just want to be something
I don't wanna be nothing
Living all alone

No I'm not alright
I'm just barely getting by
But I'll tell you I'm just fine
So you leave me alone

They say I'm way too obsessed
And I've got nothing left
And I'm not quite there yet
But those words they'll regret

'Cause I've got something left
And I'm not giving in
I will not let them win
I won't stop 'til the end no
