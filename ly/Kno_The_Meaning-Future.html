		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying?
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a kingpin you hear me

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

We dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, "They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one"
We going back in as soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him in custody, they took my life away

People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode

I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggy's
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody smoke one or pour with me
Niggas rocked the lean, man, when I was OT
And I'm still dealing with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger
I got so much love for my niggas
Brown paper bag, we getting back to the paper
Getting back to the basics
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hating, I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick laying on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doing some real life porno

And I ain't worried 'bout nothing in the world, keep that badass bitch
These niggas ain't none of my worries, damn that shit
There's so much more I gotta endure
I just had my baby, gotta go on tour (fuck that shit)

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
Get back in the studio, give them what they was missing
They didn't know I knew the game and I know how to reinvent it
They ain't know me in the projects, they just know me from rhyming
My hard work finally catching up with perfect timing

You know what I'm saying
I could take a hundred dollar slab
And goddamn make three hundred off that bitch, you dig?

Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
I skipped class to smoke weed
Hidin' from the police
I spent time overseas, hangin' out in England
And I got the squad on my mind and I mean this
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meanin'

Everything in the streets
It prepared me for everything that I'm going through right now
The good and the bad, you know what I'm saying?
Can't let none of this shit get to me
I go harder 'cause I know where I was at
And I know where I wanna go
