		  Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I ain't tryin' to think about it, no
Yeah, I said it, boy, get up inside it, uh
I want you to homicide it
Go in slow, but I want you to pipe it, uh
And I think I kinda like ya
Up against the wall, we don't need a title, uh

Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it 
Man, fuck a title, uh

Boy I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close now
Take it home on your camera phone
Get a little bad, nigga, watch me blow it down

Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it (ooh, yeah)
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it (ooh)

You could be rough, boy, but you won't
Give me some love, boy, give it to me 'til the morn'

Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
Yeah, I said it uh
Yeah, I said it
Yeah, I said it, babe
