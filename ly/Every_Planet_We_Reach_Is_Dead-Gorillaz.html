		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost my leg like I lost my way
So no loose ends
Nothing to see me down
How are we going to work this out

Dreams aren't bad, I had turned back
I love the girl
But God only knows it's
Getting hard to see the sun coming through
I love you
But what are we going to do

Picture on the dreamer
I'll take you deeper
Down to the sleepy glow
Time is a low
Don't you know
What are we going to do

When you go back
All the second selfless days
You're in love with him
I want to see you again
I love you
But what are we going to do
