		<p>
		  We gon' start this shit off right (off right)
We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right (off right)
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

We gon' start this shit off right (off right)
We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right (off right)
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Bitches outside, them some sad ass bitches
Leggo, leggo, leggo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Bitches outside, them some sad ass bitches
Leggo, leggo, leggo
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Ashanti)

I fucked around and made a bunch of fuck around money
Now I feel like found money
I'm fuckin awesome, 'til awesome have a child for me
Got homies who ain't comin' home 'til the cows coming
Niggas with power, they tryna press our power buttons
Now baby make that ass clap
Like it's proud of me
She said "I will" like ill with an apostrophe
It's lil' Tunechi, word around on the streets
Now everything is workin' out like obliques
They wanna see it obese
You drive me crazy, you gon' crash the 'vert
Get out my business, why you act like a clerk
I got a white girl, she call me names like bastard and jerk
That's when I send her ass back to the 'burbs
Fucked her right, good night, die with 'em open
I'm with a big booty bitch dressed inappropriate
Cocaine, baking soda and some hot water
Kept the feinds comin' back to me not karma
Smiled at my first kilo like a proud father
Smiled at my first judge like, "I'll be out tomorrow"
Keep the Glock on 'em
All eyes on me, I had a Pac moment
This a Mannie Fresh beat and I go Pac on it
My homeboys proud of me like Barack homies
Your homeboys tired of me, I hope they die yawnin'
Leave ya house haunted
I ain't kiddin' I ain't playin', fuck up your house party
Lil Tunechi

So DJ, won't you play some more songs?
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go but home
Yeah, we ain't got nowhere to go but wrong
Whoa, whoa-oh-oh-oh
So DJ, won't you play some more songs?
'Cause we ain't got nowhere to go but home
Yeah, we ain't got no way to go wrong (got you 'Shanti)

Just a watch and a mink coat
Wherever I spit at, a tree grow
I'm a Blood with some c-notes
And I'm gettin' more checks than a peephole
I dun' been through hell and back on a steamboat
Met the devil, came back feelin' frio
Gangbanging, tatted up like Latinos
And since I'm on my Spanish shit, it's Carter Cinco
Mami is bionic and bisexual, bilingual
Mami is a goddess but she gotta let her wings show
Mami tryna fuck me with her team, that's a team sport
All these bad bitches in this bitch but I ain't seen yours
Muscle car look like I just got out the bing, whoa
Drop the top, smell like I just opened a weed store
A nice beat mixed with Tunechi like a cream float
With Mannie Fresh the OG, now it's a G.O.
Got the squad in this bitch case it pop off
Fresh, can you please tell these niggas I've been rich since the Hot Boys
Bad ass dog by the screen door
Your girl walking 'round my house
Wearing nothing but my watch and my mink coat, yeah
Now everybody throw a five, throw a five, Carter Cinco
And since I'm on my Spanish shit, them other boys finito

We gon' start this shit off right
We got bad ass bitches in the house tonight
We gon' start this shit off right
We got some bad ass bitches in the house tonight

We got some bad ass bitches, bad ass bitches
Bitches outside, them some sad ass bitches
Leggo, yeah, leggo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
In the restroom, in the mirror takin' pictures
All right, yeah, that's alright, yeah, that's alright
Yeah, that's alright, yeah

We got some bad ass bitches, some bad ass bitches
Couple niggas trippin', mean muggin' makin' fistses
It's alright, it's alright
Hope we don't fight, no
Welcome
