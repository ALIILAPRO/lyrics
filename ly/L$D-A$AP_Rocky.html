		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system pumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduce her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love (yeah)
My tongue at a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been gettin' high 'cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinkin', drivin', now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

Feelin' low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feelin' low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

It started in Hollywood (duh, duh-duh)
Dreamin' of sharin' love (duh, duh-duh)
My tongue had a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all

I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
