Get em (Get em Good)

Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)

Get em ( uh) get em (yea)
Get em (that’s how I, get em)
I’m on yo head now
I did not come here to play around
Oh no you scared now
U wil not make it home safe and sound
Let’s make it clear now
I do this shit, I make u scream and shout
And yea I’m here now, taking ya bringing down the house
I done came along
You just came from gettin off ya couch
Bring the gang along, if u trip then we turning it out
It’s the same ole song, and I see the same thots when I’m out
But don’t take me wrong, we just tryna make it get some clout
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em
Get em ( uh) get em (yea)
Get em (that’s how I, get em)
I’m on yo head now
I did not come here to play around
Oh no you scared now
U wil not make it home safe and sound
Let’s make it clear now
I do this shit, I make u scream and shout
And yea I’m here now, taking ya bringing down the house

Hope you ready for it
taking what I want, I want it now
Run it steady Forrest,
From the north, and take it to the south
Them hoes really boring
quick with action, is what I’m about
And you can’t ignore it
That’s facts, and without a doubt
I’m on top of this
Wish you could get on top of this
Ima take hood and turn it to a metropolis
Bitch I’m so good
You hoes just talk a lot of shit
He give me that wood
I get it, get it, I got it bitch
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em (Get em Good)
Get em ( uh)get em (yea)
Get em
Get em ( uh) get em (yea)
Get em (that’s how I, get em)
I’m on yo head now
I did not come here to play around
Oh no you scared now
U wil not make it home safe and sound
Let’s make it clear now
I do this shit, I make u scream and shout
And yea I’m here now, taking ya bringing down the house
I’m on bigger things
Pay up all my bills and gimme rings
I’m on bigger schemes
Fuck that scamming, tryna get a V
On that Hennessy
Tryna give a fuck, it can not be
Fuck my enemies
I be on my own shit, let it be
