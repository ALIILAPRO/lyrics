		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The demons are here
The burning's begun
The run of our time
The sanctums, they'll burn

You'll face your time, your death
The burning of haloes

You said
You said you'd never come back here again
I've changed me
All of me

I believe I'll die once I see you here
I believe I'll die once the scar opens again
I believe I'll die once I see you here
I believe I'll fight it again to watch you leave

You'll face your time, your death
The burning of haloes

The price we pay
Through the eyes and the mind of a broken man
It's here to stay
Confined in all

The birth, the growth, the life
The shadows uprising
I've lived through the eyes of a man
In search of the bright light

I will live once I am free
The soul travels lightly across the plains
The golden star in sky embrace your heart

I believe I'll die once I see you here
I believe I'll die once the scar opens again
I believe I'll die once I see you here
I believe I'll fight it again to watch you leave

You'll face, your time, yourself
In this world of all chaos
