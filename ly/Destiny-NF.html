		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
Fulfillin' my destiny, yeah
I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny, yeah

I told y'all I'm a psycho
Ain't no tellin' what I might do, yeah
Doubt put his hands around my throat, so I cut 'em off
That's what you get for steppin' on my toes
At the top of the key, that's an iso
My career about to take off, flight mode
You don't like where we're headed, what you sittin' on my flight for, huh?
Yeah, they said, "Wait until your time comes"
Nope! Time's up
You put in the album, got you thinkin' it's your birthday, woo!
Yeah, I'm full of surprises
A lot of pressure on the records and you know I'm makin' diamonds
Tell me, how would you define this?
You witnessin' the finest
Yeah, you never know what you can do until you try it
I been workin' late nights like I'm Letterman
He ain't workin' anymore? Well forget it then
Somebody get the sedatives
Too late, yeah the lightbulb's off in my head again
Where is Edison for my adrenaline
Rushin' through my veins like it's never did
What good is the body, man, if you ain't got the head with it
Since a kid up I've been a pessimist
I like to focus on the negatives, oh Lord!

I talk to God like, "What's next for me?"
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)
Yeah, my pops told me he was proud, I don't think he knew what that meant to me
Yeah, you try to take advantage of me before you die, you'll be dead to me (all day)
Before you die, you'll be dead to me
Laugh when they question me, y'all ain't no threat to me, yeah

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny

Yeah, you know I keep it real honest
Real topics, ain't no way I will stop it
Chills watching everything that's going on around me, they wonder if I still got it
I'm still rhymin', just another day in paradise, Phil Collins
'Til you put your hands on me, yeah, now we got a real problem
Pay homage, make comments
We in the same genre, but I can guarantee we don't put out the same product
Get away from me, there ain't nothing you can say to me
Tried to roll my name through the dirt, that's fine, I was made from it
You ain't made it 'til they printin' shirts with your face on it
Outside tryna sell 'em at your shows, those are fake, dummy
This is something can't nobody ever take from me
No mistakin' me, take a blade to me, take a vein from me
Let me know what you get when you pull the DNA from me, woo!
No matches, I've been the baddest, no way to match it
You never seen the passion that's even half this
I'm wreakin' havoc
I think the fact that you think I'm average is kinda madness
So quit your naggin', you couldn't fathom what I've imagined
Forget the mansion, I'm in the attic
It's pretty graphic, but had to happen
You won't see it, get your glasses, forget the status

Yeah, I feel like we might be on the come up (all day)
Knew I was a problem how I showed up
Did not have to sell out, but the show does (all day)
They ask me why I do it, so I told 'em (yeah)

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny

I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
I'm just fulfillin' my destiny (all day)
To the death of me, I'm just fulfillin' my destiny
