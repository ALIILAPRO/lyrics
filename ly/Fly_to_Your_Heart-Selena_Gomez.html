		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch all the flowers
Dance with the wind
Listen to snowflakes
Whisper your name

Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams 
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings
Fly to your heart

Touch every rainbow
Painting the sky
Look at the magic
Glide through your life

A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night
You can fly

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star
When you believe you'll find your wings, fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly, you can fly to your heart

Rise to the heights of all you can be
Soar on the hope of marvelous things

Fly to who you are
Climb upon your star 
When you believe you'll find your wings 
Fly

Everywhere you go
Your soul will find a home
You'll be free to spread your wings
Fly, you can fly to your heart
