		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a lighthouse in a storm
From the day that you were born
A promise
Father to a son
Your mother said it best
We will be put to a test
A promise
Father to a son

Is there anything I can do
A wisdom where your heart is heading to
A place you want more than I can give
Father to a son

Well I made a few mistakes
But I'll never break your heart
A promise
Father to a son
I never knew a love
Could be scarier than anger
A promise
Father to a son

Is there anything I can do
A wisdom where your heart is heading to
A place you want more than I can give
Father to a son

Is there anything I can do
A wisdom where your heart is heading to
A place you want more than I can give
Father to a son
Father to a son
