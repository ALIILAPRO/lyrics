		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-oh
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-oh
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-oh (say it ain't so, say it ain't so) 
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (say it ain't so, say it ain't so) 
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-oh (say it ain't so, say it ain't so) 
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge (say it ain't so, say it ain't so) 
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)

Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
