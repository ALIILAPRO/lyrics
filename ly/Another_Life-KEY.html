		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Levels, levels
Fighting battles
I want you back in my life

Shadows, shadows
Hollow, hollow
Light's fading fast, so fast

Show me what you want on the reply
Tell me how you feel make it deep babe
Tonight
Oh, tonight yeah

If you need my love say you want that
Hit the pedal and drive we can backtrack
Don't stop
Just give your all 

Like rockets we will blaze up to the outer-space
Until we reach the roof, hey, what we gotta lose?
See we're gliding now high above the ground
Lift off, past the moon

Leave all the madness
And let go
To another life (another life, another life)
To another life (another life, another life)

Up to Atlantis
Let go
To another life (another life, another life)
To another life
And we'll be alright

The air is so shallow
Breathing is matter over my mind
You're on my mind yeah

Fears will not settle
Emotions forever planets we fight
Through the heights yeah

When the bass goes boom
Lighting we flash, opposite moods
But you like it like that in the rumble
With our full love, full speed hit the thunder
Feel the heat (yeah, yeah)
When ya move (yeah, yeah)
From your feet to the groove (through the galaxy we're riding in)

Like rockets we will blaze up to the outer-space
Until we reach the roof, hey, what we gotta lose? (What we gotta lose?)
See we're gliding now high above the ground
Lift off, past the moon

Leave all the madness
And let go
To another life (another life, another life)
To another life (another life, another life)

Up to Atlantis
Let go
To another life (another life, another life)
To another life
And we'll be alright

Oh-oh (meet me), oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)

Oh-oh (meet me), oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)

Many miles to go to reach the stars
Oh, it's linear
I will chase for life to where you are (come on, come on)

Leave all the madness
And let go
To another life (another life, another life)
To another life (another life, another life)

Up to Atlantis
Let go
To another life (another life, another life)
To another life
And we'll be alright

Oh-oh (meet me), oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)

Oh-oh (meet me), oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)
Oh-oh-oh (meet me in another life)
