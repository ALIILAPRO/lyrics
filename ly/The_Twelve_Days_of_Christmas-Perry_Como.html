		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
A partridge in a pear tree

On the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the fourth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the fifth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the sixth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the seventh day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Seven swans a swimmin'
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the eighth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eight maids a milkin'
Seven swans a swimmin'
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the ninth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Nine pipers pipin'
Eight maids a milkin'
Seven swans a swimmin'
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the tenth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Ten ladies dancin'
Nine pipers pipin'
Eight maids a milkin'
Seven swans a swimmin'
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the eleventh day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Eleven Lords a leapin'
Ten ladies dancin'
Nine pipers pipin'
Eight maids a milkin'
Seven swans a swimmin'
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree

On the twelfth day of Christmas
My true love gave to me
Twelve drummers drummin'
Eleven Lords a leapin'
Ten ladies dancin'
Nine pipers pipin'
Eight maids milkin'
Seven swans a swimmin'
Six geese a layin'
Five golden rings
Four calling birds
Three French hens
Two turtle doves
And a partridge in a pear tree
