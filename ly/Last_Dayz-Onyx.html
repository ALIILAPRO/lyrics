		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  South suicide Queens, all niggas
Gather up all your arms
And get ready for this New World Order
Shit is about to change, motherfucker

I'm Miss America's nightmare
Young, black and just don't give a fuck
I just wanna get high and live it up
So fuck a 9 to 5 and whitey tryin' to slave us (fuck them)
With minimum wages, slamming my niggas up in cages
Changin' their behavior to spitting razors, that's outrageous
Smoking roaches is hopeless, we want lazy sofas and sculptures
Lady chauffeurs who fuck us, full house and royal flushes
Roll with the rush, it's that Afficial Nast
Got bitches with pistols and cash, we living in the last
My theory is, "Fuck it", sexy niggas get abducted
My corrupted is conducted, through ghettos, sipping Amaretto
Hand on the metal, foot on the pedal (never settle)
He wore Carolina Herrera, dirty Donna Karan sweaters (yeah)
Ralph Lauren leathers and suedes
Gold plated guns and grenades
To blow up, I got news from the informers
I'm trapped in corners, busting shots at Time-Warner's (ayy, yo)

My man Big Ty, he know how to get by
Get high, do a jix, then be fixed to be fly (uh-huh)
Some mid, cross and up and downtown action
And when he stick he keep a grip and move with traction
Keep mad alibis, a plan to stay wise and wide-eyed
Living in the state of Southside
Crooked jakes and fakes snake niggas all out for papes
All who wanna over take, you leave 'em with drapes
The white sheet covers, this heat smothers
The street, eat brothers
Six shots rang, duke got banged
We all ready for these wars
We all want more, these the last days (get yours)

Thirty-two shots inserted in Glocks, you heard it for blocks
The murderer who gots convertible drops
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of living
Never giving a shit
'Cause we living in it
'Cause it be off the hook
Crooks, crack
Cheeba spots, and selling rocks
The cops around the clock
It's hot
Livin' life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never giving a shit
'Cause we living in it

Thinkin about takin' my own life
I might as well, 'cept they might not sell weed in Hell
And that's where I'm goin' 'cause the Devil's inside of me
He make me rob from my own nationality
That's kind of ignorant, but, yo, I gotta pay the rent
So yeah, I'll stick a nigga most definite
A degenerate, if I get caught I'm innocent
'Cause I don't leave no sticky fingerprints
For the cops, they only good if they dead
And all that badge and the gun shit be goin' to their head (word)
To make bread, I gotta steal for sport
So I stole the show and made some pennies for my thoughts
And if this fucking rap shit don't pay
I'ma start selling drugs around my way (uh)
Killing my own people in the USG
Shit, they gonna get it from somebody, I'd rather it be me (ayy)
Besides, they can't tax dirty money
And you can't trust nobody (nobody)
No one (no one), I'm a scorpion
And I'll probably bite the bullet 'cause I live by the gun (what?)

Big heavy hitters, twnety-five to life bidders 
Who just came out and pullin' flame out
Take aim
Blow your brains out
It's life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never giving a shit
'Cause we living in it
In South suicide Queens where niggas act up
Nigga back up
Afficial Nast throw your fucking gats up
It's life on the edge, a dangerous way of livin'
Never giving a shit
'Cause we living in it
We never giving a shit
'Cause we living in it
Afficial Nast motherfuckers don't give a shit
Word up

I need fours dutches, sun seeds
Hurry up, don't take no time (word up, man)
