		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "I'll be back"
"I'll be back" that's what you said
When you left me

I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay but I need some space
And you're in the way

Can you see me?
I'm dancing on my own
Can you hear me?
I'm crying out for help
Is it ignorance?
Or selfishness?
You said stay here
But I'm running out of air
I hope you know
As I wait, I suffocate

I hope you know
I hope you know
The air gets cold
When you don't hold me

The sky turns grey
The sky turns grey
The flowers fade
And blow away

Can you see me?
I'm dancing on my own
Can you hear me?
I'm crying out for help
Is it ignorance?
Or selfishness?
You said stay here
But I'm running out of air
I hope you know
As I wait, I suffocate

Should I chase you down?
Or should I keep waiting?
Should I move on?
Or should I keep waiting?

Can you see me?
(Or should I keep waiting?) I'm dancing on my own
(Should I move on?) Can you hear me?
(Or should I keep waiting?) I'm crying out for help
(Should I chase you down?) Is it ignorance?
Or selfishness?
(Or should I keep waiting?) You said stay here
But I'm running out of air (should I move on?)

I hope you know
As I wait
I suffocate
