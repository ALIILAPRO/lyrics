		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Prime time
Nursery rhyme
Did you see the teacher
Sister
Black and white
What she's gonna to do

They say eye for eye, tooth for tooth
But don't hurt your brother
Cross-road, overload

Oh, I, I testify
They just showed me Mary
She was stoned, stoned, danger zone
There was nothing in her eyes

And then there, there in the air
Nailed to the cross was Jesus
Cross-road, overload

Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray my soul to keep away
From the holy spirit, holy ghost
They're hiding in the dark

Oh, nightmare, electric chair
You might not get to heaven
Bad boys, shout for joy
Watch him to cry

Prime time
Nursery rhyme
Love just needs religion
Cross-road, overload
