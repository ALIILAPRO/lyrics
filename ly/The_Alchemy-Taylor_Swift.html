		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong

So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong

So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to be
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

Shirt's off and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer sticking to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
"There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league"
Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me

Touchdown
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to be
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
