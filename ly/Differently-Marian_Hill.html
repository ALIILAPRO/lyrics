		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this story, I know it well
Know how much you're missing
I can see how far you fell
I know about her
I know she's new
But try to see her from a different point of view
I know you want
I see his face
And I know what you wanna say

Tell me, does she kiss like me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?
Come on, tell me, can she sing like me?
She a king like me?
Are you lost at sea at all?
Tell me, is she there like me?
Do you care that she runs around till 3, do ya?
Tell me, are you missing me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?

–ferently, differently

You say she's basic
That might be true
But you don't know her and she's not concerned with you
It's all about him, he hasn't grown
And we both know that you're so much better on your own
So let him watch you walk away
I never want to hear you say

Tell me, does she kiss like me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?
Come on, tell me, can she sing like me?
She a king like me?
Are you lost at sea at all?
Tell me, is she there like me?
Do you care that she runs around till 3, do ya?
Tell me, are you missing me?
Do you wish that we ended differently?

–ferently, differently
Think about it
–ferently, differently
That we ended
Diff–how we ended
Diff–how we ended
How we ended
Diff–how we ended
Diff–how we ended
How we ended
Differently

So let him watch you walk away
And if he stops you, you can say

I can see you're missing me
And you wish that we ended differently oh
Even if she sings like me, she's a king like me
You'll be lost at sea
I know you were never there for me
And I'm sure she'll see what a fool you'll be
We don't
Even if you're missing me
I don't wish that we ended differently

–ferently
–ferently
–ferently
Differently
Think about it
–ferently
–ferently
–ferently
Differently
That we ended
Diff–how we ended
Diff–how we ended
How we ended
Diff–how we ended
Diff–how we ended
How we ended
Differently
