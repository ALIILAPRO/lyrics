		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you tell me that you love me
I can't help but feel so lucky, I
I'd fall for you 10,000 times again my my
When I talk with you it's easy
Like you somehow really see me, I
I've been looking for you all my life
Your voice calms my head like a beautiful lullaby
Your eyes soothe my mind like the bluest of tides
You hold me down
When no ones around
When someone so lovely
Genuinely loves me
How could I feel down
So take what you need
All I can offer you is all of me
I thought that might not be enough
But you've always said that it was
You're wonderful my love
You wrote a letter for my birthday
Wrote down all the words you had to say
The words on that page need a frame, sincere and kind
You love the parts of me I've broken
You took my chest and tore it open wide
A piece of your heart placed in mine
You hold me down
When no ones around
When someone so lovely
Genuinely loves me
How could I feel down
So take what you need
All I can offer you is all of me
I thought that might not be enough
But you've always said that it was
You're wonderful my love
You're wonderful my love
You hold me down
When no one's around
Your beauty amazing
Like a renaissance painting
You're wonderful my love
You're wonderful my love
