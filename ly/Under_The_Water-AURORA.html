		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the water we can't breathe
We can't breathe under the water we die
Under the water there is no one watching
Under the water we are alone
Then why do we jump in? Why do we jump in?
Under the water we die

So many souls, that lost control
Where did they fall?
Into the deep, what do they seek?
Where did they fall? Where did they fall?

Hearts will dream again
Lungs will breathe in wash away the sins
It's where it begins
Feet won't fail you now
Arms won't let you down wash away the sins

Under the water we can't be together
Under the water we die
Then why do we jump in? Why do we jump in?
Under the water we die

So many souls that lost control
Where did they fall?
Into the deep, what do they seek?
Where did they fall? Where did they fall?

Hearts will dream again
Lungs will breathe in wash away the sins
It's where it begins
Feet won't fail you now
Arms won't let you down wash away the sins
It's where it begins

Hearts will dream again wash away the sins
