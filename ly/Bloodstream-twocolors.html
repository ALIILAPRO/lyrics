		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel it in my bloodstream like we're still in love
It's rushing through my body, I can't get enough

I feel it in my bloodstream like we're still in love
(Like we're still in love, oh, we're still in love)
It's rushing through my body, I can't get enough
(I can't get enough, just can't get enough)

I'm just going through a drug overdose
I can't take it no more
I'm losing faith in the chemicals
Take me high when I'm low

I'm just going through a drug overdose
You got my heart on the floor
Not yours, not yours
I'm still going through withdrawal

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I feel it in my bloodstream like we're still in love
It's rushing through my body, I can't get enough

I feel it in my bloodstream like we're still in love
(Like we're still in love, oh, we're still in love)
It's rushing through my body, I can't get enough
(I can't get enough, just can't get enough)

I'm just going through a drug overdose
I can't take it no more
I'm losing faith in the chemicals
Take me high when I'm low

I'm just going through a drug overdose
You got my heart on the floor
Not yours, not yours
I'm still going through withdrawal

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no

I wish I was getting high
I'm shouting, I feel alive
A feeling that's deep inside
I'm not yours, not yours
I'm still going through withdrawal

No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not yours
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not yours
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not yours, not yours

I'm still going through withdrawals
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not yours
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not yours
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
I'm not yours, not yours

I'm still going through withdrawals
