		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart it melts like plastic
I fell through the hole yesterday
Your smile pulled me in like elastic
I felt my mind detonate

Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's just growing
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains

We broke in two like a matchstick
It burns in my soul every day, every day
Your world was to me, so fantastic
And help seemed so far away, far away

Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's just growing
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
You tell me it's just growing pains
Oh, I've made mistakes
And yes I know, it's growing pains

The truth it feels like concrete
I drove into this wall yesterday
I wish I could be realistic
But my children, my dreams, went away

I know I made mistakes
You say it's growing pains
And when I feel ashamed
You say it's growing pains
And I'm crying out for change
You say it's growing pains
I know I made mistakes
I know it's growing pains

Oh, I've made mistakes
And you just say it's just growing
When I feel ashamed
You tell me it's just growing pains
When I'm crying out for change
And oh, I've made mistakes
And yes I know, it's growing pains
