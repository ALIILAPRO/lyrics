		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're asleep on the couch with Tammy
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried

You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shaking
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it
And you say, "screw you"
I say, "I love you"
And I know it's true

You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now

You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of hope in your eyes
You can't believe it
But you're close to tears
Oh God, I'm sorry for the wasted years

(Not the one I could have been)
You're not the man you should have been (I let you down)
I let you down somehow (not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman now)
But I can be that woman now
