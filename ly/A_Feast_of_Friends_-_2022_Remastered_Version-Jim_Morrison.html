		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain 
South cruel bindings
The servants have the power
Dog-men and their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors
I'm sick of dour faces 
Staring at me from the TV tower

I want roses in my garden bower, dig?
Royal babies, rubies 
Must now replace aborted strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal for the plant that's plowed

They are waiting to take us into the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton 
Thrillful comes death on a strange hour?
Unannounced, unplanned for 
Like a scaring, over-friendly guest you've brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all 
And gives us wings where we had shoulders
Smooth as raven's claws

No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
Until its other jaw reveals incest
And lose obedience to a vegetable law
I will not go
Prefer a feast of friends to the giant family
