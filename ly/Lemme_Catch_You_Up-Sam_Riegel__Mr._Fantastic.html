		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lemme catch you up on the story of a legendary crew...

I stumble upon a want ad cause I needed to pee
The sovereign hires us to kill an unknown enemy
Turns out to be a dragon and he fucks our shit up  
But we eke out a win because we never give up (yeah!)

Vox Machina becomes protectors of the realm
Gets invited to a party at Uriel's
The Briarwoods show up and Percy freaks the fuck out
Cause they slayed his whole damn family and took the crown (what?)  

We follow em to Whitestone and take up Percy's fight
While Pike leaves on a quest to reconnect the Everlight
I learn about the Zippertwat from a book that Vax swiped
But Delilah's dogs take it and we lose our ride

Whitestone is in shambles and the sun tree almost dead
Percy's poppin' off their henchmen with a list on his gat
But smoke keeps pourin' outta him 
Yo, what the fuck is up with that?

We find his sister Cass but she gets her throat cut, we see red
Kiki's lightning reaction Ashari magic saves her ass and
We bust outta there, I need some hot three-way action!
 
Delilah, oh Delilah, decides to raise the dead
We get surrounded on all sides, it's a zombie attack
Pike cuts em down from the sky with a monsta killin' blast
The people are inspired to rise up for their hood
As we race up to the ziggurat to snatch the Briarwoods

Ooh Acid creepin' up to our necks, Cassandra double crossed us
Grog drops trou, takes a swim and saves us all, yes!
At last Kiki harnesses the power of the light
And smokes Sylas Briarwood to dust, goodnight!

Delilah runs inside and tries a magic rite
The Whispered One appears, oh no, the end is nigh!
Percy battles the internal demon, he takes a stand  
And he overcomes the curse but he shoots his own hand

Cassandra stabs Delilah dead 
And vows to the people of Whitestone to be their new head, new head
We return to Emon as hometown heroes, ya know 
Uriel makes a speech and cedes control , No!

As the dragons come for us, what could happen all my people?
It's time to strap onuh, I mean inNo, no, I mean on!
