		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Mic check of the Gods, nigga
Mic check of the Gods
Yeah

The shining
Represents the light that's in the darkness
A diamond
Y'all niggas ain't ready when I drop this
The timin'
Remarkable and in alignment
Anything is possible, I promise

Yo
I admit it, I was gone for a lil' minute
It's like I lost my glow, yo
My inner light was dimmin'
Now I got my mojo back
Joe don't know how to act
About to black out
I never back out
Unless we talkin' bringing gas out
And every show is packed out
We bringin' cats out from South Africa to Glasgow
I guess you could say I got this shit mapped out now
World domination by determination
This is mumble rap extermination
This is Godly interpolation
This is that, "Who ya top 5?" conversation
Type of rap that "Fuck a Grammy nomination"
Type of rap that "I'ma take 'em to my basement"
Bring it back 'cause when they come to leavin' mic's ablazin'
I'm adjacent to that nigga Satan
That ain't for debating
No more time for wasting
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The shining
Represents the light that's in the darkness
A diamond
Y'all niggas ain't ready when I drop this
The timing
Remarkable and in alignment
Anything is possible, I promise

Unstoppable if it's divinely guided
I'm like Mahatma Gandhi meets Muhammad Ali
Trapped in a rapper's body
Another old soul, in every lifetime you find me
My angels who surround me
Niggas was frontin' now they all behind me
Funny story how I beat the odds so oddly
Funny how I dropped all these bombs so calmly
Funny how I never found this shit, it just found me
It just, yeah, yeah
The shining

(Something's gonna happen in your life
That is going to affect everybody's life)
For the good)

The shining
Represents the light that's in the darkness
A diamond
Y'all niggas ain't ready when I drop this
The timing
Remarkable and in alignment
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
