		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?

Girl I really like your style
I really, really like your vibe
Can I see you tonight?
I wanna be in your arms all night
Said I wanna be in your arms all night

Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?
Can I see you tonight?

Can I see you
Tomorrow, tomorrow?

I want to be your friend
I want to be more than that
I wanna sleep next to you every night
I wanna wake up with you by my side
Every day and every night

Will you love me tomorrow?
Tomorrow, tomorrow
