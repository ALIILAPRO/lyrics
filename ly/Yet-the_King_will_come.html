		  God
Don't give up on me yet

I know I'm not your best bet
But I'm trying
So don't give up on me yet

And God (God, God)
Don't leave me here alone
I know I need to grow, still
And I'm trying
Don't leave me here alone

I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So, don't give up on me yet

God (God, God)
I know it makes no sense

You love me time and time again
But I still need reminding
Yeah, I know it makes no sense

I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So, don't give up on me yet

(Don't give up on me)
(Don't give up on me)
(Don't give up on me)

(Don't give up-) don't give up on me
Don't give up (give up on me)
Don't give up on me (don't give up)
(Don't give up on me)
Don't give up on me (don't give up)
(Don't give up) don't give up on me
(Don't give up) don't give up on me

God
I know I'm not the same
But you knew that I would change
And I think that you're trying
To tell me it's okay
I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But, I wanna believe it
So don't give up on me yet

Don't give up on me yet
Don't give up on me
