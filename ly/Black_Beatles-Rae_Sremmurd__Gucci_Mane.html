		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black Beatles in the city, be back immediately
To confiscate the moneys (EarDrummers)
Rae Sremm, Guwop, Mike WiLL
I sent flowers, but you said you didn't receive 'em
But you said you didn't need them (Mike Will Made It)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (they know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (let it go)
Smoke in the air (hey), binge drinkin' (ah)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (then they lose it)

Gettin' so gone, I'm not blinkin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
New day, new money to be made
There is nothing to explain
I'm a fuckin black Beatle, cream seats in the Regal
Rockin' John Lennon lenses, like to see 'em spread eagle
Took a bitch to the club and let her party on the table
Screamin', "Everybody's famous"
Like clockwork, I blow it all
And get some more
Get you somebody that can do both
Black Beatles got the babes belly rolling
She think she love me
I think she trollin'

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (they know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (let it go)
Smoke in the air (hey), binge drinkin' (ah)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (then they lose it)

Came in with two girls, look like strippers in their real clothes
A broke hoe can only point me to a rich hoe
A yellow bitch with green hair, a real weirdo
Black man, yellow Lamb', red light, go (catch up)
They say that Guwop and them just came in through the side door (huh)
There's so much money on the floor, we buyin' school clothes (yeah)
Why you bring the money machine to the club for?
And a pint of lean, pound of weed, and a kilo (skrrt)
I Euro-step past a hater like I'm Rondo (wow)
I upgrade your baby mama to a condo (wow)
Like Chapo servin' yayo to the gringos
Black Beatle, club close when I say so

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (they know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (let it go)
Smoke in the air (hey), binge drinkin' (ah)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (then they lose it)

She's a good teaser, and we blowin' reefer
Your body like a work of art, baby
Don't fuck with me, I'll break your heart, baby
D&G on me, I got a lot of flavor
15 hundred on my feet, I'm tryna kill these haters
I had haters when I was broke, I'm rich, I still got haters
I had hoes when I was broke, I'm rich, I'm still a player
I wear leather Gucci jackets like its still the '80s
I've been blowin' OG Kush, I feel a lil' sedated
I can't worry 'bout a broke nigga or a hater
Black Beatle, bitch, me and Paul McCartney related (yeah)

That girl is a real crowd pleaser (oh, yeah)
Small world, all her friends know of me (they know me)
Young bull livin' like an old geezer (ah)
Quick-release the cash, watch it fall slowly (slowly)
Frat girls still tryna get even (tryna get even)
Haters mad for whatever reason (let it go)
Smoke in the air (hey), binge drinkin' (ah)
They lose it when the DJ drops the needle (then they lose it)
