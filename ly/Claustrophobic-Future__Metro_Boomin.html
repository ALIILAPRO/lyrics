		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All that other shit is garbage, that's what I mean, son
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Like, get the fuck out of here, son
Shit is wack, son
Cut it out, please
Nobody's buyin' it, nobody likes it
You be hurtin' our ears, that shit is annoyin'
Like, stop it, man
Just 'cause niggas got a chain, some jewelry 
And they dress like the motherfuckin' part 
They wanna be the rappers and shit
Like, cut it out
We the professionals, son
We professionals at what we do, like, cut it out
Yeah

Had to buy another mansion, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went and bought a bigger Maybach, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went back extended Phantom, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Make sure that 'Rari a drop 'cause I get claustrophobic
Had to buy another mansion, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went and bought a bigger Maybach, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went back extended Phantom, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Make sure that 'Rari a drop 'cause I get claustrophobic

Sittin' inside the hybrid, lookin' like a pirate
Fresher than your stylist, fresher than a stylist
Presidential Rolex, niggas big timin'
Eighty-five pointers, Ochocinco diamonds
Million-dollar Phantom, I won't even drive it
Chauffeur, Louis Vuitton loafers when I'm slidin'
Digital, niggas never visual
Residuals, rackies comin' plentiful
Ice on my sleeve, got it out that mud
Transportin' cheese, we sellin' drugs
Tractor-trailer pull up on my way to re-up
I know when you stay down, that's the way you T up
European stylin', I go from the feet up
Every time we meet up, it's been gettin' bigger
Every Presidentials, I got my credentials
Cobra deadly venom, push a button and send 'em
Raised around these sinners, now we gang members
Copped a big bazooka for my main hitter

Had to buy another mansion, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went and bought a bigger Maybach, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went back extended Phantom, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Make sure that 'Rari a drop 'cause I get claustrophobic
Had to buy another mansion, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went and bought a bigger Maybach, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went back extended Phantom, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Make sure that 'Rari a drop 'cause I get claustrophobic

Atlanta to Skyami, goin' back to Cali'
Snakes and deadly venom, bitch, I'm super slatty
Work out in the snow, Rocky Balboa
Pull up 'Ventador, look like Chapo
Servin' Kurtis Blow, I got dirty snow
Parked outside the store, ten trucks in a row
Pocket full of bread, sittin' inside the Rolls
I been on a roll, over a billion sold
Only one was chose, I secured my goals
Cookin' so much coke, I need another stove
Made myself a plug, I can move a load
Took it from lil' Mexico across the globe

Had to buy another mansion, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went and bought a bigger Maybach, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went back extended Phantom, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Make sure that 'Rari a drop 'cause I get claustrophobic
Had to buy another mansion, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went and bought a bigger Maybach, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Went back extended Phantom, I'm gettin' claustrophobic
Make sure that 'Rari a drop 'cause I get claustrophobic

Stop it, man
You know what I mean? Do somethin' else 
Stop tryna do what everybody else doin', you know?
You know? 'Cause I know that's what's goin' on
'Cause these niggas ain't supposed to be rappin'
I mean, who really like these niggas?
