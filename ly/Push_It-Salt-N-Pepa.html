		  Ah, push it
Ah, push it

(Hit it)

Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby
Ba-baby, baby (get up on this)

Ah, push it
Ah, push it
Ah, push it (hey, get up on this)
Ah, push it

(Get up on this)
Ow baby
Salt and Pepa's here
Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt and Pepa's here
Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt, Salt and Pepa's here
Salt and Pep-, Salt and Pep-, Salt and Pepa's here
Salt, Salt, Salt 
Salt and Pepa's here

Now, now, now, wait a minute, y'all
This dance ain't for everybody
Only the sexy people
So all you fly mothers
Get on out there and dance
Dance, I said!

Salt and Pepa's here, and we're in effect
Want you to push it, babe
Coolin' by day then at night working up a sweat
Come on girls, let's go show the guys that we know
How to become number one in a hot party show
Now push it

Ah, push it
Push it good
Ah, push it
Push it real good
Ah, push it
Push it good
Ah, push it
P-push it real good

Hey
Ow
Push it good

Ooh, baby, baby
Baby, baby
Ooh, baby, baby
Ba-baby, baby

Push it good
Push it real good
Ah, push it
Ah, push it

Yo, yo, yo, yo, baby-pop
Yeah, you come here, gimme a kiss
Better make it fast or else I'm gonna get pissed
Can't you hear the music's pumpin' hard like I wish you would?
Now push it

Push it good
Push it real good
Push it good
P-push it real good

Ah, push it
Get up on this (uh)
Get up on this (uh, uh, uh)
Get up on this (hey)
Get up on this (hit it)

Boy, you really got me going
You got me so 
I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it
Ah, push it

Boy, you really got me going
You got me so 
I don't know what I'm doing
Ah, push it
Ah, push it

Ah
Ah, push it
Push-push-push it, push it
Push it, Push-push-push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it
Push it, push it
Push it, push it, push it
