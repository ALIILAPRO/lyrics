		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One missed spark and just like that
The world goes up in flames so fast
And all I want is all I had
But it's too late to take it back

And I can't ask of you to give away the last of you
But selfishly I'm hoping that you stay

Let's lock all the doors and crawl in to bed
Just another moment so I don't forget
'Cause it's gonna hurt and I'm scared to death
We have to go but I don't wanna leave just yet

The truth is written on the walls
But we'll lay here and watch them fall
And please, forgive me for holding on
I'm tryna to take it in before you're gone

And I can't ask of you to give away the last of you
But selfishly I'm hoping that you stay

Let's lock all the doors and crawl in to bed
Just another moment so I don't forget
'Cause it's gonna hurt and I'm scared to death
We have to go but I don't wanna leave just yet

I don't wanna leave just yet
No, oh, ohh-oh-ohh

If we don't have forever, just get me tonight

Let's lock all the doors and crawl in to bed
Just another moment so I don't forget
'Cause it's gonna hurt and I'm scared to death
We have to go but I don't wanna leave just yet
