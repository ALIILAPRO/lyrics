		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Ooh, you are baby
Ooh

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman
More than a woman to me

Ooh, you are, baby
Ooh

More than a woman, oh
Oh
Ohh, my baby

Ohh, oh
Ohh, oh

Here in your arms I found my paradise (ohh)
My only chance for happiness
And if I lose you now, I think I would die
Oh, say you'll always be my baby, we can make it shine
We can take forever, just a minute at a time, ohh

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (ohh, oh)
More than a woman to me

(Ohh, oh) ohh

More than a woman
More than a woman to me
More than a woman (more than a woman, ohh)
More than a woman to me (oh)

More than a woman (ohh, my baby)
More than a woman to me (baby, baby, baby, baby)
More than a woman
More than a woman to me (oh, oh, ohh)

More than a woman (ohh, ohh)
More than a woman to me (ohh, ohh, oh)
More than a woman (oh, baby)
More than a woman to me
