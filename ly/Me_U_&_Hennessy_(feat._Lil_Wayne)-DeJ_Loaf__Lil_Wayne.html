		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we stay home tonight? (Can we stay home tonight?)
Try something new tonight
This drink got me feeling right
I'm 'bout to lose my mind

You, me and Hennessy look what you did to me
Fuckin' so crazy, you twirling and spinning me
My head keep on spinning
My legs on keep on shaking
But my head keep on spinning
I'm out of mind, let's keep on sipping
Let's make some babies and make it official
I feel you inside, no better feeling
I throw it back again, you catch my drifting
You shifting inside, you got me screaming
You got me yelling out yo name ooh I need you
You kiss on my thighs and then you eat it
Pause for a minute then, I let you beat it
I'm loving this ride, smooth like a Beamer
Smooth like that Henny
This what happens when we drinking
I'm not gonna lie, you got me speechless
Got 69, more than 25 reasons

Me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you

You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me (thank you)
I say my head keep on spinning
Me, Hennessy and you

It's just me and Hennessy and you
Some fast food
'Bout to act a damn fool in your brand new
Your brand new (Mula!)

Can we stay home tonight?
Try something new tonight?
Don't wear your thong tonight
No Trojan on tonight
Oh Lord I usually don't do this
But I'm a go and get the quarter goin'
Ignore the phone and the car alarm
Hold up, I'm 'bout to cum, no, false alarm
Makeup off, no weave, glasses off
Codeine, Adderall, that's a pussy marathon
Girl you don't love me, you just love my doggystyle
Put this dick up in your mouth while you're talkin'
Like what you talkin' 'bout?
Yeah 'cause you've been talkin', no more talkin'
While I make us a drink, and I don't drink
So when you're not lookin'
I pour some out in the sink
Babe, I guess chemistry is true
But I don't know if it's the Hennessy or you
I heard you eat pussy too and I'm feelin' that
I hope your girlfriend feelin' me too
I'ma fuck her real good right next to you
Then look at you like it's finna be you
Me, Hennessy and you, and you

Couple candles
No TV's reporting bad news
It's just me, Hennessy and you
Some fast food
And you gon' act a damn fool on this good wood
This bamboo
MULA!

You, me and Hennessy, look what you did to me (thank you)
I say my head keep on spinning
Me, Hennessy and you

Ay, this what happens when we drinking
Me, Hennessy and you
Me, Hennessy and you
