		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiere ser dueño de todo (uh)
No me deja en paz con ese cabrón
Lo nuestro es cabrón (pop that, pop that)
Uno para el otro y borracho' los dos (uh)
Si quieres conmigo, pierde ese control
Ese control (pop that, pop that)

Bitch, this Tamagotchi
Tour bus through Milwaukee
Bitch, I'm making bread (bread)
Sound like Pavarotti (pop that, pop that)
Bitch, my vaseline (seline)
You can't get it off me (off me)
Bitch, this not my scene (scene)
Vamos pa' Miami (pa' Miami) (pop that, pop that)

Feel on my waistline
I'm in L.A, four hours away, just hit me on facetime (facetime)
Feeling so good (feeling so good) singing a bass line (bass line)
Your body is on me, you touching up on me
We come at the same time (same time)
At the same time

You with somebody, or are you cool?
I want your body, you want me too (pop that, pop that)
I see you coming, I come for you
Need you around me, I know you do

Ando de gira y todos me siguen, los chicos me quieren tocar (wooh)
Tengo dinero y ando soltero, dime lo que quiere' comprar (pop that, pop that)
Aquí está muy frío, no' vamos, te sigo, ¿dónde quieres ir a volar? 
Algo sencillo, con un cigarrillo me dice que quiere follar (pop that, pop that)

Bitch, this Tamagotchi

You can't get it off me (off me)
Bitch, this not my scene (scene)
Vamos pa' Miami (pa' Miami) (pop that, pop that)

Feel on my waistline

I want your body, you want me too (pop that, pop that)
I see you coming, I come for you
Need you around me, I know you do

This is what you want, I'm sure
I ain't tryna front, no more (pop that, pop that, don't stop)
Ain't seen you in months, or more
You're all that I want, for sure (pop that, pop that)
This is what you want, I'm sure
I ain't tryna front, no more (tired of being alone, tired of being alone)
Ain't seen you in months, or more
You're all that I want, for sure (pop that, pop that, don't stop)

Bitch, this Tamagotchi
Tour bus through Milwaukee
Bitch, I'm making bread (bread)
Sound like Pavarotti
Bitch, my bag Céline (Céline)
You can't get it off me (off me)
Bitch, this not my scene (scene)
Vamos pa' Miami (Miami)

(Pop that, pop that, don't stop)
(Pop that, pop that)
