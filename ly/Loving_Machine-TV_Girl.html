		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here she comes, walking down the street
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine
In the place where I used to be
He almost looks like a human being
And here she comes walking down the street
Maddie Klein sure loves her little loving machine
Sometimes he holds her hand too tight
Ooh, but that's alright

'Cause he'll never leave
No, he'll never leave
Will he ever pull her hair like she likes?
No, but that's alright
Maddie Klein and her fabulous loving machine

And there they go, walking up the street
She'll take him home, shut him down, and she'll go to sleep
And that's just the way that it's got to be
She can't get him wet, or he'll overheat
And who really cares about a little rust
If Maddie Klein's got herself a little boy she can trust?
Sometimes she misses the flesh and bone
But they only wanna screw her and leave her alone

But he'll never leave 
No, he'll never leave
Will he ever smack her ass like she likes?
Will he ever make her laugh late at night?
No, but he'll never leave
When he gets obsolete
She can always just throw him away
And get a new one, but that's okay
She'll love him the same
As her fabulous loving machine
