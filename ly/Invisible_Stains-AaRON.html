		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember the bulwark, the southern sun
The sky we owned from the rooftops
And your smile
I remember the fish market, the sandy roads
Drift nuts in the harbor
And your eyes

Invisible stains of the heart carry me home
It's now that I have lost all what I had
That I care for it

I remember the last embrace, the shirt you wore
The feeling of loosing war (easy)
I remember hidden bruises, the rag and bones 
The red wall maze, the snake charmer 
That would gaze at these lies

Invisible stains of the heart will carry you home
No matter how far I think I have walked
There is always a room for your bones
Invisible stains of the heart will carry you home
In each of my walks I am holding
The ghost of your hand

I remember 
Southern breeze (easy)
I remember

Invisible stains of the heart will carry you home
In each of my walks I am holding
The ghost of your hand
Invisible stains of the heart will carry you home
It's only when you lose what you own
That you start caring for it
