		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No more complains
And tears, they won't help
They won't return
Your pet from the dead
The time has come
To get her far away
There is a price
Everyone is gotta pay

Your

Cat

Your cat is dead
Try to accept that fact
Your cat is dead
She'll meet her mom and dad
Your cat is dead
She was your only friend
Your cat is dead
Fuck, this is very sad


There was no pain
It happened very fast
She was asleep
And she never guessed
You cry, you think
That this is just a joke
But no she's dead
It's time to buy a dog

Your

Your cat is dead
Try to accept that fact
Your cat is dead
She'll meet her mom and dad
Your cat is dead
She was your only friend
Your cat is dead
Fuck, this is very sad
