		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time I think I've made it past the gate
I'm back again, no
Must surrender to my fate
There's no way out and no way in, no

Running blindly
Calling for the light
But it can't find me
I'm too deep inside

Now the fog is closing in
Voices empty echo in the dark
The dark

Creeping shadows following
I shout but no one's listening at all

Lost inside the maze again... 
Every time I think I've made it to your heart
I'm out again, no
Endlessly I fall apart
And there's no escaping it

Running blindly
Calling for the light
But it can't find me
I'm too deep inside

Now the fog is closing in
Voices empty echo in the dark
The dark

Creeping shadows following
I shout but no one's listening at all

Lost inside the maze again... 
Lost inside the maze again... 
Lost inside the maze again...
