		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah
Hangin' on
Here I go

You see the two black birds flying
Flying high just to be together
When we face the music
It might help you to the other side of a great divide
Fly together
So I've asked the grand master why
Asked him why life feels so hard sometimes
You got to use the music, sweet soul music
To reignite your soul divine, to reignite your soul

'cause life is more
More than a love song, it's more than a fantasy
More than a little bit
This life is more
More than a dream ya'll, it's more than a fantasy
More than a little bit
So take your time, and realize, and fly

I hear the two blues birds sing that song
Dee-dee-diddly, dee-dee-diddly, yeah
My respects to the grand master for the lines
Such a pretty thing, how the melody abides

But life is more
More than love song, it's more than a fantasy
More than a little bit
This life is more
More than a dream ya'll, it's more than a fantasy
More than a little bit
This life is more
More than a love song, it's more than a fantasy
More than a little bit
And I'm through the door now (more than a dream ya'll)
See the sun shining (it's more than a fantasy)
More than a little bit

I'm through the door (fly high)
We know life is more (fly high)
More than pretty things (fly high)
Or singing melodies (fly high)
Oh life is more (fly high)
Way more, yeah (fly high)
Way more (fly high)

Why, when the thunder sounds
And you see the lightning almost touch the ground
You hear a voice sometimes, my inner child sings
Fly together (fly together)
But life feels so hard sometimes and you start to lose your mind
Just grab your sister's hand
And fly together
Black pumas, show em' how
The blues birds, fly together (fly together)

Let's fly together baby (fly together)
Fly together (fly together)
Fly together (fly together)
Help me sing a song and fly (fly together)
Touch that sky (fly together)
Fly together (fly together)
Let's fly together (fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
(Fly together)
