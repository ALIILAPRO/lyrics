		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love a demon
Can you free me
I got reasons, let her know I'm leaving
Commit suicide
At the doorway
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
Love a demon
Can you free me
I got reasons, let her know I'm leaving
Commit suicide
At the doorway
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
I'm in my whip, I'm in the hills in LA
I met this girl, said her name was Shadae
I needed more, I wanted her to come and stay
UberX
I got cash and Apple Pay
Suicide
If she ever runaway
Percocet and lean the only thing to ease the pain
I've been taking drugs everyday to numb the pain
I've been taking drugs get high and flout away
Love a demon
Can you free me
I got reasons, let her know I'm leaving
Commit suicide
At the doorway
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
Love a demon
Can you free me
I got reasons, let her know I'm leaving
Commit suicide
At the doorway
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
I'm talking to you girl, why you walked away
I'm talking to you girl, what you have to say
Needed time, but you took up all the space
Everything you told me, mane sounded kind of vague
No bread in my pocket but I need you
I got hopes I got dreams to be on GQ
If I don't wake up in the morning
That's the only time I will ever leave you
Love a demon
Can you free me
I got reasons, let her know I'm leaving
Commit suicide
At the doorway
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
Love a demon
Can you free me
I got reasons, let her know I'm leaving
Commit suicide
At the doorway
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
Life's boring, feeling like a role-play
