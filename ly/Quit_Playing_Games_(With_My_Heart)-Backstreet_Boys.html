		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, oh

Even in my heart I see
You're not bein' true to me
Deep within my soul I feel
Nothing's like it used to be

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you got to stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart

I live my life the way
To keep you comin' back to me
Everything I do is for you
So what is it that you can't see?

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time
Impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
You better quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you got to stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games

Baby, baby the love that we had was so strong
Don't leave me hangin' here forever
Oh baby, baby this is not right
Let's stop this tonight

Baby, oh, quit playin' games
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, baby
Na, na, na, na, na-ah

Sometimes I wish I could
Turn back time, impossible as it may seem
But I wish I could so bad, baby
Quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Before you tear us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart
I should've known from the start
You know you got to stop (from my heart)
You're tearing us apart (my heart)
Quit playin' games with my heart

Quit playin' games with my heart
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, baby
Na, na, na, na, na-ah

Quit playin' games with my heart
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na (with my heart)
Na, na, na, na, na, baby (my heart)
My heart
