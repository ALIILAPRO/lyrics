		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars 
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther
I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Adiós and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for Tequila and pretty senoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adiós and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play

The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
Because my bartender she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the Rum

I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today, life is good today

Adiós and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas they call me Big Poppa
When I throw pesos their way
Adiós and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jäger
And I'll grab my guitar and play

Adiós and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The senoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to stay
Adiós and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

(Just gonna prop up by the lake)
And put my ass in a lawn chair
Toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Life is good today
