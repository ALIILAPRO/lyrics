		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leaders come
Stand in line
Reveal your true self and conform
I sold my song
Crossed the borderline
I found something I'd never admit to

Come here
I've paid up for you
I have sold my weakness too
Come here
I split my heart in two
But you don't have it in you

Carbon soul
Transparent and played out
See you soon in non-fiction
I sold my song
My mouth was sewn
But it's coming undone and that's why I sold out
