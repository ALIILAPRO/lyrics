		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna line my walls with photographs you sent
Of you lying in your swimsuit on the bed
Can't live without your love inside me now
I'll find a way to slip into your skin somehow

I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend

I love to watch you when you're trying on your clothes 
And now you're all I think about when I'm alone
Can't wait to feel your love inside me now
We'll have a drink or two and we'll go to your house

I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend

I wanna fuck your love slow
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend
Catch my heart, go swim
Feel your lips crush
Hold you here, my loveliest friend
