		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't help but wondering about all
The stupid things I've done
When I'm on my own with
Nobody else to follow me
Why, I still stand myself
When I've done wrong?
Someone call, call me anything
I can make it true just for fun
And still take a lot
Baby you're in this mountain of lies

I've never said anything conjure about
So impressed, nothing will make it stop
It'll always rise above and we all
Cause this hurts still the best around
Begone i'm not welcome here anymore
I could afford

I always pushed you away when
You tried to open up
Can't stand to see you with him
Even just in a dream
Why always this jealousy? I'm so sick with it
Why do I let this mess me around?
Such a waste of time
Why do I wanna make myself like that?
