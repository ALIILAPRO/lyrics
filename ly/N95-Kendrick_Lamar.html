		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, new world, all the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied
Whoa, oh, oh, oh (yeah)

Take off the foo-foo
Take off the clout chase
Take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone
Take off the car loan
Take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry
I'ma take ten steps
Then I'm takin' off top five
Take off them fabricated streams
And them microwave memes
It's a real world outside (take that shit off)
Take off your idols
Take off the runway
I take off to Cairo (take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez
Five day stay, take a quarter mil'
Hell, if I know (take that shit off)
Take off the false flag
Take off perception
Take off the cop with the eye patch (take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal
Take off the unsure
Take off decisions I lack (take it off)
Take off the fake deep
Take off the fake woke
Take off the I'm broke, I care (take it off)
Take off the gossip
Take off the new logic, that if I'm rich, I'm rare (take it off)
Take off the Chanel
Take off the Dolce
Take off the Birkin bag (take it off)
Take all that designer bullshit off
And what do you have? (Bitch)

Huh, huh, uh, you ugly as fuck
(You out of pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You out of pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk 'bout?
Talk about us (you out of pocket, shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off? (Brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)
Copy off us (get back in pocket)

The world in a panic
The women is stranded
The men on a run
The prophets abandoned
The Lord take advantage
The market is crashin'
The industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box
While they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly
Watchin' for love
This ain't monogamy
Y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that?
I gotta relax when I feel (huh, facts)
All of my descendants
They come in my sleep and say I am too real (huh, facts)
I'm done with the sensitive takin' it personal
Done with the black and the white
The wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals
I know the feelings that came with burial's cries (bitch)

Huh, huh, uh, you ugly as fuck
(You out of pocket)
Huh, two ATMs (hah, hah, hah, hah)
You steppin' or what? (You out of pocket, huh)
Who you think they talk 'bout?
Talk about us (you out of pocket, shoot, shoot, shoot)
Who you think they copy off?
Copy off us (brrt, brrt, brrt, brrt)

Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house, ventin' in the sa-, ahh

Can I vent all my truth?
I got nothin' to lose
I got problems and pools
I can swim in my faith
Camera's movin' whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attractin' the feds
When I'm brackin', look at my reaction
My pupils on skates (hold up, hold up)
Let's think about this for a second (let's go)
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic (let's go)
Would you sell your soul on credit? (Let's go)
Would you sell your bro for leverage? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel
They the only ones relevant? (Let's go)
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel
They the only ones relevant? (Let's go)

(Huh, uh, huh)
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket (this shit hard)
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it (this shit hard)
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic (this shit hard)
What's your life like? Bullshit and gossip (this shit hard)

What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas
I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch
I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic?
That ain't protocol (bitch)
