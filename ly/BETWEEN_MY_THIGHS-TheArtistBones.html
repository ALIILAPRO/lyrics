		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you like it babe
Tell me all the things you wanna do
Now that you got me here
Pay no attention to the room
I'm all about you babe
The vibe's so right when alone with you
Kiss my troubles away

And we can do this all day, and all night if that's what you really want to
And I can' think of another place, that I want you

Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs

Trace my body babe
Get to know between the lines
Make my body ache
Let your lovin blow my mind
Slow it down now baby
No need to rush take you time
Wanna see ya face.. in my.. in my

And we can do this all day, and all night if that's what you really want to
And I can' think of another place, that I want you

Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs

I like where ya headin'
Down south and ya love is a weapon
I like the way you throw it on me,
Got ya head in the game like Wade from the 3
We can kiss when we start out baby
But you gotta eat this heart out baby
A lil slip of the tongue'll set the mood right
Get lost in ya thoughts blow my mind
Got you standing at attention
And ya tongue is a sword so we call that fencing
You know you like these dimensions
You can break down these walls no question
I like it straight but you can chase me
A lotta girls wanna taste me
And at the end of the night when ya mouth is full
You can call that Savoury
Get it?
Savoury

Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
Face between my thighs
