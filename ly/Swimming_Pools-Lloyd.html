		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm way past gone
And I just see the bottom of this bottle
I just woke up to a room full of models
Who know that I ain't calling them tomorrow
It's been so long
Since I've been on this level right here
Waking up, after I passed out
I put my clothes on before I mash out

Cause I been losing my mind, wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in inside
Buying the bottle and feeding them lies
Shawty say she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Into my room, I hit her from behind
Do it again like I'm pressing rewind
Cause I ain't never babysitting
I been lining up shots
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of
Liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then
I watch them all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of
Liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it, oh

Pour up (Drank) head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) faded (Drank)

I'm way past gone
From the partying and bullshit
Don't remember where I'm at
In a room full of bitches
Music playing in the back
Damn, time for me to get gone
'Cause I ain't supposed to be here
Feeling faded, I'm so intoxicated
And your girl say she feeling X rated
I'm gone

Cause I been losing my mind, wasting my time
Fucking these hoes and sipping this wine
Skipping the line to get in inside
Buying the bottle and feeding them lies
Shawty say she need a ride
I tell her cool and get ready to slide
Into my room, I hit her from behind
Do it again like I'm pressing rewind

Cause I ain't never babysitting
I been lining up shots
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First you get a swimming pool full of
Liquor then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles then
I watch them all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of
Liquor and they dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it, oh

Pour up (Drank) head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank) stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank) wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank) faded (Drank)
