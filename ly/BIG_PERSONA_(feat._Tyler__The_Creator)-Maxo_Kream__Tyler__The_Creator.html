		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's that big shit
And we all gettin' money
We can all get money
(Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?)

Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?
Million for the summer house
Love it when the sun be out
'Cause we be out
Ridin' around in that thing with the center roof
And the inside is orange like a cantaloupe
Got a Grammy and not just the interlude
Y'all niggas lucky I ain't snatch the other two
Got the lemon that sit on the ear ring
And that bitch glimmering like bling
Dance on the moon, it be like sing, nigga
So far, so far, so far, so far
Damn, bro, that neck on Lamb' mode
The boots in blue, the yellow hue
That shit like rainbow, it's big shit

Big money, big cars, big jewels
Big yard, big niggas, big talk
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?
Big dreaming, big business, big riskin'
Big winning, big living, big shit
It's whatever, nigga, uh
Big money, big cars, big jewels (big shit, big shit, big shit)
Big yard, big niggas, big talk (this that big shit, big shit, big shit)
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout? (Big shit, big shit, big shit)
Big dreaming, big business, big risk (big shit, big shit, big shit)
Big winning, big living, big shit (Nigga, big shit, big shit)
It's whatever, nigga

It's Mr, Maxo Biggie Poppa, who you know that do it better?
I'm the trap Barack Obama, Betty Crocker, used to pedal
Remixin' drugs but he love Nutty Professor with Griselda
Pockets kill, man, it keep poppin'
I make more money than professors
Bitch, I'm gettin' cake
Eight figure nigga, no more section 8
Moved mama out the hood
We ain't good, bitch, we doin' great
Big ass mansion, new estate
Friendly neighbors, pearly gates
Sippin' Arnold Palmers with my mama chillin' by the lake
Broke ass niggas love to hate
Can't pay his rent, he always late
I left the hood, they called me fake
Ain't shit realer than real estate
All that flexin', cappin', that's below my tax bracket
Before I buy a bitch a Birkin bag
I spend a bag on assets, big splashin'

Big money, big cars, big jewels
Big yard, big niggas, big talk
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?
Big dreaming, big business, big riskin' (what your fuckin' mouth when you speak to me, nigga)
Big winning, big living, big shit (don't look in my direction)
It's whatever, nigga, uh
Big money, big cars, big jewels (I'll buy y'all niggas' life)
Big yard, big niggas, big talk (fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?)
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout?
Big dreaming, big business, big risk (I don't flex, nigga, I just tell you about what I did, haha)
Big winning, big living, big shit
(It's whatever, nigga, uh)
Yeah
