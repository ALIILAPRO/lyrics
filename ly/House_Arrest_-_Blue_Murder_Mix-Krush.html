		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  We got this house under arrest,
I know you gonna dig this
Bug on out, bug on out, bug on out

Ooh, if you're looking for love, don't follow me
We've got this house under arrest

Hey, hey, don't follow me
Check this out
Ooh, if you're looking for love, don't follow me

We've got this house under arrest
Hey, hey, don't follow me , don't follow me
The best is the law and you know it's true

We've got this house under arrest
Bug on out, freeze, check this out

Ooh, if you're looking for love, don't follow me 
Ooh, if you're looking for love, don't follow me 

Don't you follow me, don't you follow me, don't follow me

Beat, beat, beat is the law Beat, beat, beat is the law
