		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can make you mad
I can make you scream
I can make you cry
I can make you leave
I can make you hate me
For everything
But I can't make you come back to me

But I can't make you come back to me

Called me all day
But I never pick up
Instead of pulling my weight
Always pushing my luck

You gave me all that I could take
Yeah, I took it all for granted
Head up in the clouds
Yeah, I never understand it

I remember thinking
I don't need you
But then time passed by
And it's so untrue
Now I'm the rain over your parade
Reason you're over me

Yeah, I always keep making the same mistakes
Maybe I never deserved you anyways

I can make you mad
I can make you scream
I can make you cry
I can make you leave
I can make you hate me
For everything
But I can't make you
Come back to me

I can make a world
Out of broken dreams
I can make you say things
You don't mean
I can unmake
All we were made to be
But I can't make you come back to me

But I can't make you come back to me

Calling all day
Tryna make things right
Just to fuck it all up
When I see you tonight
Since you told me hit the road
I've been running on empty
If anything I know
It's how to ruin a happy ending
I remember when you still needed me
Don't know how I let it go so easily
Now I'm the cloud to your sunny days
Reason you run away

Don't know how I keep making the same mistakes
Maybe I never deserved you anyway

I can make you mad
I can make you scream
I can make you cry
I can make you leave
I can make you
Hate me for everything
But I can't make you come back to me

I can make a world
Out of broken dreams
I can make you say things you don't mean
I can unmake all we were made to be
But I can't make you come back to me

But I can't make you come back to me

I can unmake all we were made to be
But I can't make you come back to me

I can make you mad
I can make you scream
I can make you cry
I can make you leave
I can make you hate me for everything
But I can't make you come back to me
