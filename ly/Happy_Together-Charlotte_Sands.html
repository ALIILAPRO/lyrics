		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walkin' in Santa Monica
With your hand in my pocket
Suffocated with memories
I don't know how to stop it
You were sellin' a fantasy
Told me you were a fan of me
So I pulled out my wallet
And I bought it

You're soundin' different when you say my name
I try to kiss you, but you look away
You say you just wanna be happy
What were you when you had me?

I thought that we would be happy together
I thought that we could be happy forever
Now your feet are getting cold
Your grip is getting weaker
Baby, I was stupid for thinking that maybe
We could be happy together
I thought that we could be happy
Whatever

We used to talk on the phone
You'd say that we're breakin' up
Thought you were talkin' connection
But you were talkin' 'bout us
I thought you wanted a part of me
Now you're not even callin' me
How can I reach your mouth
If you're asleep on the couch?

You're soundin' different when you say my name
I try to kiss you, but you look away
You say you just wanna be happy
What were you when you had me?
I thought that we would be happy together
I thought that we could be happy forever
Now your feet are getting cold
Your grip is getting weaker
Baby, I was stupid for thinking that maybe
We could be happy together

I thought that we could be happy forever
Now these lies are getting old
Your words are cutting deeper
Baby, I was stupid for thinking that maybe
We could be happy together
I thought that we could be happy
Whatever

You're soundin' different when you say my name
I try to kiss you, but you look away
You say you just wanna be happy

I thought that we would be happy together
I thought that we could be happy forever
Now your feet are getting cold
Your grip is getting weaker
Baby, I was stupid for thinking that maybe
We could be happy together
I thought that we could be happy forever
Now these lies are getting old
Your words are cutting deeper
Baby, I was stupid for thinking that maybe
We could be happy together
I thought that we could be happy
Whatever (whatever)
