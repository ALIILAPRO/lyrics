		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Fire woman, yeah)
Shake, shake, shake, shake it, yeah

Wound up, can't sleep, can't do anything right, little honey
Oh, since I set my eyes on you
I tell you the truth
T-t-t-twistin' like a flame in a slow dance, baby
You're driving me crazy
Come on, little honey, come on now

Fire, smoke she is a rising
Fire, yeah, smoke on the horizon
Fire, smoke she is a rising
Fire, oh smoke stack lightning, smoke stack lightning

Well now, shake it up, you're to blame
Got me swayin' little honey
My heart's a ball of burnin' flame
Oh, yes it is
Prancing like a cat on a hot tin shack
Lord, have mercy
Come on little sister, come on and shake it

Fire, smoke she is a rising
Fire, oh, smoke on the horizon, yeah
Fire, smoke she is a rising
Fire, oh, smoke stack lightning, baby

I was thinking what I've been missing
I'll tell you truthfully, well
She's coming close now
Oh, I can feel her
She's getting close to me
And I never, yeah

Fire, smoke she is a rising
Fire, oh, smoke on the horizon
Fire smoke, she is a a risin', risin', risin'
Fire, smokestack lightning

Aj-j-j, burnin' out
And shake it, baby
Come on and burn it

I say, send down fire to me
Say, send down fire to me
Say, send down fire to me, yeah

Fire woman, you're to blame
Fire woman, you're to blame
Fire woman, you're to blame
Fire woman, you're to blame
