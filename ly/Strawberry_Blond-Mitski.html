		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love everybody because I love you
When you stood up, walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
I looked over it and I ached
I love everybody because I love you
I don't need the city, and I don't need proof
All I need, darlin', is a life in your shape
I picture it, soft, and I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond

Reach out the car window tryin' to hold the wind
You tell me you love her, I give you a grin
Oh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape
So I follow the white lines, follow the white lines
Keep my eyes on the road as I ache

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rollin' on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rollin' on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Look at you, strawberry blond
Fields rollin' on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm?
Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
