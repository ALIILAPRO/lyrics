		  This time around I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out
Somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna get me
You really wanna get me

He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had
He really thought, he really had a hold on me
He really thought 
(They thought they really could control me) he really had

This time around I won't be gettin' bit
Though you really wanna get me
(You really wanna get me)
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really wanna fix me
(You really wanna fix me)
Somebody's out
Somebody's out to use me
They really want to use me
And then falsely accuse me (accuse me)
This time around
They'll take it like spit
No, you really can't control me
You really can't control me

He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had

He really thought he really had control of me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had

Listen, I've got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer nigga, I ain't jokin'
Indo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'
The fool comes slippin'
So I could blow 'em open
This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rocks
Got Pitts by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that (this time around, yeah)
Baby

He really thought he really had a control of me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought
(They thought they really had control of me) he really had

He really thought he really had control of me
He really thought he really had (control of me)
He really thought he really had a hold on me
He really thought he really had a hold on me

He really
He really got control of me
He really thought (he really got control of me)
He really thought he really had a hold on me
This time around, yeah
He really thought
