		  (Hundred bad bitches in the city)
G-g-g-good work Charlie

Hundred bad bitches in the city
All the girls, they are so pretty
Hundred bad bitches in the city
All the girls, they are so pretty
Why do you want me, are you Annie?
All the bad bitches can't have me
Why do you want me, are you Annie?
All the bad bitches can't stand me

Christ, I opened the box
Looked down at the crystal rock
He like, "Wife, give me all you got"
And when I'm screamin', he's like, "Where's my cum?"
I'm like "tongue," up and down the stick
In the whip real low in the schoolgirl fit
We talkin' schemin', Bonnie and Clyde
Hundred bad bitches, one ride-or-die

I spit it, I lick it, I count it and I flip it
I need it, I want it, I need it, I want it
I spit it, I lick it, I count it and I flip it
I need it, I want it, I need it (I need it)

Hundred bad bitches in the city
All the girls, they are so pretty
Hundred bad bitches in the city
All the girls, they are so pretty
Why do you want me, are you Annie?
All the bad bitches can't have me
Why do you want me, are you Annie?
All the bad bitches can't stand me (Stand me)

Hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred bad—
Hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred bad bitches

Hundred bad bitches in the city lookin' pretty
With the ass and all the titties
Throwin' 20s, throwin' 50s
Got the rocks and they be drippin'
Stick they tongue out and they trippin'
At the pool house, they be dippin'
They be speedboat, water whippin'
Kinda like 'em when they sippin'
Ride around over the limit
They're like, "Charli, baby, get in"
They know racin' is my fetish
So I vrooma vrooma vrooma
Purple Lambo with the roof off
In the mirror with the lipgloss
Me and Tommy 'bout to link up

Hundred bad bitches in the city
All the girls, they are so pretty
Hundred bad bitches in the city
All the girls, they are so pretty
Why do you want me, are you Annie?
All the bad bitches can't have me
Why do you want me, are you Annie?
All the bad bitches can't stand me

Uh, hundred-hundred
Hundred-hundred, bad, hundred
Bad bitches, bad
Hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred
Hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred bad—
Hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred bad bitches
Hundred-hundred bad
Hundred bad, bad
Hundred-hundred-hundred bad
Hundred-hundred-hundred bad
Bad bitches in the city
All the—
Hundred-hundred bad—
Hundred-hundred bad bitches, bad
Hundred bad bitches—
All the girls, all the girls, all the—
Hundred bad
Hundred-hundred-hundred bad bitches
Hundred-hundred bad bitches
All the girls— so pretty
Haha
