		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just went up on the list, yeah
Bitch, I went doubled my wrist (time)
Lil' buddy smokin' on piss (no lie)
I'm fuckin' my money, blow a kiss (no lie)
I ain't have Percs all day, I, I gotta get 'em
I know they took my wave, I gotta, I gotta split 'em
Why would I tell you to get in this GLE Tonka then swerve? Yeah
Why would I tell you to move these packs for me? No, don't lie
Why would I tell you to move these stacks for me? You know why
Why would I tell you to move these packs for me? No, don't lie

I just get high then I rev' it out
We take this shit to your mommy's house
I just get high, I don't map it out
Bitch, I took the plan on a different route
Pull up to the city, we knock out the show 
We tellin' these pussies to move around
I just got off the phone with Eliantte 
Told me check him, and then it's a eighty-ball
No, you can't fuck with the mob (okay, okay, okay)
No, you can't fuck with the God
Seen your broke ass in your hometown, seen your ass workin' a job
I hit the bank with any amount, I'm knowin' they pullin' it out (ooh, yeah)
I'm tellin' you this shit ain't fine as it gets (yeah)
I'm tellin' you this shit ain't fine, this shit ain't (yeah)
I'm tellin' you don't waste my time, I tell it again (yeah)
Yeah, I'm tellin' you I'm parked outside, it's harder to get (yeah)
Got a G63 on the coupe, got a Glock 23, the swoop
He get jumped out, yeah, no rule
It's a back order, baby, get loot
Got twizz army, bitch, we got troops
Feel like Toys R Us with coupes
Got some Hi-Tech red sittin' in my juice
Super boy syrup, bouta get it, get loose

I just went up on the list, yeah
Bitch, I went doubled my wrist (time)
Lil' buddy smokin' on piss (no lie)
I'm fuckin' my money, blow a kiss (no lie)
I ain't have Percs all day, I, I gotta get 'em
I know they took my wave, I gotta, I gotta split 'em
Why would I tell you to get in this GLE Tonka then swerve? Yeah
Why would I tell you to move these packs for me? No, don't lie
Why would I tell you to move these stacks for me? You know why
Why would I tell you to move these packs for me? No, don't lie

I hit the back-back too, yeah, what's in the backpack, boo? Yeah
Chanel, Number (N)ine on the group, yeah
Pull up, I'm takin' the loot
Lil' bitch, I'm on the Percs, I been noddin' off
I can't feel nothin', I can't feel at all
You gotta tell me somethin' if you tell it all
You a snitch, yeah, you a tattler
Everything around me flawless, yeah, every diamond on me flawless
I'm rich, I don't need dollars, yeah
All my guys really ballers, yeah
They bitin' the swag, lingo, like piranhas
Who said the demon really is a monster?
You is not real, you is an imposter
That pussy play dead like that bitch a possum
I don't feel nothin' at all, I just been vibed out
We don't fucks with law, yeah, we gon' slide out
You a broke boy, don't get involved, you can't ride around
Most of y'all really be bitches, I can't fuck with y'all

I just went up on the list, yeah
Bitch, I went doubled my wrist (time)
Lil' buddy smokin' on piss (no lie)
I'm fuckin' my money, blow a kiss (no lie)
I ain't have Percs all day, I, I gotta get 'em
I know they took my wave, I gotta, I gotta split 'em
Why would I tell you to get in this GLE Tonka then swerve? Yeah
Why would I tell you to move these packs for me? No, don't lie
Why would I tell you to move these stacks for me? You know why
Why would I tell you to move these packs for me? No, don't lie

No
Don't lie
