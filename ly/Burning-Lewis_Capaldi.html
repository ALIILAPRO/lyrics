		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't even begin to explain
This all too well familiar pain
It comes and it goes
But it gets in my bones all the same, ooh

Well, maybe I'm a fool
For falling in love with you
When I had nothing left to lose
And nothing more I could give
Went down with your sinking ship
Now I don't think I'll make it through
Through

Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
'Cause the longer you convince me to stay
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone

Forget everything we've come to expect
It only serves to further fuck with our heads
And I don't wanna pretend
This will all be alright in the end, ooh

So maybe now, instead of balancing on the edge
We can put this to bed for good
Can call it quits or risk sinking with this broken ship
But I don't think we'd make it through
Through

Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
'Cause the longer you convince me to stay
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone

I wish I could stay
I wish I could lie
Do whatever it takes to get you through the night
I can't be the one
I can't take the fall
Can't go up in the flames to keep your body warm

Now it's only the beat of my heart
That reminds me not to stare at the sparks
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
'Cause the longer you convince me to stay
Our salvation's slipping further away
Can't set fire to my soul just to keep ya
Keep ya
Keep ya from burning alone
