		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've come a long, long way together
Through the hard times and the good
I have to celebrate you, baby
I have to praise you like I should

You're so rare
So fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You're so rare
So fine
I'm so glad you're mine

You make me glad I'm a woman
'Cause you're a feeling, thinking man
And anytime I know you're needing
I'm gonna please you every way I can

You're so rare
You're so fine
I'm so glad you're mine
You're so rare
And so fine

You clear the questions from my mind
I was afraid to say I love you
Afraid to take, and too eager to give
You helped me deal with what I'm feeling
With why and how I want to live

You're so rare
Man, you're so fine
You know, I'm so glad you're mine
You're so very rare
And so fine
I'm sure glad you're mine

I have to praise you when you hold me
When you work your way around
Ain't a part of me left over
That your sweet love ain't found
You make my, my moan turn to whisper
You make my whisper turn to call
You make me scream
And scream that I love you
When you, when you make me rise and fall

You're so rare
And you're so fine
And I'm so very, very, very glad you're mine
You're so rare
And so fine

Oh, oh you're mine, you're mine
You know, you know I want the best for you, baby
And what you want, I want for you
And we can, we can work together, baby
To see it, to see it all come true

'Cause you're so rare
And you're, you're so fine
And Lord knows, I'm so very glad you're mine
You're so rare, so rare
And you're so very, very fine
Oh, you cleared all the questions from my mind

We come a, we come a long, long way together, baby
Through the hard times and all the good
I'm gonna take this day to celebrate you, baby
'Cause I have to stop and praise you like I should

You're so rare, take yo' praise
And you're so fine
And I hope you know I'm glad you're mine
Take yo' praise, you're so rare
Take yo' praise, you're so fine
