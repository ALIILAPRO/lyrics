		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My man says I'm a smoking gun
They call me cheap Champagne
But I'm his Dom PÃ©rignon
Kids online say I have too much fun
I get high with the spotlight on
Baby, when the crowd goes home
I'm all alone and I've got no one
Baby, when the credits roll
No self control, I come undone

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch
I got a driver so I'm never alone
I thought you knew I was a late night cat fight
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Strung out on pills like Wall Street on a week night, oh

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch

My man calls me a setting sun
Pretty little Hollywood
Gonna have a rolling stone
Spread, page one
And credit cards are so much fun
Jesus, won't you save my soul?
No self control, I come undone

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch
I got a driver so I'm never alone
I thought you knew I was a late night cat fight
Cocaine kid with a bad bite
Strung out on pills like Wall Street on a week night, oh
I thought you knew

I thought you knew
I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch

I thought you knew I'm filthy rich
I thought you knew I never answer my phone
I thought you knew I was a bitch

I thought you knew
