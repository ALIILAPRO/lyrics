Bust back, nigga where yo guns at?
Rah, rah, nigga, we don't do that
Op talk, nigga, we don't trust that
Keep the peace? Hell nah, nigga, fuck that
Load it up, pull it back, yeah, we shoot it up
Pulling up, then we shooting where you posted up
Duel wield Mac 10, use the whole clip
Then we pull out, nigga we don't give no fucks
My niggas savage, we all going bat shit, uh
Yeah, Bruce Wayne, black mask, that's it, uh
Yeah, talking all that shit but you can't back it, uh
Yeah, all you niggas stutter like you lagging

I be walking round wishing that a nigga would
Fucking with the wrong nigga, yeah, I wish he would
Get the chrome then I put it to a nigga dome
Pull the trigger and I send a pussy nigga home
He gone meet his maker
I don't fuck with fakers
I'm the undertaker
I'm a life taker
I'm the fucking shaker
I'm a shot caller
I'm an ice breaker
I'm a trench crawler
Brrrap
Brrrap
