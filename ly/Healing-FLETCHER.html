		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been feeling
Inside out in my feelings
Upside down, on the ceiling
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I'm finally breathing
The smoke ain't gone but it's clearing
I ain't there yet but I'm healing
I ain't there yet

Inhale, exhale on repeat, yeah
Lately, it's so hard to breathe, yeah
Falling 'bout a million times
It's a miracle I'm still alive
No one said that it was easy
Tryna piece the broken pieces
But that's the shit I'm working on
The journey is a work of art

I can't erase all the things that I've done
But all the mistakes made me who I've become

I've been feeling
Inside out in my feelings
Upside down, on the ceiling
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I'm finally breathing
The smoke ain't gone but it's clearing
I ain't there yet but I'm healing
I ain't there yet but I'm healing

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I ain't there yet, but I'm healing
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I ain't there yet, but I'm healing

Breaking down, don't mean I'm broken (yeah, I'm broken)
Losing hope, don't mean I'm hopeless
And maybe all I need is time (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It never happens overnight

I can't erase all the things that I've done (I've done)
But all the mistakes made me who I've become

I've been feeling
Inside out in my feelings (my feelings)
Upside down, on the ceiling
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I'm finally (finally) breathing
The smoke ain't gone but it's clearing
I ain't there yet but I'm healing
I ain't there yet but I'm healing

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I ain't there yet, but I'm healing
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I ain't there yet, but I'm healing

I'm finally breathing (oh, oh-ooh, oh, oh, oh)
The smoke ain't gone but it's clearing (ooh-ooh, ooh)
I ain't there yet but I'm healing
I ain't there yet but I'm healing

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I ain't there yet, but I'm healing (healing)
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah
I ain't there yet
