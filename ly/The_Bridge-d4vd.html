		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over water there's a bridge, and I can't seem to get to you
The fear of a loss, what I always succumb to
The way that I feel, I can't capture it all
Like the waves that I sink in when you tell me that I'm not

Enough, shut up, 'cause I'd kill myself for you
Walk in the dark, I can't find my way to you
Gone, gave it all, and it's all my fault that I
Chose to keep holding on to the love you
Threw away, but I'd stay just to see you make it
I'm stuck in my ways, so you know I'm not faking
You thought I was simple, so you got complicated
Don't you get complicated, that's the reason that we separate

The water rising faster
Now before and after
Climbing up the ladder
Screaming at me louder

So let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let her go, ah-ha
So let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Let her go, ah-ha

Over water there's a bridge, and I can't seem to get to you
The fear of a loss, what I always succumb to
The way that I feel, I can't capture it all
Like the waves that I sink in when you tell me that I'm not

Enough, shut up, 'cause I'd kill myself for you
Walk in the dark, I can't find my way to you
Gone, gave it all, and it's all my fault that I
Chose to keep holding on to the love you
Threw away, but I'd stay just to see you make it
I'm stuck in my ways, so you know I'm not faking
You thought I was simple, so you got complicated
Don't you get complicated, that's the reason that we separate
