		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to wait 'til you know me better
Let's just be glad for the time together
Life's such a treat and it's time you taste it
There ain't a reason on earth to waste it
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself

Lick it up, lick it up, oh, it's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, ooh yeah
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, come on (come on)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, ooh

Don't need to wait for an invitation
You gotta live like you're on vacation
There's something sweet you can't buy with money
Lick it up, woo, lick it up
It's all you need, so believe me, honey
It ain't a crime to be good to yourself

Lick it up, lick it up, oh, it's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, ooh yeah
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, come on (come on)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, come on

It's only right now (it's only right now)
Ooh yeah (ooh yeah), ooh yeah (ooh yeah), yeah, yeah

Oh, woo

Lick it up, lick it up, oh, it's only right now
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, come on (come on)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh, woo

Lick it up, lick it up, oh, yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Lick it up, lick it up, oh
