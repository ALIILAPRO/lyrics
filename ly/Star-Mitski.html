		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we met
We acted like two fools
We were so glad
So glad to have found it

That love is like a star, it's gone
We just see it shining
It's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on?

You know I'd always been alone
'Til you taught me
To live for somebody

That love is like a star
It's gone, we just see it shining
'Cause it's traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
I am yours

No matter that love's gone
We just see it shining
We've traveled very far, I'll
Keep a leftover light burning
So you can keep looking up
Isn't that worth holding on?
