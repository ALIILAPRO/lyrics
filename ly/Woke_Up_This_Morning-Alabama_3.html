		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, you woke up this morning
Got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you'd be the chosen one
She said, "You're one in a million, you've got to burn to shine"
But you were born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes

And you woke up this morning
All that love had gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong
Hey but you're, you're looking good, baby
I believe that you're feeling fine, shame about it
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes, yeah

Because you woke up this morning 
Got a blue moon in your eyes
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes

Well, you woke up this morning
The world turned upside down
Lord above, thing's ain't been the same since Howlin' Wolf walked into your town
But you're, but you're one in a million 
'Cause you've got that shotgun shine, boom
Born under a bad sign with a blue moon in your eyes, yeah

You woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah
Woke up this morning 
You got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah

When you woke up this morning everything was gone 
By half past ten your head was going ding-dong
Ringing like a bell from your head down to your toes
Like some voice tryna tell you there's something you should know 
Last night you were flying but today you're so low
Ain't it times like these that make you wonder if you'll ever know 
The meaning of things as they appear to the others 
Wives, husbands, fathers, sisters and brothers 
Don't you wish you didn't function 
Wish you didn't think beyond the next paycheck 
And the next little drink? 
Well, you do, so make up your mind to go on 
'Cause when you woke up this morning 
Everything you had was gone 
Everything you had was long gone

See I woke up this morning (woke up this morning)
Yeah, woke up this morning (woke up this morning)
You woke up this morning
You wanna be, you wanna be the chosen one tonight
Yes, you know it, because you, you just can't help yourself

Woke up this morning (when you woke up this morning)
Yeah, woke up this morning (when I woke up this morning)
Woke up this morning
And you did it, girl
You got yourself a gun 
You got yourself a gun 
You got yourself a gun
