I don't need you, I want money
I don't want you, I want money
I don't need you, I want money

I'm fully able, I'm fully able
I'm ballin' now
Got so much food on the table
I'm done with labels
Yeah I'm done with labels
I turn the tables
Yeah my god is able

Na, na na
Na, na na
Na, na na
Na, na na
Just wanna be honest (na, na na, na, na na)
I'ma do me regardless (na, na na, na, na na)
