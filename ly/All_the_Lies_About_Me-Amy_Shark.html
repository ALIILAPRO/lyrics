		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I got home I was angry
No idea why you hate me
And I cried all night then passed out
And my hairs still up and you're still out
Yeah, that's me so selfish
Jealous every minute of the day
She's so passive aggressive
Yeah, whatever you say

Ooh, I'm not as bad as you think I am
And I don't know what you're telling everyone
You're making up shit and you know it
Picking up my heart just to throw it
And I start to believe all the lies

I act so strong then I crumble
Spoke nice and loud now I mumble
Leave all my things on the floor
You can't see the mess if you close the door

Yeah, that's me so selfish
Jealous every minute of the day
She's so passive aggressive
Yeah, whatever you say

She's crazy
She's all alone
She's helpless and on the phone
It's midnight where I am
Are you as sad as me now?

Ooh, I'm not as bad as you think I am
And I don't know what you're telling everyone
You're making up shit and you know it
Picking up my heart just to throw it
And I start to believe all the lies
About me

All the lies about me
About me
All the lies about me

I'm not as bad as you think I am
And I don't know what you're telling everyone
You're making up shit and you know it
Picking up my heart just to throw it
And I start to believe all the lies
About me
About me

All the lies about me
All the lies about me
