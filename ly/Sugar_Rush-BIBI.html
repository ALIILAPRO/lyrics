		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm sweet like candy
You could look don't touch
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush

I'm sweet like candy
You could look don't touch
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush

Yeah, I got cake baby yeah I got dough
Bet you never met a bitch who had both
Mmm, and if you try to get close I'll
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Sweet like lemonade smooth like butter
Won't give it up for no sucker
Don't take shots baby, duck and take cover
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Homemade
They don't make 'em like this no more
One taste
And I make 'em go make 'em go fall in love

I'm sweet like candy
You could look don't touch
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush

I'm sweet like candy
You could look don't touch
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush (rush, rush, rush, rush)
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush 

No artificial sweetener
You gon' eat it up 'til yo teeth hurt
I don't need a man for no dessert
I got popsicles in my freezer

I got thirty flavors
No free samples boy, you gotta pay first
I make bread but I ain't no baker
Good girl on her worst behavior

Homemade
They don't make 'em like this no more
One taste
And I make 'em go make 'em go fall in love

I'm sweet like candy
You could look don't touch
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush

I'm sweet like candy
You could look don't touch
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush (rush, rush, rush, rush)
Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush

Don't try to get handsy
You get sugar rush
