		<p>
		  Uh

Darling, this world ain't for the faint of heart (nah)
Feel like (uh) we were made to fall apart

I can build your heart an army (yeah)
Don't gotta do this all by yourself
If you need someone you call me (yeah)
You got me (yeah), you got me

Oh, I can be your lifeline
Stay with you 'til the sunrise
When you're low, it don't mean you're alone
I'll be by your side
Oh, I can be the reason
That you don't feel your demons
When you're low, it don't mean you're alone
I'll be by your side

Oh, I could be your lifeline
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Oh, I could be your lifeline
(Oh, oh-oh, oh)

Highs and lows (yeah), lights will glow (uh)
And they'll fade (yeah)
Reach your hand out in the dark
And I'll meet you halfway

'Cause your heart's an army (yes, it is)
Don't gotta do this all by yourself
If you need someone you call me (all you gotta do)
You got me (all you gotta do), you got me

Oh, I can be your lifeline
Stay with you 'til the sunrise
When you're low, it don't mean you're alone
I'll be by your side
Oh, I can be the reason
That you don't feel your demons
When you're low, it don't mean you're alone
I'll be by your side

Oh, I could be your lifeline
Oh, I could be your lifeline

Oh, look to your left (yeah), look to your right (yeah)
I'll be right here (uh), I'll be by your side
Look to your left (yeah), look to your right (yeah)
I'll be right here (uh), I'll be by your side
Look to your left (uh), look to your right
I'll be right here (come on), I'll be by your side
Look to your left (yeah), look to your right (yeah)
I'll be right here (uh)

Oh, I can be your lifeline
Stay with you 'til the sunrise ('til the sunrise)
When you're low, it don't mean you're alone
I'll be by your side
Oh, I can be the reason
That you don't feel your demons
When you're low (what?)
It don't mean you're alone (what?)
I'll be by your side

Oh, I could be your lifeline
(Yeah, yeah)
Oh, I could be your lifeline
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I could be your lifeline
(Oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
Oh, I could be your lifeline
(Oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah, yeah)

You don't have to worry
No, no, no, no, no, no
You don't have to be alone
No, no, no, no, no, no
You don't have to be alone
