		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And when the moon is big and full
And look it's made al just for you
You can't go down down down down
You can't go down down

And when the adrenalin is rushing high
and you're reaching for the very sky
You can't go down down down down
You can't go down down

Forget you grey life
Forget you tomorrows
Get into the bliss
Get out of control

And no moor shit is going to surround you
And no more thoughts of heave and hell
Just the truth the truth
You just can't resist you
Get out in the night
Get out of control

Forget you grey skies
Forget you tomorrows
Get into the bliss
Get out of control

And when the moon is big and full
And look it's made al just for you
You can't go down down down down
You can't go down down

Get out of your grey skies
Get out of tomorrows
Get into the bliss
Get out of control
