		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You pick me up when I feel down
No matter how deep in the night
I got your back when we go out
You know I'm always on your side

You make this world a little wild
And we shout through crowded streets
Turn up the noise and make it loud
And let the world fall at our feet

We love it on the other side
Where the dreams are real, do what we like
Let them point and laugh, at who we are
It was you and me here dancing from the start

We don't need money to feel good
'Cause you're the ride or die the rest of my life
Don't need a party to feel high
We're like the modern version of Bonnie & Clyde

You see the truth 
You're in my heart
And you catch me every time
And if you're low and fall apart
I'll bring some peace back in your mind

We love it on the other side
Where the dreams are real, do what we like
Let them point and laugh, at who we are
It was you and me here dancing from the start

We don't need money to feel good
'Cause you're the ride or die the rest of my life
Don't need a party to feel high
We're like the modern version of Bonnie & Clyde

We don't need money to feel good
'Cause you're the ride or die the rest of my life
Don't need a party to feel high
We're like the modern version of Bonnie & Clyde

Give me a three, two, one 
I'll be dancing with you
Keep it going on like every day
And in a three, two, one 
I'll shoot you straight to the moon
Through the sky, to the stars in your eyes

They've all tried to bring us down but
We keep moving up
They wanna steal our golden crown 
But all the roads will lead 'em back to us

We don't need money to feel good (to feel good)
'Cause you're the ride or die the rest of my life
Don't need a party to feel high
We're like the modern version of Bonnie & Clyde

We don't need money to feel good
'Cause you're the ride or die the rest of my life
Don't need a party to feel high
We're like the modern version of Bonnie & Clyde
