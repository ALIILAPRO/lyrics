		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can it be permissible
She compromise my principle, yeah yeah
That kind of love is mythical
She's anything but typical

She's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
She used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible, Simply irresistible

Her loving is so powerful, huh
It's simply unavoidable
The trend is irreversible
The woman is invincible

She's a natural law, and she leaves me in awe
She deserves the applause, I surrender because
She used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible, Simply irresistible

Simply irresistible 
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible 
(She's all mine, there's no other way to go)

She's unavoidable, I'm backed against the wall
She gives me feelings that I never felt before
I'm breaking promises, she's breaking every law
She used to look good to me, now I find her
Simply irresistible
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible
(She's all mine, there's no other way to go)

Her methods are inscrutable
The proof is irrefutable, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's so completely kissable, huh
Our lives are indivisible, yeah yeah

She's a craze you'd endorse, she's a powerful force
You're obliged to conform when there's no other course
Well she used to look good to me, but now I find her
Simply irresistible 
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible 
(She's all mine, there's no other way to go)
Simply irresistible 
(She's so fine, there's no tellin' where the money went)
Simply irresistible 
(She's all mine, there's no other way to go)
Simply irresistible
