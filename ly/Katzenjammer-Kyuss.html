		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a girl and not a pearl.
I want a girl who'll take me home.
A kind is nice and will get me
Where I want to go. yeah.
There's been a lover to ignore me,
To ask me the one who knows.
If I tell the car, run the other,
Will it end from there?
Take a look underneath the hood,
And I won't be friends.

Baby in my motor,
Make my blood boil,
Be on her.

Baby in my motor,
Make my blood boil,
Be on her.

Blue Shaddows on the track.

Run your fingers through my hair,
Use my Dodger to get me there.
Line my seats with everybody there.
Oh my god then baby will last,
Its got little hands and baby blue eyes,
Mine who will last when my baby will lie.

Baby in my motor,
Make my blood boil,
Be on her.

Baby in my motor,
Make my blood boil,
Be on her.

Baby in my motor,
Make my blood boil,
Be on her.

Baby in my motor,
Make my blood boil,
Be on her.

Yeah.
