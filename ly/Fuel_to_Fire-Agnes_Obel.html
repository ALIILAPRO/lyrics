		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you want me on your mind
Or do you want me to go on?
I might be yours, as sure as I can say
Be gone, be faraway

Roses on parade, they follow you around
Upon your shore, as sure as I can say
Be gone, be faraway
Like fuel to fire

Into the town we go
Into your hideaway
Where the towers grow
Gone to be faraway
Sing quietly along

Pious words to cry into the under
Upon your shore, as sure as I can say
Be gone, be faraway

Oh, what a day to choose
Torn by the hours
All that I say to you
Is like fuel to fire

Into the town we go
Into your hideaway
Where the towers grow
Gone to be faraway
Never do we know
Never do they give away
Where the towers grow
Only you will hear them say

Sing quietly along
Sing quietly along
