		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it something I wrote
That made you just feel like I just wasn't enough
Was it something I said
That made you leave all of it behind in the dust

I wish that you just called me
And leave me message saying we shouldn't end this today
I told you I was sorry
For making a mess and complicating your head like I did

Harder for you
Drowning was harder for you
Harder for you

And I wanna go back and live a thousand life times with you
And I wanna escape these moment it gets harder without you

Was it something I wrote
That made you just feel like I just wasn't enough
Was it something I said
That made you leave all of it behind in the dust

I wish that you just called me
And leave me message saying we shouldn't end this today
I told you I was sorry
For making a mess and complicating your head like I did

Harder for you
Drowning was harder you
Harder for you

And I wanna go back and live a thousand life times with you
And I wanna escape these moment it gets harder without you
