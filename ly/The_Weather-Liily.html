		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been paid to me victimized
I've been posed by a threat of my
By threat of my
My sobriety
Seraphim
May you open
up your arms
Cause I can't resist
Cause I can't resist
Cause I can't resist the thought of being remembered

Spilled all my guts just to measure the weather
Year after year, come try and bring me down
My Mind in a million pieces
Still got more than a million reasons
To play nice with the heat of the ember
Please play nice with the heat of the ember

Catacombs are my only vice
Scattered bones keeps my head on right
Sorry eyes and a candy crooked smile
Seem to hide what I got left of my pride
My pride, oh

Spilled all my guts just to measure the weather
Year after year, come try and bring me down
My Mind in a million pieces
Still got more than a million reasons
To play nice with the heat of the ember
Please play nice with the heat of the ember

Don't come around
Or you'll drown
Or you'll drown
Or you'll drown
Or you'll drown

My mind in a million pieces
Gives a million reasons oh
My mind in a million pieces
My mind gives a million reasons oh
