		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit too real too real
Screamin' for your life
Skr, skr, skr, skr, skr

Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to cook it off the counter
Make me have to serve you with the hammer
Make me have to put it in the freezer
Make me have to put it on the camera
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash splash was all you heard, came in the house and it's all you heard

Cookin' up chicken like Gladys
Stayin' up late on addicts
Pullin' up swervin' he a caddy
Fuck around caught me a baddie
Cranberry cups with the matic
Throw a half a brick at Magic
18-5 on a Monday
I'm a renegade with the money
Like the way I scrape that butter
Betty Crocker sippin' on muddy
Straight droppin' gon' get floody
Pyrex pot and the 40
This'll get a slow trap scorchin' 
If it ain't hot it ain't rollin'
Twenty four seven ain't closin'
They got my name at the Precinct
Know a nigga playin' in a sink
Came through playin' in a mink
Don't put the fan on it's gon' shrink
I put a lot bands on it, let it rinse
Got a lotta bands on me, outta drench
I got re-rock on me got fish
I got kilo of Cuban on my wrist
I started drinkin', then I made a hit
I got my fork and my work and my syrup
I got my recipe goin'
You see me just splashin' and play wit that girl you already know what goin' do

Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to cook it off the counter
Make me have to serve you with the hammer
Make me have to put it in the freezer
Make me have to put it on the camera
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash splash was all you heard, came in the house and it's all you heard

I just whipped up a new Celine
I just whipped up new Maserati truck
Cookin' by the sink with the fire up
Burned down the house call the fire truck
All Bape got me scrapin' louder
Might even take a lil longer
Took a few loses with the 'caine
Arm&Hammer made me stronger
Right for the door, count up the four
We ran outta sandwich bags, go get some more
You ain't put in the work and you homeless
I stash the work in the Honda
Heavy mixin' to keep it one hunnid
Came in the house and it's all you heard
Splash splash is all you heard
Whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash splash all you heard
Count up the cash and all you heard

Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to cook it off the counter
Make me have to serve you with the hammer
Make me have to put it in the freezer
Make me have to put it on the camera
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Bakin' is all you heard, whippin' cocaine up is all you heard
Splash splash was all you heard, came in the house and it's all you heard
