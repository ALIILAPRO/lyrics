		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey blondie, there's a million eyes on you
Do you ever get curious?
Hey blondie, there's a million minds on you
Do you ever get furious?
Hey blondie, if I ever took mine off you
Would you even get curious?
Hey blondie
Oh, hey blondie

Hey blondie, could you maybe just slide towards me?
Don't want anything serious
Hey blondie, could you maybe just cry for me
If we ever get serious?
I know sticks and stones and big glass homes
Don't hurt you 'cause you're so perfect
I know you get so lonely, but you're not lonely
Well, watch it, 'cause you're still workin'

Do you ever get weak like Monday morning, baby girl?
Do you want it to end like Sunday? Sorry, darling
Do you ever get tired like ropes and wires, baby girl?
There's a million eyes on you
There's a million eyes on you

Hey blondie, I took a million tries for you
And I wanna take a million more
Hey blondie, if you ever get tired of me
Just remember what I'm really here for
Those twists and turns that feel like cursive
But you don't crumble
You might miss one step, and you still don't stumble
And I just wonder

Do you ever get weak like Monday morning, baby girl?
Do you want it to end like Sunday? Sorry, darling
Do you ever get tired like ropes and wires, baby girl?
There's a million eyes on you
There's a million eyes on you
There's a million eyes on you
There's a million eyes on you

(There's a million eyes on you)
(Eyes)
(There's a million eyes on you)
(There's a million eyes on you)
(Oh, hey blondie)
Oh, hey blondie
