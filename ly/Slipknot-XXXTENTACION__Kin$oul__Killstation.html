Uh, won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break, uh

Lost in the pessimistic state of perception
It's been hard to participate in natural instances
And due to my history, I don't know what's next for me
But keep my composure, fuck over anyone next to me
If dean detriment told me love was for negligent
Motherfuckers that can't seem to keep wearin' their head
I'm not self-aware, I'm misled, I'm a hypocrite like the rest
I will kill myself if it benefit all of my fucking friends
I'm sorry mama, I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I could test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said
I didn't mean to fucking hurt you
If I had to test my worth, I'll show you heaven on this earth
So if alive or in the dirt
I swear to God, you'll be my first priority
Before the hurt, that mean for better or for worse
I said

Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not, uh
Won't fall my nigga, I slip not
I won't be dead, misled, ahead, I never break, uh

Through the soulless pit, I never slip, I get a grip
My mind drift to a place, where the devil lives
My soul rise to the sky, made of abyss
With the evidence, that I made with the elements
Fuck your settlement, let's settle this now
We tearing it down, we make these incredible sounds
We cherish them now
The pain that was never announced, we singin' it out
They look around confused like they ain't figure it out

Oh, you can't run away
From everything you made
You try to erase
Memories will fade
