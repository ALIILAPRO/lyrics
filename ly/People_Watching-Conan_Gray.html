		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That wasn't funny, but she laughed so hard, she almost cried
They're countin' months they've been together, almost forty-nine
He's makin' fun of how she acted 'round the holidays
She wears a ring, but they tell people that they're not engaged
They met in class for metaphysical philosophy
He tells his friends, "I like her 'cause she's so much smarter than me"
They're having talks about their futures until 4AM
And I'm happy for them

But I wanna feel all that love and emotion
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'
Someday I'll be fallin' without caution
But for now I'm only people watchin'

I'm only lookin' just to live through you vicariously
I've never really been in love, not seriously
I had a dream about a house behind a picket fence
Next one I choose to trust, I hope I use some common sense
But I cut people out like tags on my clothing
I end up all alone, but I still keep hoping

I wanna feel all that love and emotion
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'
Someday I'll be fallin' without caution
But for now I'm only people watchin'

Cut people out like tags on my clothing
I end up all alone, but I still keep hoping
I won't be scared to let someone know me
Life feels so monotone, but I still keep hoping
Cut people out like tags on my clothing
I end up all alone, but I still keep hoping
I won't be scared to let someone know me
Life feels so monotone, but I still keep hoping

I feel love emotion

I wanna feel all that love and emotion
Be that attached to the person I'm holdin'
Someday I'll be fallin' without caution
But for now I'm only people watchin'
