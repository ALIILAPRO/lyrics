		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love is fadin'
I feel it's fadin'

When no one ain't around
I feel it's fadin'
I think I think too much
I feel it's fadin'
Ain't nobody watchin'
I feel it's fadin'
I just fade away

I feel it
Fade away
I feel it
I feel it
Fade away-ay-ay-ay
I think I think too much
I feel it
Your love is fadin'
I feel it

Roll up, roll up
Hold up, hold up
Po' up, po' up
I feel it
I love to
I wanna
I'm tryna
I feel it
I'ma rock the boat
Work the middle 'til it hurt a little
I feel it
Your love is fadin'
I feel it

Fuckin' with a real ass nigga
I feel it
Fuck how you feel ass nigga
I feel it
Bitch better act like you know better
I feel it
Woah

When no one ain't around
I feel it's fadin'
I think I think too much
I feel it's fadin'
Ain't nobody watchin'
I feel it's fadin'
I just fade away
I feel it's fadin'

You don't even know
I've been so far gone
I feel it
I've been so led on
I've been runnin' 'round
I feel it
I've been on my shit
Whole world on my dick
I feel it
I just need to know
I can feel it

Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Oh, deep inside
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside
I can feel it
Oh, deep inside
Oh, I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Oh, I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Oh, deep inside
Oh, I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside
I feel it
Yes, deep inside
Oh, I get lifted, yes
Deep, deep, down inside
I get
I feel it's fadin'
Oh, I get lifted, yes

I feel it's fadin'
I feel it's fadin'
I feel it
I feel it's fadin'
