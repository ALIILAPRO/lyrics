		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swim too quickly
'Cause big waves are hard to jump over
You're not sweet, not sickly
You don't taste like nothing when I'm sober
And I already wanna die
You just make it like ten times worse
And I heard that you tell the guys I'm the worst
You come 'round on Monday
And goddamn, you stink like you've missed me
I find it funny
You don't close your eyes when you kiss me

And I'm sick of your puppy eyes
You said boys should never cry
Well, surprise, I bet no one's ever told you

You bought me some flowers, I gave them to someone else
Told me that you loved me, you're just talking to yourself
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna hear it
Let yourself out, you're so conceited, yeah, yeah
You bought me some flowers, I gave them to someone else
Told me that you loved me, you're just talking to yourself
And I don't wanna know, I don't wanna hear it
Let yourself out, you're so conceited, yeah, yeah

You're far too easy
You hide between the lines but I read you
It's a pity
I get off when I mislead you
And say I, I, don't want no others guy
Pretend I love your suit and tie
It's fun playing with a man's mind for once
And you say come over
Say please, I might think about it
You lost composure
And I don't think you ever found it

And I'm sick of your puppy eyes
You said boys should never cry
Well, surprise, I bet no one's ever told you

You bought me some flowers, I gave them to someone else
Told me that you loved me, you're just talking to yourself
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna hear it
Let yourself out, you're so conceited, yeah, yeah
You bought me some flowers, I gave them to someone else
Told me that you loved me, you're just talking to yourself
I don't wanna know, I don't wanna hear it
Let yourself out, you're so conceited, yeah, yeah

You bought me some flowers, I gave them to someone else
Told me that you loved me, you're just talking to yourself
And I don't wanna know, I don't wanna hear it
Let your goddamn self out, you're so conceited, yeah, yeah
