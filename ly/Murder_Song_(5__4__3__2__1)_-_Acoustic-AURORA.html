		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one

He holds
The gun
Against
My head
I close
My eyes
And bang
I am dead
I know
He knows
That he's
Killing me
For mercy

And here I go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And here I go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And he holds my body
In his arms
He didn't mean
To do no harm
And he holds
Me tight

Oh, he did it all
To spare me from
The awful things 
In life that comes
And he cries
And cries
I know
He knows
That he's
Killing me
For mercy

And here I go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And here I go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

He holds my body
In his arms
He didn't mean
To do no harm
And he holds
Me tight

Oh, he did it all
To spare me from
The awful things
In life that comes
And he cries
And cries

Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one
Five, four, three, two, one

The gun is gone 
And so am I
And here I go
