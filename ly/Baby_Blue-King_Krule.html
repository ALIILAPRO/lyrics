		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl, I could've been someone to you
Would've painted the skies blue

Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue 

Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl, I've got no chance and nothing to say
Girl, but stay here for a little while

Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue 

But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last, baby blue

(You are my) baby
(You are my baby)
(I was your slave, can't you see?)
(I was just playin' in the sea)

Bobbin' on the problem
On the problem, on the bobbin'
She was falling, I was bawling
My heart was stopping, she was throbbing
Oh
