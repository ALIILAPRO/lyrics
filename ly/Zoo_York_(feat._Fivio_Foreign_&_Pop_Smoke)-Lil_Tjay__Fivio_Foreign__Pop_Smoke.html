Bow-bow-bow-bow, bow
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York

Walk in the spot and it's litty, designer through city, you know I'ma turn up (ayy)
Bro got the Henney and I got a blunt, fuck around, throw a band when I burn up (ayy)
Shawty right here, she a freak and she move like a pro, tryna dance, so I churn her (bow)
Then she feelin' my dick, it's the burner (ayy)
She ain't used to my bop, she a learner (ayy, ayy, ayy)
I had to flex up, I done copped a new pieces to glitter my neck up
They ain't fuckin' protect us, we was young niggas dreamin' 'bout flingin' Pateks up (bow)
They was tryna arrest us, fuck all them niggas, don't let me get 'fessed up (bow)
Nigga think he a wrestler (bow), I might just teach him some shit, no semester (bow-bow-bow-bow)
I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta get to the bag, ah (bag)
Damn (damn), I think I fell in love with the cash
I been in the studio workin' hard to the max
I can't (I can't), I cannot never, ever fall back (ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm on my Birkin, nigga (yeah)
Run up, we merkin' niggas (bow)
I got some shooters they ready to ride (boom, boom, boom)
I send 'em, they lurkin' nigga (bow-bow-bow-bow)
I'm on my Birkin, nigga
Run up, I'm merkin' niggas (gang, gang)
I got some shooters they ready to ride
I send 'em, they lurkin' nigga (bow-bow-bow-bow)

Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York (woo)
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York

Look, I'm from the town (I'm from the town)
Send me the addy, I'm huntin' him down (grr)
Get off the stage and I jump in the crowd (ayy)
They keep sayin' we too wild (bow)
I fell in love with the crowd (I did)
They fell in love with the sound (they did)
Grr, bow, bow-bow-bow-bow
Attention (attention), move 'round with a vengeance (ayy)
Bow, bend 'em, throw it down, offend them
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm with the demons and henchmen (I am)
Uh, uh, we can't wait until we see as a victim
Give me the money, I need it, I'm itchin' (I am)
Them niggas know when I see them, it's different (ayy)
Uh, I know they a opp 'cause my finger keep twitchin' (ayy)
Bow, leavin' him lifted (leavin' him lifted)
Blicky, blick him (blick him), blick him (blick him), blick him (bow)

Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York (woo)
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York

Got fifty-two shots in this Glock but a nigga won't let him
Xd, a nigga totin' Beretta
Ruffle them feathers (don't get shot)
I leave 'em deader
I got your bitch suckin' on my treasure
I woo from the floor, yeah, we do it better
I got the hoes like I'm Hugh Hefner
Bitch, I'm a dog, I'm a blue devil
One dead in Nieman, scannin', it's readin'
Perc hit, I'm geekin', shit turned me to a demon
Bad bitch named RiRi, nice, but treeshy
She want me to breed her, I'm like, "Nah, bitch, you sneaky"
I make it rain on whoever, I make it rain that woo weather
Nigga, I put in pain, shooter in the driver in the red Cartier frames
Crush the paper, fry the tool, put an eighth in my spliff, roll
Get in my zone, hop in my Rolls, smokin' opps to the face

Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York (woo)
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York
