		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pure hearts and stumble
In my hands they crumble
And fragile and stripped to the core
I can't hurt you anymore
Loved by numbers
You loosing life's wonder
And touch like strangers detached
I can't feel you anymore

The sunshine, trapped in our hearts
It could rise again, but I'm lost
And crushed
I'm cold and confused with no guiding light left inside
You were my guiding light, mhm yeah

Oh-oh, oh-oh
When comfort and warmth can't be found, I still reach for you
But I'm lost and crushed
I'm cold and confused with no guiding light left inside

You're my guiding light
You're my guiding light
When there's no guiding light left inside
When there's no guiding light in our lives
