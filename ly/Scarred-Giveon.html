		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dry your eyes
This is hard but it's okay
I just don't want you same way you want me
I can't give you my heart 'cause it's broken
But still come home with me

Oh, come closer
Drop your bag on the sofa
You're under me but I'm not over
Not over all the things I told you
Oh babe, I'm broken
Numb to all of your emotion
My last love was cold
So now I gotta be the coldest

It's too bad you want my love
You cry, but I don't budge
You try, it's not enough
Not your fault, girl, it's me
I'm scarred

It's too bad you want my love (too bad you want my love)
You cry, but I don't budge
You try, it's not enough
Not your fault, girl, it's me
I'm scarred

It's too bad
Too bad
Not your fault girl, it's me
Oh, yeah

Stay the night
This is hard but it's okay
Honestly, I just want you to hold me
Tried to give you my heart, I was hoping
That all the things you say and do will make me love you, baby
Oh, it's too bad
Don't mean to
Lead you on, waste your time, just because
Girl, I know, I'm what you want
But I'm still just not ready to fall for you yet

Oh, come closer
Drop your bag on the sofa
You're under me but I'm not over
Not over all the things I told you
Oh babe, I'm broken
Numb to all of your emotion
My last love was cold
So now I gotta be the coldest

It's too bad you want my love
You cry, but I don't budge
You try, it's not enough
Not your fault girl it's me
I'm scarred

It's too bad you want my love (too bad you want my love)
You cry, but I don't budge (you cry)
You try, it's not enough
Not your fault girl it's me
I'm scarred

It's too bad
Too bad
Not your fault girl, it's me
Oh yeah
