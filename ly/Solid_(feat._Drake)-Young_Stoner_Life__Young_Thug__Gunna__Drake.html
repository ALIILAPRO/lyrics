		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy
Slip, slide, tryna provide for me
For me
For me

Find me somewhere out in London, you know that's the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been makin' donations, see you like United Way, you know how I do
Stories you told me 'bout him, I can see that it's night and day, he told me the truth
Walkin' from here to my bedroom, it feel like it's miles away, there's too many rooms

And I'm still hard body, I don't fear nobody
Phantom whips, I'm ridin', all my friendships solid
I get big deposits, all my whips exotic

Revvin' the engine, whoa
City dependin', I gotta finish it
I want opinions, why? She want a demon, yeah
She want a ring or some sort of arrangement, yeah
Somethin' that's dangerous
I wanna change it, I wanna claim it, yeah
I want it painted, yeah
She quick to say, "No", 'cause she know she a diamond, uh
She gettin' quiet, uh
She on a diet, she want a massage, yeah
Tryna get intimate, ayy
Bank account never diminishin', yeah
Niggas are changing they images, yeah
Niggas act hard but they innocent, yeah
Hop in a tank and move militant
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Find me somewhere out in London, you know that's the hideaway
I need some head and some moral support from you right away
Since I been makin' donations, see you like United Way, you know how I do
Stories you told me 'bout him, I can see that it's night and day, he told me the truth
Walkin' from here to my bedroom, it feel like it's miles away, there's too many rooms

And I'm still hard body, I don't fear nobody
Phantom whips, I'm ridin', all my friendships solid
I get big deposits, all my whips exotic

Trunk on the engine, I'm on a mission
The Bronco two-fifty, I'm out your division
I got 'em excited, know it's been a lil' minute
I left her delighted, man, I love all her Chrome Hearts
These suckers despised it, the touch is the Midas
She said, "Fuck me and cum," I just do it like Loverboy Nike
Ordered the jet just for you and your friends
Chauffeur you 'round in that big body Benz
Got a lil' bitch that came up from nothing
We shoppin' in London and doin' it big
Been in private but we out in public
I know we the topic for you and your kids
Life's Monopoly, goin' broke not a option
If they could've stopped it, they would've been did
They would've been dead, she could be the wig
Don't play with my head, don't you test my emotions
Don't be textin' my phone every day, I'ma leave it on read
I'm diggin' and strokin'
My new bitch pussy wet like a ocean, I need a new spread
The solid one chosen
Young Gunwunna stay focused, I can't let 'em put me on edge

No, they cannot put me on edge
I just bust down my wrist and it's rose gold and it's ahead
I just put pointers on fingers
I just counted ten million, all cash, and got head from the feds
Woo, yeah, I just told 'em if he play then we stoppin' the growth of they dreads (stoppin')
I just had talk with the peppermint Porsch
That I'm never gon' drive 'em this year (skrr, skrr, skrr, skrr)
Feel the panoramic doors, we got fours and deuces, toast
I'm the big dog of my coast (whoa)
Micro minis with the scopes (uh)
Ain't tellin' this bitch my goals (my goals)
Had her livin' at the Montrose (Montrose)
I'ma peep, but a player not poor (yeah)
I been thinkin' 'bout selling my soul (woo)
Take me out the country and drop me in apartments, she won't see me cry
I just put macaroni cheese in my pocket, it came with the sides
I just put twenty mil' inside a escrow, I don't give a fuck 'bout your life
You had a bust, but that shit was too little, I promise you never was hot
