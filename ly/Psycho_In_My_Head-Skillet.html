		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'm just paranoid
Or maybe I'm just livin' a lie
Can't stop this screamin' voice
Or maybe I'm just sick inside

This is the face
I hate the other side of me
Out of this cage
He breaks to take the life from me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I'm not crazy

There's a psycho in my head
I'm closer to the edge
Makin' me feel like I'm livin' in misery, misery
Insane
These voices in my brain
Starting to feel like it's gonna be the death of me, death of me

There's a psycho in my, there's a psycho in my head

Livin' in hysteria
Nothin' makes much sense tonight
Maybe I'm too scared to trust
To stop the chaos in my mind

This is the face
I hate the other side of me
Help me believe
I need to see the light in me
Tell me, tell me, tell me
I'm not crazy (crazy)

There's a psycho in my head
I'm closer to the edge
Makin' me feel like I'm livin' in misery, misery
Insane
These voices in my brain
Starting to feel like it's gonna be the death of me, death of me

There's a psycho in my, there's a psycho in my

Maybe I'm just paranoid
Or maybe I'm just livin' a lie
Can't stop this screamin' voice
Or maybe I'm just sick inside

Yeah
I'm not crazy, I'm not crazy
Though I might be

'Cause there's a psycho in my head
I'm closer to the edge
Makin' me feel like I'm livin' in misery, misery
Insane
These voices in my brain
Starting to feel like it's gonna be the death of me, death of me

There's a psycho in my 
There's a psycho in my head
(Livin' in misery, misery, insane)
There's a psycho in my head
(Gonna be the death of me, death of me)
There's a psycho in my, there's a psycho in my head
