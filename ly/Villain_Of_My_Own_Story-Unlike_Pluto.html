		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh-we ooh-we, oh-we ooh-we)

I was the one who wanted nothin'
I was the one who lived in pain
I was the one who strived for nothin'
I was the one who stood in rain

Ah, I feel like I'm no good
I should run away ah, I feel like failure's
One step ahead of me

Fuck all the people with the
Bentleys with their nice lives
Fuck all the people in the
Mansions with their bright skies
Fuck all the people sittin' pretty
With their sane minds
Fuck, think I'm becomin' the
Villain of my story

And I am the one that's holding grudges
I am the one that lives in pain
I am the one who's out of touch and
I am the one inflicting pain

Ah, I feel like I'm no good
I should run away ah, I feel like failure's
One step ahead of me

Fuck all the people with the
Bentleys with their nice lives
Fuck all the people in the
Mansions with their bright skies
Fuck all the people sittin' pretty
With their sane minds
Fuck, think I'm becomin' the
Villain of my story

And I've been the bad guy for so long
I'm growing tired
Is it too damn late to twist the plot?
To turn it 'round
