		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I drive you away?
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one we know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah, that's what I'll do

I say, oh
I say, oh

My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
That's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
Oh yeah, I will, yeah, I will, yes, I will

I said, oh
I cry, oh

Yeah, I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah, I saw sparks
Sing it loud

La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
