		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why is there so much faking under the Sun?
Everyone I see makes me just wanna run

Can't buy me loving
Can't buy me loving, la-la-la
Can't buy me loving
Me loving, me loving
Can't buy me loving
Can't buy me loving, la-la-la
Can't buy me loving
Me loving

Every time you say "I do"
And I just can't stop all the thoughts that cross my mind
What if I don't give you?
What you're craving for, would you leave me behind?
Life is full of treachery and pain
You're only in for the money, in love with my money
I don't care much for you, get out of my sight
And leave me behind

Why is there so much faking under the Sun?
Everyone I see makes me just wanna run

Every time you say "I do"
And I just can't stop all the thoughts that cross my mind
What if I don't give you?
What you're craving for, would you leave me behind?
Life is full of treachery and pain
You're only in for the money, in love with my money
I don't care much for you, get out of my sight
And leave me behind

Every time you say "I do"
And I just can't stop all the thoughts that cross my mind
What if I don't give you?
What you're craving for, would you leave me behind?
Life is full of treachery and pain
You're only in for the money, in love with my money
I don't care much for you, get out of my sight
And leave me behind
And leave me behind
