		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't look at old photos
Get that from my mother
Wish I looked more like her
I can't find the words that
Can match all her colors
I know my face seems angry
It's really just hunger
The comedown is tough
But for me it's the come up

Time moves like traffic lights changin'
Steady they go, but I'm growing impatient
My winters are colder than yours
You don't know me
Gory to the core and you said I was boring

But I was just nervous bottle of Advil
Heavenly purchase stay on my nightstand
Kill off the voices i just want purpose
But I'll hear a song I didn't write
And then forfeit

Get out the way now i spеw burns when
I'm feeling burnt out
But plan B's are a crisis
Pray for silver linings yеah, no sleep
Can't shake the way
That we keep getting older

Drive past my hometown like a guest
Windows down and the heat high
Parts of me I grew out of
No chance to wave goodbye
I try, to stay out the rearview
To stay on the dashboard
To never look backwards
'Cause if I do it makes me wish
I'd gotten here faster

Time moves like traffic lights changin'
Steady they go, but I'm growing impatient
I won't bend the truth for
The sake of the story
Gory to the core and you said I was boring

But I was just nervous bottle of Advil
Heavenly purchase stay on my nightstand
Kill off the voices i just want purpose
But I'll hear a song I didn't write
And then forfeit

But I was just nervous bottle of Advil
Heavenly purchase stay on my nightstand
Kill off the voices i just want purpose
But I'll hear a song I didn't write
And then forfeit
