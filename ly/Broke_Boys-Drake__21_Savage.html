		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ayy
Hop in that bitch and I start the V
Snakes in the grass so they harder to see
My brother would give up his life to the O
He told me he'll go be a martyr for me
Said that she ready to come to the 6ix
I hit up Pauleen, the charter, the P
Ain't really leave but I'm back in (back in)
I'm back in (back in), I'm back in (back in)
I'm ridin' around in Atlanta with Sav'
'Cause that nigga been goin' harder than me
Nothin' had changed, I'm just harder to please
Ferrari is makin' an SUV
We ain't got a choice, we orderin' these
Shout out Noel for recordin' the V's

He know where this shit 'bout to go, 'cause nobody touchin' the flow
They say you alone at the top, but it's gotta be lonely below
You boys gettin' ready to diss, but don't even mention the O
And don't even mention a foe unless you boys tryna go broke

Whoa, I got more stripes than Adidas
(Yeah, I got the stripes, but fuck Adidas, nigga)
I don't chase bitches, I leave 'em
(Hoes screamin' like I'm Justin Bieber, nigga)
I don't get mad, I get even
(Hit you niggas like a buzzer beater, nigga)
I don't get mad, I get even
(Hit you niggas then you gone)
Whoa, all that foundation she wearing, she think she QC
Tellin' all my sneaky links you with me
You must be Coach K 'cause you ain't P
I'm on a Jet like my last name Li
Two sticks in my hand like I'm playin' the Wii
G Block Babies will spank you for free
We rough niggas up, now they beggin' for peace (G Block Babies)
Steppin' on shit, I done fractured my toe
Born in October, I'm so OVO
Halloween come and he wanna dress up
But he don't need no costume, I'm turnin' him ghost
She called me mucus, I stay in her throat
Stick hit that boy, got his ass hittin' notes
My niggas wear masks so

You know where this shit 'bout to go, 'cause nobody touchin' the flow
They say you alone at the top, but it's gotta be lonely below
You boys gettin' ready to diss, but don't even mention the O
And don't even mention a foe unless you boys tryna go broke

Ah damn, man, you niggas is the worst
Savage snatch you out ya crib, then drop you in a hearse
Baby, please, when we nervous, stop reachin' in your purse
Nigga went and bought a house when he coulda bought a verse
Niggas dumb as fuck, imagine if I did that stupid shit when I was comin' up
My crib feel like a hedge fund, I be in here just thumbin' up
Know I'm SN1, 'til I'm done fuckin' London up
Niggas make me nauseous, I had enough of broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys, yeah, I can't talk to broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys, wait, yeah
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys, wait
All you niggas make me sick, wait
All you niggas rappin' 'bout the bricks and the licks
Then I hear in real life you livin' with your bitch
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys
I don't want no convo, I don't got no time for
Niggas postin' mansion, livin' in a condo
Y'all be make believin', I cannot relate to you
I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys
I cannot believe y'all was dissin' on the old boy
I can't even think on how you came up with that flow, boy
Please talk to someone else 'cause I can't talk to broke boy
I can't talk to broke boy, I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to broke boys
I can't talk to broke boys, nah, nah, I can't talk to broke boys, I can't talk to

That nigga's crazy
