		<p>
		  Ayy

I guess this my life, yeah, this my life, yeah
It won't go down twice, yeah, go down twice, yeah
Let a nigga try me, yeah, please don't try me
I know I be trippin' 'bout this shit, but it's all timin'

I can show you why you mad
Show you how to get a bag (bag)
Yeah, I lost a couple bags (bags)
But every time, I get it back (back)
I get it back and double that, yeah
She a bird, she a gnat (yeah)
I be worried 'bout the future
And she be worried 'bout the past, yeah
Past, I gotta finesse
Bitch, I be ballin', runnin' the wreck
Talkin' 'bout TEC, just pull up direct
For real, I can tell when they get vexed (yeah)
It's a lot to digest, yeah
I be tryna lie less, yeah
I can't make it make sense, yeah
I be doin' my best, yeah

I guess this my life, yeah, this my life, yeah
It won't go down twice, yeah, go down twice, yeah
Let a nigga try me, yeah, please don't try me
I know I be trippin' 'bout this shit, but it's all timin'

Lately I'm smokin' more, but I'm thinkin' less (less)
'Cause I get this feelin' inside of my chest
That's my regrets (regrets)
And I'm goin' up to him at the way you met me
Girl, I was a mess
Paranoia in my head, like you, "Do you want me for the check?"
But you love me and I don't gotta second guess
I got cribs, cars and Pateks
Lot of money, ten times more stress
Show what's more than our lovin'
I guess this my life now
Everywhere I go, it's cameras and lights now
I don't want advice now

I guess this my life, yeah, this my life, yeah
It won't go down twice, yeah, go down twice, yeah
Let a nigga try me, yeah, please don't try me
I know I be trippin' 'bout this shit, but it's all timin'

I'm takin' my life one day at a time
If I'm bein' honest I'm losin' my mind
Doin' these drugs that help pass the time
It is what it is, I swear I'll be fine
Man of my word, I creep through the vines
I come to your city and create a vibe
I fall in love every time I get high
She fall in love every time, a surprise
I do not care 'bout these hoes
Most importantly, get to that check
And you wanna glow how I glow
Well, let me teach you some finesse
It's funny how everything goes
Now we up, I don't have time to stress
We just gettin' to the racks
We just gettin' to the racks

I guess this my life, yeah, this my life, yeah
It won't go down twice, yeah, go down twice, yeah
Let a nigga try me, yeah, please don't try me
I know I be trippin' 'bout this shit, but it's all timin'
