		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High, there's a reason for my high
There's a whole world outside
I saw it last night
Yeah, they're saying I'm insane
'Cause I wanna go to space
And leave it all behind
And leave it all behind, I'm leaving

I, I've never, ever been this far away from home
And all alone, it gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
And I, I'm moving at the speed of light, I had to go
But now I know, it gets dark so I can see the stars

Yeah, my feet came off the ground
Gravity won't hold me down
No, not this time
I'm not who I used to be
'Cause I came out here to see
The universe inside

I'm leaving them behind
I'm leaving them

I (I), I've never, ever been this far away from home
And all alone, it gets dark, yeah, it gets dark
And I, I'm moving at the speed of light, I had to go
But now I know, it gets dark so I can see the stars

It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
It gets dark so I can see the stars
