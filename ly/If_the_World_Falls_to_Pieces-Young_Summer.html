		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now we have nothing to lose 
Flames look beautiful if you forget what they can do 
If they only knew

Oh at least we can say we tried
Never gave up  didn't go down without a fight 
Into the night  Into the night

Come sit by the window
To see from a better view
if the world falls to pieces 
At least I'll be with you

I'll save you 
You'd save me too

Come sit by the window
To see from a better view
if the world falls to pieces 
At least I'll be with you
At least I'll be with you
