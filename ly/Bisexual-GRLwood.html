		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time we talk, you use that word
Describing yourself as if I never heard
Is it something that you really want me to know?
Cus fuck you say it every single time I’m around
You say you’re bisexual,
I really wanna hold ya
Do you have a boyfriend?
I wanna be your boyfriend.
Every time we talk, its about your boyfriend,
I don’t really wanna hear anymore about him,
Can you talk about anything besides your boyfriend
Good goddamn I don’t wanna hear about your boyfriend
You say you’re bisexual
I really wanna hold ya
Do you have a boyfriend?
I wanna be your boyfriend.
Do you have a boyfriend?
I wanna be your boyfriend
You say you’re bisexual,
I really wanna hold ya
Do you have a boyfriend?
I wanna be your boyfriend
