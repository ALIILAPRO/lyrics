Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage

Miley Cyrus, catchin' bodies
Don't care, that pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage

Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage

Malibu, that's casual
Got the Michael Duke
Fit you with grab the tool
I'm with them animals
It's a real nigga, annual
Your hoe on automatic, put her on manual
She can't handle me, handle me and Betty Boop
You're lookin' for me, I'm in Saks Fifth Avenue
I just went and bought me some flashbangs
You can disappear, disrespectin' that gang
Travel Gold, ratata
You talkin' rarara
She got more mileage than a car, haha
And she just pull up to the spot (spot, spot)

Miley Cyrus, catchin' bodies
Don't care, that pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage
Miley Cyrus, catchin' bodies
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, that pussy got some mileage, mileage
Don't care, your pussy got some mileage, mileage
