		  (Exodus)
(Movement of Jah people)

Men and people will fight ya down
When ya see Jah light
Let me tell you if you're not wrong
Well, everything is all right
So we gonna walk
Through the roads of creation
We the generation
Tread through great tribulation

In this exodus
Good god almighty
Movement of Jah people
Exodus
The movement of Jah people

Oh, well, well, well
Open your heart, uh!
And look within
Are you satisfied
With the life you're living?
We know where we're going
We know where we're from
We're leaving Babylon
We're going to the Father's land

In this exodus
