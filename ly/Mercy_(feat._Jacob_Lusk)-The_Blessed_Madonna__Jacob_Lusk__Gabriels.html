		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

Have mercy, baby

Now that I am begging on my knees
I can finally see the things and how they used to be
Forever come my way, it's the choices that I made
I was surely thinking 'bout me

I lost the path, I lost the life within
Forgot that feat of fire for the same day
So don't watch mistakes I made
Was a friendship that I'd trade
Now I'm begging for forgiveness
Begging to be saved

Show me mercy with your love
I messed up and I miss your touch
Show me mercy, show me mercy
Have mercy on me

Now you got me begging on my knees
Lonely nights without you makes it harder for me to breathe
I think I'm missing you so much
I'm not strong enough, had enough
Baby, please come back, I'm feeling bad

I lost the path, I lost the life within
Forgot got that feat of fire for the same day
So don't watch mistakes I made
Was a friendship that I'd trade
Now I'm begging for forgiveness
Begging to be saved

Show me mercy with your love
I messed up and I miss your touch
Show me mercy
show me mercy
Have mercy on me

(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)

Show me mercy with your love
I messed up and I miss your touch
Show me mercy (have mercy on me)
Show me mercy
Have mercy on me

(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
(Have mercy on me)
