		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where I go, when I go there
No more memory anymore
Only men on distant ships
The women with them swimming with them to shore

Where I go, when I go there
No more whispering anymore
Only hymns upon your lips
A mystic wisdom, rising with them to shore

Touch me, just like that
And that, oh, yeah
Now, that's heaven
Now, that I like
God, that's so nice
Now lower down
Where the figs lie

(Oh, oh, my God, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Still, you must admit, with the two anatomies
It truly is daunting, I mean, how everything might

Measure up?

Not that I'm saying I wouldn't
I wouldn't want to not (touch me)
Would ever not want to 

Moritz?

I have to go! 

(Touch me) Moritz, wait!

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, my God

Where I go, when I go there
No more shadows anymore
Only men with golden fins
The rhythm in them, rocking with them to shore (where I go)
Where I go, when I go there
No more weeping anymore (no, no, no)
Only in and out your lips
The broken wishes, washing with them to shore (touch me)

Touch me (all silent)
All silent (baby, just tell me)
Tell me, please, "All is forgiven"
Touch
Consume my wine (oh)
Consume my mind (oh)
I'll tell you how, how the winds sigh
There I go, there I go

Touch me (oh, oh)
Just try it (just, just try it)
Now, that's it (now, there, that's it)
God, oh, that's heaven (oh, God that's heaven)
Touch
I'll love you right (oh, I'll love you right)
We'll wander down
Where the sins cry (where the sins cry)

Touch me, just like that (oh, oh, oh)
Now lower down, where the sins lie (oh, oh, yeah)
Love me (oh, love me, yeah), just for a bit 
(Ooh) we'll wander down, where the winds sigh
Where the winds sigh
Where the winds sigh
Where the winds sigh
