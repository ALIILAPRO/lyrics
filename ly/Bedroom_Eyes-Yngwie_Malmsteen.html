		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on baby, what's on your mind
You're stumbling in the darkness
Like you're running blind
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around
This same old graveyard
on the same playground
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
Be my late night movie star
By my nature I can tell who you are
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes
There's no innocence
In your bedroom eyes
Baby Baby
Got no self-defense
For your bedroom eyes
Over and over then we do it again
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around
Is there any way to stop this merry go round
