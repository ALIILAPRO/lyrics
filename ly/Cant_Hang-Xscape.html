		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get down
Let's get down

You claim you've been waiting
With no game
Just anticipating
How it would be
If you and I were in the sack
But to me
You look like you wouldn't know how to act

I need someone to hold me
(All night long)
It must be you my darling
(Am I wrong)
It ain't a damn thing baby
Show me what you can bring
Cause some try to swing but they still can't hang

You and me, let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang
I betcha can't hang

You and me, let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang
I betcha can't hang

You claim you can do this this and that
Ain't no shame in my game
If it's wack I gotta tell you that
So you betta be
(Up on your down stroke)
(You gotta know how to keep this boat afloat)
Cause in my mind think your gonna slip baby

I need someone to hold me
(All night long)
It must be you my darling
(Am I wrong)
It ain't a damn thing baby
Show me what you can bring
Cause some try to swing
But they still can't hang!

You and me, let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang
I betcha can't hang

You and me, let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang
I betcha can't hang

You talk alot of this
And you talk alot of that
Is it all fact
Brotha man are you Phat
Cause if it's on the real
I come with mad sex appeal
Flip light delicous 
You know the deal
Hey that's me
I be the chic
The one with the physique
I freak you in the sheets
I take a nigga deep down under
I make him wonder
How to make the lighting come before the thunder
That's the pleasure I bring
I make a nigga get up and sing:
Tinga linga ling ling
I got the pow
Da boogie and the bang bang
You can't hang don't talk da game

You and me, let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang
I betcha can't hang

You and me, let's get down
Even though you claim that you've been around
I betcha can't hang
I betcha can't hang
