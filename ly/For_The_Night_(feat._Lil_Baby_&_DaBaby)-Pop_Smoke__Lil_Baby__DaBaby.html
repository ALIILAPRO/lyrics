		  (CashmoneyAP)
Get 'em, get 'em, oh
Oh (I'm tryna fuckin' get 'em) 
Oh (I'm tryna fuckin' get 'em)
Oh, oh (get 'em)
Oh (gettin' big, goin' up)
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh

If I tell you once, won't tell you twice, yeah
I'm a thief in the night (thief in the night)

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (look)

If I call you bae, you bae for the day
Or a bae for the night, you not my wife
She want a killer to fuck all night
I wanna fuck on a thot, gimme head all night
AP, big rocks, in the hood with the 'Rillas
5K on the dinner, bring three hundred thou' to the dealer

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night (Baby)

I'm rich but I'm ridin', I'm low on exotic 
I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some
Nothin' ain't seen, all this money on me 
Hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun
Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets
Got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young 
And I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior
She beggin' for attention, I don't see her
C.I.P Pop, I wish that you could see us
Million cash plus whenever I go re-up
I got some niggas in the street, won't beat me
I got the industry tryna be me
I just go Ray Charles, they can't see me
I'm in a Rolls Royce with a RiRi

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night

Yeah, like a thief in the night (thief)
I pull up, give her D for the night (uh-huh)
Tryna fuck in the V, it's aight (let's fuck)
We can't fuck up my seats 'cause they white (watch my seats, watch my motherfuckin' seats)
I'm livin' like "Thriller," I only come out at the night time
She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy
She don't do the Henny, just white wine (what she do?)
Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio (yeah)
I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho (zoom)
Park the Porsche and pull up in a Lambo 
I hop out, Major Payne, rockin' camo (yessir)
Think she cute, make her fuck, let her man go (she cute)
Like to shoot, light you up, bitch, I'm Rambo
Cuban link full of rocks, it's a choker (oh)
Rest in peace to the Pop, make me smoke ya

I did some wrong (oh, oh), but I'm always right (oh, oh)
Said I know how to shoot (oh, oh) and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night
