		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another zero to sell me off
Negotiate with the universe
To gain some extra privilege
And make you good in the image

Hollywood chic, drink my pride
And I'll be flavor of the week, I'll get inside
Pick up the award for best rock act, apart from that
And that and that and that

Do you love me yet?
I'll make myself a fool for you
Do you love me yet?
Just tell me what I've gotta do
Do you love me yet?
Do you promise I'll be healin' soon?

Oh, if I can stop fucking around
I'll be worth a fortune
Do you love me yet?

Exploit a fan base and call it love
Be controversial but just enough
It sounds kinda like ELO
Get sued but you'll meet a hero, hey, yeah

Holdin' me up, and I'm divine
Before a culture takes a turn, eats me alive
Pick up the award for best rock act, apart from that
And that and that and that

Do you love me yet?
I'll make myself a fool for you
Do you love me yet?
Just tell me what I've gotta do, oh
Do you love me yet?
Do you promise I'll be healin' soon?

Oh, if I can stop fucking around
I'll be worth a fortune, yeah
If I stop fucking around
I'll be worth a fortune
Do you love me yet?
Oh, oh

Let me in the world above
If there's nothin' on me
If there's nothin' on me
What's left when I'm gone?
Your life just isn't long enough
Don't stop, give it to me
Don't stop, give it to me
I want it all, I

Do you love me yet?
I'll make myself a fool for you
Do you love me yet?
Just tell me what I've gotta do
Do you love me yet?
Do you promise I'll be healin' soon?

Oh, if I can stop fucking around
I'll be worth a fortune, yeah
If I stop fucking around
I'll be worth a fortune
Do you love me yet?
Oh, yeah
