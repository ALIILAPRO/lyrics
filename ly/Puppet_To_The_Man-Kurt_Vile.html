		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I bet by now you probably think I'm a puppet to the man
Well, I'll tell you right now, you best believe that I am
Sometimes I'm stuck and then I think I can't unglue it
Sometimes I'm stuck and then I think I can't unglue it

This one goes out to all those who want the rat to survive
And of course by this, I am alluding I want him to die
My sister's stuck and she don't think she can unglue it
Sometimes I get stuck in a rut, too, it's okay, girlfriend
Sometimes I'm in a rut so much, I don't want it to end

Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, I bet by now you probably think I'm a puppet to the man
Well, I shout it out loud, because I know that I am
Sometimes I'm stuck and then I think I can't unglue it
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
Will you help me do it?
