		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Found myself today singing out your name
You said I'm crazy
If I am I'm crazy for you

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy
But it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave, just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over
Send me spinning closer to you

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into

Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you
