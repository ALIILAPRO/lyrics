		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde, fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish, no Donald Glover 
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?" got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh-oh-oh)

We were only getting better (only getting better)
Driving in a circle, a whirlpool, going 'round forever (going 'round forever)
How could I be so lucky? 
Nobody has loved me without all the pressure (without all the pressure)
Of making tiny errands (of making tiny errands)
'Cause we just laugh it off, still having a ball
I don't wanna go home 'til the rest ('til the rest) of my life (of my life)
You know nothing compares to the shattering feeling I get
Oh, when you're not right there, no

I was all alone with the love (with the love) of my life (of my life)
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night (oh, oh, oh), no
I don't need no light to see you

Shine
It's your golden hour (oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (oh-oh-oh)
