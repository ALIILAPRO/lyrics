		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

Steady tryin' to maintain
Same things that a blood bitch may frame
My brain can't fathom what the hate say
He say, she say, how 'bout me say?
Get the Visa
Headed to the islands ASAP 
What's that on my shawty wrist? That's a AP
I'm the type to save a bitch, C-A-P-E
Feeling like ET, flying out of the Addy
Fucking on shawty, she baddie
Casual convo then at it
I mean I'm better than better, maybe I'm lying
I'm sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain't love?
I'ma find a perfect balance, it's gon' take time
I heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty still in love through the grapevine
Heard shawty in love through the grapevine

Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be all, we gon' be all
We gon' be all, we gon' be all
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be all, we gon' be alright
We gon' be all, we gon' be all
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be all, we gon' be all
We gon' be alright, we gon' be all
Mix a little bit of weed with a little bit of cash
With a little bit of this, with a little bit of that
We gon' be all, we gon' be all
We gon' be all, we gon' be all

Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why

She said I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you
I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you
I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you
I, oh, I, am falling for you, falling for you

Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
Why am I so in love?
I don't know why
