		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm flawless and by that I mean I'm perfectly flawed yeah
Ain't nobody gonna tell me I'm not yeah
I've been telling y'all but baby this is my year
My Year
I've been working in the kitchen
Stirring up success
I've got it baked up to perfection
Not worried bout no mention
I've been looking at the vision
Only moving forward
Ain't got no time for no opinions
Cause I'm that girl
Yeah you can't stop he being that girl
You act like self love is a crime now
Well lock me up I'll do the time now
Yeah you hate on me cause you ain't like me
Can't get my name out your mouth I see
Don't vibe with your negativity
Ain't matched up with my energy
So au revoir to your bad Ora
Cause I know what your bad motives are
Don't test me cause you won't get that far
I'm flawless and by that I mean I'm perfectly flawed yeah
Ain't nobody gonna tell me I'm not yeah
I've been telling y'all but baby this is my year
My Year
I'm flawless and by that I mean I'm perfectly flawed yeah
Don't fit a standard or your stereotypes yeah
Think it's your mindset that should change and not mine yeah
Mmh Yeah
Work that body
Go on girl
Hit that gym
Work on that Pilates
I've been tailoring my time
Working on my body
Pay offs looking might fine
Oh she a little hottie
Ooh girl where you get that
They say fake it till you make it
Work that ego
Like placebo
Don't forget girl
They gonna hate you
Like Regina out of mean girls
The way you shine the way you walk
In for the kill feminine boss
Work those big doughy blue eyes
You a damsel but you ain't lost
Okay but when?
Oh yeah that's right
No I didn't want your opinion
I'll be sleeping just fine
Knowing you hate say that to my Millions
People watching me now
Like I'm a pill
Call it prescription
It's just me myself and my crew
And don't forget god he rides with us too
Why you crying
Dry your eyes and
Come with me
I'll set you free
Oh why you crying
Cause I'm flawless
Yeah I'm tripping with the sauce
Yeah I'm saucy
Down with the girls and all boys the wanna wife me
Classy girl I hold it down
I keep it lowkey yeah
Cause they like me like me like me
Yeah they really like me like me like me
Wanna be just like me like me like me
I'm flawless cause I like me like me yeah
