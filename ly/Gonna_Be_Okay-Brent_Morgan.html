		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't listen to the voice inside your head
You're doing just fine
You're trying your best
If no one ever told you it's all gonna be okay
We're just people never sleeping over stupid shit
We won't remember in the morning
Yeah, we're gonna forget
And no one ever told you it's all gonna be okay

When you lose faith in everything you ever knew
Don't give up on you

When life gets overwhelming
Relying on yourself iss hard to do
But don't give up on you, no
If you've been lost and lonely
Ashamed to be alone with only you
With no one left to lose
If it's the last thing that you do
Don't give up on you

You've been living off opinions for way too long
Afraid to be right, ashamed to be wrong
If no one told you it's all gonna be okay
Those people always keeping up to keep you down
Stop looking for a reason just to keep 'em around
I know they never told you it's all gonna be okay

When you lose faith in everything you ever knew
Don't give up on you

When life gets overwhelming
Relying on yourself it's hard to do
But don't give up on you, no
If you've been lost and lonely
Ashamed to be alone with only you
With no one left to lose
If it's the last thing that you do
Don't give up on you

There's no one like you, yeah
One to one
Never gonna find another like you, yeah 
You, there's no one like you, yeah
One to one
Never gonna find another like you, yeah

When life gets overwhelming
Relying on yourself is hard to do
But don't give up on you, no
If you've been lost and lonely
Ashamed to be alone with only you
With no one left to lose
If it's the last thing that you do
Don't give up on you
