		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here lies the lifeless bride and groom
Till' death do us part came far too soon
Buildings burn and people die all of the time

But I heard that you reap what you sow
So around and around we go
And when you see my face you'll know

You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow
You can't save yourself

These vengeful thoughts trapped underneath
Rage, scorn, misery
Payback for what you took from me
Hope, love, sanity

I heard that you reap what you sow
So here's to believing in ghosts
Now when you see my face you'll know

You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow

No forgiveness, just farewell
From the match made in heaven
You sent straight to hell
No forgiveness, no escape
May you rest in pieces
For your grave mistake

For your grave mistake
You can't save yourself
Or save your soul
When you meet the man whose life you stole
With weathered wings and broken bones
A flight for the fallen flies the crow
You can't save yourself

No, you can't save yourself
For your grave mistake
You can't save yourself
