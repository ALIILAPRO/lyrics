		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey

How do my plans fit in with yours? (Oh)
You're such a doll and I'm a boy
Where did my parents go? (Oh, oh)
I'm not in Italy
They like vacation homes much more than they love me

You're made of plastic, I'm just blood
When I was born, you were produced

I wish I was a toy
You say, "Hahahahahaha"
And you laugh
And I cry

Half of my heart is in your chest
I'm not a mama's boy
I'd go see Italy
I'd go see Tuscany
If you could come with me

Maxa-Maxa-Million, what you waiting up for?
Please come out and play with us more
Izzy Izzy Izzybell likes to stay in the house
Please come out and play with us now
M-A-M-A-B-O-Y, mama's boy, mama's boy
M-A-M-A-B-O-Y, mama's boy, mama's boy
Mama's boy, mama's boy
M-A-M-A-B-O-Y, mama's boy, mama's boy
M-A-M-A-B-O-Y, mama's boy, mama's boy
M-A-M-A-B-O-Y, mama's boy, mama's boy
M-A-M-A-B-O-Y, mama's boy, mama's boy
