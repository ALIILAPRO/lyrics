		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh

This year's moving light speed
I fear that I might be
Spiraling with my foot down
Somebody cut the brakes now
Time flies out the window
I cling to the echo
Wondering where they're headed
Everywhere but the present

I'm lost in living
In tunnel vision
At all my limits

So I keep on hitting cruise control
Busy going nowhere slow
Stuck inside my own mind
Watching life from the outside in overdrive
Scared I'm gonna lose control
Stranger living in my bones
Turning off the headlights
Take a ride to the dark side in overdrive

Keep on hitting cruise control 
Oh, oh

My thoughts on a landslide
Two feet on a fault line (fault line)
Wondering why I'm shaking
How did I get so complacent?

I'm lost in living
In tunnel vision
At all my limits

So I keep on hitting cruise control
Busy going nowhere slow
Stuck inside my own mind
Watching life from the outside in overdrive
Scared I'm gonna lose control
Stranger living in my bones
Turning off the headlights
Take a ride to the dark side in overdrive

Keep on hitting cruise control 
Oh, oh
