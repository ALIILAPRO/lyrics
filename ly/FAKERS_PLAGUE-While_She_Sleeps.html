		  Pretenders
You've got a way with words
You've got a lot of nerve
Pretenders
Fuck this shit
I'd rather be a sinner than a hypocrite
I'm losing the will to live 
I can't get enough of it
There's a mirror at the end of the road

I can't do right for doing wrong, someone save me
Scratch that, I'll be wrong on my own
I'm tired of wasting my time, you're overrated 
I don't trust this, I don't know where I am (do you?)
I just can't see it for the sleight of hand 
I wish I knew where to start

Calling all pretenders
Evoke, provoke
Dead eyes look white to the snowed, mainline the vulnerable
Calling all pretenders
We're living in a world too vicious to love

We will stamp our feet and hope the devil can hear us
So he's waiting when you arrive
We won't be far behind
It's like we're feeling our way through the dark
There's a mirror at the end of the road

The lights are on but no one knows you're suffocating
Don't pride yourself on denial
I'm losing my mind, you're overrated
Mercy games, let go
We're hooked on you
This comfort zone will destroy us too you know
We're the fiends to an end
You know, we're the leaders of the misled

For fuck's sake

Everybody's talking about the way that we destroy 
And how to point the finger everywhere but in
You've got a lot of nerve

Nerve (fuck this shit)
I'm losing the will to live cause you're a fucking hypocrite 
(Go)

Fuck your leaders
Oh yeah

We will stamp our feet and hope the devil can hear us
So he's waiting when you arrive
We won't be far behind

We will stamp our feet and hope the devil can hear us
So he's waiting when you arrive
We won't be far behind
It's like we're feeling our way through the dark

We are so numb to our faithless morals
We find serenity here in this chaos
We're all chancers here you know
It's why we're drawn to the unknown
Let go
