		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried to let it go
But I'm addicted to your chemicals
I got a piece, I want an overdose
I love the way she gets so physical
Fucks like an animal

In night, I just imagine how you put your love on me
Lights off, lighted on
Ready for some action
Baby, come and give it to me

'Cause I'm a freak
The way you're poppin' and droppin'
All over me
No, I don't want you to stop it
Yeah, I'm a freak
Baby, I can't lie
When you move like that
I got a one track mark
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak

Yeah, baby there you go (let's go)
Stealing my heart just like a criminal
No turning back, this time is critical
You move your body like a miracle
Baby, here we go

In night, I just imagine how you put your love on me
Lights off, lighted on
Ready for some action
Baby, come and give it to me

'Cause I'm a freak
The way you're poppin' and droppin'
All over me
No, I don't want you to stop it
Yeah, I'm a freak
Baby, I can't lie
When you move like that
I got a one track mark
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak

Baby you pop and lock it
Drop it, I watch it for sure
Baby you rollin' and rocking
Move it, I use it, let's go
You know I leak it and do the things that they make you explode
You don't believe me, mami, just let me go low
Because I'm a freak, that's a no
Now can I get big, big, big, baby back it up nice and slow
I just wanna skip, skip, skip, ride out and go
I came, I saw, I conquered, on to the next, let's go

Yeah I'm a freak
The way you're poppin' and droppin'
All over me
No, I don't want you to stop it
Yeah, I'm a freak
Baby, I can't lie
When you move like that
I got a one track mark
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak
'Cause I'm a freak
Yeah, I'm a freak

It's The Cataracs

From the hotel room to the DJ booth
On the bathroom seat, yes, I'm just a freak
And when the sun goes down, gotta let it out
Baby don't blame me, I'm just a freak
