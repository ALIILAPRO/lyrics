		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it from the top
If I start I just can't stop
All the patience that I've got
It's not enough to save me
It's a race against the clock
But we don't wanna watch
Keep running 'til we're lost
Got me thinkin'

Pull it out of park, put it in drive
I can feel your heart beatin' with mine
Underneath the stars lookin' for a sign
Glowing in the dark 'til the sun shines
Made it pretty far on the first try
Might've set the bar a little too high
Started with a spark, now we're on fire
Started with a spark

Ooh, baby
You take me on a ride
Gonna drive me crazy
Ooh, baby
I feel like we made it pretty far
Now we're stargazing

Push until it pops
Tryna clear my thoughts
Better keep the A/C on for me
Not enough, yeah
Windows start to fog
Clothing coming off
Making it too hot
Got me thinkin'

Pull it out of park, put it in drive
I can feel your heart beatin' with mine
Underneath the stars lookin' for a sign
Glowing in the dark 'til the sun shines
Made it pretty far on our first try
Might've set the bar a little too high
Yeah, started with a spark, now we're on fire

Ooh, baby
You take me on a ride
Gonna drive me crazy
Ooh, baby
I feel like we made it pretty far
Now we're stargazing

(Ooh, baby)
(I feel like we made it pretty far)
