		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa, so jet lagged

What time is it where you are?
I miss you more than anything
I'm back at home, you feel so far
Waitin' for the phone to ring
It's gettin' lonely livin' upside down
I don't even wanna be in this town
Tryin' to figure out the time zones makin' me crazy

You say good morning
When it's midnight
Going out of my head
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad
I miss you so bad
And my heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Is so jet lagged

Oh-whoa

What time is it where you are?
Five more days and I'll be home
I keep your picture in my car
I hate the thought of you alone
I've been keeping busy all the time
Just to try to keep you off my mind
Tryin' to figure out the time zones makin' me crazy

You say good morning
When it's midnight
Going out of my head
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad
I miss you so bad
And my heart heart heart is so jet lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged 
Is so jet lagged

Oh-whoa, oh-oh-whoa

I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I miss you so bad)
I miss you so bad (I wanna share your horizon)
I miss you so bad and see the same sun rising
I miss you so bad and turn the hour hand back to when you were holding me

You say good morning
When it's midnight
Going out of my head
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad
I miss when you say good morning 
But it's midnight
Going out of my head 
Alone in this bed
I wake up to your sunset
And it's drivin' me mad 
I miss you so bad
And my heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Heart, heart, heart is so jet lagged
Is so jet lagged

Oh-whoa
Is so jet lagged
