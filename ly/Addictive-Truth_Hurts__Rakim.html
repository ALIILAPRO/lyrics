		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He breaks, me down, he builds, me up
He fills, my cup, I like, it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes, in late, but it's, OK
He do, I do, he knows, the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on, his knee, he keeps, me clean
And gives, me things, he makes, me scream

He's so contagious
Returns my pages
He's got me anxious
He's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin'
Spontaneous
He's so persuasive
And I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight is waitin' (tonight is waitin')
And I ain't complainin' (and I ain't complainin)
I'm entertainin' (I'm entertainin')
My number one fan (my number one)
My back is achin' (my back is achin')
From our love makin' (from our love makin' oh)
Oh yes I'm taken
Ain't no use in fakin'

My ups, my downs
My high and my lows
From head to toe
He makes me glow
He hits the spot
He makes me hot
I'm all that he's got
And he's all that I've got

He's so contagious
Returns my pages
He's got me anxious
He's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin' (he keeps me guessin')
Spontaneous (spontaneous)
He's so persuasive (so persuasive)
And I'm his lady

Thinkin' of a masterplan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a grand
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin' in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin' to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin' loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD, addicted

He's so contagious
Returns my pages
He's got me anxious
He's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin'
Spontaneous
He's so persuasive (so persuasive)
And I'm his lady (and I'm his lady)

He's so contagious
Returns my pages
He's got me anxious
He's what I waited for
He keeps me guessin'
Spontaneous
He's so persuasive
And I'm his lady
