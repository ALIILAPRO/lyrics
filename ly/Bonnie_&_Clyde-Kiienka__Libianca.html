		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel your touch on my skin when I'm alone
I wanna ride till I die no questions asked
When things go bad your by my side
You let me know I'll be alright
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Bonnie and Clyde

I can't even stutter
Girl your the one I want, I want no other
Me and you always ride like bread and butter
Your the baddest bitch ain't no competition
Any opposition yeah we gon slaughter
Body in a bag it's a murder
Fuck with my Bonnie then it's over
Pull up on you in a rover
Bonnie and Clyde, I hope you got the memo

Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Bonnie and Clyde
Oh oh

Still remember this smile of yours, bright as the sun
I don't wanna make your head big but, you give me butterflies
Baby my heart is right, you know I'll never lie
I'll give it to you right, I mean if you the guy
So take it slow and hold me close
And make me smile, I'll do the same
On my life, on my life

Bonnie and Clyde, Bonnie and Clyde
My heart is yours and yours is mine
Bonnie and Clyde
