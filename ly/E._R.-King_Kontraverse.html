		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ahhhh look at all the lonely people
Ahhhh look at all the lonely people
When I'm alone I sit at home and I think
When I'm depressed them be the times that I drink
I feel alone and I be around ppl
Fly high around pigeons I'm an eagle
Rockstar life I feel like the Beatles
The difference I play with drums better than Ringo
I don't feel alone even tho I'm single
Get around a group of ladies and mingle
I'm doing my thing
Might play the drums while I sing
Black ppl listen up kings and queens
Controversial discussions
Presented by me
I love my life this journey lovely
Live it up any day shit can get ugly
I ain't fuckin with niggas
No we not buddies
The ladies call me funny they be coming
Ahhh look at all the lonely people
Ahhh look at all the lonely people
She calling me when she lonely
We ain't spoke in weeks so she phony
I'm trying to take her to my BR
Call father McKenzie another opp in the ER
Bet not be a loner
You selling za my og told me
You bet not be a stoner
If you can't survive the streets you might be a goner
You gon pick up the phone her
You gon baby come home her
Niggas stupid call em' Homer
These hoes is sick they corona
Do you know where you belong
Asked her do you know where home is
I know we get caught up in the moment
I just offer atonement
Ahhh look at all the lonely people
Ahhh look at all the lonely people
Ahhh look at all the lonely people
Ahhh look at all the lonely people
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong
