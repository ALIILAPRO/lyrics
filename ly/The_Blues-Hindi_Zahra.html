		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The blues is gone
Gone away from me
And it took so long
Before I could breathe
The road is wide
And the search is deep
But the change will always
Always ome with dreams

Love like rain on the desert
Reflections of beauty
And hope we can stay in this present
With light surrounded now
so raise he fire to the sky
oh, we brave, we patient, we wild

See a heart of golden love
We'll never die
As long as we never say goodbye
To another love

Love like rain on the desert
Reflections of beauty
And hope we can stay in this present
With love surounded now so
So we can take this forever
visions of heaven and angels leading the way
The way

Love like rain on the desert
Reflections of beauty
And hope we can stay in this present
With love surrounded now so
So we can take this forever
Visions of heaven and angels leading the way
The way
