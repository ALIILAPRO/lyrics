		<p>
		  I can't define
When i look into your eyes
It maybe weird but it feeling like
The time goes slow

I can't define
When i feel into your skin
It maybe strange but i promise that
It's the sweetest thing

Maybe we can't talk
But baby, we don't need it all
Cuz maybe, we just find ourself
In the peak of love

No need a vow
I can keep myself within
Your deepest love, your comfort zone, even your bad day

Maybe we can't talk
But baby, we don't need it all
Cuz maybe, we just find ourself
In the peak of love

You're my peak of love
But I can't define
When i look into your eyes
It maybe weird but it feeling like
The time goes slow

Maybe we can't talk
But baby, we don't need it all
Cuz maybe, we just find ourself
In the peak of love

If I'm going wrong
Don't worry, it won't be so long
Cuz baby, i will find our home
In the peak of love
