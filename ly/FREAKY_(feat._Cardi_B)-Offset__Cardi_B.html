		<p>
		  I'm freaky (woo, woo)
Freak, freak, (woo, woo) I'm freaky
Freak, freak, freakio
Freak, freak, freaky ho

All this ass that I got, man, I should throw it (woo)
You ain't had them bitches bad, and, boy, you know it
All this ass, I can't keep it to myself (woo)
Boy, come and lick this ice cream 'fore it melt (woo)
Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, freakio
Freak, freak, freaky ho

If that bitch is not a freak, then she ain't nothin' (woo)
Kick that bitch up out the spot if she ain't bussin' (bussin', woo)
I'm a rich nigga, man, I'm filthy (filthy)
Make a bitch baby daddy wanna kill me (yeah)

Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, freakio
Freak, freak, freaky ho

All this cash, bitch, you know, I'm 'bout to blow it (blow it, blow it)
I'ma catch it when you throw it (throw it)
Spend a bag in Chanel, it don't hurt me (CC)
Water runnin' down my leg like the jetski
I get freaky, lick her nipple, make her breastfeed
He ain't spendin' nothin', I told the bitch to text me (hey)
Freak, freak, she freaky
Fuck it, take her shoppin' on GP (hey)
Freaky, top me off on Peachtree (woo)
Bad bitch, you know that shit ain't rent-free (bad)
Birkin color purple, Oprah Winfrey (Oprah)
Pop it, twerk it, baby, go up on your friend feed (hey)

Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, freakio
Freak, freak, freaky ho
All this ass that I got, man, I should throw it (woo)
You ain't had them bitches bad, and, boy, you know it
All this ass, I can't keep it to myself
Boy, come and lick this ice cream 'fore it melt (woo)

That's a fact, nigga (fact, nigga)
This shit is fat, nigga (fat, nigga)
If I throw it at you, I hope you could catch, nigga (catch, nigga)
I might wrap my legs around one of you rap niggas
Don't you know this pussy pump-out platinum plaques, nigga? (Bah, bah, bah)
Hella freaky, diamond, VV (ha)
Pussy clean (clean), hella squeaky (woo)
Bitch bad (bad), Bella, Gigi (woo)
All this Chanel, they call me, "CC"

If that bitch is not a freak, then she ain't nothin' (woo)
Kick that bitch up out the spot if she ain't bussin' (woo)
I'm a rich nigga, man, I'm filthy
Make a bitch baby daddy wanna kill me (yeah)

I put some water on her (water), she put some water on me (splash)
I think her body a drug (drug), man, I'm 'bout to OD
I told her call all her friends, we PJ right to the sea (woo)
I give her money to spend, money to buy a boutique (racks)
Freak bitches, stop playin' like you don't eat bitches
Ran up me a hundred, now they speak different (huh?)
Tan, took her to Bali, on the beach with her (Bali)
Fuckin' with the boss, nigga, not a cheap nigga
Fly, had to take her shoppin', suck the dick until she cry (uh)
I'm not a stingy nigga, fly out to Dubai (let's go)
I don't know who better, her or her friend? That shit a tie (who? Who?)
Put that pussy on me, I make sure you survive

All this ass that I got, man, I should throw it (throw it)
You ain't had them bitches bad, and, boy, you know it (woo)
All this ass, I can't keep it to myself
Boy, come and lick this ice cream 'fore it melt (woo, woo, woo)
Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak, it's freaky (freaky)
Freak, freak (woo, woo), freakio
Freak, freak, freaky-ho (woo, woo)
