		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a whole mountain
And a river runs through it
If you split my mountain wide
You would find many rivers
Among flocks of non-white doves
And non-temptable mortals

The kingdom is much more real
And the beauty is endless
Only when tightened beyond recall
Is your necklace a blessing
Leave your pearls in the sea
You undeserved bitch

You are not worthy of such a treasure
My hand on your heart, I know there is a beating
In this oh so bleak landscape
There are many mountains

But not so much water.
My kingdom
