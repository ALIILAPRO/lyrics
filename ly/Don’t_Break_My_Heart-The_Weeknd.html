		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh (I'm paralyzed)
Ooh
Ooh (let's go)

I see you drowning in the purple lights
Diamonds shining bright
I see every ice on you (on you)
You snatch my soul, I'm crucified
I feel paralyzed
I'm so mesmerized by you (by you)

But I know you're right for me, ecstasy
I keep coming back for more
I think that you would die for me, destiny
And this time, I know for sure

Just don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

Take it anymore, take it anymore
I can't take another heart break or I'll end it all
And the girl I used to love
We broke up in the club
And I almost died in the discotheque

And now, I know she wasn't right for me, enemy
I kept coming back for more
I'd rather you would die for me, destiny
And this time, I know for sure

Just don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

I believe the liquor's talking
I just need the room to stop and
I could be the one you want
Just as long as you don't break my heart

And I realized when I kissed your neck
That the room is hot
I can taste your sweat
It's just you and I in the discotheque
But don't you worry

Just don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
