		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hop in the Trackhawk, slide (slide)
Bulletproof, I don't gotta hide (bulletproof)
Glock forty, this gon' burn a nigga (burn 'em)
Five-five-six, he fried (fried)
I ain't tryna kick it, don't hang with niggas (hey)
Cuttin' off all loose ties (cuttin' off)
Niggas be rats and liars (rats)
Givin' out bullets, no matter your size (hey)
Big dawg get you stepped on (big dawg)
Big dawg get you wacked (wacked)
Big dawg get your wife gone (big dawg)
Big dawg give her back (hey)
Big dawg play with millions, nigga, I'm a big dawg to the max (max)
Big dawg havin' that munyun

I walk in the room and they eat it up (woo)
It's just gang at the table, can't eat with us (gang)
300K on the Bentley truck 
We do not care 'bout your gang, bet' not beef with us
She fuckin' with lames, wanna leave with us
We post in the flame and they eat it up
I order the Brabus, two-hundred more thousand
I spend a lil' fifty to geek it up
If it's smoke in your heart, nigga, speak it up
Nigga talk about it, I got young niggas already caught a body
I done fucked on a bitch and forgot about it
He got left on the block, he a port-a-potty
Bought the Lambo', the doors comin' suicidal
We gon' spin on they block, don't care who the rival
Every car that I bought, I still got the title
Every bitch that I fuck, they ain't none' without 'em, facts (facts)
Nigga better tuck that chain in nigga, when the gang in shit get snatched (hey)
Fifty, bring me a hat
They let off 'bout sixty, no comin' back (yeah)
We fuckin', bitch don't get attached (uh-uh)
A couple of mill' in the stash (a couple)
We lookin' like where they be at? (Where?)
When we see them, we ready to crash (crash)

Hop in the Trackhawk, slide (skrrt)
Bulletproof, I don't gotta hide (bulletproof)
Glock forty, this gon' burn a nigga (burn 'em)
Five-five-six, he fried (five-five-six)
I ain't tryna kick it, don't hang with niggas (hey)
Cuttin' off all loose ties (cuttin' off)
Niggas be rats and liars (rats)
Givin' out bullets, no matter your size (hey)
Big dawg get you stepped on (big dawg)
Big dawg get you wacked (wacked)
Big dawg get your wife gone (big dawg)
Big dawg give her back (hey)
Big dawg play with millions, nigga, I'm a big dawg to the max (max)
Big dawg havin' that munyun
