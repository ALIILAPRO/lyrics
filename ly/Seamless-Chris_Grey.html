		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Canu0027t get the thought of us out my mind
Iu0027ll risk everything we have to lose
Letu0027s cross a couple lines tonight
I can tell that youu0027ve been waiting too

Ooh sun rising we ainu0027t even gone to bed
Your eyes are telling me to go again
We ainu0027t ever going back to being friends, no

I can feel your heart beating
And I love the feeling
You call it a bad idea, you donu0027t know the meaning
‘Cause with you girl itu0027s seamless (seamless)
Yeah we donu0027t have to try
Girl itu0027s just seamless (seamless)
Girl itu0027s just seamless

You might have to call in late to work in the morning
‘Cause you been working overtime on the nightshift
Alarms are going off, we ignore them
You been spending all your time all on my

Ooh sun rising we ainu0027t got no rest
Your eyes are telling me whatu0027s next
We ainu0027t ever going back to being friends, no

I can feel your heart beating
And I love the feeling
You call it a bad idea, you donu0027t know the meaning
‘Cause with you girl itu0027s seamless (seamless)
Yeah we donu0027t have to try
Girl itu0027s just seamless (seamless)
Girl itu0027s just seamless (seamless)

If itu0027s a bad idea
Then girl get your ass over here
Iu0027ll show you the meaning
What youu0027ve been fiending
Girl itu0027s just seamless

I can feel your heart beating
And I love the feeling
You call it a bad idea, you donu0027t know the meaning
‘Cause with you girl itu0027s seamless
Yeah we donu0027t have to try
Girl itu0027s just seamless
Girl itu0027s just seamless

I can feel your heart beating
And I love the feeling
You call it a bad idea, you donu0027t know the meaning (you call it, you call it)
‘Cause with you girl itu0027s seamless (seamless)
Yeah we donu0027t have to try
Girl itu0027s just seamless (girl itu0027s just, girl itu0027s just, girl itu0027s just)
Girl weu0027re fucking seamless

Girl itu0027s just seamless
Girl itu0027s just
