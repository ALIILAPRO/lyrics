		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I don't understand
Why we can't just hold on
To each other's hands
This time might be the last
I fear, unless I make it all too clear
I need you so, oh

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
When we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in
Take these broken wings

Baby, I think tonight
We can take what was wrong
And make it right
Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood makes me whole
I need you so

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again
Learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up
And let us in

Take these broken wings
You've got to learn to fly, learn to live, love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in yeah, yeah

Let us in
Let us in

Baby, it's all I know
That you're half of the flesh
And blood that makes me whole
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

So take these broken wings
And learn to fly again, learn to live so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up and let us in

Take these broken wings
You got to learn to fly, learn to live and love so free
And when we hear the voices sing
The book of love will open up for us and let us in
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh
