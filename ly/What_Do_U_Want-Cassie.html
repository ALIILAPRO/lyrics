		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's Go!

I got a crew in every single nation
(uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh)
You didn't know when you started altercation
(uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh)
Boy you caused me to much agrivation
(oh-no oh-no oh-no oh-no)
My hommies want to sit down and have a conversation
(yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea)

What do you want from me 
How can I give it to you
What do you want me to do
What do you want from me

The devil gave this sweet little cupcake
(uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh)
We got Brooklyn and Harlem
Time to educate
(uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh)
We gotta little pretty, cute
Foreign missy
(oh-no oh-no oh-no oh-no)
Boy it's your turn to
Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake
(yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea)

What do you want from me 
How can I give it to you
What do you want me to do
What do you want from me

I'm gonna make you cry
I'm gonna make you cry
I'm gonna make you, make you

I'ma make sure you get it good
Because you had this thing coming
Like you knew you would
You were my time, my money, and
My body to
Give me one good reason
I should give it to
Let's Go!

Let's Go!

Let's Go!

Let's Go!

What do you want from me 
How can I give it to you
What do you want me to do
What do you want from me
What do you want from me
How can I give it to you
What do you want me to do
What do you want from me
