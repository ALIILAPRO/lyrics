		<p>
		  Could we be imagining?
Could we be imagining?

Wide awake
Didn't mean to lose my precious mind today (mind today)
Sick and tired of waking up so far away (so far away)
I don't know if Mercury's in retrograde
Am I okay? Nah

I don't wanna get too close, shit gets complicated (ah)
I don't wanna take it off, emotionally naked (ah)
Really don't feel too good, fake it 'til you make it (ah)
I don't wanna talk right now, got me agitated

I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I, I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I (oh)

It's hard to concentrate
I've been the baddest bitch in the world today
Sweet like my tears through these Cartiers
I set the money for the bodyache
They say they need me for the party
I'm three-deep with the hotties
I let 'em pose for the picture
The Bentley take too much parking
I turn a opp to my bitch
You know I really don't give a shit
I'm into the cut with the killers, the drillers
We turned the trap to The Met, I'm here bangin' with the set
Body bangin', we gon' sex
I shoot him like a film in a movie, nigga
But his ass is not on set
Prr, you know what's next
Real life is not pretend
Real riders with the tint in the window
Pull up, let the blicky sing

I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I, I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I, I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging

Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining? I-I-I-I)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining? Yeah)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining? Yeah)
Could we be imagining?
Could we be imagining?
Could we be imagining?
(Could I be imagining?)
(Could I be imagining?)
(Could I be imagining?)
(Could I be imagining?)
