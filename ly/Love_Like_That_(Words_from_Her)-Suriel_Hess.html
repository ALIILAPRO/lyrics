		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Running out of good excuses
Yeah, I know we got no reason not to do this
I'm scared to be scared and
Afraid to show it
But who said love has to be heroic?

I'm no Superman, but I'll do all I can
I'll do everything for you
Whatever you might want me to

How could it be that hard?
You and me, a perfect picket fence
A cute dog, and a pretty backyard
Don't know why I've tried to run so far
'Cause how could a love like
That be so hard?

Why do I always try to
Call it the last goodbye?
When we both know I'll be calling tomorrow
Why do I run the risk of
Ruining all the things we've made?
Maybe I'm just afraid
Maybe I'm not so brave

I'm no Superman, but I'll do all I can
I'll do everything for you
Whatever you might want me to

How could it be that hard?
You and me, a perfect picket fence
A cute dog, and a pretty backyard
Don't know why I've tried to run so far
'Cause how could a love like
That be so hard?

It probably isn't who am I kidding?
It probably isn't what have I been missing?
Fall into your rhythm while we're
Dancing in the kitchen

Don't know why I've tried to run so far
So far
'Cause how could love like that be so hard?
'Cause how could love like that be so hard?
