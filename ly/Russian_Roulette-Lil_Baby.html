		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know my grandma happy, finally got my shit together
Told bro we'll take the town if we just stick together
Every time bro catch a bid, we do that shit together
I know he got two phones, but I still sent a letter
'Cause I know how that feel
Don't compare me to no other rapper, I feel like my shit real
Frontin' bows and fuckin' niggas hoes before I got a deal
It's love for sure, but you done broke the code, I don't know how to feel
And I ain't told nobody no for real since I got a mil', I'm tied in
Another bloody summer in Atlanta, done lost five friends
Mama told me that water was cold, I still had dived in
Never let a nigga take me out, it's beef, we dine in
Dog done lost his mind, I pray to God to help him find it
I was in a dark spot but I came back and I broke the knot
Remixin' my country boy for a profit, now a nigga run the charge
I don't need your comment, nah
This the shit that I live for, at least five niggas that'll kill for me
Hundred racks for my kid lawyer
It ain't my fault she don't got morals
I got rich, that's my life story
I left the streets in a paddy wagon, I came back and got right to it
Never question my loyalty, if it's that deep, then don't do it
Seem to go my hardest when I'm goin' through it

Through with that, said I'm done but then I doubled back
Are you dumb? You the one, and I'm because of that
Firearm always on me, I be clutchin' that
Know I'm wrong, how the fuck we playin' Russian roulette
All my life, I had to fight, I feel like Mike
Shootouts every other week, we had that
Bitches every other night, I'm past that
I'ma always play my part, give a fuck 'bout no awards and shit

I still ain't drop my hardest shit
I'm tryna get on some artist shit, my mind still in the 'partments
My accountant say I need to slow it down with these Dior garments
Close my eyes and think about where I come from when I'm performin'
I'm on top of every dime, I check my balance every mornin'
I'm relaxin' with a bad one, they be askin', can they join us
And my left wrist on Crip, nigga, these bracelets sixty pointers
In the Maybachs back to back on the Southside, it was me and Wunna
I'm puttin' on for my people them
Say the wrong words, we deletin' him
No doubt about it, they believe in him
Won't let 'em down, I promise
I really cried when Marlo died, I felt it all in my stomach
On the same shit that I been on, I ain't never switchin' my formula
I remember they made fun of me, can't beef with nobody under me
These lil' niggas should honor me, I'm way up on 'em honestly
Four building's in the last month, I'm boostin' up my economy
Four million, that was this week, which one of y'all wanna come for me? Yeah

Through with that, said I'm done but then I doubled back
Are you dumb? You the one, and I'm because of that
Firearm always on me, I be clutchin' that
Know I'm wrong, how the fuck we playin' Russian roulette
All my life, I had to fight, I feel like Mike
Shootouts every other week, we had that
Bitches every other night, I'm past that
I'ma always play my part, give a fuck 'bout no awards and shit
