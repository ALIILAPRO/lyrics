		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never get her back, get your baby back
Never gonna find that one again
Never get him back, never had your back
Never get him 'round your house again
See you in the dark, searching for your heart
See you when the rivers rise
See you when we meet, see you when you fall
See you when the spider bites

You were wrong to me
You set me free
And I wish we could sleep
For a thousand years
I love you best
When there are no fears

Slide into your love, try to make it up
Slide into the one you need
Slide into yourself, slide into the fear
Slide into the ones you lost
Monkey on your back, give you what you need
Monkey see, monkey do

You were wrong for me
You set me free
And I wish we could sleep
For a thousand years
I love you best
When there are no fears

We're up, we're down
We're in, we're out
We're close and so far
Like we don't know where we are
We're sinking (oh)
Slowly sinking, safe

You were wrong to me
You set me free
And I wish we could sleep
For a thousand years
I love you best
When there are no fears

We're up, we're down
We're in, we're out
We're close and so far
Like we don't know where we are
We're sinking
Slowly sinking
We're sinking
Slowly sinking

I don't know what you see
But this TV says to me, "We're sinking"
