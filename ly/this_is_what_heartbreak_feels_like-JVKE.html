		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty little liar
What you gonna say?
Tell me that you love me
Lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame
Guess my lover was a snake

Pretty little liar
What you gonna say?
Tell me that you love me
Lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame
Guess my lover was a snake

Pretty little liar
What you gonna say?
Tell me that you love me
Lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame
Guess my lover was a snake

Yes, I feel like I'm choking
Breaking up 'cause we already broken
Snake emoji on my phone when you calling
'Cause our love doesn't feel like falling

When I cry myself to sleep
I see you in my dreams
I can't breathe
'Bout to hyperventilate

Hiding your phone when you're sleeping
Staying out late on the weekend
Deep down I knew you were cheating
But I didn't wanna believe it

I'm busy fighting my demons, you were so deceiving
Messing with my feelings
You were my Garden of Eden
Now I'm leaving

Pretty little liar
What you gonna say?
Tell me that you love me
Lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame
Guess my lover was a snake

Pretty little liar
What you gonna say?
Tell me that you love me
Lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame
Guess my lover was a snake

What you gonna say?
Tell me that you love me
Lying to my face
I know you double-crossed me
Girl, you're such a fake
What a shame
Guess my lover was a snake
