		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I catch myself, staring at your face
When you're not awake
I just can't help it
No, no
Just having you here
Lying next to me
It's the little things
That cause a storm
Inside of me

And every time you're close I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver
Every time we kiss I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver
I gotta catch my breath (breath)
So caught up that I forget (forget)
Every time you're close I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver

Your hand in my hand
Skin upon my skin
Over and again
I can't get enough
No, no, no
The way you give yourself to me
I just can't believe
Sending chills all up and down my spine
I want you to know
I want you to know

That every time you're close I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver
Every time we kiss I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver
I gotta catch my breath (breath)
So caught up that I forget (forget)
Every time you're close I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver

I wanna rush
Into your touch
It just feels so right oh whoa

I wanna rush
Into your touch
It's like seeing the sun
For the very first time
It gets me every time

It makes me
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver
Every time we kiss I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver
I gotta catch my breath (breath)
So caught up that I forget (forget)
That every time you're close I
Shiver
Shiver
Shiver

I catch myself staring at your face
When you're not awake
I just can't help it
No, no
