		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes that sun comin' up on this Gulf Coast town
We've had one hell of a time, but our time is runnin' out
You're about to head back north, I'm 'bout to head back west
But I gotta get this off
My sunburned chest, I swear
I think this thing we got could go somewhere

Girl, I've never gone to Jacksonville, Georgia
But after holdin' you all night, I wanna
'Cause this ain't a margarita, can I get your number
"Meet me by the water" text, hookin' up
See you next summer
See you next summer
Nah, this ain't

I bet them hometown boys can't wait for you to get back
They're probably standin' in line, go ahead and tell 'em all that
You met somebody at the beach and didn't wanna say goodbye
Let's add a one more on that population sign, yeah

Girl, I've never gone to Jacksonville, Georgia
But after holdin' you all night, I wanna
'Cause this ain't a margarita, can I get your number
"Meet me by the water" text, hookin' up
See you next summer
See you next summer
Nah, this ain't 

I know we both gotta leave, but we don't gotta leave alone
You say the word, girl, and I'll follow you home
'Cause I can't wait all year
To kiss you like I'm kissin' you right here

Girl, I've never gone to Jacksonville, Georgia
But after holdin' you all night, I wanna
'Cause this ain't a margarita, can I get your number
"Meet me by the water" text, hookin' up
See you next summer (see you next summer, girl)
See you next summer (see you next summer, girl)
Nah, this ain't
See you next summer (see you next summer, girl)
I'll see you next summer
