		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's forgotten her car keys 
And the flowers for her friends 
They say she's a harpy
But she is on her meds

Cause you're holding onto someone who's special 
Educating someone who's mental
Giving the fat pigs a facial
We all listen to death metal

She's mates with Roy Fokker 
And he's completely faced 
She's in with the rockers
But it's not to her taste

Cause you're holding onto someone who's special 
Educating someone who's mental
Giving the fat pigs a facial
We all listen to death metal

Let it go
No one knows 
Where she goes.
