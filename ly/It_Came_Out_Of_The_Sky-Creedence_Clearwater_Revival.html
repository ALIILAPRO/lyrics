		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen
Laid on the ground and shook, fearin' for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' it came out of the sky

Well, a crowd gathered 'round and a scientist said it was marsh gas
Spiro came and made a speech about raising the Mars tax
The Vatican said, "Woe, the lord has come"
Hollywood rushed out an epic film
And Ronnie the popular said it was a communist plot

Oh, the newspapers came and made Jody a national hero

Walter and Eric said they'd put him on a network TV show
The White House said, "Put the thing in the blue room"
The Vatican said, "No, it belongs to Rome"
And Jody said, it's mine but you can have it for seventeen million

Oh, it came out of the sky, landed just a little south of Moline
Jody fell out of his tractor, couldn't believe what he seen
Laid on the ground a shakin', fearin' for his life
Then he ran all the way to town screamin' it came out of the sky
Oh
