		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Scour to find new ways of love
Denounce moralisers
Ethic without prohibition and laws
Give no credence to church
Satisfaction in the sign of crime
The meaning of my life
There is no sin all down the line
No repentance pay the price

Number one in the list of misdeeds
Persuade my sister
She shook and gasped in licentious greed
Turned by mutual whisper
Wrapped up in bewitched body shower
Forbidden fruits taste better
Primitive caress to burn out the power
Nymphomania dressed in leather

Incest
Incest
Incest

You take your virtues in a tow
And commit a sin
By defects in your character
You will always imagine
The number of all your virtues
Wipe out the stains and outrage
Realize your exceptional dreams
Incest grin and bear it

You take your virtues in a tow
And commit a sin
By defects in your character
You will always imagine
The number of all your virtues
Wipe out the stains and outrage
Realize your exceptional dreams
Incest grin and bear it

My inclination is a portrait of myself
When I look inside the broken glass
Enjoy sweetest lust and I am feeling well
Moral dilemma without wrath
Crave for you in ecstasy of my mind
Love you to the quick
Don't know what has happened to me
The condition of a bitch

Incest
Incest
Incest

You take your virtues in a tow
And commit a sin
By defects in your character
You will always imagine
The number of all your virtues
Wipe out the stains and outrage
Realize your exceptional dreams
Incest grin and bear it
