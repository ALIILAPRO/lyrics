		  This is how we do it
(This is how we do it)
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-lo
Shabada-lo-lo-lo
(This is how we do it)
Lo-lo-lo-lo-oh-oh

This is how we do it
It's Friday night and I feel alright
The party's here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'Shaw 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, "Monty, yo we made it"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. Mack or a want to-be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got da money
Hundred-dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
(This is how we do it)
Ooh, South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back
(This is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed, it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
(This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC, they're my homies
(This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track
(This is how we do it)

Check it out
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
And all they said was 6'8" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a DJ and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
"You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash"

Oh I'm buzzin' because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does
(This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
(This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track
(This is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed it's all because
(This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does, nobody does
(This is how we do it)

Oh it's party time
(This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the west side
(This is how we do it)
Oji's got the flavor, yeah
(This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does it
(This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know that
(This is how we do it)
This is how we do it
