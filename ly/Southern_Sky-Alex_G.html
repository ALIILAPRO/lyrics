		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three
I count black sheep on my way to sleep
I can't pick and choose these devils
In my patterned dreams
When I wake up I am smiling
Now I will not change my mind
I will remember the trouble
In my brother's eye

It's okay, we don't cry
We love the southern sky
It's okay, we don't cry
We love the southern sky
It's okay, we don't cry
We love the southern sky
It's okay, we don't cry
We love the southern sky

You and me
These are titles I can hardly speak
Are we bound here to an echo
Tinted blue and green?
Let my memory run backwards
So together we may lie
I will remember the fire
In the southern sky
