		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick) yeah, let's go
(It's a smash) okay, yeah, let's go
Yeah, okay, let's go
Okay, yeah, let's go

Ayy, I got that fire on me (that fire)
Uh, I got that 9 on me (that 9)
Uh, I got that drank on me (that syrup)
Uh, I'm the one they wan' be
I'm the one she gon' call
I'm the one she gon' see
Baby, I'm ballin' too hard (too hard)
All of that cash made me

A lonely boy (lonely boy)
Lonely boy (lonely, lonely)
Lonely boy
Such a lonely boy (yeah, yeah)
Lonely boy (lonely boy)
Lonely boy (lonely boy)
Lonely boy (lonely boy)
Such a lonely boy

Yeah, flooded my wrist just to drown on my bitch
Yeah, they try to cross me, they gettin' burned with the bridge
Yeah, can't run from the truth, dawg, it is what it is
Yeah, I'm telling you who, dawg, I am what I am
I just want pull up coupes, uh, I just wanna numb my pain
I just wanna pop on Xans, countin' down 'til it fades
Lookin' back at my past, ain't much shit I'd change
Why you tryna play these games? (Quit playin')
Like we don't die the same
Took me up out her frame, I took her outta my sight
Two guns by my waist, who wanna try my life?
Void in me gets bigger, sippin' on oil to fill it
I'm just gettin' sicker and that money won't heal it
Yeah, such a lonely boy (lonely boy, lonely boy)
Yeah, such a lonely boy (lonely boy)
Yeah, duckin' up off these pills, but I don't get no sleep
They say family-free, but my blood ain't cheap
Told my brother to chill, be anything but me
All of these percs and pills, I'm anything but free
Baby, you cute and all, but when you talk, you blow my high
Where the fuck all this money gonna go when I die?

A lonely boy (lonely boy)
Lonely boy (lonely, lonely)
Lonely boy
Such a lonely boy (yeah, yeah)
Lonely boy (lonely boy)
Lonely boy (lonely boy)
Lonely boy (lonely boy)
Such a lonely boy

I just want pull up coupes, uh, I just wanna numb my pain
I just wanna pop on Xans, countin' down 'til it fades
Lookin' back at my past, ain't much shit I'd change
Why you tryna play these games?
Like we don't die the same
