		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just have a little patience
I'm still hurting from a love I lost
I'm feeling your frustration
That any minute all the pain will stop

Just hold, me close
Inside, your arms, tonight
Don't be to hard on my emotions

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience

I really wanna start over again
I know you wanna be my salvation
The one that I can always depend
I'll try to be strong, believe me
I'm trying to move on
It's complicated but understand me

'Cause I
Need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have little patience yeah
Have a little patience yeah

'Cause the scars run so deep
It's been hard, but I have to believe

Have a little patience
Have a little patience

Oh, 'cause I
I just need time
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I"m still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
Have a little patience
My heart is numb has no feeling
So while I'm still healing
Just try
And have a little patience
