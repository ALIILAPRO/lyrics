		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have this one
Da, dat-dat-da, dat-dat-da-da-da

(Yeah)
(Yeah)
(Rise)

Half-alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised

It's strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind
Yeah, it blows my fucking mind
These days, I never seem to get enough
I'm tired of this shit, I want to go home
Don't waste my fucking time
Don't waste my fucking time
Because anything exceptional
Gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance
And all their common evils 
This planet isn't special
Collections made of clay
I'm waiting for the punishment
I know is on my way

(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)

Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
"You form a line to formalize the former lies"
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound, and it was sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse
Now I've been saying this for years
But you don't comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear
Because I understand it
Androgyny and insults
You try so hard to be difficult
You want to win the war?
Know what you're fighting for

(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)

Irreverence is my disease
It's secondhand, but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity
With the angel eyes and demon seeds
You're missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you'll see
The last man standing gets no pity
(No pity)
(No pity)
(No pity)
(No pity)
(No pity)

(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
(Cut, cut, cut me up, and fuck, fuck, fuck me up)
