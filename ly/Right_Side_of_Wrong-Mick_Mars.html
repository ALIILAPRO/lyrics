		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Divide and conquer us all, yeah the cities will fall, let's burn it down No more
believing the lies, and the people will rise the suns fading out
It's already too late, there's no turning back
Voices are calling It's been so long
Catch me I'm falling
In the end there's no right side of wrong
Keep on selling the dream, while they're steeling the green, we're going no where
The hate that's building inside, you learned from your parents eyes, let's change
this somewhere
It's already too late, there's no turning back
Voices are calling It's been so long
Catch me I'm falling
In the end there's no right side of wrong
