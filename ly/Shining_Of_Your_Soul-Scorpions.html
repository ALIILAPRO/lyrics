		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the backyard of my soul
There's a charming little home
And that's where all the trouble goes
Where all the trouble goes

In the center of my heart
There's a place that keeps you warm
That's where all my loving goes
Where all my loving goes

Well love is a meaning, a true loving feeling
How can I be sure?
I can't stop believing, it's more than a feeling
And when you come through the door
I see the shining of your soul

In the backyard of my soul
Lies the answer to it all
It's a long, long way to go
Such a long, long way to go

Love is a meaning, a true loving feeling
How can I be sure?
I can't stop believing, it's more than a feeling
And when you come through the door
I see the shining, I see the shining of your soul

Shining, shining of your soul (shining of your soul, shining of your soul)
Shining, shining of your soul (shining of your soul, shining of your soul)
See the shining of your soul
Shining, shining of your soul (shining of your soul, shining of your soul)
Shining, shining of your soul (shining of your soul, shining of your soul) 
See the shining of your soul

Love is a meaning, a true loving feeling
How can I be sure?
Can't stop believing, it's more than a feeling
And when you come through the door
I see the shining of your soul

You shine, shine, shine
You shine, shine, shine
When you come through the door, oh
I see the shining of your soul
Of your soul
