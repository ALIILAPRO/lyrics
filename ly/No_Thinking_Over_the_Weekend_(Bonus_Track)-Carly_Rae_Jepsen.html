		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was looking for you on the beach
When it's good, was it always out of reach?
In the hotel, someone sent me flowers
Getting dressed now, meet you in an hour

Lavender sunset, ocean air
Feeling it, stealing kisses from your neck
Summer haze, the nights are getting hotter
Wake me up when you're ready for the water

Do you think about star signs?
'Cause I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky

No thinking over the weekend (our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend (this love has no limits)
I'm in this beautiful dreamin' (dreamin', dreamin', dreamin')
No thinking (thinking, thinking, thinking)

Holiday, take the train off the track
The windows were closed, so we kick the door open
Everyone waved at us

Do you think about star signs?
'Cause I think I saw Jupiter
Dive into the black sky

No thinking over the weekend (our lips have no secrets)
No thinking over the weekend (this love has no limits)
I'm in this beautiful dreamin' (dreamin', dreamin', dreamin')
No thinking (thinking, thinking, thinking)
I'm in this beautiful dreamin' (dreamin', dreamin', dreamin')
No thinking (thinking, thinking, thinking)

Tried but I couldn't get away (tried but I couldn't get away with it)
Tried but I couldn't get away (tried but I couldn't get away with it)
No thinking over the weekend, no thinking over the weekend

I'm in this beautiful dreamin' (this love has no limits)
No thinking (this love has no limits)

(Lavender sunset ocean in the water)
(In the hotel, someone sent me flowers)
(Ready for the water)
(Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin)
(Thinking, thinking, thinking)
(Wake me up when you're ready for the water)
(No thinkin', no thinkin')
