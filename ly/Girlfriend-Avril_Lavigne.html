		  Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

You're so fine, I want you mine, you're so delicious
I think about you all the time, you're so addictive
Don't you know what I can do to make you feel all right?

Don't pretend, I think you know I'm damn precious
And, hell yeah, I'm the motherfuckin' princess
I can tell you like me too and you know I'm right

She's like so, whatever
You could do so much better
I think we should get together now and that's what everyone's talkin' about

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

I can see the way, I see the way you look at me
And even when you look away, I know you think of me
I know you talk about me all the time, again and again
So come over here and tell me what I wanna hear
Better yet, make your girlfriend disappear
I don't wanna hear you say her name ever again (and again and again and again)

'Cause she's like so, whatever
And you could do so much better
I think we should get together now and that's what everyone's talkin' about

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend

Uh, in a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

Uh, in a second you'll be wrapped around my finger
'Cause I can, 'cause I can do it better
There's no other, so when's it gonna sink in?
She's so stupid, what the hell were you thinking?

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
No way, no way

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend
No way, no way

Hey, hey, you, you, I don't like your girlfriend
No way, no way, I think you need a new one
Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend
No way, no way

Hey, hey, you, you, I know that you like me
No way, no way, no, it's not a secret
Hey, hey, you, you, I want to be your girlfriend
No way, no way, hey, hey
