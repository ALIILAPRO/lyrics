		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Circe was divine
A tale of pearls before the swine
An empress, a brilliant sorceress

And then a lover scorned
And that's how the story's told
Hold the rest, they stole the magic

And Sita's archetype:
The perfect image of a wife
Did we ignore the fire in her soul?

Remember Amy's plea
I know the poets disagree
When it comes to love
Did we even have control?

They think know us
Because they wrote the history books

Here's to the women (women)
Who don't ever seem to get a say
In how their pages get portrayed

Here's to the women
Who know everything the poets say
And be a menace anyway

The historians who looked away
The game was set before it played
We're breaking out behind the cage
'Cause that's some shit that we won't take

The women
Who wrote stories in the roads they paved
We're bringing back their golden age

This is our golden age

A pretty penny prize without a
Thought behind the eyes
We don't get a say: it's "in our DNA"

'Cause they refuse to see beyond commodities
We can be sweet with a
Vicious streak: call that dichotomy

They think they own us
But now we're taking back the history books

Here's to the women (women)
Who don't ever seem to get a say
In how their pages get portrayed

Here's to the women
Who know everything the poets say
And be a menace anyway

The historians who looked away
The game was set before it played
We're breaking out behind the cage
'Cause that's some shit that we won't take

The women
Who wrote stories in the roads they paved
We're bringing back their golden age

Queens wear more than just their crowns
They keep castles from crumbling down
Yeah, you can't keep us on the ground
We're coming for your kingdom now
Queens wear more than just their crowns
They keep castles from crumbling down
Yeah, you can't keep us on the ground
We're coming for your kingdom now
