		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Wheezy out of here

The dash, a digi', the schedule busy
My head in a hoodie, my shorty a goodie
My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, "Look up," 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"

Cartier glasses, I won't even peek at you
Yellow Ferrari like Pikachu
I got 'em waitin' and watchin' what he gon' do
Tryna peep what I do, tryna steal my moves
$2,500 for a new pair of tennis shoes
The same price, I could make them youngin's come and finish you
Lawyer been chargin', he a Jew, he like his voodoo
Real dope boy, hundred thousand in Evisu
Presidential tints slide by, we don't see you
I been gettin' money, I ain't worried 'bout what he do
I'm gettin' money like I'm from the '80s
Me and Drake 'bout to drop man, this shit gon' go crazy
They know I'm the truth, comin' straight from the basement
I'm straight as the street, man I come from the pavement
A million, all hundreds, it make em 'go crazy
Wah-wah-wah, bitch I'm Lil Baby

Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawgs goin' all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like, "Yes, indeed"
Me and my dawgs going all the way
When you livin' like this, they supposed to hate

Wheezy out of here
