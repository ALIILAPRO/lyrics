		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unfaithful backstabbing coward
I'm fucking sick of all the lies and all the treachery
I was always by your side and this is how you repay me
And after all these years you fucking turned your back on me
I can't believe I ever considered you family
I will never forget this knife you placed in my back

Recreant
Say it to my face
No more fucking games
This is where you pay
Recreant

Step the fuck back and just bleed
You're a worthless gutless pig
Now you'll see that I'm not just something you can fucking cast aside
My whole life I stood right by your side
You fucking hypocrite
You make it seem like it was my fault

You lied
Don't forget I know exactly what you did
I'm fucking sick of all the lies and all the treachery
I was always by your side and this is how you repay
And after all these years you fucking turned your back on me?
I can't believe I ever considered you family
I will never forget this knife you placed in my back

Recreant
Say it to my face
No more fucking games
This is where you play
Recreant
You are dead to me
