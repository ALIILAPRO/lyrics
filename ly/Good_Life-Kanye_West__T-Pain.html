		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like we always do at this time
I go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
I go-go for mine, I gots to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
Ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where niggas who sell D
Won't even get pulled over in they new V
The good life, let's go on a living spree
Shit, they say the best things in life are free
The good life, it feel like Atlanta
It feel like L.A., it feel like Miami
It feel like N.Y., summertime Chi, ahh
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
So I roll through good
Y'all pop the trunk, I pop the hood, Ferrari
And she got the goods
And she got that ass, I got to look, sorry
Yo, it's got to be 'cause I'm seasoned
Haters give me them salty looks, Lawry's
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up" the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky (ayy)

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
Ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
I'm good

Welcome to the good life
Where we like the girls who ain't on TV
'Cause they got more (ass than the models)
The good life, so keep it coming with the bottles
'Til she feel booze like she bombed at Apollo
The good life, it feel like Houston
It feel like Philly, it feel like D.C.
It feel like VA, or the Bay, or Yay
Ayy, this is the good life
Welcome to the good life
Uh, homie, tell me what's good
Why I only got a problem when you in the hood?
Welcome to the good life
Like I'm new in the hood, the only thing I wish
(I wish a nigga would)
Welcome to the good life
He probably think he could, but, but
I don't think he should
Welcome to the good life
50 told me, "Go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate then let 'em hate
And watch the money pile up" the good life

Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine (yeah)
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky
Now I, I go for mine, I got to shine
Now throw yo' hands up in the sky (ayy)

I'ma get on this TV mama, I'ma
I'ma put shit down
Ayy (ayy), ayy (ayy)
Ayy (ayy), ayy (I'm good)

Have you ever popped champagne on a plane
While getting some brain?
Whipped it out, she said, "I never seen snakes on a plane"
Whether you broke or rich, you gotta get this
Havin' money's the everything, not havin' it is
I was splurgin' on trizz
But when I get my card back activated
I'm back to Vegas (welcome to the good life)
'Cause I always had a passion for flashin' before I had it
I close my eyes and imagine the good life (hey)

Is the good life better than the life I live
When I thought that I was gonna go crazy
And now my grandmama ain't the only girl calling me baby
And if you feelin' me now then put your hands up in the sky
And let me hear you say hey, hey, hey, ooh
I'm good
