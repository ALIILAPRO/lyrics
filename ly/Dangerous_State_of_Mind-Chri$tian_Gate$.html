		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse One:
You say we're better as friends
Like I can live and forget
You got so good at pretending you're sorry
From someone that I loved
To someone that I see hardly
To someone, I used to Fuck
To someone that won't call me

Pre-Chorus:
You let me go cause of misunderstandings
Now that I know you better I get what your plan is
Damage, Gaslit
You driving me batshit
Wanna see me crazy?
Well, maybe I’ll let you have it, cause

Chorus:
You don’t give a fuck right now
Know you’re in my head keeping me up right now
I’d be fucking you rough right now
But someone in your bed keeping you up right now
You stand behind your walls
You don't know me at all
You stay just out of reach
So you can take advantage of me

Verse two:
If I let you get to me
That would be the death of me
You should know you're dead to me
Murderer of my Memories
Trying to get ahead of me
Till you're giving head to me
Draining all my energy
Lovers turned into enemies

Pre-Chorus:
You let me go cause of misunderstandings
Now that I know you better I get what your plan is
Damage, Gaslit
You driving me batshit
Wanna see me crazy?
Well, maybe I’ll let you have it, cause

Chorus:
You don’t give a fuck right now
Know you’re in my head keeping me up right now
I’d be fucking you rough right now
But someone in your bed keeping you up right now
You stand behind your walls
You don't know me at all
You stay just out of reach
So you can take advantage of me

Outro: You don’t give a fuck right now
Know you’re in my head keeping me up right now
I’d be fucking you rough right now
But someone in your bed keeping you up right now
