		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're speeding on the runway
We gotta really burn this road
Road road road
We got no chance to move too slow
I am taking off my bottoms
The summer heat makes me white-hot
Hot hot hot
Before we crash I let you know
All London was burnt down by a farthing dip
I've grown attached to you, you've grown attached to me
Emotional breakdown starts at lighting speed
But highly in the air
You recklessly left me dysfunctional
I am bailing out!
Hold me while free fall
Stop let me shoot
Just let me use my parachute
I would never lose my hands
On our way down
But you left me dysfunctional
I have met you in July
I am not just passing by
You are so sexy you are so cute
Just let me use my parachute hey
I have met you in July
I am not just sleeping by
You are so sexy
You are so cute
Just let me use my parachute hey
We dissolve in coulds our boredom
I am touching you, you turn me on
We cannot stop and try less strong
We roam by this endless Summer
July left me you and sunburn
Before we crash I let you know
All London was burnt down watching our fall
Our stunt impressed the Queen
She's almost blacken out
You rolled my stripes and strings up into a fireball
Please, stretch me out again,
It's time to catch the beat, dysfunctional
I am bailing out!
Hold me while free fall
Stop let me shoot
Just let me use my parachute
I would never lose my hands
On our way down
But you left me dysfunctional
Low-pressure could probably make me feel insane
I've got no time for blue study On the
brink of the precipice we stay
It is not skydiving, baby, but
A Death-defying act
You left me goosebumps on my back
I am fading
Mind went dull
I'll jump with you my baby
Cuz only now I feel a way dysfunctional
I am bailing out!
Hold me while free fall
Stop let me shoot
Just let me use my parachute
I would never loose my hands
On our way down
But you left me dysfunctional
