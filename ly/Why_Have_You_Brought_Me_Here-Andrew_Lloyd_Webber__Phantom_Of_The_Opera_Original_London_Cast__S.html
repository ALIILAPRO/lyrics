		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why have you brought us here?

Don't take me back there!

We must return!

He'll kill me!
His eyes will find me there!

Christine, don't say that

Those eyes that burn! (Don't even think it)

And if he has to kill a thousand men

Forget this waking nightmare

The Phantom of the Opera will kill and kill again (this Phantom is a fable, believe me)
There is no Phantom of the Opera

My God, who is this man (my God, who is this man)
Who hunts to kill? (This mask of death?)

I can't escape from him (whose is this voice you hear)
I never will! (With every breath?)

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is here
Inside my mind

There is no Phantom of the Opera

Raoul, I've been there
To his world of unending night
To a world where the daylight dissolves into darkness
Darkness

Raoul, I've seen him!
Can I ever forget that sight?
Can I ever escape from that face?
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face
In that darkness
Darkness

But his voice filled my spirit
With a strange, sweet sound
In that night, there was music in my mind
And through music, my soul began to soar
And I heard as I'd never heard before (what you heard)

Was a dream and nothing more

Yet in his eyes
All the sadness of the world
Those pleading eyes
That both threaten and adore

Christine, Christine

Christine

What was that?
