		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked behind the sofa
Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
Under the bed it's not there, I can't find it anywhere

I'm stressed and ready, ready to go
I'm stressed and ready, I can't be alone
I'm stressed and ready, ready to go
I'm stressed and ready, will I die alone?

Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked inside the fridge
Then I got drunk, I cut my own fridge

Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked inside the closet
All I could find was me

Maybe I should try some yoga
Three, two, one, breathe with me
I'm not gonna cry any more
I cried in Finding Nemo
I'm just a bamboo toothbrush wrapped in plastic
I'm just a bamboo toothbrush I'll never use

'Cause eye contact, it makes me uncomfortable
Everything it makes me uncomfortable
They say nice people finish last
Well year six sport's day I got picked last
I bought a self help book it didn't work
Maybe I should read it, that'll work
I fell in love with the one next door
But are they five doors down?

I'm stressed and ready, ready to go
I'm stressed and ready, I can't be alone
I'm stressed and ready, ready to go
I'm stressed and ready, will I die alone? (Probably)

Has anybody seen my will to live
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked behind the sofa
Then I got drunk, I cut my own fridge

Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked under my bed
(All I could find was me)

Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked inside the fridge
Has anybody seen my will to live?
I haven't seen it since I was a kid
I've even looked inside the closet
Has anybody seen my will to live?
