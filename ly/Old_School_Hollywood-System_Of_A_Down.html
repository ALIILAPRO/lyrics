		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Old school
Hollywood
Baseball
Old school Hollywood, Baseball

Tony Danza cuts in line
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Standing in the sun I'm wasting my time
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood

Old school Hollywood, baseball
Jack Gilardi's ten feet tall
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Me and Frankie Avalon

Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood

Hey man, don't you touch my belt
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Standing in the sun I'm about to melt
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood

Old school Hollywood, baseball
Jack Gilardi's ten feet tall
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Me and Frankie Avalon

Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood

Old school Hollywood, baseball
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Old school Hollywood, baseball

Old school Hollywood, baseball
Jack Gilardi's ten feet tall
Old school Hollywood, baseball
Me and Frankie Avalon

Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
