		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Yeah, ride for my slime, slide for my slime (slime)
Yeah, ride for my slime, slide for my slime (slime)
Yeah, ride for my slime, slide for my slime
Yeah, ride for my slime
I just got up off that jet, I swear I just touched Heaven, yeah
Bad lil' bitch up on my side I told her, "It's forever", yeah
Went up too high, now I'm stuck I'm gon' be rich forever, yeah
Bitch, I ride for mine, they say it's up then it's whatever, yeah
Foot up on they neck, neck, neck, the ghost it match the set, set, set
Cutthroat city vet, vet, vet, I'm stackin' chips like bet, bet, bet
Poppin' on that yeah, yeah, yeah
I been gone like where? Where? Where?
Sliding for that warfare
Sliding for mine, riding for mine

Yeah, I'm in this shit for the game (yeah)
We matchin' the chain, we matchin' every time we pull up (yeah)
Wanna be like us, wanna be strikers
All on my motherfuckin' dick like a hooker
All this Balenci', this shit came from Europe
Bitch grab the wheel while I pour up the syrup
Told my lil' twin if I got it, it's his
Smoke or the biz, I'm here 'til we burn up, yeah (yeah)
All of my snake, my slime, they up in the field (yeah, yeah)
I been on too many drugs, I can't really feel (yeah, yeah)
I done shook too many hands, and none of them real
I put this shit on my hands, I did it for real (yeah, yeah)
I bought that big lil' Ghost, that big lil' truck, that big lil' R-A-M
That big lil' Lac, big lil' GLE, that big lil' Benz
Got a big lil' stack, a big lil' crib, just bought one in the Hills
Crush a big lil' Perc, a big lil' Xan, yeah, I call that a big lil' pill
I been up takin' these risks for real (for real)
Piss on my motherfuckin' record deal
Heard you were stitching your record seal
This house on my motherfuckin' neck for real
This house on these motherfuckin' wrists for real
Been a minute since I slept for real
Ride for the 5, and I slide for the 9
I die for my slime or at best I kill

Yeah, ride for my slime, slide for my slime (slime)
Yeah, ride for my slime, slide for my slime (slime)
Yeah, ride for my slime, slide for my slime
Yeah, ride for my slime
I just got up off that jet, I swear I just touched Heaven, yeah
Bad lil' bitch up on my side I told her, "It's forever", yeah
Went up too high, now I'm stuck I'm gon' be rich forever, yeah
Bitch, I ride for mine, they say it's up then it's whatever, yeah
Foot up on they neck, neck, neck, the ghost it match the set, set, set
Cutthroat city vet, vet, vet, I'm stackin' chips like bet, bet, bet
Poppin' on that yeah, yeah, yeah
I been gone like where? Where? Where?
Sliding for that warfare
Sliding for mine, riding for mine
