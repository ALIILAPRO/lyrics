		  [VERSE: SON ROB]

I ain't taking no shit, take no hits from the blunt but I might hit the 40 again
Dawg you don't know me, bro don't get too close cuz I might just go call up my brodies again
Know what you think from that Freudian slip, I fought my bouts with them boys in the pit
Stack you some reps, say it with your chest
We do not hide behind toys with the clips
Put on the pressure 'til poison is picked, put on some more 'til my boys in the biz
Suits on the run, kid I ain't playing I told you and bet ain't no choice in this bitch
4-5-6 Rolls Royce in this bitch, I might just need me a lawyer in this bitch
Used to the struggle, graceful at that, I ain't lying I swear I'm enjoying this shit
BARAKU, BARAKU, Fuck the cops but they isn't who shot at you
Semi-auto, the FN go BARAKU and I been introducing a lot of you
See my name at the top of the articles, know them shordies done read it, they flaunt at you
Bobby Koga done made him a part of you, got it popping like BARAKU BARAKU
Bet I'm there if I'm if I'm thinking it's possible, Never said that's what all of you ought to do
Matter fact lotta people is onto you, sent a prayer if you fall Imma honor you
I ain't saving nobody to tell the truth, If somebody win then some gotta lose
Kept it steady I stay to myself dawg, momma already told me "I'm proud of you"


[VERSE: KING CAEXAR]

Back in this bitch
Had to pull out for a bit
But wasn't out of lube
Been spittin' it raw out the mouth for a cheque
And dogging these chicks since middle school
Shoutouts to Ibou and Amadou
Telling me that rhyming was something that I'ma do
Arm leg leg am headed out the womb
Ahead of my time they calling me kirikou

Shooter for hire, I'm Türkoğlu
Magic bullet spin the tires I'm touchin you Keep the heater on the seat like I'm Macadoo
Mac'll burn a Bernie Mac if he act a fool Takin' out for the angus i'm drivin thru
Saw the wraith and he ran like he Scooby Doo
Caught a fade that's Hidan & Kakazu
Feel the bass on the beat when we coming through

It sound like Baraku, Baraku
I'm a monster I pull up & murder you
Onibabu to you rappers I'm Babadook
Mambu Jambu I'm a savage I ravage you
Snatch yo bitch, she gon' freak for the Phantom troupe

Got digits for the brains like its Sudoku
Hit me up when she hungry for the juca root Fill her up to her belly till her kidney bruise
Dick like Baraku, Baraku
Freak bitches on a beach down in Malibu Peanut butter & jelly that's Goober Scoop
Sweep the bitch off her feet like Popsecu
Get her quick on her Knees for a popsicle

Niggas snakes & they plottin' to poison you
That's why they hate in your face they anointed you
Trim the grass and they run like the fescue do

Shit like Baraku, Baraku
Think you Kimbo & bad like you Masvidal
Nigga cappin' on camera, im touchin' you
You uso, I'm Usman Kamaru"
Caught a opp on a block or the avenue
Put a dot on his head like he Urdu
You bluffin' ain't packin' a caribou
I'm buckin' he dancin' the boogaloo"

It sound like...Baraku, Baraku
Yeah Baraku, Baraku
Rob im telling you niggas trash man
For real, I could do this shit in my sleep like everytime
Till it gets fucking boring
Ya dig?
