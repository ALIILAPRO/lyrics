		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I miss your sweet face
Only been about three days
I know it's gonna sound cliché
Every time I see ya come my way
You got me singing like aye
Tell me when you hear it like aye
Cause the sun shine like every time I see ya, every time I see ya
Every time I, eh eh

Protect your soul, it'll pay off in peace cause
Toxic friends will shred you off in pieces
I had a friend called Mary, she was decent
She was nice to me but not to others
Then she turned her back to me no reason
It was kinda sad but saw it coming
Then I figured it said a lot about me
Maybe I should change what I've been seeking?
You're your company, so choose it wisely
Keep your energy, don't give it blindly
Choose your passion then make it your reason
Pick your family beyond a season
I'm feeling so zen right now
Looking so gwen right now
Crash as I fall to the ground
Thought I had it all figured out

But then I miss your sweet face
Only been about three days
I know it's gonna sound cliché
Every time I see ya come my way
You got me singing like aye
Tell me when you hear it like aye
Cause the sun shine like every time I see ya, every time I see ya
Every time I, eh eh

Been to hell and back but I think I wanna stay
Still gotta unpack cause I think I got away
I been told that I am a little strange
I like it, I don't wanna ever change
This really is the happiest I've ever been
Don't mess with negative, they just all replicas
I do not care if they let me in, I'm always delicate
But don't you dare touch a relative
One day I will travel through a mirror
Say hello and meet my own reflection
Then we'll take a walk near by the river
Grasp the moment make it last forever
I'm feeling so glad right now
Nothing like sad right now
crash as I fall to the ground
I thought I had it all figured out

But then I kinda miss your sweet face
Only been about three days
I know it's gonna sound cliché
Every time I see ya come my way
You got me singing like aye
Tell me when you hear it like aye
Cause the sun shine like every time I see ya, every time I see ya
Every time I, eh eh

Only been about three days
I know it's gonna sound
Thirty-three
Every time I see ya, every time I see ya
Oh you got me singing like aye
Tell me when you hear it like aye
Cause the sun shine like every time I see ya
Every time I see ya

And I miss your sweet face
Only been about three days
I know it's gonna sound cliché
Every time I see ya come my way
You got me singing like aye
Tell me when you hear it like aye
Cause the sun shine like every time I see ya, every time I see ya
Every time I, eh eh
