		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-uh, ah-ah, ah, uh-uh
Oh-oh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh-oh, uh-uh

I'm lying in my bed
The blanket is warm
This body will never be safe from harm
Still feel your hair, black ribbons of coal
Touch my skin to keep me whole

Oh, if only you'd come back to me
If you laid at my side
Wouldn't need no mojo pin
To keep me satisfied

Don't want to weep for you
Don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so

Oh, precious, precious silver and gold 
And pearls in oyster's flesh
Drop down we two to serve and pray to love
Born again from the rhythm
Screaming down from heaven
Ageless, ageless, I'm there in your arms

Don't want to weep for you
I don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so
So, so, so
So

Oh, the welts of your scorn, my love, give me more
Send whips of opinion down my back, give me more
Well it's you I've waited my life to see
It's you I've searched so hard for

Don't want to weep for you
Don't want to know
I'm blind and tortured, the white horses flow
The memories fire
The rhythms fall slow
Black beauty, I love you so, so
Black, black, black beauty
