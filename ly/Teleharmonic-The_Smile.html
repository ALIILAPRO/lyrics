		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Will I make the morning?
I don't know
Tied up
In half-truths
Wanting
Payback, payback

Whining drones
On a cold sea
Ramming down doors
Piling in
Caught in dragnets
By fishermen
Wanting
Payback, payback
Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?

Somewhere you'll be there
So long
Somewhere you'll be there
So long
Soon you'll be there
So long
Soon you'll be there

In all that fire and ice
In all that fire
In all that ice

Bury me
In the way out
In the past
Oh, Lord, how should I forget?
Hung up, pinned up
By hammer and nails

Somewhere you'll be there
So long
Somewhere you'll be there
So long
Soon you'll be there

In all that fire
In all that ice

Where are you taking me?
Where are you taking me?
