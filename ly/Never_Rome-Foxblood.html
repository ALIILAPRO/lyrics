		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay your head down, sing me to sleep as I come undone
I fell out of love with myself
I’ve got a bad heart, in more ways than one
Gotta tell you, the last few days, weeks, months and years have been kind of rough
Drink in the dark for a while, so I go out with a smile and I guess that’ll be enough
I’m sorry that I couldn’t make the pieces fit
I’m so far adrift
In an ocean you don’t even know exists
This is more than a rainy day, this is a hurricane

We are one
Empires pulled apart by stones
We are one
But we were never Rome

Sit alone at home pick apart my thoughts remind myself, even the best things run their course
Sitting, drinking, trying to bring myself back from the brink
But I’m a lost cause, and I’m starting to sink
So I pick myself up, write myself off
I’m shooting for death, but clearly not doing enough
I’m not doing enough

Fell by the wayside, getting high more than ever now
And I never found the strength, to put the bottle down, my fire's burnt out

My old lover, my old friend
I’ve been thinking about dying again

My hands have got the shakes as I put pen to paper in your name for the last time
Let myself down time, after time
Tell myself lie after lie
And the sun shines lightly through the window pane
I think this could be the morning of my final day
And I need you to do this final thing for me
There’s still gold in my heart, so bury me deep

My old lover, my old friend
I’ve been thinking about dying again
My old lover, my old friend
Everyone of you means everything

And the sun shines lightly through the window pane
I think this could be the morning of my final day
And I need you to do this final thing for me
There’s still gold in my heart, so bury me deep
