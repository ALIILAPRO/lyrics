		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God of my life
Blurred out my soul
Bring storm and fire
Stories I've been told

Bring us all grace
Right before my eyes
As you break through these gates
Far from the sky, Lord

I hate to let you down, hate to let you down
Hate to say it now, hate to say it now

I don't really care where I go when I die
'Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that's he's wasting his time
'Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Sins washed away
Dark turns to light
If your body is a temple
So take me inside

I feel no pain
Pleasures of mine
If you give me a taste of
Eternal life

I hate to let you down, hate to let you down
Hate to say it now, hate to say it now

I don't really care where I go when I die
'Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that's he's wasting his time
'Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Hate to let you down, hate to let you down
Hate to let you down, hate to let you down

I don't really care where I go when I die
You can tell the devil that's he's wasting his time

Oh, I don't really care where I go when I die
'Cause I just found heaven
You can tell the devil that's he's wasting his time
'Cause I just found heaven
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Singin' Halle, Halle, Halle, Halle, Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Oh, Hallelujah
'Cause I just found heaven, Hallelujah
Hate to let you down, hate to let you down
Hallelujah
Hate to let you down, hate to let you down
Hallelujah
