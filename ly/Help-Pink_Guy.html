		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up in the mornings
Sinking halfway to the bottom
There's a loud distorted screaming in my soul
Everything is dark and empty
And I don't know how to fix it
So I curl up in a ball
And cry in the comfort of my home

I don't know why
I feel like shit
I say I'm fine but I'm not fine

I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide all my deepest feelings

I think there's something wrong with me
'Cause all I see is death
Everytime I go outside
I look like I've been doing meth
And I sleep for nineteen hours on a Thursday afternoon
And every now and then I cough up blood
And I don't know what to do

I don't know why
I feel like shit
I will not see a therapist

Ladies and gentlemen, 
If you wanna fucking kill yourself 
Put your fucking hands up (yeah!), 
Razor blades in the air everybody (yeah!)
(*Coughing*)
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, help, help, help, help, help, help, HELP!

I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide all my deepest feelings
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide all my deepest feelings
