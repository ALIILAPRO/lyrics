		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fuck your ass up
I fuck your ass up (fuck him up, son)
I fuck your ass up (fuck him up, son)
I fuck your ass up (Wu for life, fuck him up)

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up

Hut one, hut two, hut three, hut
S.O.A.D., live and uncut
Styles unbreakable, shatterproof
To the young youth, you wanna get gun? Shoot
Blaow, how you like me now?
Don't fuck the style, ruthless wild
Do you wanna get your teeth knocked the fuck out?
Wanna get on it like that, well then shout
Come on

Lazers and blazers, hit me with the major
The damage, my Clan understand it be flavor
Gunning, humming coming at ya
First I'm gonna get ya, once I got ya, I gat ya
You could never capture a nigga man's stature
For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resigning, now master
My style? Never
I put the fucking buck in the wild kid
Let's get together

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up

I bought like 20 white boys in the back of a pickup truck
With hockey pucks and skateboards on the way to Woodstock
Leave home the Glock
I have a gun the size of a black hole
Shoot planets, don't get frantic
Throw your hands up in the air, don't panic
Supreme arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Wu-tang Clan, as stight as long dreads

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
I'll fuck your ass up

I come with that loco style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it up with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire, smoke your
Crews be acting like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit sticks in my drawers
So I can get fuzzy-funky for you
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang, rah
Here comes the Tiger versus Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk, you play me chump, you get dumped
Wu is coming through at a theatre near you
And get funk like a shoe

Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Wu buck wild with the trigger
Shame on a nigga who try to run game on a nigga
Yo, I'll fuck your ass up
I'll fuck your ass up
I'll fuck your ass up
I'll fuck your ass up
I'll fuck your ass up, bitch
Fuck his ass up
