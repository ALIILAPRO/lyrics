		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista

Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad

Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told

What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad

Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel organism, T.W.I.S.M
Not from the prism, take charge like Manilla
Nine-five Shaq represent with the Thrilla
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad
Who are you?

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it

Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad, too bad about it
