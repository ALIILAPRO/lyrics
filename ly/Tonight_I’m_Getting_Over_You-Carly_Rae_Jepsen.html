		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna smash your fears
And get drunken off your tears
Don't you share your smile with anyone else but me
I wanna touch your heart
I wanna crush it in my hands
Make you plead and cry as you give up all the lies

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you
Over you

Stuck in a real bad dream
And man, it feels so new to me
Should be in your arms but I'm begging at your feet
It's been a real hard night
And I just hold my pillow tight
It won't love me back, no,
It's not you and I

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
No more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new

Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you
Over you ah
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Tonight I'm getting over you
Over you
Over you (Tonight I'm getting over you)

We're not lovers
But more than friends
Put a flame to every single word you ever said
And no more crying
To get me through
I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new
Tonight I'm getting over you
