		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma need a bigger bag for all this cash
Fuck a breather, I'ma grind until I'm ash
Sip my tea hot, while they're steeping in their lack
Wanna keep up
Bitch, you better boss up fast

Lesson one
Never listen to a stupid man
Let him run
His mouth while you run errands in your Benz
Lesson two
Do whatever you wanna do
Play it big (big)
Snatch a wig (wig)
Elevate your game while they follow rules
Lesson three is never doing
Wishy washy business
If you wanna be the creme
Then put your cookie in it
Flossing on max (max)
Get 'em like plaque
And if they think you're way too sick then they can wear a mask, mm-hmm

Watch me making my luck
Every minute-minute
Heading straight to the top
Ain't no limit-limit
Keep on making it pop
'Til my name in Guinness
And I'm never gonna stop

I'ma need a bigger bag for all this cash
Fuck a breather, I'ma grind until I'm ash
Sip my tea hot while they're steeping in their lack
Wanna keep up
Bitch, you better boss up fast
Boss up
Boss up
I'ma make you boss up fast
Boss up
Boss up
I'ma make you boss up

Keep my money like I keep my body, thick as fuck
So if you wanna get it like I get it
Bitch, you better boss up

Look in the mirror, damn, I'm fucking fine
Got that Botox early, she forever twenty-five
Used to be the girl to shrink into a ball and cry
But now I be the woman
Eating little men alive, uh
Yeah, I'm the first in my fam to a get a mil'
Put it in my purse 'til it burst from all the bills
In it for the heart of it but money is a benefit
I get it, get it, get it
And I'm never getting sick of it
Hard work, working
Keep all the exes lurking
And if you hang with me, bitch, we will get your ass a Birkin

Watch me making my luck
Every minute-minute
Heading straight to the top
Ain't no limit-limit
Keep on making it pop
'Til my name in Guinness
And I'm never gonna stop

I'ma need a bigger bag for all this cash
Fuck a breather, I'ma grind until I'm ash
Sip my tea hot, while they're steeping in their lack
Wanna keep up
Bitch, you better boss up fast
Boss up
Boss up
I'ma make you boss up fast
Boss up
Boss up
I'ma make you boss up

Keep my money like I keep my body, thick as fuck
So if you wanna get it like I get it
Bitch, you better boss up

Color color green
Looking good on me
Dollar dollar tree
Not the energy
They be bringing heat
But I you know I keep it
Icy
'Cause a CEO is all I see
Color color green
Looking good on me
Dollar dollar tree
Not the energy
They be bringing heat
But I you know I keep it
Icy
'Cause a CEO is all I see
