		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think you know yet, what you're wanting back
I don't think it shows yet, who can give you that
But I hope it's changing, slowly as you move
And I know you're worthy, I do
There's a spark in your eye
I've seen it
It is how you're designed
Believe it
Maybe now's not the time
But I mean it
There's a spark in your eye
I've seen it
So long I need to not need you
There's a spark in your eye
I've seen it
It is how you're designed
Believe it
Maybe now's not the time
But I mean it
There's a spark in your eye
I've seen it
So long I need to not need you
