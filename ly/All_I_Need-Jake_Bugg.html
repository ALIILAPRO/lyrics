		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call me cynical, but original
Trying to fit into a world that so digital
Came to let you know, I left the pigeonhole
Now I got to find the next one, let it go

I don't think twice
'Cause I know my mind
This could be our time
Tonight, it feels so right

All I need
It don't let me down
It don't let me down

All I need
And it don't let me down
It don't let me down

Tell me where the fight is
Tell me where the high is
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

Tell me where the fight is
Tell me where the high is
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

I know who you are, and I'm never wrong
And I believe your nothing if you think you are someone
Just try and realize that you don't have to lie
Everybody is trying to live just one day at a time

I don't think twice
'Cause I know my mind
This could be our time
Tonight, it feels so right

All I need
It don't let me down
It don't let me down

All I need
It don't let me down
It don't let me down

Tell me where the fight is
Tell me where the high is
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

Tell me where the fight is
Tell me where the high is
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?

I don't think twice
'Cause I know my mind

All I need (all I need)
It don't let me down
It don't let me down (ooh)

All I need
It don't let me down
It don't let me down

Tell me where the fight is (ooh)
Tell me where the high is (tell me)
Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now? (hear me)

Tell me where the fight is (ooh)
Tell me where the high is
Can you hear me now? (ooh, hear me)
Can you hear me now? (can you? Yeah)
