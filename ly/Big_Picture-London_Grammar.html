		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, what did you do to me?
My only hope is to let life stretch out before me
And break me on this lonely road
I'm made of many things, but I'm not what you are made of

Only now do I see the big picture
But I swear that these scars are fine
Only you could've hurt me in this perfect way tonight
I might be blind, but you've told me the difference
Between mistakes and what you just meant for me

Don't say you ever loved me
Don't say you ever cared
My darkest friend was

Have you forgotten all the lies you left there so fresh
Turning old in the air
And now, you have no weapons
You can try to get close to those I love
Do you really think they don't know what you're made of

Only now do I see the big picture
But I swear that these scars are fine
Only you could've hurt me in this perfect way tonight
I might be blind but you've told me the difference
Between mistakes and what you just meant for me

Someone say you ever loved me
Don't say you ever cared
My darkest friend was
