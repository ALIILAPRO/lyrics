		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight
You are the spring, ours life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever

I am the one who came when you feel down
I was the only one around (the only one)
When things were hurting you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seemed so hard to be
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (we are forever)

I am your friend, through thick and thin
We need each other
We'll never part, pur love is from the heart
We never say I don't need you
We are forever

I am the one who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be (the only one)
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever,
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

I am forever (I am forever)
We are forever (we are forever)

You are the sun that lights up the sky
When things are shady
Let come what may we do get by

I was the only one around (the only one)
When things would hurt you

We are forever (I am forever)
We are forever (I am forever)

We are forever (what you live for?)
We are forever
(What you live for? Our love is strong)
We are forever, oh right
We are forever, alright
I am forever
I am forever (alright)
We are forever
We are forever
I am forever
I am forever
