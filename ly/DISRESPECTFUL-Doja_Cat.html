		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you know what I want
The way they wish I wouldn't fall
The way you save me from them dogs
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful (yeah)
(Let's go, ah, yeah)
Yeah

Woah there, boy, don't go there, boy
Tell me how they 'posed to breathe with no air, boy
Okay, way you treat 'em ain't no fair, boy
They all wanna get a piece of them coattails, boy
Class act, put you in the business
Even in economy, I'm giving him the biscuit
Give 'em any task, any man here would risk it
For me, they ain't cuffin', that's imaginative figment
All disrespect, you ain't letting your foot off
I like it when they mad and we making they wood soft
Uh, yeah, he nice and he fine and he tall
But if I'm with him, I'm eventually finding flaws
What the heck it is, his smile and walk
He got experience and generously kind and soft
Sexy the way that he sensitive
Jealousy don't ever get the best of him
Thank God, 'cause

The way you know what I want
The way they wish I wouldn't fall
The way you save me from them dogs
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful
Baby, it's disrespectful

All the ugly boys (get rowdy)
All the pretty boys (get rowdy)
All the skinny boys (get rowdy)
All the big boys (get rowdy)
All the rich boys (get rowdy)
You a hustler (get rowdy)
You ain't getting funds (get rowdy)
I ain't kidding, boys, come on (get rowdy)
