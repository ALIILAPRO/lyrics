		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean
Wish I was not afraid
Of all I have that's broken
I know I must behave
To contain all my emotion

But I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean

Like a hidden cave
I am always open
I hold the space you made
I'm empty but still hoping
I have a feeling
A terrible fear encroaching

That I'll never love a boy
The way I love the ocean

I ask why
It's better to speak than it is to die
One more try
It's better to laugh than it is to lie

I thought I had a man
Someone who could hold me
But nobody can
I wish someone had told me
I was born yesterday
And I'm still wet, still soaking
And I want to love a boy
The way I love the ocean

The way I love the ocean
The way I love the ocean
