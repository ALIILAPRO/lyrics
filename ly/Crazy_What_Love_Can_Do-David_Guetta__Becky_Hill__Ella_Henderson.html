		  Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da

Wrap me up in diamonds, cover me in gold 
But nothing they could buy me made my heart whole 
I'd given up on romance, then I found you 
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

Can someone tell me what is happenin' to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe
Didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

Wrap me up in diamonds, cover me in gold (gold)
But nothing they could buy me made my heart whole
I was lonely, lonely, then I found you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

Can someone tell me what is happenin' to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe (finally breathe)
I didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da (can do, do)
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da (can do, do)
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da (can do)
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

I don't ever wanna close my eyes
'Cause this feeling's like paradise
Never felt like this in my whole life
Ain't it crazy what love can do?

Can someone tell me what is happenin' to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe (finally breathe)
Didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love

Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da (ah)
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da (oh, whoa)
Da-da-da-da, do-do
Dun-da-da, da-dun-da-da (oh)
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?

Can someone tell me what is happenin' to me? (Ah)
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe (finally breathe)
I didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain't it crazy what love can do, crazy what love can do?
