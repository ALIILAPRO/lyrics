		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you asked me why did I do that
I'd sigh
If you asked me why I never look back
I'd want to know why
If you asked me bout the friends I choose
If they would stay
And who'd stand up to the test of time
I'd just have to say

It's none of your
It's none of your
It's none of your business

I keep myself to myself
It's all that I do
May I suggest 
You do the same
Don't need nobody else
Laying their blame
On me

If you told me that the time has come
I'd say that it's not
If you told me that you told me twice
I'd say I forgot
If you don't care for the words I use
You know what to do
Pack up all of your bags and go
It's all up to you

Because it's none of your
It's none of your
It's none of your business

(The Best Thing in My Life)

I like the way you look and sound
I like the way all things get turned around
The way you don't hold out for too long
For when I know that I've said something wrong
You are my reason
You are my light
Always be the one who sorts out wrong from right
You are the message
That I hope to find
You'll be the one for me
Time and time

You are my feeling
You are my sound
You are just the best thing in my life

You are still my lifeline come what may
What's more I'm gonna say it anyway
You'll be the first and you're the last
You are the only one since time has passed
You got all my numbers
And I got all yours
I know I never ever felt like this before
You are my season
You are my soul
You are forever, I want it, more and more

You are my feeling
You are my sound
You are just the best thing in my life
