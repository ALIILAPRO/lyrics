		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell

This is our life and we livin' it well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

Let's go to (paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (paradise)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured
But I swear I've never loved you more
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (paradise)

I'm feelin' it, my head's where the ceilin' is (oh yeah)
This energy turns nights into memories (oh yeah)
Count up the bands, you've been workin' all summer
Ex didn't know what he had, what a bummer
Insecure people turn to insecure lovers
Well, my drink is almost out and I'm about to pour another

Just let it out
The night has just begun, we on a level now
If I get too fucked up, promise you'll hold me down
Yeah, this that shit you can't deny
This that shit you feel inside

This our life, our time, we livin' well
Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

Let's go to (paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights (ooh, it do)
This shit make me feel alive (baby)
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (paradise, oh yeah)
Don't know if it's the drink I poured (poured)
But I swear I've never loved you more (loved you more)
When you right here, I come alive
One more hit and we can fly
This shit feel like (paradise)
