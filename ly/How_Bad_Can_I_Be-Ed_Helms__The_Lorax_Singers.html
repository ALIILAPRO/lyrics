		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just following my destiny
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? How bad can I possibly be?

Well, there's a principal of nature (principal of nature) 
That almost every creature knows
Called survival of the fittest (survival of the fittest) 
And check it this is how it goes
The animal that is has got to scratch and bite and claw and bite and punch 
And the animal that doesn't (well the animal that doesn't) winds up 
Someone else's lu-lu-lu-lu-unch! (I'm just saying')

How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just following my destiny
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just doin' what comes naturally
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? How bad can I possibly be?

Well, there's a principal of business (principal of business) 
And everybody knows his sound
He says the people with the money (people with the money) 
Makes the money-lovin' world go 'round!
So I bigger in my company, I bigger in my factory, I bigger in my corporate size!
Everybody out there take care if yours and me? 
I'll take care of mine, mine, mine, mine, mine! (Shake that bottom line!)
Let me hear you say 'smogulous smoke' (smogulous smoke)
Schloppity schlop (schloppity schlop)
Complain all you want, it's never ever, ever, ever gonna stop

Come on how bad can I possibly be?

How ba-a-a-ad can I be? I'm just building the economy
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? Just look at me pettin' this puppy
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? A portion of proceeds goes to charity!
How ba-a-a-ad can I be? How bad can I possibly be? Let's see!

(How ba-a-a-ad can I be?) All the customers are flying!
(How ba-a-a-ad can I be?) All the money's multiplying!
(How ba-a-a-ad can I be?) And the PR people are lying!
(How ba-a-a-ad can I be?) And the lawyers are denying!
(How ba-a-a-ad can I be?) Who cares if a few trees are dying?
(How ba-a-a-ad can I be?) This is oh so gratifying!

How bad? How bad can this possibly be?
