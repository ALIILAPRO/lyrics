		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Metro)

I been betrayed before, I done been played before
Givin' 'em all the smoke, givin' 'em all
I done been left in the rain, I ain't have nowhere to go
I feel less of a man, I can't depend on a ho
They put my brother inside the ground, I found me a sound
Don't care if it's war, we fuckin' on bitches, I'm holdin' 'em down
If she a hustler, fine and honest, I'm bringin' her 'round
I told her, "I don't care what you do in the street
Just don't make me look like a clown"

Big dawg status, my play money, whole M stacks in the PayPal
Caught a opp' hangin' at a barbecue and fucked around and shot the whole playground
Eastside nigga 'bout gunplay, say the wrong thing, we'll chase y'all
Hit 'em broad-day with a AR, 12 still tryna get the case off
One twenty-five wsa the backend, still on tour with a MAC-10
Count a couple Ms, I'm clappin', make sure the Phantom get a fraction
Don't think I'm just rappin' and all these lyrics cappin'
Talkin' out his neck, we right hook, left hook, stomped and slapped him
VVs in my ear, I look like a star
Plain Jane Richard, I coulda bought a car
If she ain't givin' top, we gon' let her starve
Your shooter wrote a statement, so now we call him Searge'
Hit him with the AK, make him burn carbs
I brought my Thunder to Los Angeles, Paul George
Make a brick, do the whoa with a Ford
Got a thot pregnant, whoa, hit abort
Niggas know I'm geeked, high on the moon
21, made man, bada-boom
Pussy boy, you're lukewarm, not cool
Glock, Ruger, KelTec, rob who?
Your baby mama went to Cali
She touchin' the city, we gettin' 'em gone
We really tryna catch a body
You just tryna catch a body in a song
I let down my guard, I showed her my heart
She couldn't believe it was chrome
Them pants thirty-five hunnid
Mediocre rappers can't put 'em on

I been betrayed before, I done been played before
Givin' 'em all the smoke, givin' 'em all
I done been left in the rain, I ain't have nowhere to go
I feel less of a man, I can't depend on a ho
They put my brother inside the ground, I found me a sound
Don't care if it's war, we fuckin' on bitches, I'm holdin' 'em down
If she a hustler, fine and honest, I'm bringin' her 'round
I told her, "I don't care what you do in the street
Just don't make me look like a clown"
