		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

I won't stop, not now
Guess what?
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body right
I glow in light
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body

Some people do
But some, they just like to talk (okay)
Some shoot the breeze
But some like to leave a mark (okay)
Some need the light
And some people like the dark (okay, yeah)

I won't stop, not now
Guess what?
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body right
I glow in light
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body

Gimme release
Keep the drugs, gimme relief
Keep the love, just gimme a piece of that
One piece of that
Give it to me
Don't blush, just give it to me
No heart, no second degree tonight
Run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to

My body, my body, my body (hey-la, hey-la, it's my body)
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body
My body, my body, my body 
Hey-la, hey-la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to (hey-la, hey-la, it's my body)
