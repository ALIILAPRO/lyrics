		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise

My boy was a montage
A slow-motion love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight

Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect, shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day

So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unraveled
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight

Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

Rain, he wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV

I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnight's like this, midnight's like this)
