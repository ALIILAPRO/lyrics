		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tan
In her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you
May never ever have that chance again

That chance again, babe
Woo

Westbound Greyhound to Tinseltown 
To pursue her movie star dreams
She's giving hot tricks to men just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you
May never ever have that chance again

That chance again, babe

She gave up her life to follow her dreams (again, babe)
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad (ooh)
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality for Ms. Hollywood

Woo, lipstick in hand
Tahitian tan
In her painted on jeans

She dreams of fame
She changed her name
To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time that means

She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
It's true, that you
May never ever have that chance again

That chance again, babe

You know it, baby
(Westbound Greyhound)
(To Tinseltown)
(To pursue her movie star dreams) again, babe
(She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood) woo

(Westbound Greyhound)
(To Tinseltown)
(To pursue her movie star dreams) again, babe
(Hollywood, she's Hollywood) ah
You know it, baby

(Westbound Greyhound)
(To Tinseltown)
(To pursue her movie star dreams) again, babe
(Hollywood, she's Hollywood) woo

(Westbound Greyhound)
(To Tinseltown)
(To pursue her movie star dreams) again, babe
(She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood) woo

She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
Hollywood, she's Hollywood
She's Hollywood, she's Hollywood
