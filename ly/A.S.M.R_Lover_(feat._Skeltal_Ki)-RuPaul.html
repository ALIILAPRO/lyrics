		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you deliver
These goosebumps, these shivers
And where they end up
Make me 'bout to erupt
And they go all the way down
For you I'm all the way down
You know that thing that you do
Whenever you get close to me
You blow that tingle in my ear
Make it go right straight through me
They go all the way down
For you I'm all the way down

You make me feel
Whisper in my ear
That's what you are, lover
A.S.M.- Are you for real?
All I wanna hear
Whatever you have to say
Long as you whisper to me, eh, eh
A-a-a-a.S.M.R. Lover
That's what you are to me, eh, eh
A-a-a-a.S.M.R. Lover
That is what you are

Come over (hey), come hither 
The closer (hey) the better
Throat vocalizing (hey) like reverb
That microphone sound sweeter when wetter
Two mics are better than one
Give it to me stereo, 'cause it's double the fun
Now lemme hear your nut crackin', lip smackin'
Got cherries poppin' when you chewin' that gum (hey)
Audibly, you really do it for me and by that I mean sonically
Honestly, I wanna be forever under your spell
Like when your lips surround me
Left, right, left, right
Chills all down my spine I like
You in my head every night
To knock me out, y'all know what I mean, right?

You make me feel
Whisper in my ear
That's what you are, lover
A.S.M.- Are you for real?
All I wanna hear
Whatever you have to say
Long as you whisper to me, eh, eh
A-a-a-a.S.M.R. Lover
That's what you are to me, eh, eh
A-a-a-a.S.M.R. Lover
That is what you are

You knock me out
Keep whispering it to me
Send chills right through me and don't stop
Don't hush your mouth

You make me feel
Whisper in my ear
That's what you are, lover
A.S.M.- Are you for real?
All I wanna hear
Whatever you have to say
Long as you whisper to me, eh, eh
A-a-a-a.S.M.R. Lover
That's what you are to me, eh, eh
A-a-a-a.S.M.R. Lover
That is what you are (you are)
