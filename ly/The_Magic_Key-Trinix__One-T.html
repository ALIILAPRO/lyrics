		<p>
		  (Listen up)
This sudden end to my days
Makes me wish I'd changed my ways
Spent more time with the posse
One-T, Nine-T, Bull-T, me

From up here life seems so small
What's the meaning of it all?
Miss the way, it used to be
One-T, Nine-T, Bull-T, me

Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen, find the magic key (listen up)
Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen, let your life be free (listen up)

(Listen up)
(Listen up)

Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen, find the magic key-key-key-key
Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen, find the magic key-key-key-key (listen up)

Blissful days, what you gonna do?
Still I miss my old T-crew
Can't after live without them
I just wish they only knew
May they have lived without a home
But my homies loved me, kept me warm
Taught me to forget about the game
Money, hatred, hunger, pain

This sudden end to my days
Makes me wish I'd changed my ways
Spent more time with the posse
One-T, Nine-T, Bull-T, me

Missing you, missing you
Missing you, magic crew

Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen, find the magic key (listen up)
Music's the odyssey (yeah)
It's here for you, for me
Just listen, let your life be free (magic key)

(Listen up)
(Listen up)

Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen find the magic key-key-key-key
Music's the odyssey
It's here for you, for me
Just listen find the magic key-key-key-key
