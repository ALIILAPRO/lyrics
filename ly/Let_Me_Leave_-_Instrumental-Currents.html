		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wide awake in clothes I haven't changed
For days and days as the sun creeps through
The window on my face
Just let it go
You say I'm like a ghost
My skin is white as paper
As I haunt the halls of my home, oh

I scream like it would stop the ache
Your colors start to show (to show)
I know what I have to do but it kills me

Rewriting all the songs
I change your name but I know
You'll still take everything to heart
Just let it go
I wonder if we'll die with hope
Or if we'll be counting the sins
We carry deeply as we go

I just wanted you to have a better life (better life)
Not always shying away from your thoughts on the inside
I, I could set you free

I put you on a shelf knowing that I'd be
Too far to reach you from down in hell
The sun slumps back as I burn your dreams
To the best of my ability
So just let me leave

I scream like it would stop the ache
Your colors start to show (show)
I know what I have to do but it kills me
Sleep, if anything, I'll dream
It's only then I'll have you
I know what I have to do but it kills me
