		  (Durel made the beat, I'ma rock wit it)
(Takeoff)

I cop me a coupe and I hop in it (coupe)
He claimin' the game, but he not it (nah)
That Birkin bag came with the fire in it (brrr)
He told you a rap with a lie in it (lie)
He got some new jewels, he's flexin' his ice
He praying to God he don't die in it (God)
Let me take 'em back to the bando on the Nawf
Don't you remind me (Nawf)
I try to stay low but I shine so bright
So it be hard not to find me (shine)
These rainbow diamonds up in that Rollie
No, this not your regular timepiece (rainbow)
Come place your order, gon' cost you a quarter
And there's a fee to stand beside me (fee)
God forbid if somebody try me
I'm turning this shit to a crime scene (grrr)
Grab a cig and put up the kid
The mini Draco in the arm sling (shoot)
And ain't no jumpin', no switchin' no side
When I let it sing, the bell ring (no)
Please don't judge me just 'cause of my cover
'Cause you never seen what I seen (go)

(When the racks too skinny)
I walk in the bih with my gun out (bow)
You don't know what I know, ain't seen what I seen
What the fuck they be talkin' 'bout? (Huh?)
Damn (damn)
She stick on a bag and went on this bitch to clock out (go)
I pulled the F&N out of my drawers
She thought I was pullin' my cock out (cock out)
If you touch one of us, we bust your little bitty shit get shot down (rah)
You're not one of us, I did not trust you then
Especially not now (not now)
Young nigga come through spittin' this swangin' shit
It's a Nawfside playground (Nawfside)
Yeah, zip 'em up, spray ground (zip 'em)
We gon', 85 Nawf-bound (skrr)
Yes sir, this Migo business (yes sir)
We divided the field like tennis (we divided the field)
We shook up the trenches
Movin' the tenants and still trappin' in it (trap, trap)
It's a handoff fifty (woo)
I'll stack it up, double it, spend it (stack it, stack it)

When the racks too skinny (too skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, uh)
When the racks too skinny (too skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, woo)
When the racks too skinny (go)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, uh)
When the racks too skinny (skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze)
When the racks too skinny (too skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze)

(Offset)
Dropped out of school (hey)
Kicked down the door, bust it down now we full (kicked door)
Know 'bout the denim, the patches velour
I sent 'em, they split 'em, don't go back and forth
I got a stick, this bitch take down a horse (stick)
Basketball seats in the Wraith like a court (hey)
We get you split, get you put in a morgue (morgue)
Big body mansion with basketball courts (courts)
Count a whole M up, my thumb was sore (sore)
Just look at the bitch and I know I'ma score (score)
Two-hunnid cash with a mag in my drawer (mag)
I'm pullin' strings like I play the guitar (hey)
Dracos and MACs, we ready for war (Draco, Draco)
We petty, we spend every day with them cut up machete
I spend a little lettuce, he sent to the medics
My money come steady
Somebody die, only way I can dead it
I heard your money was shedding
We on the verge, worth hundreds of millions (verge)
They trick of your top and I took off my ceiling
Cash in the vault, I got more than a million
M's in the bank, I don't care 'bout a penny (M's)
Play with the gang, we stay and we drill 'em
Fuck it, we crash, we villain
I'm in my bag and I'm hittin'

When the racks too skinny (too skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, woo)
When the racks too skinny (go)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, uh)
When the racks too skinny (skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, soo)
When the racks too skinny (too skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, uh)
When the racks too skinny (racks)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, woo)
When the racks too skinny (go)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, uh)
When the racks too skinny (skinny)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, soo)
When the racks too skinny (racks)
I can make some, squeeze a milli (squeeze, uh)
