		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My only was lonely, my heartbeat would hold me like every night
You showed up and showed me to shut off the lonely, you'll be alright
Nobody knows me the way that you know me, I'm losing time
Deliriously, I'm

Tracing all the curves of your face
Caught up in a permanent phase

I don't know what day it is
That's fine (fine)
Got me in a fever dream
Oh my
I don't know what day it is
Or night, that's fine
We're timeless you and I
I, I, I, I, I

There's nothing above it, my dearest beloved, it's almost rude
Enlightened, I'm hiding, potentially frightened to knock on wood
Nobody knows me the way that you know me, so understood
How do you feel so good

Tracing all the curves of your face
Caught up in a permanent phase

I don't know what day it is
That's fine (that's fine)
Got me in a fever dream
Oh my (oh my)
I don't know what day it is
Or night, that's fine
We're timeless you and I
I, I, I, I, I

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Timeless
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Timeless
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Timeless
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Timeless

Tracing all the curves of your face
Caught up in a permanent phase

I don't know what day it is (I don't know what day it is)
That's fine (that's fine)
Got me in a fever dream (got me in a fever dream)
Oh my (oh my)
I don't know what day it is (no, I don't know)
Or night, that's fine (that's fine)
We're timeless you and I
I, I, I, I, I

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (we're timeless)
Timeless (we're timeless you and I)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (we're timeless)
Timeless (we're timeless you and I)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (we're timeless)
Timeless (we're timeless you and I)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (you and I)
Timeless
