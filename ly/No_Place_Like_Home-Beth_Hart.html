		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time on the road
Without a soul to call my own
I'm tired of talking to the cards
I miss the flowers in the yard

There's no place like home
No place like home
There's no place I'd rather be than home

I'm gonna move out of the street
Stack some stones maybe grow some wheat
Build a fire for a little heat
And have someone curl up at my feet

There's no place like home
No place like home
There's no place I'd rather be than home

I wanna hang up some pretty things
From my suitcase full of dreams
Maybe a letter or an old post card
That paper star stole from a jar

There's no place like home
No place like home
There's no place I'd rather be than home

The sweetest words I ever heard
Is welcome home
It's been a long and dusty road

There's a place that's meant for us
Full of faith, hope, love and trust
I'll keep trudging up the road
But someday I'll be going home

There's no place like home
No place like home
There's no place I'd rather be than home
Home, home
Home, home
