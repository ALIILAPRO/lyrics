		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I might
Disintegrate into the thin air if you like
And I'm not

The dark center of the universe like you thought
Well it took a lot of work to be the ass that I am
And I'm pretty damn sure that anyone can
Easily, equally fuck ya over
Well God said something but he didn't mean it
Everyone's life ends but no one ever completes it
Dry and wet ice, they both melt
And you're equally cheated
Well it took a lot of work

Well an endless ocean landing on an endless desert
Well it's funny as hell, but no one laughs when they get there
If you can't see the thin air
Why the hell should you care?
Well it took a lot of work

Well sure you'll tell me you've got nothing to say
And I went and shook hands the other day
If you can't see the thin air then
What the hell is in your way?
