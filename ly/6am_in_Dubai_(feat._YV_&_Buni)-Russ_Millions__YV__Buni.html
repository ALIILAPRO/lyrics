6AM in Dubai, 'Bai
Ask your girl 'bout Shy, Shy
Man make a diamond die, die
Twenty-one floors in the sky, high
Said they're on me, why lie?
Just like Sizzla, dry cry
Ask your girl 'bout Y, Y
When Russ make the car loose (bine, bine)

Free up the opps, bring 'em back outside
I'll pull up on them, fill 'em up with bine
Love a machine like I love my wife
Can't pull up on gang, better love your life
Jump, jump, jump out, pull up and kweng-kweng
Pull up with glen, lengs and bem-bem
Ten car convoy, waps, and a yeng-yeng
Stay with a heater, that's my best friend

6AM in Dubai, 'Bai
Ask your girl 'bout Shy, Shy
Man make a diamond die, die
Twenty-one floors in the sky, high
Said they're on me, why lie?
Just like Sizzla, dry cry
Ask your girl 'bout Y, Y
When Russ make the car loose (bine, bine)

Copper and lead, we ain't firin' blanks
Killy's them could probably buy a whole tank
She said I'm contagious, man are just bland
Controversy makers, man are not bad
Buni too crazy, wanna just crash
One of a kind, turn the whole place mad
Come too close and you might meet Max
G Wag', Urus, killy, press gas (yo)

6AM in Dubai, 'Bai
Ask your girl 'bout Shy, Shy
Man make a diamond die, die
Twenty-one floors in the sky, high
Said they're on me, why lie?
Just like Sizzla, dry cry
Ask your girl 'bout Y, Y
When Russ make the car loose (bine, bine)

It could rain or shine
Day or night, any time, he can hold this bine
It's opp block, where we let that shine
Or main-road if for certain guys
Beef can't dead 'til ten of them die
And I got more fries for five of them guys
You soon get touched, don't think you can slide
You gon' slip, more time

6AM in Dubai, 'Bai
Ask your girl 'bout Shy, Shy
Man make a diamond die, die
Twenty-one floors in the sky, high
Said they're on me, why lie?
Just like Sizzla, dry cry
Ask your girl 'bout Y, Y
When Russ make the car loose (bine, bine)
