		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She walks on fire
Watch it burn in her eyes
Her wicked beauty sure will
Take you for a ride
She plays it sweet with such
An innocent disguise
You'll only see it come
Out at night
I'm weak in the knees
Whatever you please
Cause I'm in shackles
Hypnotic lover taking
Over my mind
Your spell is binding
Makes it so hard to fight
She twists her hips and
Keeps it coming all night
I can't control myself
That girl is so fine
If looks could kill I'd be a
Dead man you see
But I would never wish to
Be set free
My queen of lust tell me
What is your decree
You don't know what it's
Doing to me
I've fallen for you
What more can I do
Cause I'm in shackles
Hypnotic lover taking
Over my mind
Your spell is binding makes
It so hard to find
She twists her hips and
Keeps it coming all night
I can't control myself
That girl is so fine
I get lost in your divine
And walk along the wild side
There's no heart for breaking
Cause mine is taken when
You look me in the eyes
I'm addicted to your love
It's all I'm thinking of
If I'm in prison keep on living
Life in shackles
Hypnotic lover taking
Over my mind
Your spell is binding makes
It so hard to find
She twists her hips and
Keeps it coming all night
I can't control myself
That girl is so fine
