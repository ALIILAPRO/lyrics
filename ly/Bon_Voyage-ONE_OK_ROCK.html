		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It took some time to realize that things are not getting better
We should know, we should know it's over
You're seeing the other side of me
We tried to weather the weather
We should know, we should know that night's gone

熱が二つを引き合わせ
冷めてしまえば never getting better
I know things won't change
I'm saying Bon Voyage
Down to the line, down to the line
It's time to sail
We're stuck on repeat
I'm saying Bon Voyage
Down to the line, down to the line
I'm letting go

I hope you find another life
Maybe you'll start getting better
We should know, we should know
It's over
I miss the days I spent alone before we lived together
We should know, we should know
That time's gone

熱が二つを引き合わせ
冷めてしまえば never getting better
I know things won't change
I'm saying Bon Voyage
Down to the line, down to the line
It's time to sail
We're stuck on repeat
I'm saying Bon Voyage
Down to the line, down to the line
I'm letting go
Bon Voyage, Bon Voyage, Bon Voyage, Bon Voyage

I know things won't change
I'm saying Bon Voyage
Down to the line, down to the line
It's time to sail
We're stuck on repeat
I'm saying Bon Voyage
Down to the line, down to the line
I'm letting go
Bon Voyage, Bon Voyage
