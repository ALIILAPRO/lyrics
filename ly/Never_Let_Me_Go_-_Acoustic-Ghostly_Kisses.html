		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me
Where will you go now?
Can I follow you?
Can I follow you?
 
Tell me what you really want
Show me how to drift where you are
Where no one else has ever been before
 
Will I ever be the one
Who knows you more than anyone?
Like no one else has ever been before 
 
Never let me go
I wanna know what lies ahead
Ahead of us
Never let me fall
I wanna live up here
Up here in your arms
Please don't go now
Stay where you are
Please don't go now
Is that all?
 
Tell me
Where do we go now?
I will follow you
I will follow you
 
Tell me what you really want
Show me how to drift ashore
That inner self no one has seen before
 
Will you share your secret sun?
Who loves you more than anyone?
Like no one else has ever loved before

Never let me go
I wanna know what lies ahead
Ahead of us
Never let me fall
I wanna live up here
Up here in your arms
Please don't go now
Stay where you are
Please don't go now
Come back home
