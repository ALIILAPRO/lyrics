		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got musics for days
Weren't taking a break
Just watching the game getting played out
Them man there sit on the fence
They don't live what they say
Their bars are made up
I'm still in the trenches
Keeping my pace running nuin like Gatlin
I don't see no evil
Speak no evil
So I don't hear none
I've blown my stack
No cash in the bank
Streets want music
I'm out in the rain
Taking Ls got my head in my hand
Video shoot they seeing the whip
Big drip outside wid alla da gang
Now they asking when is the blue vid coming
Like bro the ting gurn bang
I don't even know but It soon gurn land
Some do this ting for the likes
Not me I don't really care bro
A million streams got em calling my phone like damn you really gone clear bro
They ain't done it like me still their loving the ting I'm the mandems hero
Secret haters on man
I don't really care why them man there weirdos
I'm active in a real life
Offline getting it in real real time
Built this ting from the ground
Now they seeing success now it's me they warn be like
You gotta guard your heart from all of this praise
You ain't gotta tell me twice
So I'm keeping my circle a circle tight
I don't need no new guys
New year but still on glides
Dead weight man cut few ties
Me I'm far from perfect dirt on my hands through grace I'm still gurn shine
Out of sight but still on minds
I been really quite since last year
24 starting with a big old bang
Back and better not new here
Back shifting it up a few gears
Don't talk to me if you don't wanna mash work we don't give no free food here
Them boy play dirty
So why would I play fair
I give my problem's to God
The get backs long that's one of his fortes
Back and better
Increase the pressure
If your tryna settle just go away
How's a man on his ass just talking wass but you ain't made bread in 4 days
I'm a hussala baby
Even in school was the one shotting food in the hallway
In this new generation still got beef the the enemy call me salt bae
