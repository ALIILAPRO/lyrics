		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me dizzy, running circles in my head
One of these days, I'll chase you down
Well, look who's going crazy now
We're face to face, my friend
Better get out, better get out

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out

You can see this on my face, it's all for you
The more and more I take, I break right through
And therapy still scares me, put me on my back again

I may be crazy, little frayed around the ends
One of these days, I'll phase you out
Burn it in the blast off, burn it in the blast off
Watching me crawl away
Try to get out, try to get out

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

Break out, break out
Break out, break out
Go, go, go

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
You know you make me break out
Make me break out
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that
I don't wanna look like that

You know you make me break out
Make me break out
Make me break out, yeah
