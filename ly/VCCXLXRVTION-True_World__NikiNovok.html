		  Damn
Damn

Damn painted chef banged up in my motherfucking crisper glass
Damn painted chef banged up In my motherfucking crisper glass
Motherfucking crisper glass
Motherfucking crisper glass
Crisper glass
Motherfucking crisper glass
Niggers be running they come

Ooohhhh

Sooner or later I might take flight
Kicking it with my crispness and bridges and we handle this shit
First we sticking these niggers up and then we holler if they bitch
That's how the shit goes
That's how the shit rolls
Motherfuckers bitch If I can get my fucking close
To and then I'll go fucking with her oh hope

Fuck you

See a nigga talking shit
Pepper jelly go for yours
Recess stuff go right back stuff that bitch up like a poster boy
Found both on the screen but it ain't no thing and it ain't no need to worry
Rambling through his wallet and it looks like paydays early so

Damn painted chef banged up in my motherfucking crisper glass
Damn painted chef banged up In my motherfucking crisper glass
Motherfucking crisper glass
Motherfucking crisper glass
Crisper glass
Motherfucking crisper glass
Niggers be mother mother mother fucking

Sooner or later I might take flight
Kicking it with my crispness and bridges and we handle this shit
First we sticking these niggers up and then we holler if they bitch
That's how the shit goes
That's how the shit rolls
Motherfuckers bitch If I can get my fucking close
First we sticking these niggers up and then we holler if they bitch
That's how the shit goes
That's how the shit rolls
