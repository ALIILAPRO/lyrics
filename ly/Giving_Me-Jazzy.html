		  Yeah-yeah
Ooh-ooh

I blame you for all the hurt and all the pain
All the sunshine and the rain (stay)
This feeling that I know, you're giving me
No lies, you're loving me
Hugging me, touching me
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
You're giving me, you're giving me
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
You're giving me, you're giving me

Step by step when you're moving in
When you come to the club and you're tuning in
Hold tight to your man 'cause I'm movin' in
Four by four, what you cruising in
Boy, you got me feeling good, won't you come on, baby?
Boy, you got me feeling good, you know I want you, baby
Step by step when you're moving in
When you come to the club and you're tuning in
Hold tight to your man 'cause I'm movin' in
Four by four, what you cruising in
Boy, you got me feeling good, won't you come on, baby?
Boy, you got me feeling good, you know I want you, baby

You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
Boy, you got me feelin' good (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
Boy, you got me feelin' good, you know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
(You're giving me)

I blame you for all the hurt and all the pain
All the sunshine and the rain (stay)
This feeling that I know, you're giving me
No lies, you're loving me
Hugging me, touching me
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
You're giving me, you're giving me
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da
You're giving me, you're giving me

Step by step when you're moving in
When you come to the club and you're tuning in
Hold tight to your man 'cause I'm movin' in
Four by four, what you cruising in
Boy, you got me feeling good, won't you come on, baby?
Boy, you got me feeling good, you know I want you, baby

You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
Boy, you got me feelin' good (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
You know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
Boy, you got me feelin' good, you know I want you, baby (you're giving me)
(You're giving me)

La-da-da-da-da-da-da (you're giving me)
Da-da-da-da-da (you're giving me)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da (you're giving me)
You're giving me
La-da-da-da-da-da-da (you're giving me)
Da-da-da-da-da (you're giving me)
La-da-da-da-da-da-da (you're giving me)
You're giving me
