		<p>
		  Don't tell me that you don't think it won't sell,
That's just a fucking lousy lie.
If they don't like it, it doesn't do well,
We'll give them something else to buy.

If you wanna do it go ahead.
Life ain't to long, you can't hang around.
If you conform you might as well be dead.
Be sure of what you want and what you've found.

When you say there's no other way,
I just laugh, know it's not true.
It's just them what they say, it's not you.
What are you afraid of? Do you know?
Do you begin to realise?
Just let it out, let it show,
Don't compromise.
Don't compromise.

Don't think what you parents might say,
If it's too noisy, fast and loud.
Just fuck 'em all, and do it anyway,
Stand up and be proud.
If you wanna...

When you say...
Don't try to be something you're not,
We can see through you, who you're ripping off.
Try hard, give it your best shot,
You may go far.
