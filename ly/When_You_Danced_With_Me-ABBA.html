		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can remember when you left Kilkenny
And you told me, "I'll return next year"
I never meant to hold you to your promise
And the years went by and I'm still here
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

So is the outside world as you imagined?
Was it worth it, severing the ties?
Happy to see me or a bit embarrassed?
There's a darkness deep in your blue eyes
So you left for the city, I hope you like it there
You're only here now to see the Village Fair
You're just here for the music, that's all, or could it be
You miss the good old times when you danced with me

When you danced with me

I miss the good old times when you danced with me
