		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come tomorrow I'm going to be the one
That you will follow
Your world is so upside down 'cause
It's all over now

Take the high road and you'll
Take the low one
See it all through those passing hours
These moments seem so inside out
It's all over now it's all over

See the daytime you've seen the darkness
I'm torn apart through those many changes
A feeling that you'll understand
It's all over now

See me walking and hear me talking I'll
Guide you all through those endless ages
Your world was so upside down but
It's all over now it's all over

A feeling that you'll understand
It's all over
