		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One second

It's a cracked screen world
Where white blooms above the city (I'm sorry)
Catch sunrise and the freeway glows
Perfumed with Palo Santo (here's what I found)
Early flights touch down
Every day, the tired influencer (I didn't get that, could you try again?)
Ain't sleeping deep
Waiting for an answer
Gotta press on, brown eyes
I'll always keep you close beside me
Billing trees
'Cause that's the way it's meant to be

It was a different time (different time)
I hear that a lot up in the hills (in the hills)
Logic kills and Silver Lake reflections (reflections)
Just trying to keep my head up (my head up)

But nothing real anymore
In the world of the tired influencer
Ain't sleeping deep
Waiting for an answer
Gotta press on, brown eyes
I always keep you close beside me
Billing trees
'Cause that's the way it's meant to be

If you know
Is it meant to be?
If you know

Wear your love
Wear your love
Wear your love
Love
Is it love you need?
Wear your love
Wear your love (wear your love)
Wear your love
It's meant to be
Wear your love
Wear your love
Wear your love
Wear your love
