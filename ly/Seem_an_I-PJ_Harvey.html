		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bedraggled angels blethered
Across Eleven Acres
As belling from the boneyard
Rangled 'round the orchard

Her fingernails a-ripped
From hauling clay-filled fists
Out of the river's edges
For pots with happy voices

Consumed with twanketen
Only eased by scratching
Wisp-words slim as thistles
Or sickly chicken whistles

Seem an I a childhood
Of quartere'il and wormwood
Of not-friends running nowhere
Of vog a-veiling elsewhere

Till in the vaulted barn
Queer-lit by dummet zun
She knew herself a vessel
Fit for a different wordle

Where footsteps must be lone
And barefoot upon stones
The northwind's ever-host
Giving edges to the ghosts

Seem an I a childhood
Of quartere'il and wormwood
Of not-friends running nowhere
Of vog a-veiling elsewhere
Of mother's voice not calling
Of corrugated iron
Of devil's birds and whiskey
Of chilver hogs and fleecy

And nuts I could not reapy
And nuts I could not reapy
