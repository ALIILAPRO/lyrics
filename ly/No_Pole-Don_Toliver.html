		  Yeah-yeah, uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Uh-uh, yeah-yeah

She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (pay, yeah, pay, yeah)
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)
Scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)

Like did you get the memo?
She eat up load the reload
I'm poppin' hella Skittles
Then I can solve your riddle
Will smoke you like it's menthol
This dude is crazy mental
A swat hood hero
Got johnny dang dental
She's a nympho
She suave on the pillow
Got cheeky around dinero
She's too gone, that she can't hear, yeah (ooh, ooh)

She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go
She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (pay, yeah, pay, yeah)
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)
Scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)

Seen way too many ones
I'm 'bout to go some hunnids (I'm 'bout to throw some hunnids)
In that old life that you run from
Baby girl, keep running (ooh, keep running)
It's pressure with me, it's sexual to me (it's sexual to me)
Check my bank account (ooh, ooh), it's precious to me
Got my anchor out (ooh, ooh), I'm locked in your seat
You know you my baby now, special to me
I bought you time, I bought you diamonds, you can keep the receipt
I got you down, I got you loose, I guess you owe it to me
Is you down or nah? Fuck around, find your spouse
I get you lit, lit chyeah-chyeah
Watch me slip inside, yeah-yeah

She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole (oh)
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go (ooh, ooh)
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll (pay, yeah, pay, yeah)
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)
Scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt), scrape the bowl (skrrt, skrrt)

She know she don't wanna
Pull out, sent her on her way
She don't wanna hit the strip club, no, no
She don't wanna go strip, no, no
She don't wanna go strip, no way
