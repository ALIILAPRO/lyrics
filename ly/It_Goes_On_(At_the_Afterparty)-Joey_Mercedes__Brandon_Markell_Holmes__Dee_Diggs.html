		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not just about how good the party is, baby
It's also about the afterparty
It goes on and on and on
I wanna ask you, what kind of afters do you wanna have?
Can we have an afterparty?
Just for two, me and you?
Think about, it could go on and on and on
What kind of party do you wanna have?

Making plans and controlling my space
Letting go disregarding my pace
That's how it goes when you wanna walk away
I know you know but that be all I gotta say

Making love in the distance so close 
Hiding lies in the sheets where we belong
You probably thinking this is all going wrong
I promise you this all I wanna know

It goes on
It goes on
It goes on
It goes on

It goes on
It goes on
It goes on
It goes on

I'm scared now maybe
I'm scared
I'm scared
I'm scared now maybe
I'm scared
I'm scared

You can see me like a fucking tv screen
Sunday Monday in and out it's all a dream
Put the love inside your heart inside of me
If you think I'm getting close, you won't believe
You can drown inside my heart like I'm the sea
Cut me up in little parts like all of me

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On

Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
Body to body, beat to beat
cfterparty, you and me 
You and me 
You and me 
cfterparty

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On

On and on and on
On and on and on
On and on and on
On
