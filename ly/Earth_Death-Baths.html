		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My men cannot get out of being pulled into the earth
I've been done here, only time keeps me from the demiurge
My self cannot get out of being pulled into the earth
Well we do next to nothing, we have always been the scourge

Come kill me
I seem so brittle
Come kill me
I see so little
(Every animal)
Come kill me
I seem so brittle
(Every animal)
Come kill me
I see so little

My men cannot get out of being pulled into the earth
I've been done here, only time keeps me from the demiurge
My self cannot get out of being pulled into the earth
Well we do next to nothing, we have always been the scourge

Come kill me
I seem so brittle
Come kill me
I see so little
(Every animal)
Come kill me
I seem so brittle
(Every animal)
Come kill me
I see so little
