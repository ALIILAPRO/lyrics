		<p>
		  Ay (yah)
Ay (ay)
Ay (hey)
Chocolate (uh)
Chocolate (uh)
Chocolate (yah)
Chocolate
Chocolate

Ay, just cashed the check
And I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
Yeah, I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
Sweet tooth, baby, make that dollar stretch
Chocolate
Chocolate
Chocolate
Chocolate

Uh, I feel my sweet tooth acting up
All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up
Honey, paper sack brown, yeah, I'm black enough
Never holler "man down" 'cause we're standing up
Standing rock, she pretty b
Stay litty, lil' nigga, is she shitting me?
Off the Hennessey and Tito's, we go
Hard in the paint like a nigga making free throws

Yum, yum, yum, yum
Yum, yum, yum, yum
Yum, yum, yum, yum (all I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) 
Yum, yum, yum, chocolate (all I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) 
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) chocolate
(Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up) chocolate
Chocolate
(Uh, back it up)

Ay, just cashed the check
And I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
Yeah, I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
Sweet tooth, baby, make that dollar stretch
Chocolate
Chocolate
Chocolate
Chocolate

You ever find yourself stuck in between
A rock and a dark place, leap for a dream
I'm hard and a heartless king without a queen
Got iceberg so it's fuck bitch nah'mean?
We ain't throwing rice, I'm just throwing D
And making music for the people that be feeling me
Off the Hennessey and Tito's, we go
Hard in the paint like a nigga making free throws

(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws)
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws)
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws)
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws)
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws) chocolate, chocolate, chocolate
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws) chocolate, chocolate, chocolate
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws) chocolate, chocolate, chocolate
(Free throws, free throws, free throws, free throws) 

Now take another shot, 'cause it ain't a gift
And ain't no designated driver, we can get a lift
Now go and sip you some mo', sis, while I fire up this 'dro spliff
Blow this joint, get the glowsticks

(Glowsticks, glowsticks, glowsticks) chocolate
(Glowsticks, glowsticks, glowsticks) chocolate
(Glowsticks, glowsticks, glowsticks) chocolate
(Glowsticks, glowsticks, glowsticks)
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(All I need is you to go on 'head, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum
(Back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up) yum, yum, yum, yum

Ay, just cashed the check
(Hard, hard in the paint, hard, hard in the paint, hard)
Yeah, I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
(We go, we go, we go, we go, we go, we go)
(Hard in the paint like, hard in the) chocolate
(Hard in the paint, hard, hard in the) chocolate
(Hard in the paint, hard, hard in the) chocolate
(Yo, we go, we go, we go) chocolate
Ay, just cashed the check
And I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
Yeah, I'm 'bout to blow it all on chocolate
Sweet tooth, baby, make that dollar stretch
Chocolate
