		  What I need?
You what I need
(Damn, Pliz)
I need a freak
Huh, ayy (Mustard on the beat, ho)

I need a freak, freak, freak (yeah)
To rub my hair, hair, hair (rub my hair)
Ayy, I need a freak every day of the week (huh, huh)
With her legs in the air, air, air (with her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak (I want a freak, yeah)
Who just don't care, care, care (who just don't care)
Ayy, I need a freak wit' a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare, all the niggas stare (ayy, ayy)

I need a freak, bounce to the beat, yeah
Freak ho, tell me what to eat, yeah
Freak girl, tell me where to sleep
Swallow on the meat, mm, tell me if it's sweet, yeah
I like a freak, do it in the car leave cum on the seat
Do it in the dark, I don't even wanna see (no, no)
Open up your door, I got a big ass key, yeah
Like a freak though, baby bend your knees (bend your knees)
So nice, make her say please (say please)
Like a lolly, lick it 'til it's clean
She looked at me said, "baby, what you mean?" (what you mean?)

I need a freak, freak, freak (yeah)
To rub my hair, hair, hair (rub my hair)
Ayy, I need a freak every day of the week (huh, huh)
With her legs in the air, air, air (with her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak (I want a freak, yeah)
Who just don't care, care, care (who just don't care)
Ayy, I need a freak wit' a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare, all the niggas stare

Ayy, ayy
Oh you lookin' for a freak? (uh?)

I can do a trick you ain't know make you cum (mwah)
Big ghetto booty, bougie, choosy (ayy, ayy, ayy)
Ain't givin' up the pussy for a dinner and a movie (ah)
I need me a nasty ass nigga that don't care (yeah)
Broke up with my ex cause I had the nigga scared (yeah)
You ain't eatin' what you here for, baby I'm a nympho
Wanna keep a nigga on rock like a Flintstone (ayy, ayy)
Real freaks don't trip, they come and then dip (yeah)
Treat him like party favors, I pass them like chips
Get my nut, then what?
I'm back to bidness (go, go, go)
A good lick, hella tricks, that's all that he is (ah)

I need a freak, freak, freak (yeah)
To rub my hair, hair, hair (rub my hair)
Ayy, I need a freak every day of the week (huh, huh)
With her legs in the air, air, air (with her legs in the air) (ayy, ayy)
I want a freak, freak, freak (I want a freak, yeah) (bitch)
Who just don't care, care, care (who just don't care)
Ayy, I need a freak wit' a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare, all the niggas stare

Ayy, I got a bitch named Ashley, she don't even ask me
Suck a nigga up with Britney it in the backseat (sheesh)
Brand new bitch, paparazzi think she Cassie (huh, huh)
Tell her make it nasty, spit like Daffy (spit)
I ain't Billie Jean but the bitch call me daddy (woo)
Diamonds in my ear got me feelin' like Gatsby (hey)
House full of hoes, you could only imagine (go)
Five in the morning, getting ghost like Casper

I need a freak, freak, freak (yeah)
To rub my hair, hair, hair (rub my hair)
Ayy, I need a freak every day of the week (huh, huh)
With her legs in the air, air, air (with her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak (I want a freak) (bitch)
Who just don't care, care, care (who just don't care)
Ayy, I need a freak wit' a big ass butt
Make all the niggas stare, all the niggas stare

I need a freak, freak, freak (yeah)
To rub my hair, hair, hair (rub my hair)
Ayy, I need a freak every day of the week (huh, huh)
With her legs in the air, air, air (with her legs in the air)
I want a freak, freak, freak (I want a freak) (bitch)
Who just don't care, care, care (who just don't care)
Ayy, I need a freak wit' a big ass butt
