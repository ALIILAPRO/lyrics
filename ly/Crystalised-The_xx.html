		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've applied the pressure
To have me crystallized
And you've got the faith
That I could bring paradise

I'll forgive and forget
Before I'm paralyzed
Do I have to keep up the pace
To keep you satisfied? ha-iah-i

Things have gotten closer to the sun
And I've done things in small doses
So don't think that I'm pushing you away
When you're the one that I've kept closest

Ha-iah-iai
Ha-iah-iai
Ha-iah-iai
Ha-iah-iai

You don't move slow
Taking steps in my direction
The sound resounds, echo
Does it lessen your affection? no

You say I'm foolish
For pushing this aside
But burn down our home
I won't leave alive, ha-iah-iai

Glaciers have melted to the sea
I wish the tide would take me over
I've been down on my knees
And you just keep on getting closer

Ha-iah-iai
Ha-iah-iai
Ha-iah-iai
Ha-iah-iai

Things have gotten closer to the sun (glaciers have melted to the sea)
And I've done things in small doses (I wish the tide would take me over)
So don't think that I'm pushing you away (I've been down onto my knees)
When you're the one that I've kept closest (and you just keep on getting closer)
Go slow
Go slow, whoa
Go slow
Go slow, whoa
Go slow
