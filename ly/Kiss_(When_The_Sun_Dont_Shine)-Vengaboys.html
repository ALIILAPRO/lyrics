		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every Friday 

My head's spinning round and round
Been working all week now baby
Yes, it's my day 

I take a trip downtown
To my favorite club now, baby
That's when I see you 

With loving arms to fall into
But I'm not lookin' for full-time love 

There's still so much I want to do
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine 

Oh whoa, oh whoa
You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine
Oh whoa, oh whoa 

Can live without it
I don't want a full-time love 

'cause it's not on my mind now, baby
You know my freedomIs what I'm thinking of 

And I ain't got the time now, baby
Straight out of the blue 

You came and asked me to
Be your date in the daytime babe 

But I am sorry, no can do
I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine 

Oh whoa, oh whoa
You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine
Oh whoa, oh whoa 

I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine
Oh whoa, oh whoa 

You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine
Oh whoa, oh whoa 

Kiss me when the sun don't shine
Kiss me when the sun don't shine, oh whoa 

(Make some noise for the Vengaboys)
Oh whoa 

I only kiss, kiss, kiss when the sun don't shine
Oh whoa, oh whoa 
You want to kiss, kiss, kiss then tonight is fine
Oh whoa, oh whoa
