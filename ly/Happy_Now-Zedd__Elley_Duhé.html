		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?

You're the only one who can up and run
Leave me just as empty as the day you came
You hold all the cards, all the broken hearts
Strung over your shoulder 'til it's all in vain

And only you know the strength of your teeth
Awash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
And lonely

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

(You're the only one who can)

In the palm of your hands
You can make me dance
Spin me 'round in circles 'til I'm wrapped in string
You keep on talking sweet 'til your fingers bleed
But don't you dare ask me how I've been

Now only you know the strength of your teeth
Awash in the weight of your pockets, so deep
And lonely

You're a world away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

(You're the only one who can)
(You're the only, you're the only)
(You're the only one who can)
(You're the only, you're the only)

World away
Somewhere in the crowd
In a foreign place
Are you happy now?
There's nothing left to say
So I shut my mouth
So won't you tell me, babe
Are you happy now?
