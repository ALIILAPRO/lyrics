		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Contemplation fear, lying on the floor
Staring into nothing, what the hell am I here for?
So come on and play, stab it in my heart
So all this time was wasted, ripping me apart

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

It's starting over, starting over
Can't stand, it's over, God is gonna take me out
My time is over, this time is over
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out
(God is gonna take me out) (God is gonna take me out)
(God is gonna take me out) (God is gonna take me out)

Crawling on the floor all around this space
Talking to myself, what is this thing I gotta face?
Walking through a door, has it been a waste?
Going on and on, thinking I could find my place

We are the hurt inside your head
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

It's starting over, starting over
Can't stand, it's over, God is gonna take me out
My time is over, this time is over
Why is this over? God is gonna take me out
God is gonna take me out
(God is gonna take me out) (God is gonna take me out)
(God is gonna take me out) God is gonna take me out

You can't see
I'm torn away from you and everything that's 
Close to me
I cannot face the truth, it's nothing that

I believe
Just run away from me and thank me when you're
Free from me
Come take me

Come take me
Come take me
Come take me
Come take me

We are the hurt inside your head (come take me)
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said (come take me)
Happiness is boring, need pain instead

We are the hurt inside your head (come take me)
Lost in the void of what is dead
Constantly twisting things I've said (come take me)
Happiness is boring, need pain instead
