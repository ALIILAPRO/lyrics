		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spend the night
Yeah, looking for my inside in a hotel room
Waiting for you
We're gonna make it tonight
Yeah, something in the air tells me that time is right
So we've better get it on

DJ, play a song for the lovers, tonight
Please, play a song for the lovers, tonight

Don't want to wait
Lord, I've been waiting all my life but I'm too late again
I know but I was scared
Can't you see, oh, I'm moving like a train, into some foreign land 
That you got on
A ticket for this ride, but I will

Ooh, this is a song for my lover, tonight
Today, play a song for my lover, tonight

One more for the lovers

Can't stop looking back, no no
