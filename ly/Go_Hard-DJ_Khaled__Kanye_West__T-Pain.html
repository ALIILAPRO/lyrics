		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from 

I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I could

If the they hatin' on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best

(Fuck nigga you can't stop this)
Fuck the best we run this game
Kanye West Khaled and Pain

[Chorus]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in your yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin' it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Kanye West]
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ugh were do I start
First I stand around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad
Won't no body get up on it
I flow so sick
Nigga how sick
Sea sick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as is get
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip
Fly as 57 passenges
This finna' be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it
No I ain't goin' have it

[Chorus]

[Kanye West]
I ain't never been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Goin' head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of men she goin' go down
Maybe I would of slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm Scooby I know I'm dumb
It cud get fuckin' old but it's good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's gon be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing you got to hear
I'm a tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck yall niggas I'm out of here

[Chorus]

[Repeat: x4]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from

I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in

I go hard, for the hood
I go hard, for the streets
I go hard for the ghetto
Kanye West T-Pain DJ Khaled
We the best 
We wont stop
We cant stop
We global!

[Chorus]
