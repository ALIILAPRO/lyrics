		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew a girl when she was 18 
Had c fire burning so bright 
Not sure when she started changing 
Now she only cries she won't tell me why? 

She spends her nights inside a bottle 
She's driving the wrong way going 95
She don't wanna listen to the gospel 
She don't wanna try she just wanna fly  

So tell me what you're running from 
Tell me why you feel so numb 
Who broke your heart tell me who left you scarred 
I can see that someone really hurt you 

So tell me what you're running from 
Tell me why you feel so numb 
Who broke your heart tell me who left you scarred 
I can see that someone really hurt you 

Growing up she was a rebel 
My father told her just be safe
Now she goes  dancing with the devil 
It used to be a phase now it's everyday 

She found hope inside the bible
Then lost her faith now suicidal 
She turned to the wine for her survival 
To Take away the pain she don't hesitate 

So tell me what you're running from 
Tell me why you feel so numb 
Who broke your heart tell me who left you scarred 
I can see that someone really hurt you 

So tell me what you're running from 
Tell me why you feel so numb 
Who broke your heart tell me who left you scarred 
I can see that someone really hurt you
