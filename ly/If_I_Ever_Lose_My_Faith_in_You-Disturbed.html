		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (originally by Sting)

You could say I lost my faith in science and progress
You could say I lost my belief in religion
And you could say I lost my sense of direction
You could say all of this and worse but

If I ever lose my faith in you (In you)
There'd be nothing left for me to do (To do)

Someone say I was a lost man in a lost world
You can say I lost my faith in the people on TV
You can say I'd lost my belief in our politicians
They all seemed like game show hosts to me, but

If I ever lose my faith in you
(If I ever lose my faith)
There'd be nothing left for me to do
(If I ever lose my faith)
Lose my faith in you (In you)

I could be lost inside their lies without a trace (Without a trace)
But every time I close my eyes I see your face (Face)

I never saw no miracle of science
That didn't go from a blessing to a curse (Curse)
I never saw no military solution that didn't end up worse
If I ever lose my faith in you

If I ever lose my faith in you
(If I ever lose my faith in you)
There'd be nothing left for me to do
(There'd be nothing left for me to do)

If I ever lose my faith (Lose my faith)
If I ever lose my faith (Lose my faith)
If I ever lose my faith (Lose my faith)
If I ever lose my faith (Lose my faith)
If I ever lose my faith (Lose my faith)
In you
In you
