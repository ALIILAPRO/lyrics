		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and gentlemen
I know what you want
She's hot as a stove
Her name is Nicole

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do I do whatever you like

What you want?

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do, I do whatever you like

Boy, you want my body, wanna ride it like a Harley
Once or twice around the block
I bet I'll have you saying whoa, whoa!
First stop, let me pop, drop like a helicop
Pay attention on me while I show you the scenario
You charming me boy, yeah boy, you're charming me
Just like this beat is gonna do on the radio
Damn, I thought you knew me, by way you're talking to me
You get any closer to me, then I might just have to let it go

There's something 'bout that cocky thing,
You got me wanna see what's really going on

I do the thing, I do the thing you wanna (Ladies an gentlemen)
I'm gonna do anything you wanna (I know what you want)
I do the thing, I do the thing you wanna (She's hot as a stove)
I'm gonna anything you wanna (Her name is Nicole)

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do, I do whatever you like

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do, I do whatever you like

Yeah
Yeah
Work it out girl

Make a bed, you put the cat in the nap
I'll tell you what side I get, all night lover
See the cheek, wanna see me, make it speak
Watch it while mommy teaching, I won't stutter
I can tell you had never had a touch
Hood up while I show this much, I'll do that for ya
Playing a step, promise I can make it rain
Let me see that sugar, king, you like that, don't you

There's something 'bout that cocky thing,
You got me wanna see what's really going on

I do the thing, I do the thing you wanna (Ladies an gentlemen)
I'm gonna do anything you wanna (I know what you want)
I do the thing, I do the thing you wanna (She's hot as a stove)
I'm gonna anything you wanna (Her name is Nicole)

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do, I do whatever you like

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do, I do whatever you like

See me in the back, chick like that
Get you to run around, but I can hear like that
I said you run around, I'm the shit like that
Eat it, beat it, till it's swollen, you gonna need an icepack
I'll tell her big thang poppin', let me hear you say that
Lay back, play that, purp, Kush, blowing in the Maybach
With my company, three of them and one of me
Imagine what they done to me, on top of me, up under me
Accept no limitation baby, other can't be hatin' they'll be
All in ya face, I mean all in the wussy
I can take you on vacation and we can ballin' the "A"
You hit me up four in the mornin', what you callin' to stay, shorty

Something 'bout that cocky thing
You got me wanna see what's really going on

I do the thing, I do the thing you wanna (Ladies an gentlemen)
I'm gonna do anything you wanna (I know what you want)
I do the thing, I do the thing you wanna (She's hot as a stove)
I'm gonna do anything you wanna (Her name is Nicole)

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, I do, I do whatever you like

I'll do whatever you like
I'll do whatever you like
I can do, I can do, wait a minute motherfucker?

I've been looking all night,
Wanna kiss you one time
Mommy do what you like
Go head pull it pull it pull it pull it?

First you gotta get it right
I can love you long time
I'ma become a big crime
Then I'll pull it pull it pull it pull it?

What she want it uptight
I promise a goodnight
Girl, you're gonna sleep tight
When I pull it pull it pull it pull it

Wanna look at your eyes
When you get the big prize
Gonna give it a kind
When I pull it pull it pull it pull it
