		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doesn't seem to matter what I do
I'm always number two
No one knows how hard I tried, oh
I have feelings I can't explain
Driving me insane
All my life, been so polite
But I'll sleep alone tonight

I'm just Ken
Anywhere else, I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny to live and die
A life of blonde fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see
The man behind the tan and fight for me?

I want to know what's it's like to love
To be the real thing
Is it a crime? Am I not hot when I'm in my feelings?
Is my moment finally here, am I dreaming?
I'm no dreamer

I'm just Ken
Anywhere else, I'd be a ten
Is it my destiny to live and die
A life of blonde fragility?
I'm just Ken
Where I see love, she sees a friend
What will it take for her to see
The man behind the tan and fight for me?

I'm just Ken and I'm enough
And I'm great at doing stuff
So, hey, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken
My name's Ken and so am I
Put that manly hand in mine
Hey world, check me out, yeah, I'm just Ken

Can you feel the Kenergy?
Feels so real, the Kenergy
Can you feel Kenergy?
Feels so real, the Kenergy

Can you feel the Kenergy?
Feels so real, the Kenergy

Merry Christmas, Barbie
Wherever you are
