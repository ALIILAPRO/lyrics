		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so tired, of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other boys to play
Been tempted for too long

Go on, give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to wanna your man
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason if you can

From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over, move over, and give us some room

Go on, give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to wanna be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Reason

Don't you stop looking like some woman
Take a little look from the outside if you can
Saw a little tenderness

Go on, give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to want to be your man
Give me a reason to love you
Oh please, give me a reason if you can

This is the beginning of forever and ever, ever, ever
I'm so tired of playing
Of playing with this bow and this arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Gonna leave ti to the other boys to play
I've been tempted too long
Too long
I've been tempted every day
Tempted too long
Oh please

Give me a reason too love you
Give me a reason to want to love you
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason every day
Reason every day
