		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, yeah)

I fell in love, fell in love (yeah, yeah)
But that's okay, 'cause we in love (yeah)
Oh my God, I fell in love
I fell in love with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay, 'cause I'm in love

We in that bed, give me head
I want that, just to stay
Close your eyes, don't shed no tears (don't shed no tears)
Keep it dark, close the shades (yeah)
I'm off the pills (yeah), you on that lean (yeah)
You fuck me slow, girl, do your thing
Let's take some pictures, let's take some scenes
Playboy magazine
She got her panties down with no tee
She got her titties out, she wanna tease
She tatted up now, I see you see
I know you see, I know you see us
You know I want that bih, I wanna eat, I eat
I wanna lick it up, I wanna fuckin' eat
I want to freeze you up, I want them diamonds blingin'
I want it all on you, I want you all on me
Ooh

I fell in love, fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, fell in love
I fell in love with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in for the love
Just show me love, just show me love

Lil' ma fly, she gotta flock now (flock)
Got a squad now, got a drop now (woo, woo)
She club hop, ayy, jewelry shoppin'
Girl, you shinin' (girl, you bling), girl, you fine and
Yeah, you fine as wine (fine), you a ten like diamonds (dime piece)
I treat you like my last dime
Go broke, no joke
I cut these hoes off, I kill the roll call
I put the doors up, she like to show off
Them bitches sleepy, them bitches dozed off
I put a ring on her, name got a ring to it
On my knees for you, watch me do how he ain't do it
I cannot speak for you, but I know that he ain't fluent
I speak your language, he don't tell you things, do he?
Like, "Girl, you dangerous"
Girl, I ain't seen beauty, not 'til I seen you
Gon' treat you like queen do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me sing to you, let this be the theme music, yeah

I fell in love, fell in love
But that's okay, 'cause we in love
Oh my God, fell in love
I fell in love, with the love
Show me love, I give you love
Fell in love, I fell in love
I want in, for the love
Just show me love, just show me love
I fell in love, I fell in love
And that's okay, 'cause I'm in love
