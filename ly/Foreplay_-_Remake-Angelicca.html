		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I struggle to
It's not only you who needs to bloom
Oh yeah
I'm over here
Holding it together yet you're
Standing there so focused on someone else
Do me on here oh
Skip the foreplay
Strip me bare oh
I'll be good
I'll be so good
Always in mood
You're much older but you like it cruel to
I'm such a
Fool for you
Took my heart but not on purpose
I tried hard not to be jealous
Do me on here oh
Skip the foreplay
Strip me bare oh
I'll be good
I'll be so good
I'll be yours through the weekend
She'll be to but I'm different
I'll be yours through the weekend
She'll be to but I'm different
