		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Aye, ride with me, if ya ride with me
You can slide with me if you feel like
550 on the fire sticky
Come get high with me that's a deal, right?
Ride with me, if ya ride with me
You can slide with me if you feel like
550 on the fire sticky
Come get high with me that's a deal, right?
That's a deal, right? That's a bet, right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)

Aye, coming down like precipitation
I ain't never met a limitation
Hater plottin' my elimination?
Gotta go to Google for the information
I’m a superstar so I gotta shine
Top dollar be the bottom line
Bottom feedin' niggas outta line
Turn your heart rate to a dotted line
Yeah, my zodiac probably dollar sign
Got the energy to win it my nigga
I'm feeling great
Got a date with destiny, focusin' on my fate
I don't give a fuck what you rappin'
You've been a fake
I'm everything that they ain't and can't be
And won't be
Wanna see me fall, I can't go, I won't leave
Comin' from the blocks with
Plainclothes and police
Straight up to the top
With bankrolls and Rollies

Ride with me, if ya ride with me (Ayy)
You can slide with me if you feel like
550 on the fire sticky
Come get high with me that's a deal, right?
Ride with me, if ya ride with me
You can slide with me if you feel like
550 on the fire sticky
Come get high with me that's a deal, right?
That's a deal, right? That's a bet, right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)

Aye, 12 can't really stop shit
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
So I'm still pushin' like a mosh pit
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
Ice drippin' think I'm hot shit
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
In the yellow bucket with the mop stick
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
I been juggin' jams like wholesale
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
"Everything must go" sale
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
Hittin' bitches with the "oh, well"
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
Need a hundred milli on the low scale
(Bet it up, got)
On my worst night, I'm the best nigga
Wouldn't mess with ya, couldn't cap to 'em
Homie spotted me like 700
Brought 1100 right back to 'em
If I can't do it then it ain't real
I just make dollars I don't make deals
I've been going hard in the paint still
Blowing kush clouds till I can't feel like

Ride with me, if ya ride with me (Ayy ayy)
You can slide with me if you feel like
550 on the fire sticky
Come get high with me that's a deal, right?
Ride with me, if ya ride with me
You can slide with me if you feel like
550 on the fire sticky
Come get high with me that's a deal, right?
That's a deal, right? That's a bet, right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a bet, right? (Bet it up, got 5 on it)
That's a deal, right? That's a deal right?
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
(Bet it up, got 5 on it)
