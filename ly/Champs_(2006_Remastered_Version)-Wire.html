		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The taste of champions
The pace, the pace
The speed, the need
The need to seed
The chance to die

Another dead don't cry
Another dead don't cry
You've still got speed
You'll maybe bleed
There's less time

More speed than before
You've done it before
There is no for
What are you doing it for?
Want more, want more

Another dead don't cry
Another dead don't cry
You've still got speed
To feed from seed
Doing it
All the time
Uh-huh
