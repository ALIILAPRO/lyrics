		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brittle bones
Fragile heart
Both were meant to fall apart
Weathered hands
Tiny cheek
I'll hold your secrets safe with me

Take me in
Free your ghosts
No They can't
Haunt us both
Take me in
Don't let go
Waking up
Comatose

Ash and stone
Iron and rust
Tell me what's become of us
Caged beneath
A leaden sky
Where your beating heart is locked inside

Take me in
Free your ghosts
No They can't
Haunt us both
Take me in
Don't let go
Waking up
Comatose
Take me in
Free your ghosts
No They can't
Haunt us both
Take me in
Don't let go
Waking up
Comatose
