		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To my mother, to my father
It's your son or
It's your daughter
Are my screams loud enough for
You to hear me, should I turn this up for you

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

The silence is what kills me
I need someone here to help me
But you don't know
How to listen
And let me make
My decision

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

All your insults and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like I am nothing
But you made me so
Do something

'Cause I'm fucked up
Because you all need attention
Attention you couldn't give

'Cause, I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
