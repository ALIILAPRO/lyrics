		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (Lekaa Beats)

Cruise through life in a new shape
Indictments came, my bitch loves blue tape
Step on your turf with a screw face
Fucking, she want it on Blu-ray
Can't stay two nights, lil mama, I'm choosey
Sipping on drink and I'm woozy
I leave the kitty in good shape
Mercedes Benz and I got it in woodgrain
Moncler hood 'cause it could rain
Go make the runner go Usain
We goin' NYC, Eliantte
Buss down, it's a new plate

Aight, shawty know I'm in a good space
I got the kettle the price what the bujj weigh
Gorilla Bape on my hoodie
She want my tongue on her coochie
I check her in OT, we toking, we jeet late
Same one that live where my heat stay
I'm with my cuz in a Bentayg
I got that Roley doley rose plain
Steam filet mignon, yeah
War with me
I make a yardie wipe your nose, yeah
Homie please be sure, yeah
Ros√©, make a toast, yeah
Benzo look like ghost, yeah
Nigga my cheddar ain't low, nah
I bought my mama a Goyard
I'm sipping Ciri all week
I got my diamonds on gleam
Quarter milli' that's in reach
She gimme uck on a beach
I got a cousin name E
He put the tech in the fleece
She give me all of her hubbida hubbida
She know she ain't the main squeeze (yikes)
Bell on the cellular, Cali' the regular
Vvs in my beak
I made fifty this week, yeah
Hatton, we shopping on me, yeah (yeah)

Cruise through life in a new shape (skrrt)
Indictments came, my bitch loves blue tape
Step on your turf with a screw face
Fucking, she want it on Blu-ray (yeah)
Can't stay two nights, lil mama, I'm choosey
Sipping on drink and I'm woozy
I leave the kitty in good shape
Mercedes Benz and I got it in woodgrain
Moncler hood 'cause it could rain
Go make the runner go Usain
We goin' NYC, Eliantte
Buss down, it's a new plate

Big machine make the room shake (shake, shake)
Woo, doomsday, my demons Tomb Raid
We lit on a Tuesday (alright), Celine maroon cape
Get hit best move mate, split wigs like toupee
Birds, flyin' both ways, she slatt, slime, brozay
Crack pipes, the bando way, scope it first, the mandem wait
Free Schemo, bang them gates (ay), racks, goodness grace
Platinum plaques for goodness sake
Boujee face, the bunda great
Her mobile ends in 08
Speed dial, it's so late (so late)
She hits me back, it's okay
She up, she's horny
Do a fashion show, she showcase
Her knickers are Dolce
Man, I blammed her twice in four days
Alley-oop my brozay

Cruise through life in a new shape
Indictments came, my bitch loves blue tape
Step on your turf with a screw face
Fucking, she want it on Blu-ray
Can't stay two nights, lil mama, I'm choosey
Sipping on drink and I'm woozy
I leave the kitty in good shape
Mercedes Benz and I got it in woodgrain
Moncler hood 'cause it could rain
Go make the runner go Usain
We goin' NYC, Eliantte
Buss down, it's a new plate
