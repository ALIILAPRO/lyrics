		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Awake, I opened my eyes to see
A hospital, so white and clean
I was walking up to the roof, I think
Then can't recall at all a single thing

Held a hand for me, you were there
I know, but couldn't reach
The me that would fall down all the time
But stand and reach my hand to see
"Have you tried crossing over yet?"

Ah wanna die, wanna die
But don't really wanna die
You were there, you would care
Making me aware
Every scar, all the blood
More and more, they're never done
Not enough, not enough

Ah wanna die, wanna die
But don't really wanna die
If I died, you would cry
And I don't know why
Every scar, all the blood
More and more, they're never done
Not enough, not enough

When I forget you
I'm all alone without a place to go
But then played a mirror like a show
The past I used to know
A dream, 'til I see every part of me
Eyes of red following and

I wanna live, wanna live
Deep inside I've always been
Reaching out for a hand, so don't let this be the end
Mushrooms growing on my head
Still remember even then
Where you are when I'm dead

Ah wanna die, wanna die
But don't really wanna die
You were there, you would care
You know it really isn't fair
Every time I forgot
You remain inside my thoughts
Not enough, not enough
Ah wanna die, wanna die
Wanna die, but I still couldn't die
With you by my side
Behind the days I spent alone, afraid
Now you're here to stay

Lalala lalala lalala lalala
And the scars never fade
Memories that replay
Rewind yet again to the pain we felt on that day
