		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just one of those days where you don't want to wake up
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks
You don't really know why but you want to justify
Rippin' someone's head off
No human contact
And if you interact, your life is on contract
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, talking that shit

It's just one of those days, feeling like a freight train
First one to complain leaves with a bloodstain
Damn right, I'm a maniac
You better watch your back 'cause I'm fucking up your program
And if you're stuck up, you just lucked up
Next in line to get fucked up
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker
It's just one of those days

It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, talking that shit punk 
So come and get it

I feel like shit
My suggestion, is to keep your distance
'Cause right now I'm dangerous
But we've all felt like shit
And been treated like shit
All those motherfuckers that want to step up

I hope you know, I pack a chainsaw (chainsaw)
I'll skin your ass raw (ass raw)
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might
Break something tonight
I pack a chainsaw (chainsaw)
I'll skin your ass raw (ass raw)
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might
Break something tonight
I pack a chainsaw (chainsaw)
I'll skin your ass raw (ass raw)
And if my day keeps going this way, I just might
Break your fucking face tonight

Give me something to break
Give me something to break
Just give me something to break
How 'bout your fucking face?

I hope you know, I pack a chainsaw
What?
A chainsaw
What?
A motherfucking chainsaw
What?
So come and get it

It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, let the shit slip
Or you'll be leaving with a fat lip
It's all about the he says, she says bullshit
I think you better quit, talking that shit, punk 
So come and get it
