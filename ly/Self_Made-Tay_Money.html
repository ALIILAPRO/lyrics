		  (Known to let that MAC fly just like my nigga Doe)

I know you see me workin', bitch (I know you see me workin', bitch)
That's my own money, that's my own money (ayy), that's my own money
I ain't never needed no man for no money (duh, uh)
For no money (the fuck, uh), for no money (uh, uh)
When you see me workin', bitch (workin', bitch)
That's my own money (workin', bitch) 
That's my own money, that's my own money
I ain't never needed no man for no money (uh-uh)
For no money (uh-uh), for no money (uh-uh)

Ayy, I see you workin', bitch, what you twerkin' with?
TayTay get money, put in that Birkin, bitch
Ho, you can have him back 'cause I know you listenin'
Yeah, I'm a real ass bitch, I know that you ain't used to them
So first of all we gon' start with how these bitches broke
And she said she want the smoke, but we all know she don't
I ain't trippin' on no man, I ain't trippin' on no ho
Girl, your man asked for my number, be glad that I told him no
I ain't trippin' 'bout no bitch, step on you and still at toes
Ayy, gettin' money, duh, that's the only thing I know

Turn up on they goofy ass, throw back in my Coogi bag
I'm like, "Where your hooptie at?"
You can come and scoop me then

I know you see me workin', bitch
That's my own money, that's my own money (go off girl) 
That's my own money
I ain't never needed no man for no money (no money)
For no money (for no money, uh), for no money (ayy, uh)
I know you see me workin', bitch (ayy)
That's my own money (my own money) 
That's my own money (I'ma make it), that's my own money
I ain't never needed no man for no money (money)
For no money (ha, uh-uh), for no money (duh, uh-uh)

Okay, shake that ass, move it like you tipsy
Ice cold in this bitch, every time my neck bling
Pulled up to the ATM, you know I left it empty
Say he wanna spoil me, okay, take me to Tiffany
Ayy, I like diamonds, I like pretty, I like rubies
Ayy, bend it over, girl, bitch, I want to see your booty
Ayy, do what you gon' do with me, he said what I say to you
I say you can't handle this, even if I paid you to 
(Ow, ooh, she got on your ass, oh no, for real, all off the dome, drops mic, ha)

Turn up on they goofy ass, throw back in my Coogi bag
I'm like, "Where your hooptie at?"
You can come and scoop me then

I know you see me workin', bitch (I know you see me)
That's my own money, that's my own money (go off, girl) 
That's my own money
I ain't never needed no man for no money (no money)
For no money (for no money, uh), for no money (ayy, uh)
I know you see me workin', bitch (ayy)
That's my own money (my own money)
That's my own money (I'ma make it)
That's my own money
I ain't never needed no man for no money (money)
For no money (ha, uh-uh), for no money (duh, uh-uh)

Uh-uh, uh-uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh
