		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who do you carry that torch for, my young man? 
Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things down?

Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling
'Cause we believe in everything
If we sweat all these debts then we're sure to drown
So let's strap ourselves up to this engine now
With our God who we found laying under the back seat

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing.
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You are freezing over hell
You are bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Oh, order your daughters to ignore me think that will sort me?
And sweep me under the rug
While you're beating with a book everyone that book tells you to love

There is an ember in the heart of the kiln
And it's burning hot with love
Burning out my center till there's nothing but dust
Rolling me with care into your cigarette
Cause the God I believe in never worked on a campaign trail

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You are freezing over hell
You are bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Who do you carry that torch for, my young man? 
Do you believe in anything?
Do you carry it around just to burn things to the ground?

What did you learn tonight?
You're shouting so loud, you barely joyous, broken thing
You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
You are freezing over hell
You are bringing on the end, you do so well
You can only blame yourself, it's what I say

Feels like we could escape 
And I don't mind throwing away this filthy silver song
If you try running a maze of your lies
It's too hard to save if you've thrown out everyone
 Send "The Archer's Bows Have Broken
