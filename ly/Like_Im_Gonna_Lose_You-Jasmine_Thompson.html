		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie
That every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight
When you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared
And I was all alone
I woke up in tears
With you by my side
A breath of relief
And I realized
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you

In the blink of an eye
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is, you never know
So I'll kiss you longer, baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
And love with no regret
Let's take our time to say what we want
Use what we got before it's all gone
No, we're not promised tomorrow

So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna love you
Like we're saying goodbye
So I'm gonna love you
Like I'm gonna lose you
I'm gonna hold you
Like I'm saying goodbye
Wherever we're standing
I won't take you for granted
Cause we'll never know when
When we'll run out of time
So I'm gonna love you
