		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She knows how to twist a knife
She knows how to start a fight
She's knows how to fuck you right
She's the kind of girl you like 
Why you calling me tonight
I'm not like Alice

She gets up inside your head
Always ends up in your bed
Fingertips are full of lead 
Had enough your almost dead
Now your calling me instead
I'm not like Alice

I mean no malice
I'm not like Alice

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I'm not like Alice

I miss how you touched my skin
'Fore I knew where else you'd been
Felt your promise growin' thin
Had to leave before you did
Want forgiveness for your sins
I'm not like Alice

She knows how to twist a knife
She knows how to start a fight
She's knows how to fuck you right
She's the kind of girl you like 
Why you calling me tonight
I'm not like Alice

I mean no malice
I'm not like Alice

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I'm not like Alice

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
I'm not like Alice
