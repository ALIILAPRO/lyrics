		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For everything you do, I'd like to swallow you
And everyday I'm gonna blame you
Even if you justify every fucking bullshit lie, it only makes me want to break you

You pull me down and you crucify my name, you make me insane
It's broken now, don't ever look my way, don't even think I'm playing
Cause
I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me

When you repeatedly take advantage of me
The only thought I get of you sickens me
Everybody knows you're fake
You're everything I fucking hate
And I'm everything that you could never be

You pull me down and you crucify my name, you make me insane
It's broken now, don't ever look my way, don't even think I'm playing
'Cause I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me

I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you

You pull me down and you crucify my name, you make me insane
It's broken now, don't ever look my way, don't even think I'm playing
Cause
I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me

I fuckin' hate you
You're such a liar
I'd love to hang you
You're all the same to me
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
