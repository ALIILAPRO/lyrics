		  Yeah, boy, yuh yuh
I know that bitch want me (Lil Purpp)
Lil Purpp hurt
Turn the fuck up, nigga
Yuh, I know that bitch want me, nigga (fuck Donald Drumpf, nigga)
That bitch don't want you, nigga (yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy)
Lean, lean, double cup
Lil' bih come and hold these nuts
Hi-Tech, I got bloody cup
Fucked your bitch, now she a dub
K, okay, yuh, yuh
Lean, lean, double cup

I don't want friends, I want Audis (what?)
Smokin' on boof and it's Maui (ayy)
I'll check that bitch like I'm Maury (ayy)
Sorry, bitch, I don't say sorry
Look at my cup, it got dope (dope)
I bend her over like slope (slope)
Bitch's ass cleaner than soap (ayy)
Dick in her mouth, then she choke
Couple of bands in my mouth (ayy)
Couple of bands in the south (ayy)
I paid the bands in the west
Then take the bands to the south
Look at my wad, it's a 50 (ayy)
Went to New York for like 50 (ayy)
I think this bitch wanna kiss me
I let her top me, no kiss it (no kiss)
Whippin', Jeff Hardy in the kitchen
Countin' and wrap up the chicken
Fuck on these bitches on their menstruals (bitches)
Diamonds, they wet, they go fishin' (fishin')
Whippin', Jeff Hardy in the kitchen (what?)
Count it then wrap up that chicken
Fuck on these bitches, not their menstruals (huh?)
Diamonds, they wet like go fishin' (huh?)

I don't want friends, I want Audis (Audis)
I don't want cars, I want 'Raris (huh?)
I don't want friends, I want Audis (huh?)
I don't want cars, I want Audis (huh?)
I don't want friends, I want Audis (Audis)
I don't want friends, I want Audis (Audis)
I think his bitch lookin' salty (uh)
I just pulled up in a 'Rari

I don't want hoes, I want check
I put like ten on my neck (yuh)
I think his bitch wanna sex
Bitch ain't no sex, I want neck (neck)
Lay that bitch straight on the bed
Dick in her throat through her head (ooh)
I want a lot of blue hundreds (hundreds)
I'm tryna blow 'fore the summer (ayy)
I need a bitch like Rihanna (what?)
I need a bitch with some commas (yuh)
Ayy, yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna (yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy)
I wanna, I wanna

I don't want friends, I want Audis (Audis)
I don't want cars, I want 'Raris (huh?)
I don't want friends, I want Audis (huh?)
I don't want cars, I want Audis (huh?)
I don't want friends, I want Audis (Audis)
I don't want friends, I want Audis (huh?)
I think his bitch lookin' salty (huh?)
I just pulled up in a 'Rari (skrrt)
