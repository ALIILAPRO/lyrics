		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you need to cry
I'll be there for you whenever
You know we tried
But nothing that's good lasts forever

Something I loved
Something I loved
Is gone

With the clouds rolling in
It's felt like the end all along
So put us to rest
I just want you to know

If you need to cry
I'll be there for you whenever
You know we tried
But nothing that's good lasts forever

Oh, oh, oh
I've dreamt this before
We've run out of time
Our funeral

It's time to let go, go, go, go, oh
It's time to let go, go, go, go, oh

Oh, oh, oh
I've dreamt this before
We've run out of time
Our funeral
Funeral
Oh, oh, oh
