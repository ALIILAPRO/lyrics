		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's criminal
There ought to be a law
Criminal
There ought to be a whole lot more
You get nothin' for nothin'
Tell me who can you trust
We got what you want
And you got the lust
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the streets
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
Yes you have

It's animal
Livin' in the human zoo
Animal
The shit that they toss to you
Feelin' like a christian
Locked in a cage
Thrown to the lions
On the second page
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
Blood on the street
Blood on the rocks
Blood in the gutter
Every last drop
You want blood
You got it
O positive

Blood on the rocks
Blood on the streets
Blood in the sky
Blood on the sheets
If you want blood
You got it

I want you to bleed for me

If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
If you want blood, you got it
