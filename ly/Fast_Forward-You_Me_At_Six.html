		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just got the mirror on the way out
Don't recognize myself anymore now
Been running in circles and I can't get out
The less I know the better it rings loud

Just when you wanna fast forward
You know it's gonna hurt some more
When you feel the fire is gone
I'll pour some gasoline on

I, I, I'll pour some gasoline on
I, I, I'll pour some gasoline on
And I might be down but I'm not fucking out
'Cause I need more hours to turn this one around

I scratched the surface yesterday
I know how this one will play out
Let me start you before you start
You played yours, I played my part
Both cut from the same cloth

Just when you wanna fast forward
You know it's gonna hurt some more
When you feel the fire is gone
I'll pour some gasoline on

I, I, I'll pour some gasoline on
I, I, I'll pour some gasoline on
And I might be down but I'm not fucking out
'Cause I need more hours to turn this one around
I, I
I, I

I know you miss the old days, the old days are gone
Everything you've got isn't what you want
I know you miss the old days, the old days are gone
Everything you've got isn't what you want

When you wanna fast forward
You know it's gonna hurt some more
When you feel the fire is gone
I'll pour some gasoline on

I, I, I'll pour some gasoline on
I, I, I'll pour some gasoline on
And I might be down but I'm not fucking out
'Cause I need more hours to turn this one around
I, I, 
I, I
