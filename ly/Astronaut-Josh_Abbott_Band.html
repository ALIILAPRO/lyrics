		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I wish I was an astronaut
Instead of workin' this bullshit concrete job
I'd be pickin' you up, baby, blastin' off
Sometimes I wish I was an astronaut

Sick of sweatin' in the summer heat
Just to buy cheap beer and gasoline
Rattlesnake rowdy, cottonmouth mean
I'm sick and tired of sweatin' in the summer heat

With a Copenhagen habit and a GED
Copenhagen habit and a GED

Gonna buy a ticket to the Powerball
I'll probably take a lump sum when I win it all
I'll be rolling wheels-up with a flatland drawl
Gonna buy a ticket to the Powerball

Sick of sweatin' in the summer heat
Just to buy cheap beer and gasoline
Rattlesnake rowdy, cottonmouth mean
I'm sick and tired of sweatin' in the summer heat

With a Copenhagen habit and a GED
A Copenhagen habit and a GED

Now if I had a pretty little girl like you
I'd be headed to the shop to get a new tattoo
And I wouldn't be singin' these concrete blues
If I had a pretty little girl like you

Sick of sweatin' in the summer heat
Just to buy cheap beer and gasoline
Rattlesnake rowdy, cottonmouth mean
I'm sick and tired of sweatin' in the summer heat

With a Copenhagen habit and a GED
Copenhagen habit and a GED
Copenhagen habit and a GED
Copenhagen habit and a GED
