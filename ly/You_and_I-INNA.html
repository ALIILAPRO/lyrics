		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was so lonely babe till you got me caught up
And I know that now I'll never be alone
And I know that you will give me every single thing you've got
It's our love, and I'll never do you wrong

You and I were just like fishes in the water
And I love that where you are is where I am
And I like to be your sun and light the fire
I know that you love me, and I love you endlessly

Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry, I'm ok, I'm ok

Now when you hold me I can never get enough
Feels so right to know I'll never be alone
Baby, I would give you everything, my love will never stop
When you love me drives me crazy, turns me on

You and I were just like fishes in the water
And I love that where you are is where I am
And I like to be your sun and light the fire
I know that you love me, and I love you endlessly

Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry, I'm ok, I'm ok

Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry
Now don't you worry, I'm ok, I'm ok

Now don't you worry, I'm ok, I'm ok
