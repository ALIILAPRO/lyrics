		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey little apple blossom 
What seems to be the problem 
All the ones you tell your troubles to 
They don't really care for you 

Come and tell me what you're thinking 
'Cause just when the boat is sinking 
A little light is blinking 
And I will come and rescue you 

Lots of girls walk around in tears 
But that's not for you 
You've been looking all around for years 
For someone to tell your troubles to 

Come and sit with me and talk awhile 
Let me see your pretty little smile 
Put your troubles in a little pile 
And I will sort them out for you 

Lots of girls walk around in tears 
But that's not for you 
You've been looking all around for years 
For someone to tell your troubles to 

Come and sit with me and talk awhile 
Let me see your pretty little smile 
Put your troubles in a little pile 
And I will sort them out for you 

I'll fall in love with you 
I think I'll marry you
