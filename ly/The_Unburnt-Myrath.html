		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little priceless princess
With a heart of gold
Living roughly in exile
Throne in mind

Your freedom banner
In the hot sandy winds blow
Your silver hair flying
Mother of dragons

For your rights you will be fighting
Your free people you're guiding
You're proud to be the one you wanna be

Ride
Always, out of sight
Ride
Your dragons by your side
Khaleesi, you're holding on
Breaker of chains, you will fight
That's your goal to rise as the sun

You're much more than a goddess
Born in a storm
Neither slave or black knight
For your fights

Power your fire
Flowing in your veins your bones
A hot blast of wind
Begins to blow

For your rights you will be fighting
Your free people you're guiding
You're proud to be the one you wanna be

Ride
Always, out of sight
Ride
Your dragons by your side
Khaleesi, you're holding on
Breaker of chains, you will fight
That's your goal to rise as the sun

For your rights you will be fighting
Your free people you're guiding
You're proud to be the one you wanna be

Ride
Always, out of sight
Ride
Your dragons by your side
Khaleesi, you're holding on
Breaker of chains, you will fight
That's your goal to rise as the sun
