		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

Tied to a wheel fingers got to feel
Bleeding through a tourniquet smile
I spin on a whim, I slide to the right
I felt you like electric light

For our love, for our fear
For our rise against the years and years and years

Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red machine head
Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in

Deaf dumb, dirty
Starting to deserve this
Leaning on my conscience wall
Blood is like wine
Unconscious all the time
If I had it all again
I'd change it all

Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red machine head
Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine

Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out
Breathe in, breathe in, breathe in

Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red machine head
Got a machine head, it's better than the rest
Green to red

Better than the rest, better than the rest
Machine head

I walk from my machine
I walk from my machine
