		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This whole world is fake, it's as real as you make it
I'm a star like David
Where'd you keep the bonsam? Don't misplace it
Let me bless it, let me grace it
I ain't seen it in so long, I was feeling kinda jaded
Way too long I've been naked, way too long, I just waited
I want him bodied, wasted
Ain't got no fear, I already faced it, embraced it
Sleep in the graveyard and speak to the dead

Put teeth in his head
Bare blood like when my ex was on her reds, period
Everyday I'm serious, I'm a star like Sirius
They know I'm a alien, I feel like erasing them
I'm the father, I'm raising them
We grew up from boys to men, but I'm playing with toys again
A whole different machine, it's a washing machine
Wash them clean, how you mean? Take his pride, self esteem
From a juvenile teen I just wanted cream, cheese
Make them all scream, "Please", made his whole team freeze
We do it with ease
Now you resemble the breeze, you're a spirit
Make the whip turn, pivot
I know them man, they're chicken
We can never be the same, I know you see the difference
I keep it close by, walking distance

This whole world is fake, it's as real as you make it
I'm a star like David
Where'd you keep the bonsam? Don't misplace it
Let me bless it, let me grace it
I ain't seen it in so long, I was feeling kinda jaded
Way too long I've been naked, way too long, I just waited
I want him bodied, wasted
Ain't got no fear, I already faced it, embraced it
Sleep in the graveyard and speak to the dead

Yo, look
I came to war, you came to talk
Smokey settings, I'll smoke his bredrin, just like I did it before
I've done some horrid things, horrible things, with no remorse
Crash that corn or swing my sword
In hell tryna find the Lord
They keep on running, one day gon' run out of luck
Push my blade so deep, twist, turn, he can't breathe
Now feds wanna ask us questions, I need repentance
My hearts red, blue, green, like my members
Double tap it, we so savage, all my drillers, so erratic
If I grab him then he'll vanish
You won't find his body, I do this for a hobby
Just don't let my mum know, I've hugged her with gun smoke
Amiri on my tee, but when I ride I'm in Umbro
God knows that I've done loads
I'm really with the shits, if you slip, then you're pissed
I'm an opp, fuck the opps, tryna put them in a spliff
And you ain't safe with your missus or your kids
Bo-boosh

This whole world is fake, it's as real as you make it
I'm a star like David
Where'd you keep the bonsam? Don't misplace it
Let me bless it, let me grace it
I ain't seen it in so long, I was feeling kinda jaded
Way too long I've been naked, way too long, I just waited
I want him bodied, wasted
Ain't got no fear, I already faced it, embraced it
Sleep in the graveyard and speak to the dead
