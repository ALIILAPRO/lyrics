		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Racks on racks, money ginja me
Opps, they talk, say na frequency
Had to laugh way they humor me
Runnin' it up with the urgency
Streets dey over ginja me
From the wall to the window seat
In the sun, through the storm, in the winter
I'm in the club, shawty moving like a ninja, ninja

Fresh to death, I'm beyond heat
Activist in my Dior jeans
Buss a jigg, feed you Molly
Feed my love like crack to this fiend

I can't be your lover
Too many things to lose
You love me with no honor
Don't wanna leave, I don't
I knew that you were trouble
Wasted eyes on you
I can't be your lover
Too many things to lose

Demon with the Dior on the dresser
Pop a Molly tessie in a Tesla
Let it warm your back and your neck (uh, uh, uh)
I'ma film it all, make a best-of
Edit it all, make it scene on scene
Under it all, know you scheme on me
Hottie million with a milli' on me
I wanna menage with the blicky on me

Turn the bass up
Tell me what you want, want
She want more to taste, uh
I can get it all, all
Pretty little bitch, give me pretty, give me nana
Take me to Nirvana, diamond in the sky-y

I can't be your lover
Too many things to lose
You love me with no honor
Don't wanna leave, I don't
I knew that you were trouble
Wasted eyes on you
I can't be your lover
Too many things to lose
