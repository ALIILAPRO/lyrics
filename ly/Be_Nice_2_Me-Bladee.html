		  Drain Gang forever
"So guess what!"
"What? I don't know..."
Take a knife and drain your life, hahaha

If it's a depot, gotta bite it
If I see weed I gotta light it
If I get feelings, gotta hide it
If it's illegal I don't mind it
I broke my wrist, I gotta ice it
I wanna see you be my sidekick
If I post pics, you gotta like it
If you do this then you're the nicest

To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
To be honest, if it's wrong, I don't want to be right
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice
Talk to me nice, talk to me nice
I don't wanna talk if you're not gonna talk to me nice

Two strike is nothing, I three strike it
Can't name the feeling, man, that I get
All this shit, I'm goin' through a crisis
If you do this for me, you're the nicest
You're the nicest, my sleeve pull surprises
How many times I prayed? I pray three, I'm not anxious
Gotta play the game, and it's free, but not painless
I slide D&G, Silver Link, fuck a razor
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh (Be nice to me)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh (Be nice to me)
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh (Be nice to me)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh (Be nice to me)

Drain Gang!
