		  (Yo, Luca, where you at?)

I'ma shoot the Glock, ah, yeah
Yeah, I'ma just park that body, body
Holy fuck, ridin' round in that Urus
You look broke as fuck, broke as fuck
I tote twenty-fifth, bitch, we stroll with Glocks

I just popped that boy, popped that bird, yeah
I just pulled up in that fuckin' Urus, in that Urus trip
I been living life like way too fast, I had to perish up
Yeah, Rollie fuck, in the Bentley truck
Uh, ridin' 'round with bullets, I got plenty bucks (come)
Yeah, come back to this crib and I got plenty guns
Uh, yeah, come back to this crib, security kill you once, bitch
You can come back every day, we will gon' kill you for months
I got mob ties out the country, I got mob ties in it
I just pulled up in that Bentley and it got frog eyes in it, ha
You can cut that lil' shit up, we been up fifty minutes
I ain't talking 'bout no kitchen, kill 'em, sixty minutes
You ain't fuckin' with the boss, yeah, you get diminished
You ain't fuckin' with the cost, you been penny pinchin'

Birkin bag, holdin' weight
We some Gods, holy ones
Hold your field, hold your guts
Neon guts, triple guts (skrrt)
Flip it up, double dutch
Take that back, fifty cups
Yeah, shoot his bitch-ass up
Yeah, hit that fitted up
Uh, I just been takin' like smacks, I been smoked that-, bitch
All they shit is trash, they been smoked up
Every time I drop an album, I'ma one eye
I can't do no more or less, 'cause I'm the one now
Yeah, always lookin' behind my back like I got one eye
Bitch, I'm paranoid as fuck, like, bitch, why wouldn't I be? (Why wouldn't I be?)
Yeah, I ain't gotta explain to no one, bitch, I pull up and smack (blick 'em)
I couldn't even trust nobody, yeah, I don't trust no one
Pull up, we'll get you wacked, had to get you gone
Pull up in crunch wrap, you better hurt some
I can't trust not shit, not shit, not shit, not shit
Yeah, you better buy that Urus with the custom seats (that makes sense)

I'ma shoot the Glock, ah, yeah
Yeah, I'ma just park that body, body
Holy fuck, ridin' round in that Urus
You look broke as fuck, broke as fuck
I tote twenty-fifth, bitch, we stroll with Glocks

I just popped that boy, popped that bird, yeah
I just pulled up in that fuckin' Urus, in that Urus trip
I been living life like way too fast, I had to perish up
Yeah, Rollie fuck, in the Bentley truck
Uh, ridin' 'round with bullets, I got plenty bucks (come)
Yeah, come back to this crib and I got plenty guns
Uh, yeah, come back to this crib, security kill you once, bitch
You can come back every day, we will gon' kill you for months
I got mob ties out the country, I got mob ties in it
I just pulled up in that Bentley and it got frog eyes in it, ha
You can cut that lil' shit up, we been up fifty minutes
I ain't talking 'bout no kitchen, kill 'em, sixty minutes
You ain't fuckin' with the boss, yeah, you get diminished
You ain't fuckin' with the cost, you been penny pinchin' (you broke as-)
