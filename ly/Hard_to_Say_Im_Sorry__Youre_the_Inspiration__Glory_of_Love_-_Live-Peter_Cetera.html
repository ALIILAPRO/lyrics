		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Everybody needs a little time away," I heard her say, "from each other"
"Even lover's need a holiday far away from each other."
Hold me now. It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to stay

After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

Couldn't stand to be kept away just for the day from your body
Wouldn't wanna be swept away, far away from the one that I love
Hold me now. It's hard for me to say I'm sorry. I just want you to know
Hold me now. I really want to tell you I'm sorry. I could never let you go

After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to
And after all that's been said and done
You're just the part of me I can't let go

After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you. I promise to

You're gonna be the lucky one

You know our love was meant to be
The kind of love that lasts forever
And I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
You're always on my mind, in my heart
In my soul

[Chorus:]
You're the meaning in my life
You're the inspiration
You bring felling to my life
You're the inspiration

Wanna have you near me
I wanna have you hear me sayin'
No one needs you more that I need you
And i know, yes I know that it's plain to see
We're so in love when we're together
And i know that I need you here with me
From tonight until the end of time
You should know, everywhere I go
Always on my mind, in my heart in my soul

[Chorus:]

Tonight it's very clear
As we're both lying here
There's so many things I want to say
I will always love you
I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

You'll keep me standing tall
You'll help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

Just like a knight in shining armor
From a long time ago
Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We're gonna live forever
Knowing together that we
Did it all for the glory of love

We'll live forever (we'll live forever)
Knowing together that we (knowing together)
Did it all for the glory of love

We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
We did it all for love
