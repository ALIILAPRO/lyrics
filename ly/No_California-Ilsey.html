		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We used to drive to the ocean
Lie by the waves
Bathe in the moment
Now I'm alone, I pray for rain to come
Take me away, hmm

Away from the hills full of promise
Streets full of pain
Even in winter
Bright sunny days, I pray for rain to come
Oh, but it never does

Gotta get outta here, start a whole new life
Gotta go somewhere where the sun don't shine so bright
Everything around here
Everything 'bout this place just brings me down, ooh
'Cause there ain't no California without you
Without you
Yeah, there ain't no California
Yeah, there ain't no California without you
Without you
Yeah, there ain't no California
Ooh

It's cold in your shadow
All that remains, ghosts in the desert
Should I run away or pray for strength to come?
I'll run away, hmm

Gotta get outta here, start a whole new life
Gotta go somewhere where the sun don't shine so bright
Everything around here
Everything 'bout this place just brings me down, ooh
'Cause there ain't no California without you
Without you
Yeah, there ain't no California
Yeah, there ain't no California without you
Without you
Yeah, there ain't no California
Ooh

I'll keep runnin', baby
I'll keep runnin'
'Til you stop runnin' through my mind
I'll keep lovin' you
I'll keep lovin' you
I don't really know why
I know that I

Gotta get outta here, start a whole new life
Gotta go somewhere where the sun don't shine so bright
Everything around here
Everything 'bout this place just brings me down, ooh
'Cause there ain't no California without you
Without you
Yeah, there ain't no California
Yeah, there ain't no California without you
Without you
Yeah, there ain't no California
Ooh

I'll keep runnin', baby
I'll keep runnin'
'Til you stop runnin' through my mind
