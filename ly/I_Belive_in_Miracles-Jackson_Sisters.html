		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I die
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go
Every little hurt does
Every little hurt does
To you I am a toy
And you're the girl
Who has the say
Why I should play 
Yeah you hurt me
Desert me I just can't take
The loneliness you give me
I just can't go
Another night this way
Come back to me
Darlin' you'll see
I can give you all the things
You wanted me for
If you will stay with me
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every night I cry
Every night I die
Every night I wonder why
You treat me cold
Yet you won't let me go
Come back to me
Darlin' you'll see
I can give you all the things
That you wanted me for
If you will stay with me
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
Every little bit hurts
