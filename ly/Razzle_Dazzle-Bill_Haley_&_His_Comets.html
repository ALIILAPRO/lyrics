		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On your mark (on your mark)
Get set (get set)
Now ready (ready)
Go

Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
If it's all night long

Now here's a dance (a-wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)
Everyone can do (a-wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)
It's the hipster's dance (a-wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)
And the square cats too (a-wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)
Won't you take a chance (a-wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)
This is all you do (a-wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)

You just take your baby
Don't you leave that spot
Then you dance like crazy
Give it all you've got
That's the razzle dazzle
If you're ready or not

On your mark (on your mark)
Get set (get set)
Now ready (ready)
Go

Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
If it's all night long

Let's get together (get together)
One, two and three (one, two and three)
Jumpin' to the center (to the center)
Just you and me (just you and me)
Put your best foot forward (wack-a doo, wack-a-doo)
Baby can't you see (baby can't you see)

When you hear them holler
And you ain't nowhere
Honey, you just foller
'Cause we're sure not square
That's the razzle dazzle
Well, it's everywhere

On your mark (on your mark)
Get set (get set)
Now ready (ready)
Go

Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
If it's all night long

Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
Everybody razzle dazzle
A-going on and on

If it's all night long
That's the razzle dazzle
Razzle dazzle song
