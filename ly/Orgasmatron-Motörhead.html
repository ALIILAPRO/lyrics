		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh!

I am the one, Orgasmatron
The outstretched grasping hand
My image is of agony
My servants rape the land
Obsequious and arrogant
Clandestine and vain
Two thousands years of misery
Of torture in my name
Hypocrisy made paramount
Paranoia the law
My name is called religion
Sadistic, sacred whore

I twist the truth, I rule the world
My crown is called deceit
I am the emperor of lies
You grovel at my feet 
I rob you and I slaughter you
Your downfall is my gain
And still you play the sycophant
And revel in your pain 
And all my promises are lies
All my love is hate
I am the politician
And I decide your fate

I march before a martyred world
An army for the fight
I speak of great heroic days
Of victory and might
I hold a banner drenched in blood
I urge you to be brave
I lead you to your destiny
I lead you to your grave
Your bones will build my palaces
Your eyes will stud my crown
For I am Mars, the God of War
And I will cut you down
