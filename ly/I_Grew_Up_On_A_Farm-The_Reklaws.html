		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It ain't 'cause of my truck
It ain't 'cause of some George Strait song
Yeah, these blue jeans might be ripped
But that ain't how I bought 'em

It ain't 'cause of these boots
I'm sticking out like a damn sore thumb
Anytime I'm anywhere but where I'm from

Why can't city lights just feel like home?
I'll tell you if you really want to know

Why I gotta watch the sunrise
Job ain't ever done till it's done right
I'll tell you what makes me cry about a steel guitar
And why I gotta work so hard
Why I'm always saying Amen
Just a beer away from a best friend
Why I gotta toss a line when I see a lake
And why I'm always praying for rain
Yeah, ask me why you are the way you are
I grew up on a farm

It's a bit of my grandpa
It's a buzz on a Friday night
And it might be a bit of a drive
But just come on down and you'll see why

Why I gotta watch the sunrise
Job ain't ever done till it's done right
I'll tell you what makes me cry about a steel guitar
And why I gotta work so hard
Why I'm always saying Amen
Just a beer away from a best friend
Why I gotta toss a line when I see a lake
And why I'm always praying for rain
Yeah, ask me why you are the way you are
I grew up on a farm

Oh, it's in my blood, it's in my bones
Oh, and it's all I've ever known

I gotta watch the sunrise
A job ain't ever done till it's done right
And I got acres of reasons why
It's who I'll be till the day I die
I'll still be saying Amen
Just a beer away from a best friend
Why I gotta toss a line when I see a lake
And why I'm always praying for rain
Yeah, ask me why you are the way you are
And why I'm always thanking all my lucky stars
I grew up on a farm
