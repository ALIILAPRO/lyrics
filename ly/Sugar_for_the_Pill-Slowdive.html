		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a buzzard of gulls
They're drumming in the wind
Only lovers alive
Running in the dark

And I rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love has never known the way
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Cannot buy the sun
This jealousy will break the whole

Cut across the sky
And move a little closer now
Lying in a bed of greed
You know I had the strangest dream

And I rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love has never known the way
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Cannot buy the sun
This jealousy will break the whole

And I rolled away
Said we never wanted much
Just a rollercoast'
Our love has never known the way
Sugar for the pill
You know it's just the way things are
Cannot buy the sun
This jealousy will break the whole
