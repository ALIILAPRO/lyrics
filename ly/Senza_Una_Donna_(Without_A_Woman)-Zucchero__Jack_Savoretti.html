		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I change the world, I wanna change the world

This ain't the way I spend my mornings, baby
(Come stai?)
You've been with him and you come back, my lady
What's he like?
I just sit and watch the ocean
By myself, even do my own cookin'
You can laugh and you're forgiven but
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman, oh love
Better like this

There is no way that you can buy me, baby
Don't make fun
You got to dig a little deeper, lady
(In the heart), yeah, if you have one
Here's my heart, feel the power 
Look at me, look at me (I'm a flower)
You can laugh and you're forgiven but
I'm no longer frightened to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss, yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

I stay here and watch the ocean 
Don't know why (don't know why)
I keep on talkin' (I keep on talkin')
You may laugh, you're forgiven but
I'm no longer frightened (maybe), to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
You know I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman
Vieni qui (come on in)

Senza una donna
I don't know what might follow (ooh)
Senza una donna, oh
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss, yeah (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
