		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard from a couple friends
That you're back with your ex again
But I know there's no way
After everything you said 'bout him

Maybe you were lying
Maybe you were trying to cover it up
To forget about love
Now you're going backwards
Please don't call me after
You finally wake up
Took for granted my love

So go ahead and run, run, run
Back to who you were running from
Just make sure you
Don't run back to me when you're done
Got a handful of sleeping pills
A phone full of no one real
This is all too much to deal, ah
Run, run, run
Back to who you were running from
(Running from you)

It was like something switched
We were fine, then overnight you flipped
Your family and all your friends
On my side, they said they were in
I was in (I was in)

Maybe they were lying
Maybe they were trying to cover it up
To forget about love
Now you're going backwards
Please don't call me after
You finally wake up
Took for granted my love

So go ahead and run, run, run
Back to who you were running from
Just make sure you
Don't run back to me when you're done
Got a handful of sleeping pills
A phone full of no one real
This is all too much to deal, ah
Run, run, run
Back to who you were running from
(Running from)

You can't keep running and running
Every time a little something stresses you out
'Cause you'll be running forever
Maybe it's all for the better, I figured you out
You can't keep running and running
Every time a little something stresses you out
'Cause you'll be running forever
Maybe it's all for the better, I figured you out

So go ahead and run, run, run
Back to who you were running from
Just make sure you
Don't run back to me when you're done, ah
Got a handful of sleeping pills
A phone full of no one real
This is all too much to deal, ah
Run, run, run
Back to who you were running from
(Running from, running from
Running from, running from
Running from, running from
Mmm, mmm, ah)
