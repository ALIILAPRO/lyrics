		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First, you pick up the apparel and you stick it in the barrel
Scrub, scrub
Then you take it to the mangle and you turn the giant handle
Scrub, scrub
Then it's hung up really high until it's nearly dry
Scrub, scrub
But when we sing this song, the day don't seem so long
Scrub, scrub
It's still long, though

Gotta press out all the creases from the dresses and chimneyses
Rub, rub
Gotta fold 'em like they told us or they'll scold us and withhold our
Grub, grub
We all signed the dotted line so we've gotta do our time
Scrub, scrub (scrub, scrub)

And if you don't agree, see Clause 5
Section 7A, Paragraph 22
Part D, which says
Scrub, scrub
Scrub, scrub
Scrub, scrub
Scrub, scrub
