		  Yeah
Lola, what we doin', Lola?
Doin' the things we like to do, Coi
You know my body

Shake it fast, dump it low
Make 'em spend and throw them O's (ayy, ayy)
Green light, go
Ayy, get it up, green light, go
Up, down, throw it 'round (oh yeah)
Pop it like a pro (ayy, ayy)
Green light, go
Ayy, get it up, green light, go

Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah (uh, uh, uh, uh)

Please don't get me started (please don't get me started)
Been a fly bitch before the clip I have just departed
Did it all, to went wife beaters, it's different garments (it's different, baby)
I want parts of my opps too so we split the target
You know I'm gettin' my lick back regardless
Pesos and the bitch I trust
Don't beef 'bout cheese if it ain't a deluxe
Them shots be real and the rooms keep us
Catch that, take this, mm, hut
Big dawg from above
And the puss' can't be touched
Move Wock', that's too 'nough
Pussy sad, make it blush
Up, up, up, up, up
Throw that ass up, up, up, up, up
We should throw that dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
We should throw that dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
Uh, uh, uh, uh

Shake it fast, dump it low
Make 'em spend and throw them O's (ayy, ayy)
Green light, go
Ayy, get it up, green light, go
Up, down, throw it 'round (oh yeah)
Pop it like a pro (ayy, ayy)
Green light, go
Ayy, get it up, green light, go

Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'm really it, no tag
I told these bitches don't mention my name in none of they raps
Treat your block like a turntable, yeah, we spinnin' it back
We in New Jersey, we in New York, yeah, run that shit back
Hold on, yeah
Bubblegum, bubblegum in the dish
Yeah, how many niggas wanna make me they bitch?
How many diamonds wrapped 'round my wrist?
This bitch so bad, she more than a ten
This bitch so bad, her face like Lola
Tryna fuck some, see the splash emoji
Itty bitty butt, my ass still pokin'
My freak nigga buy me a diamond choker
We don't leave the club 'til that shit is over
Yeah, roll another blunt, hate bein' sober
Remy and Coke, don't do no Coca, yeah
I step on these bitches in Balenciaga
Throwin' it back, all you see is the Prada
Got on YSL, I look like a model
There's blood in his tee and its color yellow
Walk in this bitch, girl, I'm rude, don't say hello
Big-ass chain like I got on a medal (yeah, yeah)
Price goin' up on these bitches-es levels (these levels, levels)
Yeah, we on demon time, we the new rebels

Shake it fast, dump it low
Make 'em spend and throw them O's (ayy, ayy)
Green light, go
Ayy, get it up, green light, go
Up, down, throw it 'round (oh yeah)
Pop it like a pro (ayy, ayy)
Green light, go
Ayy, get it up, green light, go

Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
Please don't get me started
Please don't, ah, please don't, ah
