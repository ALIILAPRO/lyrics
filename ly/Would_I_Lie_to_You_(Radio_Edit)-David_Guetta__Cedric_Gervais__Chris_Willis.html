		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? Oh yeah
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you? Baby, yeah

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? Oh yeah
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you? Baby, yeah

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
(Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?)
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? Oh yeah
(Would I lie to you? Oh yeah)
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you
(There's no one else but you)
Would I lie to you? Baby, yeah

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? Oh yeah
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you? Baby, yeah

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? Oh yeah
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you? Baby, yeah

Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?
Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you? Oh yeah
Don't you know it's true, girl, there's no one else but you
Would I lie to you? Baby, yeah
