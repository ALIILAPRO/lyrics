		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Try to play it cool, I like you
Have me in your hand just like that
Wish I never told ya, it's killin' me to wonder
You give, you give me empty promises of love
You're an honest man when you're drunk
Wish I never asked ya, but it's killin' me to wonder

How long? How long?

How, how long have you loved another
While I'm dreamin' of us together?
She got the best of you
Part of me always knew
How, how long have you tried to end it
While I'm blamin' myself to fix it?
How long? (How long?)
How long?

Listen to my fears, not my friends
They don't tell the truth, they like you
Wish I never told ya, it's killin' me to wonder
You give, you give me empty promises of love
You're an honest man when you're drunk
Wish I never asked ya (asked ya)
But it's killin' me to wonder (hell, yeah)

How long? How long?

How, how long have you loved another
While I'm dreamin' of us together?
She got the best of you
Part of me always knew
How, how long have you tried to end it
While I'm blamin' myself to fix it?
How long? (How long?)
I need to know
How long have you loved another
While I'm dreamin' of us together?
How long? (How long?)
How long? How long?

I know love isn't fair
I know the heart wants what it wants
There's no way to prepare
For burning, brutal rejection
I know it takes some time
To feel the pain of losin' a lie

How, how long have you loved another
While I'm dreamin' of us together?
She got the best of you (she did)
Part of me always knew (I knew)
How, how long have you tried to end it
While I'm blamin' myself to fix it?
How long? (Hey, yeah, how long?)
I need to know
How long have you loved another
While I'm dreamin' of us together?
How long? (How long? Yeah)
How long? How long?
