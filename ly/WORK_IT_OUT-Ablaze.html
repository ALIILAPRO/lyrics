		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Weeping may endure
For a night
But I know that Joy
Comes in the morning
When The Storms of Life
Are raging
I know I'm covered
Even When it's pouring
Even When it's pouring
I know the battle is won (battle is won)
It's not over till God says it's done (God says it's done so)
So I'm gon' keep on keeping on
I know he'll work it out
I know he'll work it out
(No matter what it is, No problem too big, No problem too small, Here's why)
Weeping may endure
For a night
But I know that Joy
Comes in the morning
When The Storms of Life
Are raging
I know I'm covered
Even When it's pouring
Even when it's pouring
I know the battle is won (battle is won)
It's not over till God says it's done (God says it's done so)
So I'm gon' keep on keeping on
I know he'll work it out
I know he'll work it out
(In case y'all still don't understand, I think we can break it down a little more, Y'all ready, yea)
God will work it out yes he'll work it out
I Know that God will work it out, yes he'll work it out
I Know that God will work it out yes he'll work it out
I Know that God will work it out, yes he'll work it out
I know that God will work it out, yes he'll work it out (FREEZE)
God will work it out, yes he'll work it out (Work it out)
God will work it out, yes he'll work it out (Everybody on mute)
God will work it out, yes he'll work it out (Lemme talk to em')
I know that God will work it out (anxiety)
I know that God will work it out (Depression)
I know that God will work it out (disease)
I know that God will work it out (finances)
I know that God will work it out (On the job)
I know that God will work it out (At school)
I know that God will work it out (Hold on y'all)
I know that God will work it out (We gotta take em' to church, right here clap)
I know that God will, God will
God will, God will
God will,God will
God will, OH
God will, God will
God will, God will
God will work it out, yes he'll work it out
He'll work it out (no matter what it looks like)
He'll work it out (just walk by faith and not by sight)
He'll work it out (every little things gonna be alright)
Work it out (work it out, work it out, work it out, work it out )
I know the battle is won ( He'll work it out )
It's not over till God says its done (He'll work it out )
So I'm gon keep on keeping on ( He'll work it out )
I know he'll work it out
(Now let's do it the ablaze way, 1 2 3 switch it up )
I know the battle is won ( He'll work it out ) (the battle is won, the battle is already won)
It's not over till God says its done (He'll work it out ) (I know that it is not over, until God says that its done)
So I'm gon keep on keeping on ( He'll work it out ) (Imma keep on keeping on, Imma keep on keeping on)
I know he'll work it out (I serve a big God he is strong, we've already won we can close out the song)
I know he'll work it out
(So when times get rough, never forget, He can work it out)
