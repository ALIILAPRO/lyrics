		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I see you with her
It only gets worse
And, oh, how it hurts
I can't say
'Cause I'm all out of words
Lost on this Earth
Just floating around
Someone help me down

It's been so hard
Ever since you broke my heart (mm)
But I'll never tell (mm)
Honey, I'm not doing so well (mm)

It's not your fault
I could've done more
Like being upfront
Honest about what I want
But it's not like me
To just say what I feel
Though I feel it, it's real
Oh

It's been so hard
Ever since you broke my heart (mm)
But I'll never tell (mm)
Honey, I'm not doing so well (mm)

Honey, I'm not doing so well
Honey, I'm not doing so well
Oh, I'll never tell
Honey, I'm not doing so well
I'm not doing so well
