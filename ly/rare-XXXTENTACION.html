		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Very fucking holy, very fucking rare
Marvelous, absolutely mother fucking marvelous, dog
Marvelous (I have this dream)
Tell these fuck niggas I said, "Very rare," yeah
(That one day I go missing, I disappear)
(And no one can find me)

Ayy, I'm an asshole with a cash flow (ayy, yeah)
I got a bad bitch, she got a pretty pussy (ayy, ayy, yeah, yeah)
I beat the bitch like Ray Rice (yeah, ayy, yeah, ayy)
She won't testify if you ask her (yeah, ayy, ayy, word)
I got molly all on my dick (yeah, yeah)
Hold up, that's molly all on my dick (yeah, yeah)
I got a .40 Glock and that drum, nigga (ayy, ayy, whoa)
So when I shoot the shit, it go, "Ayy" (ayy, whoa, yeah)

Which of you niggas is about it? (Gang)
And I slap the fucker, he unconscious (gang)
You rock Hilfiger fixing to kill niggas
To make the bills bigger, he won't find us (god damn yeah, gang)
Now I play my role to get by (gang, whoa)
I won't harm a fly 'til I'm tried (gang, damn)
Burn the fucker, never yearned the fucker
I'ma leave the body in Dubai, ayy
