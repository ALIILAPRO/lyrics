		  Thank you, Ralph
Sometimes I ask myself is God cries
Trademark

I wonder if God cries
Maybe His pain is the rain
Maybe the storm that we face
Means God is ashamed
Of the creatures that He made
And how lost we became in
This world that He gave

I guess we'll never know
It's cool to wonder, right?
Dark times but we act like it's sunlight
(Sunlight)
We use religion as a way to judge and crucify
Million different ones tryna fit us
Like a suit and tie (Tiе)
Kids having gun fights from
Sundown to sunlight (yeah)
We argue abortion and thеn
We argue gun rights
All these opinions contradict on
The both sides left, right, most votes
Or the post with most likes
So many questions, not a lot of answers
Hundred billion dollars
Still no cure for cancer screw conspiracies
I'm not one for the banter
But it's someone close to me
So now it really matters
I used to smile at rainbows
But maybe that's God's frown
And the sun showers signify the
Feeling that He has when somebody does good
Turns around and does bad
Then tricks themselves out the
Good they already had it's frustration
(Frustration) , and the wind is the push
In our back as we walk away from Satan
And maybe the thunder is the
Sound of God clappin'
When he's bangin' Dax music on his playlist

I wonder if God cries
Maybe His pain is the rain
Maybe the storm that we face
Means God is ashamed
Of the creatures that He made
And how lost we became in
This world that He gave

What would God do if He was in our shoes?
I bet He'd stay off social
Media and not watch news (That's right)
I bet He'd fix the Middle
East and bring peace
To the current situation between
Palestinians and Jews that's a tall order
I bet God would probably
Have a mean cross-over
And find a lane different cultures
Could exist within the myth
That the color of our skin should separate
Us all instead of bring us closer
Fix racism, classism, fascism, sexism
Any -ism that even exists
'Cause to separate one in a
World full of people
Where we all created equal, will never be it
I bet He wouldn't sleep (Wouldn't sleep)
If that's the only time
He's chasin' his dreams
I bet he'd shoot every shot that
He had and not pass
With the knowledge that devil's
Playin' on his team

I wonder if God cries
Maybe His pain is the rain
Maybe the storm that we face
Means God is ashamed (Ashamed, ashamed)
Of the creatures that He made
And how lost we became in
This world that He gave (He gave)

Or made?
Maybe God knew we would go insane (Go insane)
Maybe God gave pain so
We'd appreciate the times
Without and when we had, it keep faith
Maybe God doesn't give strength
But give tough times
'Cause that's builds strength
If you know how a muscle's designed
And maybe God gives hate when we ask for love
So when we find it we can see
It clear and open our eyes
And if He really does cry, I hope He knows
I try as my time flies by
And that when I hit that sky
We gon' bump this song
For eternity as time pass

I wonder if God cries
Maybe His pain is the rain
Maybe the storm that we face
Means God is ashamed (Ashamed, ashamed)
Of the creatures that He made
And how lost we became in
This world that He saved (He gave)

It's Dax amen
