		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, so loud
Wait
But I don't realize
Small white legs
Broke
The pain between her thighs

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?

Skin so cold
How could someone steal a life?
Takes the blame
Wait
I got some shit to say

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?

Smashed and raped
Not again, this is a real crime
What a pretty face
Who do I feel sorry for?

Wait, something 
Now rips my 
Heart and takes 
My soul, I 

Wait, too late 
Now, I feel 
Hurt inside
Take my soul away
Away (away)

I see your pretty face
Smashed against the bathroom floor
What a disgrace
Who do I feel sorry for?

Smashed and raped
Not again, this is a real crime
What a pretty face
Who do I feel sorry for?
