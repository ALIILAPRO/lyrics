		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, put down the drink
And baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, it's so hard to swallow

Your heart is beatin' like a loaded gun
What's done is done and you're spinnin' in circles
Where's the girl that I used to know?
Why did you let her go? You know I loved her so

It's never any more than one for me
But always two or three for you

Baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, it's so hard to swallow

I don't want to see it go this way
Feelin' like tomorrow is just a yesterday
I hate the way it is and to tell you the truth
It's killin' me and it's killin' you

I can't stand all the ups and downs
The back and forths and the 'round and 'rounds
The in and outs of the slammin' doors
It's tearin' me apart, I can't take no more

It's never any more than one for me
But always two or three for you

Baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, yeah, it's so hard to swallow

I want us back like we were before
Not like the broken glass lyin' on the floor

Baby, put down the drink
(Put down the drink)
Baby, put down the bottle
(Put down the bottle)

It feels like it's all slippin' away
I wish I had you like it has you
It feels like it's all slippin' away
I wish I had you

Baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And you get high when you're down, but I'm watchin' you fall

So baby, put down the drink
Baby, put down the bottle
You're startin' to sink
And when you're down on your knees, yeah, it's so hard to swallow

I want us back like we were before
Not like the broken glass lyin' on the floor

Baby, put down the drink
Put down the bottle
(When you're down on your knees, it's so hard to swallow)
Put down the drink
Put down the bottle

Your heart is beatin' like a loaded gun
What's done is done
And you're spinning in circles
