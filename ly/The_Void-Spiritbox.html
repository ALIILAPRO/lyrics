		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a walk to the water at night
No one waits with a light in the dark
'Cause I like to sleep alone

Feel a sense of control in my life
I feel a sense of an infinite lie
Right below the surface

Curses lost to an imminent danger
Touch a razor blade to the sky
Like a crutch I need someone to break my
Fall in to a place where I belong and
Who can tell me where I want to go
Talk to the void and fall with me

Where do my fears all go when they die?
(Where do my fears go? Where do my fears go?)
To a place untethering a thousand lives between the stone
It's the way that you guide me to the edge
Of a hole that was made for me
I hear the call of the void and surrender up
A piece of my history

Curses lost to an imminent danger
Touch a razor blade to the sky
Like a crutch I need someone to break my
Fall in to a place where I belong and
Who can tell me where I want to go
Talk to the void and fall with me

Where do my fears all go when they die?
(Where do my fears go? Where do my fears go?)
Where do my fears all go when they die?
(Where do my fears go? Where do my fears go?)

Curses lost to an imminent danger
Touch a razor blade to the sky
Like a crutch I need someone to break my
Fall in to a place where I belong and
Who can tell me where I 
Want to go (but it's too close)
Talk to the void and (and it's too late)
Fall with me (this time) with me
