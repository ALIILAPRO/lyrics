		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The morning sun shines on your skin
'Cause your white curtains, they are
Paper thin
Windows open
I can feel the breeze
But we're safe here, under the sheets

I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep and listen to you breathe
Ooh, oh
I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep, I'll watch you sleep

I never get bored of looking at you
'Cause every time I see something new
Like the scar on your spine
You fell of a roof when you were nine
You lived a life before me

I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep and listen to you breathe
Ooh, oh
I don't ever wanna leave
I'll watch you sleep, I'll watch you sleep

(I don't ever wanna leave)
(I'll watch you sleep, I'll watch you sleep)
(I don't ever wanna leave)
(I'll watch you sleep, I'll watch you sleep)

(I'll watch you sleep)
(I'll watch you sleep)
