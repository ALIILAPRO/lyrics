		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't drive a big fast car
You don't look like a movie star
And on your money we won't get far
But baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Whoa-oh, oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

Now you don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Whoa-oh and whoa-oh whoa yeah
You got what it takes for me

Now when you're near me, ooh-wee
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, oh yeah
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me

You don't live in a beautiful place
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes (yeah yeah), to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Whoa-oh, and a-whoa-oh
You got what it takes for me

Now when you're near me, little girl
My head goes around and around
And when you kiss me, oh yeah
My love comes tumblin' down, you send me

You don't live in a beautiful place, no
You don't dress with the best of taste
And nature didn't give you such a beautiful face
But baby, you got what it takes, to satisfy
You got what it takes to set my soul on fire
Whoa-oh, oh yeah
You got what it takes for me

Oh yeah
You got what it takes
Don't need no money
Baby, you don't need no car
Come on, you know you got a-what it takes for me, little girl
You got what it takes for me
Yes, baby
You got what it takes for me, oh yeah
