		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, better listen closely
Ayy, shoot a pussy nigga acting nosy, yeah
It's just Big 14 and Lil Mosey, yeah
Fuck that ho, you treat her like a trophy, huh (DJ on the beat so it's a banger)

Nigga's be talkin' shit but they ain't with that shit for real
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass killed
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass spilled
You ain't really real, you ain't with that shit for real
Nigga this ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you's a lame nigga, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you should quit, nigga, this ain't that for real
This ain't that for real, this ain't that for real

No legit, you's a bitch, nigga, this ain't that for real
Odell with the pick, nigga, this ain't that for real
I'm a fucking walking lick, but nigga this ain't that for real
Yeah, yeah
Shoot him with this choppa make his body dance, uh
Choppa get to bussin', do the runnin' man, uh
Would've threw a party, I ain't got no friends, uh
All my niggas brothers and that's to the end, uh
Would've used a Glock but I used the FN
Shootin' the .223's, you a dead man, uh
Choppa gonna shoot at your head man
Where the fuck you 'posed to keep a head band
Like you hooping, but we balling the way that we shooting (that we shooting)
I got rings, I got rings, bitch not like Melo, uh
Bitch I'm with the slimes, Donatello, uh
Lemme eat that kitty, baby hello, huh

Nigga's be talkin' shit but they ain't with that shit for real
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass killed
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass spilled
You ain't really real, you ain't with that shit for real
Nigga this ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you's a lame nigga, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you should quit, nigga, this ain't that for real
This ain't that for real, this ain't that for real (uh, yeah, yeah)

I'm with 14, we gon' flow then smoke on OG
This weed loud, it's some gas, got me choking
Walking through my city, shaking bullets off me
Know my riches 'cause these bitch look how it's flexin'
You ain't with the shits, I can tell, bullets, they hot as hell
Thinking 'bout buying a well and a new crib for my momma, uh
Always pull up with some drums
But nigga I'm riding with gunners, boom
I'm just wondering what Carti would do
Beatin' his case, so I got him a jewel
Take it with slatt 'nem, we ain't doing no acting
Slide down 'less you have it, we still causing havoc
Big boy I did it again, no I don't wanna be friends
I turn a five to a ten, money, I'm throwing a band
Backwoods, I'm smoking the gas, I'm finna fuck her then pass
Skrrt skrrt I hop in the Wraith, when I'm running from 12 and I'm doing the dash
Ooh, dripping like water
And she wanna fuck 'cause money up on her

Nigga's be talkin' shit but they ain't with that shit for real
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass killed
Fuck nigga talkin' shit then he gon' get his ass spilled
You ain't really real, you ain't with that shit for real
Nigga this ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you's a lame nigga, this ain't that for real
You's a bitch, you should quit, nigga this ain't that for real
This ain't that for real, this ain't that for real
