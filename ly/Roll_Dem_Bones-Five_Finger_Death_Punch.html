		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This'll be the last tear I shed for you

Some say they kill for God
And some kill for sport
The only difference makes no difference to me
It just depends on what looks better in court
'Cause it's a knock down, drag out, everybody bow down
Sick and twisted game that you play
There are no resolutions in the broken institutions
Or the funny bloody money you crave

This is the last tear
This is the last time

There was a time that I believed I could've changed it all
Somebody got to me, somebody's got to pay
There was a time that I believed I could've changed the world
Now I can't, now I don't, now I won't
So roll them bones

Puff your chest out at me
Just what the fuck were you thinking?
I wrote the book on that shit
Bound it, backed it, burned it all down
I'm a bully beating reaper, cheating super villain, king of heathens
Everything you know that you're not
You're like a half-wit parlor trick, no one ever gave a shit
I'm laughing on the day that you drop

This is the last tear
This is the last time

There was a time that I believed I could've changed it all
Somebody got to me, somebody's got to pay
There was a time that I believed I could've changed the world
Now I can't, now I don't, now I won't
So roll them bones

This is the last tear
This is the last time

There was a time that I believed I could've changed it all
Somebody got to me, somebody's got to pay
There was a time that I believed I could've changed the world
Now I can't, now I don't, now I won't
So roll them bones

Roll them bones
