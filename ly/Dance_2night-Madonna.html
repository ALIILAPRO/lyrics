		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Move your body
Catch me from across the floor
Everybody's watchin'
But I just wanna give you more
Don't care bout nothin'
I'm fallin' for your love in the worst way

So move closer
I can feel your body rise
The heat from you
I just have to fantasize
We're all alone now
And I don't care what people have to say

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And groove around the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's do ourselves to the world

Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on

In our zone
Do you wanna take it further
And before too long
I'm gonna start to wonder
Are you a one trick pony
Or do you wanna keep runnin' this race

I'm so into you...
I've heard it all before
So what should I do?
I told you, catch me on the floor
Don't spoil this moment
'Cause talk is cheap
I don't have time to waste

You don't have to be beautiful
To be understood
You don't have to be rich and famous
To be good
You just gotta give more, more, more
Than you ever have before
And you gotta move fast, fast, fast
If you want this good thing to last

Let's dance tonight, dance tonight
And groove around the world
And we'll hold hands tonight, hands tonight
I'm just a boy and you're just a girl
I wanna dance tonight, dance tonight
Don't need no diamonds and pearls
So take a chance tonight, chance tonight
Let's do ourselves to the world

Do it, do it
Let me turn you on
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the break of dawn
Do it, do it
While the night is young
Let the music pull you through it
'Til the lights go on
