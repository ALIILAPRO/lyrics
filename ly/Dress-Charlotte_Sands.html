		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
You're just my type
I'm lying when I'm looking away
I'm staring up and down
I'm all around
Obsessed with your face

Oh, what a mess I'm in
You're so masculine
Sweet like cherry cola
Dripping confidence
Lose my common sense
Kiss you 'til I'm sober

I love the way you wear that dress
Making everyone upset
Burning that cigarette, boy
Swear to god I confess, boy
Craving your candy lips
All black finger-tips
Looks so good, I'm annoyed
Make me wanna get undressed, boy
Love the way you wear that

Too cool demeanor
You don't need to
Damn, you're pulling it off

And usually, I'm bored and I'm faking the conversations
Want you even more, with every word you're saying

What a mess I'm in
You're so masculine
Sweet like cherry cola

I love the way you wear that dress
Making everyone upset
Burning that cigarette, boy
Swear to god I confess, boy
Craving your candy lips
All black finger-tips
Looks so good, I'm annoyed
Make me wanna get undressed, boy
Love the way you wear that

Love the way you wear that
Love the way you wear that
Love the way you wear that
Love the way you wear that
I love the way you wear that
I love the way you wear that

Oh, what a mess I'm in
You're so masculine
Sweet like cherry cola
Dripping confidence
Lose my common sense
Kiss you 'til I'm sober

I love the way you wear that dress
Making everyone upset
Burning that cigarette, boy
Swear to god I confess, boy
Craving your candy lips
All black finger-tips
Looks so good, I'm annoyed
Make me wanna get undressed, boy
Love the way you wear that
