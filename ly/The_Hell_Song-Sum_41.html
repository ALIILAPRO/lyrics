		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through

I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
This happened to you

It's just a problem that I'm faced with am I
Not the only one who hates to stand by
Complications that are first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind

Knowing endless consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back, and as for me
I can't believe

Part of me won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure

Part of me won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Anymore

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same things to you
It's just a matter how you solve them
But what else are we supposed to do

Part of me won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure

Part of me won't agree
'Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Anymore

Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
Now that I find knowing so bad
I don't think I knew what I had

Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
Now that I find knowing so bad
I don't think I knew what I had
