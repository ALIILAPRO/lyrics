		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't seem to concentrate
Will they still wait for me?
You don't seem to notice
I'm not where I wanna be

I'm trying to talk, but they don't hear me
It feels like I'm shouting, but no one's listening
I'm breaking underneath

Help
Help

I know they see me hesitate
And I can't stand the shame
My mind's hurting me again
Will it ever numb the pain?

I'm trying to talk, but they don't hear me
It feels like I'm drowning, but no one sees me
I'm not where I wanna be

Help
Help

I'm trying to talk, but they don't hear me
It feels like I'm shouting, but no one's listening
I'm breaking underneath

Help
Help
