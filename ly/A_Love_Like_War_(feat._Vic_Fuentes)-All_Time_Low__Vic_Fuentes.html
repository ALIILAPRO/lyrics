		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make a wish on our sorry little hearts
Have a smoke, pour a drink, steal a kiss in the dark
Fingernails on my skin like the teeth of a shark
I'm intoxicated by the lie

In the chill of your stare I am painfully lost
Like a deer in the lights of an oncoming bus
For the thrill of your touch I will shamefully lust
As you tell me we're nothing but trouble

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war

We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all, whoa

Fail-safe trigger, lock down call
Wipe the dry clean slate, quick, sound the alarm
No escape from the truth and the weight of it all
I am caught in the web of a lie

And the bitch of it all is that I'm running from
The desire of the people to whom I belong
At the end of the day you can tell me I'm wrong
'Cause you went to all of this trouble

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war

We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all, whoa
(Let's go)

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
It feels like war (it feels like war)
Love feels like war (love feels like war)

Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
Heart's on fire tonight
Feel my bones ignite
Love feels like war, war
Feels like war, war
(One more time!)

We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all
We go together or we don't go down at all (don't go down at all)

Is this the end of us or just the means to start again
