		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Check out my melody
Check out my melody
Check out my melody
Special (check my melody, my melody)

You think you're special, you do
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it when you laugh at me
Look down on me and walk around on me

Just one more fight about your leadership
And I will straight up leave your shit
'Cause I've had enough of this
And now I'm pissed, yeah

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

Check out, check, check out, 
Check, check, check, check out my melody
Check out, check out
Check, check, check out my melody
Check out my melody
Check, check out, check, check out, check, check out
Check, check, check out out my melody

Just one more fight about a lot of things
And I will give up everything
To be on my own again
Free again, yeah

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go

Check, check out, 
Check, check out my melody
Check out, check, check out, check, check out
Check, check, check, check out my melody
My melody, check, check out my melody

Just one more fight and I'll be history
Yes, I will straight up leave your shit
And you'll be the one who's left
Missing me, yeah

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

This time I'ma let it all come out
This time I'ma stand up and shout
I'ma do things my way, it's my way
My way or the highway

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know
When you're gonna go
Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know

Check out, check, check out
Check, check out, check, check out
Check, check out, check, check out
Check, check out my melody
Check out, check, check out
Check out, check, check out
Check out, check, check out
Check out, check out
Check out, check, check out
Check out, check out
Check out, check, check out
Check out, check out my melody
