		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah

I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Now I know it's not you, fifty on my boxers
Bitch, I know you see me, shinin' in my white tee, it's easy
I'll make it look easy, believe me, we Gucci (Free Gucci)
Young punk bitch, fuckin' on a young bitch (nah, nah)
Fell in love when she saw me in the club, bitch
Young punk bitch, fuckin' on a drunk bitch (yah, yah)
Shawty fell in love, now she doin' all my drugs, Yung Bruh

Standin' in the club like lil mama in my eyesight (yeah my eyesight)
She go home with me tonight, we connect like Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi)
Yayo on the table, Gucci on my waist too (yayo)
Got my switchblade, tonight you'll be safe

Gemstone switchblade and I will pull it out (gemstones)
This club goin' up, baby, will you hold me down? (Will you hold me down?)
Hella ice on my wrists, he thought my wrists sprained
I'm in your driveway, baby, lets skrt away (skr, skr, skr)

I used to think I love you, now I know it ain't true
Now I know it's not you, fifty on my boxers
Bitch, I know you see me, shinin' in my white tee, it's easy
I'll make it look easy, believe me, we Gucci (Free Gucci)
Young punk bitch, fuckin' on a young bitch (nah, nah)
Fell in love when she saw me in the club, bitch
Young punk bitch, fuckin' on a drunk bitch (yeah, yeah)
Shawty fell in love, now she doin' all my drugs, Yung Bruh

Standin' in the club like lil mama in my eyesight
She go home with me tonight, we connect like Wi-Fi
Yayo on the table, Gucci on my waist too
Got my switchblade, tonight you'll be safe
