		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanted to
Be the one that you called to
I was a, I was a loner
And you were the girl with the answers
Finally found
But I don't know where to go
When I just wanna be alone
What's it like in Panama
In the sunlight, sunlight
And I don't know where you are
But I just wanna be alone
What's it like in Panama
Where the sunlight is golden
And could it be
You were pretending we could be
I only need, only a glimpse of
Something to make me feel loved
Finally by you
But I don't know where to go
When I just wanna be alone
What's it like in Panama
In the sunlight, sunlight
And I don't know where you are
But I just wanna be alone
What's it like in Panama
Where the sunlight is golden
I don't know why I try
To feel desired
While you and your friends all lie
In the sunlight
But I don't know where to go
When I just wanna be alone
What's it like in Panama
In the sunlight, sunlight
And I don't know where you are
But I just wanna be alone
What's it like in Panama
Where the sunlight is golden
