		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna walk with into the love
I wanna fall with you, oh
I wanna run with
You get me so high
I wanna fly with you, oh

It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine-you're mine-you're mine
It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine eh-eh-eh-eh

You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You-you'll be mine
You'll be mine-mine-mine

Tonight I'm gonna fight for my right
And loving you's the only thing on my mind
Tonight I'm gonna fight for my right
And loving you's the only thing on my mind
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay

I wanna try with you all of the things I dream to do with you, oh
I wanna break with you all of the rules that keep me away from you, oh

It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine-you're mine-you're mine
It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine eh-eh-eh-eh

You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You-you'll be mine
You'll be mine-mine-mine

Tonight I'm gonna fight for my right
And loving you's the only thing on my mind
Tonight I'm gonna fight for my right
And loving you's the only thing on my mind
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be alright, It's gonna be okay

I wanna walk with into the love
I wanna fall with you, oh
I wanna run with
You get me so high
I wanna fly with you, oh

It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine-you're mine-you're mine
It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine eh-eh-eh-eh

It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine-you're mine-you're mine
It's alright-alright
All night-all night
You're mine-you're mine eh-eh-eh-eh

You'll be mine
You'll be mine
You-you'll be mine
You'll be mine-mine-mine

Tonight I'm gonna fight for my right
And loving you's the only thing on my mind
Tonight I'm gonna fight for my right
And loving you's the only thing on my mind
