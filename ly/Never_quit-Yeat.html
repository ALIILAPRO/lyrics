		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I can never quit (quit)
Yeah, I can never quit (no, no, quit)
But I hope you do the things you said you never did (woo-woo-woo)
Make a new life
You don't fit inside my fuckin' shoes, right? (Right?)
I don't need no diamonds, I need all money
You don't do the job, we'll do the job right
Oh, you one of them bad types? (Yeah)
Oh, you on that last flight?
Do you think it look bad, right?
Heard you need somebody, don't you ever call me
I'm inside my Maybach smokin' cigs, thinkin'
Why the fuck you think that you could trust me? (Why?)
I've been off them drugs, but I'm still tweakin' (yeah)
I don't think that nobody could feel me
And you say you live like a God (God, God-God)
I feel like God (God, goddammit)
And I live like God (God, God-God)

I live off the grid, you don't know me
You don't even know the old me
Only thing that you should know, is old me
You wish that you could grow, bitch, I'ma see
I think the whole world fake, except me
You beggin' please on your knees sayin', "Accept me"
I'm overseas for the breeze on this Jet Ski
I do believe that nothin' gon' impress me
I'm way too rich to just be thinkin' 'bout this shit
I'm way too rich, I'm diabolical as shit
I'm way too rich, don't give a fuck if you get hit
Matter fact, I don't even wanna see you die, I wanna see you live
So you can think about all the shit you did and where you went wrong
And what the fuck you thought you coulda did
Yeah, I love swimmin' with the fish
I love sittin' in a bottomless pit full of-

Yeah, I can never quit (quit)
Yeah, I can never quit (no, no, quit)
But I hope you do the things you said you never did (woo-woo-woo)
Make a new life
You don't fit inside my fuckin' shoes, right? (Right?)
I don't need no diamonds, I need all money
You don't do the job, we'll do the job right
Oh, you one of them bad types? (Yeah)
Oh, you on that last flight?
Do you think it look bad, right?
Heard you need somebody, don't you ever call me
I'm inside my Maybach smokin' cigs, thinkin'
Why the fuck you think that you could trust me? (Why?)
I've been off them drugs, but I'm still tweakin' (yeah)
I don't think that nobody could feel me
And you say you live like a God (God, God-God)
I feel like God (God, goddammit)
And I live like God (God, God-God)
