		  Woo! (For a lifetime)

I've been feeling just a little bit low
Got to get back to the show, and we'll fly
You don't have to feel like
You're on your own
No one should have to dance alone
Not tonight

You and me
We're gonna write a little history
You and me
Just show me love, and then you'll see

Memories that we make
They are never gonna fade for a lifetime
(For a lifetime) we don't give no shade
If you wanna hide away
We just out herе trying to play
Stackin' thrills up in the memory bank

(For a lifetimе, For a lifetime)

I've been looking for somebody to make
Memories in the bank forever in time
There's no reason to be hard to find
'Cause we've already lost our mind

You and me
We're gonna write a little history
You and me
Just show me love, and then you'll see

Memories that we make
They are never gonna fade for a lifetime
(For a lifetime) we don't give no shade
If you wanna hideaway
We just out here trying to play
Staking thrills up in the memory bank

(For a lifetime, For a lifetime)
