		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Isn't it cool how the summer fades?
But I'm still here whispering your name
Guess the heat drives people crazy
Slip up and I call you baby

Oh, summer's over (Oh)
Guess you won't be coming over (Oh)
Good to meet you, nice to know you
Nice to know you nice to know you
Nice to, nice to, nice to

Isn't it strange how the shade can burn
How you can go to school
But you can never learn
Taking flights south when the weather changes
We'll be birds in our separate cages

Oh, summer's over (Oh)
Guеss you won't be coming over (Oh)
Good to meet you, nice to know you
Nicе to know you nice to know you
Nice to, nice to, nice to
