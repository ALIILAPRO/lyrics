		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be honest, I could use a little help from someone else
Don't be, don't be that way with me
Don't be that way with me
Fingers crossed that I can trust a stranger here
A stranger there, but lately
Don't be that way with me
Don't be that way with me

She walks me through my lines
She tells me what I'm tryna fight
Now and then I get anxious, baby, it's natural
She talks me through hard times
She tells me all my faults and I
Never need to get angry, baby, it's natural

Now I'm just tryna put myself out there
It's hard when she's not there
I tell her all the time
I tell her all the time
I should be celebratin'
But it's too devastatin'
I want her all the time
I want her all the time

She walks me through my lines
She tells me what I'm tryna fight
Now and then I get anxious, baby, it's natural
She talks me through hard times
She tells me all my faults and I
Never need to get angry, baby, it's natural
