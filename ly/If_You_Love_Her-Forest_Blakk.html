		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it
She gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have

She always has trouble fallin' alseep
And she likes to cuddle, all under the sheets
She loves pop songs and dancin', and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies and likes givin' gifts
Has a hard time acceptin' a good compliment
And she loves her whole family and all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in

Take it
When she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her, on days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her like that

Kiss her with passion as much as you can
Run your hands through her hair, whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice how pretty she is
Tell her over and over, so she never forgets

Take it
When she gives you her heart, don't you break it
Let your arms be a place she feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her, on days when
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her like that

She'll love you if you love her like that
She'll love you, she'll love you
She'll love you if you love her like that
Oh, oh oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah
She'll love you, she'll love you 
She'll love you, she'll love you

She'll love you if you love her, on days when 
It feels like the whole world might cave in
Stand side by side and you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you if you love her like that
