		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a swelling storm
And I'm caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control
Of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
 
But there, is a light
In the dark, and I feel its warmth
In my hands, and my heart
Why can't I hold on?
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories, of a stolen place
Caught in the silence 
An echo lost in space
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, it always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood, into the flood
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
 
I watched my wild youth
Disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find
 
It comes and goes in waves
It always does, oh it always does
 
The freedom, of falling
A feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through, my fingers
I'm trying hard to let go
It comes and goes in waves
It comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
