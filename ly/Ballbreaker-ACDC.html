		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breakin' balls, bangin' walls 

Work hard and tough, and I want some rough 
Unpack my bags, and take a drag 
When bang on nine, and 
Dead on time 

Open up the door 
And lay upon the floor 
She open her overcoat 
Livin' out her dreams 
Rippin' off my jeans 

You are a ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 

Engine roll, and time to go 
A razorback, a hog attack 
Buildin' steam, 
Whippin' cream 
She likes a fat, smokin' stack 

Hangin' off her legs 
She threw me on the bed 
Her hand went for my throat 
As I began to choke 
She said, Honey shoot your load 

You are a ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 

Yeah 
Wreckin' ball, let it roll 
You are a ballbreaker 
Buildin' steam, for whippin' cream 
You are a ballbreaker 

Hangin' off her legs 
She threw me on the bed 
Her hand went for my throat 
As I began to choke 
Honey shoot your load 
You are a ballbreaker 
You are a ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker 
Ballbreaker
