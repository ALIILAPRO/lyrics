		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We should put on your favorite records
Pour a little whiskey too early in the day
We could blame it all on the weather
I swear the connection was better in L.A.
We could use our imagination
Make up a confrontation
For the sake of somethin' goin' on
We should put on our favorite records
If we're lucky, turn tonight into a love song

It's alright
Gonna stay right here 'til it hits us
Even if it takes all night
Gonna find the flame, we've been missin', baby
It's alright
Gonna stay right here 'til it hits us
Even if it takes all night
Gonna find the flame, we've been missin', babe

We could try a couple different angles
Your way or my way, maybe somethin' in between
We could throw it up to the angels
Call it a day, say we gave it everything
Just 'cause we don't see, doesn't mean, doesn't mean it isn't there
Just 'cause we don't feel, it doesn't mean, doesn't mean we don't care, ohh

It's alright
Gonna stay right here 'til it hits us
Even if it takes all night
Gonna find the flame, we've been missin', baby
It's alright
Gonna stay right here 'til it hits us
Even if it takes all night
We're gonna find the flame, we've been missin', baby
