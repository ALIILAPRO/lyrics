		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You called me after midnight
Must have been three years since we last spoke
I slowly tried to bring back
The image of your face from the memories so old

I tried so hard to follow
But didn't catch a half of what had gone wrong
Said "I don't know what I can save you from"
I don't know what I can save you from

I asked you to come over
And within half an hour
You were at my door

I had never really known you
But I realized that the one you were before
Had changed into somebody for whom
I wouldn't mind to put the kettle on

Still I don't know what I can save you from
I don't know what I can save you from

I don't know what I can save you from
I don't know what I can save you from
I don't know what I can save you from
I don't know what I can save you from
