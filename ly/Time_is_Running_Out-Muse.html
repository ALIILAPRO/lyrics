		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm drowning
Asphyxiated
I wanna break the spell
That you've created
You're something beautiful
A contradiction
I wanna play the game
I want the friction

You will be the death of me
Yeah, you will be the death of me

Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

And our time is running out
And our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out

I wanted freedom
Bound and restricted
I tried to give you up
But I'm addicted
Now that you know I'm trapped
Sense of elation
You'd never dream of
Breaking this fixation

You will squeeze the life out of me

Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

And our time is running out
And our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out

How did it come to this?
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah

Yeah, you will suck the life out of me

Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

And our time is running out
And our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out

How did it come to this?
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, yeah
