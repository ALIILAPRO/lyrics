		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why don't you return my calls?
Why don't you return my calls?
Why you trip out, where I be?
You don't have to come and see me
Come and see me, come and see me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh

What you mean that you ain't fuckin' me no more? Lil' bitch, is you dumb?
Slackin' on my pimpin' made you leave me for a new one
Girl, I'm way too wavy, let you play me like it's too fun
Malice in my palace, you the salad to my crouton
Keisha, Jenny, Gia, give a fuck about what they say
Talkin' like Madea with that rah-rah and that ray-tay
Me I'm somewhere smokin' on a B, it got that A-grade
On the block, I'm spinnin' on that bitch just like a Beyblade
Don't fuck with my exes, but get text-es on a late night
Airplane mode, I'm like the wheels, 'bout to take flight
And it's five-hundred on the dash
And to them tings I'm tryna bag, I'm on your ass, oh
Money is the motive, you got no emotion
Only two niggas she want is Benjamin and Borden
If money ain't in hand, then the plan get aborted
Slick with that finesse, I bet she'll make you feel important

But ain't nothin' important to her (no)
Ain't nothin' important (no)
But Benjamins and Bordens (Benjamins and Bordens)
But ain't nothin' important to her (no)
Ain't nothin' important (no)
But Benjamins and Bordens (Benjamins and Bordens)

What you mean you went and found another nigga? Bitch, is you dumb? (Is you dumb?)
Bitch, are you dumb?
Broke my heart, and found someone, are you dumb?
Are you stupid, psychotic or dumb, my girl, which one? (Which one?)
It must be one
Is it crack, cocaine or meth you smoke?
What type of drugs you on? (What type of drugs?)
'Cause, bitch, you ain't never left before
Is it make-believe? 'Cause it must be the joke of the summer
You can't leave me so open, had your pussy soakin', it's drippin' all over my covers (oh) 
You know we been fuckin', I had you chin tuckin'
Lickin' your tongue and then grabbin' your chin when you dick suckin'
Put my chicken in your dip like it's Kentucky
Now you front it to that nigga like you didn't love it
I couldn't have figured
Heard this nigga get more paper than me
I can't even flex and say I'm richer
Guess I'm just the Rollie, he the Richard (damn)
I feel embarrassed
I was thinkin' 'bout horse and a carriage
Thinkin' 'bout kids in our back yard
And you come divorcin' a marriage
Are you dumb? (Oh) 
Are you dumb?
Are you dumb? (Oh) 
Are you dumb? (You must be dumb)
Made me put in work when you was tryna find someone
(One question) 
Are you fuckin' dumb? 
Are you fuckin' dumb?

Are you?
Are you?
Are you?
