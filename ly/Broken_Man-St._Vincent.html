		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the street I'm a kingsize killer
I can make your kingdom come
On my feet I'm an earthquake shaking
So open up my little one

Hey, what are you looking at?
Who the hell do you think I am?
And what are you looking at?
Like you never seen a broken man

Lover nail yourself right to me
If you go I won't be well
I can hold my arms wide open 
But I need you to drive the nail
Like, what are you looking at?
Well, who the hell do you think I am?
Hey, what are you looking at?
Like you never seen a broken man

But how do you see me now? 
You built my tower to tear it down
And how could you see me now?
If I stopped cracking up myself 
If I stopped cracking up

Who the hell do you think I am?

Hey, hey
Like you never seen a broken man

Like you never seen a broken man
Like you never seen a broken man
Hey, hey, hey

(Who the hell do you think I am)
Lover nail yourself right to me
If you go I won't be well
I can hold my arms wide open 
But I need you to drive the nail

Hey, what are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

Hey-hey, what are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
Hey, hey, hey
