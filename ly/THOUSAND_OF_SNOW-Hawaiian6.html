		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At night, the birds are sleeping
The snow falls on to the world
It seems to hide away the sins
we made
I found the importance
of the things that I lost
And I tumbled down on my knees
The tears can't melt the ice
Many pains and conflicts
And memories and sorrows
They drilled my body
while I didn't notice
I killed my emotions
Imitated others
in the spell of sense
And I realized
I can't laugh like I used to
Humans are weak and so delicate
and are wandering
tragic creatures
We all get hurt
and envy some others
Repeat the same mistakes
Repeat our sins
To all my angels
with wings ripped off
still lost in a huge maze
Escape forever

A thousand nights
and a thousand snowflakes
In the silence,
can't find my way
And I can't find the answer
I'm still here,
and I dream of the days
that won't rerurn
Humans are weak and so delicate
and are wandering
tragic creatures
We all get hurt
and envy some others
Repeat the same mistakes
Repeat our sins
And we'll lose it all someday
Things are all made to be broken
'Cause they're all made
by humans
In the dawn
The human sins soaked
into the snow,
it turned black
But still the world
turns with hope
