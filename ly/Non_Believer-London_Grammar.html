		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We both know that you wanna love her
Skies are open crying, please don't believe her
'Cause she'll tell you lies and then say it doesn't matter
And you're pleased to see her calling them non-believers

But maybe she loves you and I'm just a preacher
Those burning skies and all who don't believe her
Non-believers, no
Don't believe her, no

All that we are, all that we need
They're different things
Oh, maybe what we are and what we need
They're different things

Do you realize again, you chased an idea
Healed an earth behind some broken creature

Maybe she loves you and I'm just a preacher
Non-believers crying don't believe her
Don't believe her, no
Don't believe her, no

All that we are, all that we need
They're different things
Oh, maybe what we are and what we need
They're different things

Give you my all and you're taking my everything

All that we are, all that we need
They're different things
Oh, maybe what we are and what we need
They're different things

All that we are, all that we need
They're different things
Oh, maybe what we are and what we need
They're different things

All that we are, that we need
All what we are, what we need
