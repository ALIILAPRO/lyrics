		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jumping off heads like I'm Mario
I'm eating on these rappers, no Agar.io
I just got bigger, yeah, I leveled up
Earning XP just to level up
Jumping off heads like I'm Mario
I'm eating on these rappers, no Agar.io
I just got bigger, yeah, I leveled up
Earning XP just to level up
Call me Sonic cus I gotta go faster
I leveled up more since last year
Moving through the levels, gotta get em cleared
Been through a lot, it was hella weird
I'm liking 2020 so far
Dwayne Rock, gotta go harder
Schnitzel, but I don't rada
I ain't sweating, all of this is easy
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy
Winds a blowing, make it breezy
On The Lookout, niggas couldn't reach me
Even John Cena couldn't see me
Tear gas couldn't even breathe me
A clone couldn't ever be me
Far sighted, I can see into the future
I could heal a wound without a suture
Jumping off heads like I'm Mario
I'm eating on these rappers, no Agar.io
I just got bigger, yeah, I leveled up
Earning XP just to level up
Jumping off heads like I'm Mario
I'm eating on these rappers, no Agar.io
I just got bigger, yeah, I leveled up
Earning XP just to level up
