		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it returns
Like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world
The streets looking brand new
I will not be great
But I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late
I'm still glad I met you

The memory hurts
But does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket
To keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road
Its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Sometimes there's a thought
Like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to nought
When I look back through it
I remember the view
Streetlights in the dark blue
The moment I knew
I'd no choice but to love you

The speed that you moved
The screech of the cars
The creature still moving
That slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes
Gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light
The Earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Darling, there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror
Balanced there between those eyes

See how it shines
See how it shines
