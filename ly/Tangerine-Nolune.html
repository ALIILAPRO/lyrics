		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I never thought that I'd save my praise
For the song-less prayer for the opulent days
When I met my maker, looked him in the face
For the lost return of my childhood haze
And I never thought that I'd meet my match
In a parking lot outside the pumpkin patch
With your auburn hair, the way you tied it back
So I left my date, didn't even look back
Never believed anything I was told
'Cause my mother left when I was twelve years old
And I slept outside under the old orange grove
Eating tangerines for a sunken soul
Soul soul
Soul
A little compassion is too much to ask
Of the old white men buying books with cash
Say I "take too long" so they're talking smack
And I quit I'm not paid enough for that
'Cause I spent my whole life thinking I was wrong
For questioning things, for writing songs
For forgetting choreography I was shown
For feeling the things that I've always known
And there is so much that I'll never know
Why this fox it follows everywhere I go
From the church we pass into the grocery store
Even when I ask, he waits at my front door
Door
Door
Door
Never had faith in my life before
'Til I found my god at the department store
Where you worked the night shift and got off at four
So I'd wait for you up on the kitchen floor
And I think the worst part of growing up
Is starting to hate the ones you used to love
And you sit there staring in the dining room
And you try to love them but they hate you too
And you try to hate them but they love you too
Think I'll make it to the pearly gates?
'Cause I know I've seen better when I saw your face
Make Saint Peter crumble under all that grace
All that good in you outweighed all my hate
Yea, I think I'll leave, now it's time to go
'Cause I've slept in this grave 'bout a month or so
And if I don't leave now then I'll never go
I'll eat tangerines in my new found home
