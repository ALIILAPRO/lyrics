Badman bounce eh eh

I go calabar marry ekaette
Iya iya oh oh
Iya iya iya oh oh oh
Iya iya oh oh eh

For the setting we dey give them like were bulaba boys
We load, 7 rounds
For the bando she dey rock am like a pitakwa shima
She go, 20 rounds
How many?
7 rounds
We load, gun man sound
20 rounds, she rode
Badman bounce

For the setting we dey give them like were bulaba boys
We load, 7 rounds (We load)
For the bando she dey rock am like a pitakwa shima
She go, 20 rounds o
How many?
7 rounds
We load, gun man sound (20 rounds)
20 rounds, she rode
Badman bounce

I dey sorry for the man wey been pull up all alone
(Wey been pull up all alone)
Even if he carry gun, the opposition many them go fill him body gan
(What a pity, pull up and spray)
Ah
Gun man down
Wene mighty na the melody scheme
Na why she dey give me her waist
Vibes machine, lash & dip

Onye akpana nwa Agu
Aka n'odu e
Gu Gu Gu
A na ma agafe n'uzo
Fine girls ne kwe n'isi

I'm in love with Yoruba girl
Her name Na yemisi ooh
Biko yemisi
Baby ye misi
Biko ye misi ooh
Girlie ye misi

What is love without you
Oh my Nkem
I no go lie since we met
Money don come
Okwa manuchi owu
Nobody fit you
And you know I love you
No one but me and you
Girlie ooh
Obugina fine fine
Obugina

I go calabar marry ekaette
Iya iya oh oh
Iya iya iya oh oh oh
Iya iya oh oh eh
Gu Gu Gu ey

For the setting we dey give them like bulaba boys
We load, 7 rounds
For the bando she dey rock am like a pitakwa shima
She go, 20 rounds
How many?
7 rounds
We load, gun man sound (fire)
20 rounds, (spray) she rode
(Shoot) badman bounce

How low?
How low can you go?
Omalicha buss it down I get your antidote
E dey shake
Na the kind things I dey like
Free my shirt, baby girl no be fight (badman bounce)
I go doke
My penisula go poke
Your puna, I go give you light stroke
Stupid boy
Silly boys
Wan dey follow me drag
This na heavy gbedu, the type wey dey burst speaker

For the setting we dey give them like abulaba boys
We load, 7 rounds
For the bando she dey rock am like a pitakwa shima
She go, 20 rounds
How many? 
7 rounds
We load, gun man sound 
20 rounds, she rode
Badman bounce

(I dey sorry for the man wey been pull up all alone)
(Even if he carry gun, the opposition many them go fill him body gan)
(What a pity, pull up and spray)
(Gun man down)
(Wene mighty na the melody skin)
(Na why she dey give me her waist)
(Vibes machine, lash & dip)
Give me her waist o
She go make you plead her case o (Gu Gu Gu)
E no dey show for face o
So the popori dey on grace o
Plead her case
Popori dey your grace o
Give me your waist eh
