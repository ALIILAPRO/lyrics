		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like we're moving in slow motion (yeah)

Driving upside down
You're my escape from reality
You know what you mean to me
'Cause I'm leaning all my weight
Making my heart cry (yeah)
Moving in slow, slow motion

If I could stop time for real
Would make it any easier for me to love you?
'Cause you know I'm shy for you still
So bad that it kills
And I can't help but feel
Like we're moving in slow motion
Like we're moving in slow motion

If forever was forever, I would never give you up
You're my baby, you're my love, even when we in the rough
I remember when we met, was it a blessing or a curse?
Another memory I kept to keep you always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always

You know what you mean to me
Moving in slow, slow motion

If I could stop time for real
Would make it any easier for me to love you?
'Cause you know I'm shy for you still
So bad that it kills
And I can't help but feel
Like we're moving in slow, slow motion

If I could stop time for real
Would make it any easier for me to love you?
