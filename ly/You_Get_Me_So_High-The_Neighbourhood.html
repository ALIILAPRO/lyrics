		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hope you don't regret it
I pushed a lot back but I can't forget it
We never got the credit
Nobody seemed to hear us but we said it
Neither of us planned it
And for a long time I took it all for granted
I really thought we had it
But at the time it was more than I could manage, so

If we can leave it all behind us
And meet in-between
It would get me so

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

Wish I didn't doubt it
I wish I never ever told you all about it
But I just had to let you know
I never meant to hurt you, though
I had all my motives
I didn't know they wouldn't mix with your emotions
I just had to reach my goals
Never knew I needed you though, so

If we can agree to disagree and
Keep on reaching
It would get you so

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?
High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

Used to stick together
You're my best friend, I'll love you forever (come with me)
We could be the greatest
Doesn't matter if we're never rich or famous (come with me)

High all the time, high all the time
I wanna be high all the time
Would you come with me?

If you can just let me know if it's okay
To call you when I'm lonely
