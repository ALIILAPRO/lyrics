		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High on the hills with the lonely goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-lay-he-hoo
He yodelled back with the girl and goatherd
Lay-od-lay-od-low

Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodellay, yodallay, yodel-low (yeah)

This is the key that makes us wind up
When the beat comes on, the girls all line up
And the boys all look, but no, they can't touch
But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (she's crazy, right?)
They like the way we react every time we hear the

Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

Wind it up
Wind it up (c'mon)
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

You've got to let the beat get under your skin
You've got to open up and let it all in
But see, once it gets in, the popping begins
Then you find out why all the boys stare
See, they're trying to bite our style
Trying to study our approach
They like the way we do it, so original
I guess that they are slow, so they should leave the room
This beat is for the clubs and cars that go

Every time the bass bangs, realize it calls your name
Let the beat wind you up, and don't stop 'til your time is up
(Get in line now)

Wind it up (whenever you're ready)
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodal-low

(Uh huh) this is your moment
(Uh huh) come on girl, you know you own it
(Uh huh) you know your key is still tick-tocking
(Hell yeah) but you know they're watching
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
Get it girl, get it, get it girl
To the front, to the side, to the back, but don't let him ride
Keep going girl, it's your night
Don't let him steal your light
I know he thinks you're fine and stuff
But does he know how to wind you up? (c'mon)

Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Wind it up
Yodelay, yodelay, yodelay, hey!
