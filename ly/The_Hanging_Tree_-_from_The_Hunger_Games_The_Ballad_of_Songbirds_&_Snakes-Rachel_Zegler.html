		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you, are you comin' to the tree
Where they strung up a man they say murdered three?
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hangin' tree

Are you, are you comin' to the tree
Where the dead man called out for his love to flee?
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hangin' tree

Are you, are you comin' to the tree
Where I told you to run so we'd both be free?
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hangin' tree

Are you, are you comin' to the tree?
Wear a necklace of rope side by side with me
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met up at midnight in the hangin' tree
