		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't keep going at a rate like this
Running for your life when
You're meant to live gotta keep on breathing
There's too many reasons
No, you can't keep going at a rate like this
Burying the past not to deal with it
Feeling so defeated, yeah, yeah
There's too many reasons

To keep onâ€“

Lost my grandad in '07
Still tryna cope to this day
I was wonderin' if he went to heaven, yeah
There ain't nothing I can change
I spent late nights, I was scared to die
I ain't wanna see the grave
I was playing games with my heartbeat instead
Of slowing down just to pray
You've been reachin' for the hand
You thought you'd never grab
But Jesus brings the hope you
Thought you'd never have (Have, have)
Tired of livin' in a nightmare, Lord
I just wanna hear You
Runnin' 'round the same circle don't
Make me feel brand new

You gotta know
It ain't over 'cause you got a hand to hold
Let His peace come rushin' through your soul
Too many reasons for you just to let go
There's hope

You can't keep going at a rate like this
Running for your life when
You're meant to live gotta keep on breathing
There's too many reasons
No, you can't keep going at a rate like this
Burying the past not to deal with it
Feeling so defeated, yeah, yeah
There's too many reasons

To keep on breathing (Oh oh)
Just keep on, keep on breathing (Oh oh, yeah)

We lost PJ, we lost C-Dub and
Lost Lil J to these streets, bruh
Got family members on lockdown
I still pray to God to release them
Put my hope in the Father
All these problems just pushin' me harder
When I feel like I'm ready to fall, I hit
My knees and start cryin' my heart out
Yeah
Shootouts on the corner, Daddy got corona
Trauma singin' us to sleep, yeah
God ain't raised a quitter, this
Is not the ending, we will never be defeated
No, you don't have to fight
These battles on your own god is in control

You gotta know
It ain't over 'cause you got a hand to hold
Let His peace come rushin' through your soul
Too many reasons for you just to let go
There's hope

You can't keep going at a rate like this
Running for your life when
You're meant to live gotta keep on breathing
There's too many reasons
No, you can't keep going at a rate like this
Burying the past not to deal with it
Feeling so defeated, yeah, yeah
There's too many reasons

To keep on breathing (Oh oh, yeah)
Just keep on, keep on breathing (Oh oh)
To keep on breathing (Oh oh)
Just keep on, keep on breathing (Oh oh)
