		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been working ten hours
And your feet are still aching
You tell your friends to come over
To forget about your problems
You say you talked to somebody
He even looks like me
Oh baby, why do you say things
That make me believe?

That you're sorry, you're sorry
But you're not sorry at all
I wonder how could it hurt you
You've got no feelings involved
And then I tell you I want you
And you say nothing at all
You say nothing at all

'Cause I need someone who loves me
And I know it don't come easily
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love
So how am I supposed to let go
When you won't let me let go
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love

And now I'm walking down Sunset
With my feelings on repeat
I wonder what you've been thinking?
Oh, are you thinking about me?

Then you say that you love me
But you don't love me at all
I wonder how could it hurt you
You've got no feelings involved
And then I tell you I want you
And you say nothing at all
And you say nothing at all

'Cause I need someone who loves me
And I know it don't come easily
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love
So how am I supposed to let go
When you won't let me let go
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love
(To feel your love)

You said, "Hey, I just wanna hear your voice"
I said, "Babe, you know that this was your choice"
You said, "Hey, I just wanna hear your voice"
I said, "Babe, you know that this was your choice"
But it means nothing at all

'Cause I need someone who loves me
And I know it don't come easily
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love
So how am I supposed to let go
When you won't let me let go
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love

To feel your love
To feel your love
And maybe I'm just not good enough at all to feel your love
To feel your love
To feel your love
To feel your love
