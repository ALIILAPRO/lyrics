		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watcha playin' in my ear? 
You got a fix of what it is I wanna hear 
Coming through the frequencies 
And the airwaves 

You say I'm acting like a fool 
Hey man, back off, cause you don't look so cool 
With your button down shirt tie smack 
Man your so wack 

Let the music play 
Let the good times roll 
We don't care what you say 
We're turnin' up the radio 

Turn it, turn it, 
Got to get it louder 
Turn it, turn it, 
Let me hear you shout it 
Turn it, turn it, 
Get yourself together 
Turn it, turn it, 
Waking up your neighbor 

Listen as I start my jam 
Tuning into the stations on the stereo 
Don't you dare touch that dial 
'Cause I got style 
(For miles and miles) 

Everybody clap your hands 
Grooving to the way I roll with my rock band 
You know we're gonna turn back time 
To the 80's

Let the music play 
Let the Mohawks grow 

We don't care what you say 
We're turnin up the radio 

Turn it, turn it, 
Got to get it louder 
Turn it, turn it, 
Let me hear you shout it 
Turn it, turn it, 
Get yourself together 
Turn it, turn it, 
Waking up your neighbor 

It's the rock, it's the roll 
It's the pop, it's the soul 
It's the funk the hip-hop 
Oh DJ don't you stop 

It's the hits, it's the flops 
Billie Jean and She Bop 
It's the cream of the crop 
Oh DJ don't you top 
Turn it all the way 

Turnin' turnin' turnin' up the radio

Turn it, turn it, 
Got to get it louder 
Turn it, turn it, 
Let me hear you shout it 
Turn it, turn it, 
Get yourself together 
Turn it, turn it, 
Waking up the neighbor
