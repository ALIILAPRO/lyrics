		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She calls me from the cold
Just when I was low, feeling short of stable
And all that she intends
And all she keeps inside, isn't on the label
She says she's ashamed
And can she take me for awhile?
Can I be a friend, we'll forget the past
Maybe I'm not able
And I break at the bend

We're here and now, but will we ever be again
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

She dreams a champagne dream
Strawberry surprise, pink linen and white paper
Lavender and cream
Fields of butterflies, reality escapes her
She says that love is for fools who fall behind
And I'm somewhere in between
I never really know
A killer from a savior
'Til I break at the bend

We're here and now, but will we ever be again
'Cause I have found
All that shimmers in this world is sure to fade
Away again

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away

It's too far away for me to hold
It's too far away
Guess I'll let it go
