		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Stand by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality

And I'm asking, I'm asking, now love don't fight
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality

We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality

And I'm asking, I'm asking, now love don't fight
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality (reality)
(Reality, reality, reality, reality, reality)
(Reality, reality, reality, reality, reality)
(Reality, reality, reality, reality, reality)
(Reality, reality, reality, reality)

We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality

And I'm asking, I'm asking, now love don't fight
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality

We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
Side by side we follow the light
Don't go back to reality

And I'm asking, I'm asking, now love don't fight
But I know that we both could ignite
We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
(Reality, reality, reality, reality, reality)
(Reality, reality, reality, reality, reality)
We could be the stars out here tonight
Don't go back to reality
