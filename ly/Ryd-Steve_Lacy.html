		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl, I want you to ride with me
Baby, ride on me
Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl, I want you to ride with me
Baby, ride on me

I see the way you lookin' at me through my peripheral
Vision pretty, baby, as I ride on this empty road
I'm just lookin' for somethin' to do
Asked if she was hungry, does she want any food
And she said, "Nah", then she kissed me on my cheek
Next thing I know, she was feelin' on me
And I was in the M-double-O-D
When she said park my car down the backstreet

Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl, I want you to ride with me
Baby, ride on me
Speedin' down the backstreet
I'm tryna get you in my backseat
Girl, I want you to ride with me
Baby, ride on me
