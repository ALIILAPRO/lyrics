		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna see your pom-poms from the stands
Come on, come on

My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump

My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

I saw your game, Forrest
(Well, all eyes are on number forty-four)
I was screaming, "Run forty-four"
But you kept running past the end zone
(He could just be the stupidest son of a bitch alive)
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest? (Sure is fast)
Forrest Gump

My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

Forrest green, Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you
(You, you, oh, you, you) yeah
It's for you, Forrest (no, no, no, no)
(It's you, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
Forrest Gump
