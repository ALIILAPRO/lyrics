		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dont want you
To be no slave
I dont want you
To work all day
But I want you, to be true
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you
ooooo ooooo
Love to you

All I want to do is
Wash your clothes
I dont want to keep
you indoors
There is nothing for you to do
But keep me making love to you
Love to you
oooooo ooooo
Love to you

And I can tell by the way you, walk that walk
I can hear by the way you, talk that talk
And I can know by the way you, treat your girl
That I can give you all the lovin' in the whole wide world

ooooo all I wanna do is make your bread
Just to make sure
Your well fed
I dont want you 
Sad and blue
And I just wanna make love to you
Love to you
oooooo ooooo
Love to you
ooooo

And I can tell by the way you, walk that walk
And I can hear by the way you, talk that talk
And I can know by the way you, treat your girl
That I can give you all lovin' in whole wide world

ooo all I wanna do, all I wanna do is
cook your bread
Just to make sure
your well fed
I dont want you
Sad and blue
And I just wanna make, love to you
Love to you
ooooo yeah
Love to you
oooo
Love to you
