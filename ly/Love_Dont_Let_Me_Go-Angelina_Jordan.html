		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mistake and regrets
Ain't all that I have left
'Cause your touch and your scent's still on my skin
Maybe I'm a fool to erase the trace of you
There's no you, no me
At least that's how I feel

I'm trying to pull you close, closer to me
But it's just like trying to catch smoke

Love, I really wish you had a face
Maybe I could beg for you to stay
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh oh oh
Love, don't let me go

If only I could look you in the eye
There wouldn't be no place for you to hide
I'm on the floor, I'm begging oh oh oh
Love, don't let me go

If you had a heart
I could make it beat for me
If you had a soul
I know where my home would be
It's not about feeling lonely
The man, I just can't forget
And though you're not here beside me
I still see your silhouette

I'm trying to pull you close, closer to me
But it's just like trying to catch smoke

Love, I really wish you had a face
Maybe I could beg for you to stay
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh oh oh
Love, don't let me go

If only I could look you in the eye
There wouldn't be no place for you to hide
I'm on the floor, I'm begging oh oh oh
Love, don't let me go

I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh oh oh
Love, don't let me go
