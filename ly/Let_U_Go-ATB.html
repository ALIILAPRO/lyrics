		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence, never begun
I've been looking for a way to let you know

I got nothing left to fill the spaces
I got nothing but a sentence coming undone
I've been doing circle and did shows

I've been to all the familiar places
I've been running like a sentence, never begun
I've been looking for a way to let you know

I got nothing left to fill the spaces
I got nothing but a sentence coming undone
I've been doing circle and did shows

Every cloud in the sky
Every place that I hide
Tell me that I
I was wrong to let you go

Every sound that I hear
Every thought that I fear
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was wrong to let you go

Let you go, let you go, let you go

It's the little things that make you crazy
Like the flutter of someone touching your skin
I can see you everywhere I go

You could be inside a sea of faces
It could be the rumor of your grin
Swimming in the river as it flows

Every cloud in the sky
Every place that I hide
Tell me that I
I was wrong to let you go

Every sound that I hear
Every thought that I fear
Tell me that I, I was wrong
I was wrong to let you go

Every cloud in the sky
Every sound that I hear
Let you go
