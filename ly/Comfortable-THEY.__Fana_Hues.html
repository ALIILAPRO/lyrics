		  (Ha, ha, ha)
(Yeah)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, yeah, ah)

Never seen yourself fuckin' with somebody like me
I'm gon' show you somethin' better than your wildest dreams
Let's get comfortable (let's get comfortable)
Let's get comfortable
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Know you seen my message (seen my message)
Goin' through a lot, working overtime
Niggas got you stressin' (got you stressin')
I can change that all for you
Tell me, am I over steppin'? (Am I oversteppin'?)
Seem like the type of girl who really like the chase
Let me be aggressive (be aggressive)
'Cause if there's one thing for sure (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I know we don't live forever (yeah)
We might as well get together (yeah, yeah)
I'll let you do whatever that you want to me
I'm exit four off the highway (highway)
Park your car in my driveway
I've been waitin' on it all day

I know you never seen yourself fuckin' with somebody like me
I'm gon' show you somethin' better than your wildest dreams
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I'll make the rules
We can't be rushing a beautiful thing, no
Come get a clue
Timing is everything, over this way
Pressure makes diamonds, I just (I just)
Strengthen my own ways
No, I ain't lyin'
Show me you're better, I'll live for the long haul
I know we don't live forever ('ever)
We might as well get together (together)
I'll let you do whatever that you want to me (whatever)
Take exit four off the highway (highway)
Park my car in your driveway
I've been waitin' on it all day

I know you never seen yourself fuckin' with somebody like me (like me)
I'm gon' show you somethin' better than your wildest dreams
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let's get comfortable (oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Can we slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down?
Ooh (yeah), ooh-ooh (yeah)
Can we slow it down, slow it down (just)
Slow it down, slow it down, slow it down?
Slow it down, slow it down for me (yeah)
Ooh-oh, ooh, for me
Can you slow it down, slow it down
Slow it down, slow it down for me?
(Yeah)
