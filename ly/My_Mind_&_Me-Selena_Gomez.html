		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna hear a part to my story? I tried to hide in the glory
And sweep it under the table so you would never know
Sometimes I feel like an accident, people look when they're passin'
And never check on the passenger, they just want the free show

Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see

My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now 
If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now
My mind and me

It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden
Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurtin' 
Will be a little more certain they're not the only one lost

Yeah, I'm constantly
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see

My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now 
If somebody sees me like this, then they won't feel alone now
My mind and me

Ah, ah, ah
My mind and me
Ah, ah, ah 
My mind, my mind
My mind and me
Ah, ah, ah
My mind and me
Ah, ah, ah
Ooh, it's only my mind and me
My mind and me
