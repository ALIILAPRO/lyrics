		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love

I will never leave your side, my love
Standing right beside you is enough
Call on me if you feel any pain
Call to me, I'll run to you again
You can count on me
And I can count on you
You show up like I show up
And I'll keep showing up for you

So take my hand, don't be afraid
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Swear you're safe, this too shall pass
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together

Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love

I will never leave your side, my love
Standing right beside you is enough
You can count on me, uh-huh
And I can count on you
You show up for me, I show up for you
And I'll keep showing up for you

So take my hand, don't be afraid
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Swear you're safe, this too shall pass
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together

Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
And we'll get through it all together
We'll get through it all together
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
Let's love
