		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  C'mon, c'mon
Yeah
Can you feel me?
(Baby, can you feel me?)
I've got something to say
Check it out

For all this time
I've been lovin' you, girl
Oh, yes I have
And ever since the day you left me here alone
I've been trying to find
Oh, the reason why

So if I did something wrong, please tell me
I wanna understand
'Cause I don't want this love to ever end
And I swear

If you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
Oh yeah (back into my life)
And I swear
I'll keep you right by my side
'Cause baby you're the one I want (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yes you are (back into my life)

I watched you go
You've taken my heart with you
Oh, yes you did
Every time I tried to reach you on the phone
Baby, you're never there
Girl, you're never home

So if I did something wrong, please tell me
I wanna understand
'Cause I don't want this love to ever end
No, no, no, no, I swear

If you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yeah (back into my life)
And I swear
I'll keep you right by my side
'Cause baby you're the one I want (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yes you are (back into my life)

Maybe I didn't know how to show it (how to show it)
And maybe I didn't know what to say (what to say)
This time I won't disguise (won't disguise)
Then we can build our lives
Then we can be as one (be as one)
I swear

If you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me)
Oh yeah (back into my life)
And I swear
I'll keep you right by my side (by my side)
'Cause baby you're the one I want (back to me, back to me)
Oh, yes you are (back into my life)
And I swear

If you come back in my life
I'll be there 'til the end of time (back to me, back to me) 
Come back to me (back into my life), come back into my life
And I swear
I'll keep you right by my side (by my side)
'Cause baby you're the one I want
