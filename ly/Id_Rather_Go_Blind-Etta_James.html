		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something told me it was over (yeah)
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "Cry girl" (cry, cry)
When I saw you and that girl, walking now

Ooh, I would rather, I would rather go blind boy
Than to see you, walk away from me child, no

Ooh, so you see, I love you so much
That I don't want to watch you leave me babe
Most of all, I just don't
I just don't want to be free no, ooh ooh 

I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace, yeah
When the reflection in the glass 
That I held to my lips now baby (yeah, yeah)
Revealed the tears that was on my face, yeah, ooh

And babe, baby (baby, baby, baby) I'd rather
I'd rather be blind boy 
Than to see you walk away, see you walk away from me, yeah, ooh
Baby, baby, baby (baby, baby, bay) 
I'd rather be blind now
