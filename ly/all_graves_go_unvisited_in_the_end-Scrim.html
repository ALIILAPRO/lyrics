		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Had people fuck me over I woulda never thought
Fucking this bitch I told her choke me 'til she choke me out
Need to be punished, need to be hurt 'til it's out my heart
Take that emotional pain turn it to a bunch of scars
Feel like I'm not worthy for nobody
Every month my dad remind me
How I broke a bunch of promises
When I was on all kinda shit
I done paid his house, done paid his cards
Gave him a car I couldn't afford
Bought mom a car, bought Slim a car
G need that cash for his little boy

But this shit hurt, fuck, yeah
Tryna show my younger brothers they gotta put in work, yeah, yeah
I can try to give 'em the world but I can't give self-worth, nah, yeah
I know that pain, pop it away 'til it gets way past percs, yeah, yeah
Wishing it worked

Now what's right don't always feel good
Trauma I done endured
Gotta hear it when I sing to 'em
Feel this ain't gonna end good
Just wanna end these problems
Think about it way too often, yeah
Too scared to get close to these bitches
So I run 'em off
Most the time can't even fuck 'cause my dick too soft
Don't know if it's meds or it's my head or if they turn me off
If we gone do this, fuck me rough and let me hit it raw
Had this girl come into my life I think I'm falling for her
Feel like she love me for me but hey I've been wrong before
Told her my flaws, showed her the closet to my hidden bones
Trying my hardest to be honest without sabotage
Don't know if I'll ever be a father
If I should even bother
How do I raise a kid?
Still tryna help my father
Still stuck in a delusion
These boundaries so confusing
Can't bring myself to do it
No more shooting up solutions

I still ride 'til the Lord come calling on me
Like fuck withdrawals I rather OD
Like fuck these pills won't put me to sleep
Ready to trade, these mills for a bit of peace

Miss my my grandma, miss my grandpa, fuck, I miss 'em all
Hope they understand I love 'em just a little lost
Hope they proud that I'm something, stunting like a boss
When they see me face-to-face I know they see the cost

And I just wanna end these problems, yeah, yeah, yeah
Think about it way too often, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
