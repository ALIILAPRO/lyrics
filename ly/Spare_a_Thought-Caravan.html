		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When it's all over 
You come to look back
Will you be there

Will you remember
After this time
Will you still care

Will you think twice about
Stand up and shout
It all means to you

The lows and the highs
That fear in their eyes
What more could you do

It will never ever, ever be the same
Till we get back on our feet again
Spare a thought for for the friends we had
Who never quite made it through
This is our song for you
We can never, ever, thank you all enough
You never failed and still remained so tough
So spare a thought for the ones who tried
And never gave up the ghost
This time you deserve the most

All those people who denied
Sure are interesting times
I just can't believe
I still can't conceive
How on earth we will survive

Will we have learned from this
When we return
Fragile we are
Who would have thought 
Something so small
Could come for us all
Gotta do everything
Soon as we can
Whatever the cost
We owe it to those
Try to get back
Time that we lost

It will never, ever, ever be the same
Till we get back on our feet again
So spare a thought for the friends we had
Who never quite made it through
This is our song for you
