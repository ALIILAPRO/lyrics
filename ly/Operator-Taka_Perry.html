		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was lost, I had no way out
Can't control my impulsive tendencies
You're my love, but you seem so far
Glowing up 
Better now with the lights off!

I call you up, but you won't pick up
Operator, connect my frequency
Need to know, where you're at right now
Taking off

I don't know if I should fall for you
Take of your mask for me
It don't matter girl, baby you're my masterpiece
I don't know if I should fall for you
Take of your mask for me
It don't matter girl, baby you're my masterpiece

I was lost, I had no way out
Felt your waves of evolving chemistry
Broke my walls, everything was art
Oh my god, never felt this way before

I call you up, but you won't pick up
Operator, connect my frequency
Need to know, where you're at right now
Taking off
Better now with the lights off!

I don't know if I should fall for you
I don't know if I should fall for you
Baby you're my masterpiece, baby you're my masterpiece

I don't know if I should fall for you
Take of your mask for me
It don't matter girl, baby you're my masterpiece
I don't know if I should fall for you
Take of your mask for me
It don't matter girl, baby you're my masterpiece

Take of your mask for me
It don't matter girl, baby you're my masterpiece
Take of your mask for me
It don't matter girl, baby you're my masterpiece
