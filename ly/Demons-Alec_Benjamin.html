		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end

Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm

Well, at first I thought I'd have to bear this weight by myself
But when my knees were getting weak and I was in need of help
You were there to take away the pain that I felt, mhm
You're the only one that gave me hope
You're the only one who really knows

I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm

For a moment I thought maybe I was doing alright
So I took your love for granted and I left you behind
And I just didn't understand, you kept me alive, mhm
You forgave me and you gave me hope
Still you're the only one who really knows

I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm

It's you, you pull me through it on the days when I have doubts
Even when I turned my back on you, you never let me down
And even when I hit the bottom, no, you didn't let me drown
No, no, no

I've got all these demons hiding underneath
Nobody can see them, nobody but me, and you're the reason
The only thing that keeps me from diving off the deep end
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm
Because I've got all these demons, demons, demons, mhm
