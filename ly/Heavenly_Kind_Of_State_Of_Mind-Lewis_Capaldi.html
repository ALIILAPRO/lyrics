		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's almost cruel, the blue in your eyes
The kind of blasphemy that makes a congregation cry
When I'm with you, it's like nothing else
Like I could run and tell the devil to go fuck himself

Oh, Lord, I ain't afraid to die if it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now until the afterlife
Be it rain, or hail, or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save me from above
Or the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels could sing
Now I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

You bring me peace that I'd never find
There's only chaos when I'm left here to my own device
To tell the truth, I think you saved my life
Giving my heart over to you would be no sacrifice

Oh, Lord, I ain't afraid to die if it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now until the afterlife
Be it rain, or hail, or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save me from above
Or the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels could sing
Now I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

And I feel the rapture when I'm looking at ya
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You're the only reason that I keep believing
Oh, what a heavenly kind

Darling, you were heaven-sent to save me from above
You're the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels could sing
Now I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

And I feel the rapture when I'm looking at ya
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You're the only reason that I keep believing
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
