		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drive boy, dog boy, dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy
She was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy
And tears boy and all in your inner space boy
You had hand girls boy and steel boy
You had chemicals boy, I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just grown boy
She said come over, come over
She smiled at you, boy

Drive boy, dog boy, dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy
She was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy
And tears boy and all in your inner space boy
You had hand girls boy and steel boy
You had chemicals boy, I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just grown boy
She said come over, come over
She smiled at you, boy

Let your feelings slip boy
But never your mask boy
Random blonde bio high density rhythm
Blonde boy, blonde country, blonde high density
You are my drug boy, you're real boy
Speak to me and boy dog, dirty numb cracking boy
You get wet boy, big big time boy, acid bear boy
Babes and babes and babes and babes and babes
And remembering nothing boy
You like my tin horn boy and get wet like an angel
Derail

You got a velvet mouth
You're so succulent and beautiful
Shimmering and dirty wonderful and hot times
On your telephone line and God and everything
On your telephone and in walk an angel

And look at me 
Your mom squatting pissed in a tube-hole at Tottenham Court Road
I just come out of the ship
Talking to the most blonde I ever met
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, mega, mega, white thing
Mega, mega, white thing
Mega, mega, white thing
Mega, mega
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Mega, mega, white thing
Mega, mega, white thing
So many things to see and do in the tube hole true
Blonde going back to Romford
Mega, mega, mega, going back to Romford
Hi mom are you having fun
And now are you on your way
To a new tension headache
