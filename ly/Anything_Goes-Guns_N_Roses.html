		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been thinkin' 'bout
Thinkin' 'bout sex
Always hungry for somethin'
That I haven't had yet
Well maybe baby, you got somethin' to lose
Well I got somethin'
I got somethin' for you

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes

Panties round your knees
With your ass in debris
Doing that grind
With a push and a squeeze
Tied up, tied down
Up against the wall
Be my rubbermade baby
And we can do it all

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight
My way, your way
Anything goes tonight

My way, your way
Anything goes tonight, tonight
Tonight
Anything goes tonight, whoa

Anything goes tonight
