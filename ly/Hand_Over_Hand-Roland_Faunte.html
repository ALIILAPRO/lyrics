		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
Little love
Hold me down
I've had enough

Oh
Falling fast and screaming loud
I'm finding ways to drown it out
I'm hoping you can hold me down

People change
Start falling in and out of pairs
For now it all just really hurts
And I need you to hold my hand

Little love
I'm lost and might be never found
I'm hoping you can help me out

Gone
A fallen face among the crowd
I'm losing at the speed of sound
I'm hoping you can hold me down

All the same
I'm a broken ship without a sail
And nothing really seems to work
So I need you to hold me like when

We
Went walking through backyards
Asking what is in store for us
Just looking around

Cause right there
I was above it all
My back up against a wall
My lips on your brow
Hey baby you can hold me down

Oh
Little love
I'm searching for a plot of ground
I know that you can calm me down

Broken boy
Yet to find a way around
A dark and ever-growing cloud
That has him always looking down

Her voice is like a morning sun
Her touch is like a burning flare
The hope that hides inside the cloud
Returns to me when she is there

I was climbing up out of a well
While we were

Getting lost in the pillows
Feeling fine and then getting sicker
There you were
But where was I
Just hold me close baby hold me high

Finding warmth
Beneath the covers
When I had nothing we still had each other

We were alone
Outside of time
So hold me close while I start to climb

Hand over hand over hand...

My little love
I wanna leave
Turn out the lights
And be at ease

I feel I live
Along the brim
Of giving up
And giving in

So hear me now
Without mistake
In case I falter and I break

Without a doubt
Let me be clear
You are the reason
I'm still here
