lyrics
Verse 1:
Took it one step closer
Ain't no going back
You're my full time lover boy
They don't know bout that
Now I'm in my feelings
Never be the same
There's not too many people who get me that way
That way
Pre:
And oh-
It's a real good love it's too hard to take it slow
You got roots in my heart like a grapevine we gon' grow
And I know at the end of the day that
I don't know
Where we go
All I know
Chorus:
Is you're the water of my life
You're the essence of my tribe
Never known love this true
I know that
113 with you
I can't believe my eyes
That you were meant to be mine
Never known love this true
I know that
113 with you
I do I do I x3
I know that
113 with you
Verse 2:
I love you like you love Liverpool
When you call me mon amour
One look in your eyes I go dumb
Make my heart go rum pum pum pam
You make me fall
Fall deep like ocean floors
Down the window to our universe
It's just the two of us
The two of us
Pre:
And oh-
It's a real good love it's too hard to take it slow
You got roots in my heart like a grapevine we gon' grow
And I know at the end of the day that
I don't know
Where we go
All I know
Chorus:
Is you're the water of my life
You're the essence of my tribe
Never known love this true
I know that
113 with you
I can't believe my eyes
That you were meant to be mine
Never known love this true
I know that
113 with you
I do I do I x3
I know that
113 with you
Bridge:
Lock it
We keep it in pocket
Every day or night or night yeah my baby he be on it
He be on it on it on it
He be on it on it on it
X2
(Chorus)
