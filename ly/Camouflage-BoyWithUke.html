		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Promise me, promise me
You won't try to leave
Fall asleep, fall asleep
Hiding in my dreams
Camouflage, camouflage
Just where I hide my thoughts
Sabotage, sabotage
You know what I'm not

It always starts with my heart, I can feel it go
Skip two beats, a few days, few weeks
I get obsessed, I get stressed, feel the weight, on my chest
It's too much to bear, I don't wanna care, so I wear

Camouflage, camouflage
It's how I hide my thoughts for you
I feel so awful when I run
But it's harder knowing that you weren't the one

It's like a fire in my throat, I can barely speak
Every single breath
Babe, it burns, and it hurts, and you're making it worse
But I want to see you again

Camouflage, camouflage
It's how I hide my thoughts for you
I feel so awful when I run
But it's harder knowing that you weren't the one

I say it all the time
Falling in and out of line
I'm running far, baby
I'm a superstar, maybe in another life
We gon' make it out alive
We're counting stars
Say we had it from the start

Camouflage, camouflage
It's how I hide my thoughts for you
I feel so awful when I run
But it's harder knowing that you weren't the one

(You were the one for me, it's true)
(I feel lonely without you)
(You were the only one)
(The only one I'd choose)
