		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me, I'm rising so high
Out of my mind, so let it rain over me

Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me

A billion's the new million
Voli's the new vodka
Forty is the new thirty
And baby you're a rock star

Dale veterana, que tú sabes
Más de la cuenta, no te hagas
Teach me baby or better yet
Freak me baby, yes, yes

I'm freaky baby I'ma make sure that your peach feels peachy baby
No bullshit broads, I like my women sexy classy sassy
Powerful yes, they love to get the middle, nasty ow
This ain't a game you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale muñequita ahora ahí, and let it rain over me

Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me, I'm rising so high
Out of my mind, so let it rain over me

Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me

A billion's the new million
Bodi's the new vodka
Land's the new majority, ya tú sabes
Next step la Casa Blanca
No hay carro, no' vamos en balsa

Mami you know the drill, they won't know what I got 'til they read the will
I ain't try, I ain't trying to keep it real
I'm trying to keep wealth and that's for real

Pero mira que tú 'tás buena, y mira que tú 'tás dura
Baby no me hables más, y tíramelo mami chula
No games you'll see, you can put the blame on me
Dale muñequita ahora ahí, and let it rain over me

Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me, I'm rising so high
Out of my mind, so let it rain over me

Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me

Mr worldwide, Marc Anthony, tú sabes
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three

Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh
I was playing with her, she was playing with me
Next thing you know, we were playing with three
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh, rain over me

Girl my body don't lie, I'm outta my mind
Let it rain over me, I'm rising so high
Out of my mind, so let it rain over me

Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay let it rain over me
