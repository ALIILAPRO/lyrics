		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna dance till the morning light
I gotta place we can go if you're feeling the vibe
Out on the run we can make this right
All I need is your love for the night

I'm the key you're my ignition
The feeling that I'm missing
All I need is your permission
To make loving you my mission
Last call is the beginning 
We'll leave the city limits
As long as you're here with me
Baby girl I'm winning

All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side
All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side

All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side
All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side

I'm the key you're my ignition
The feeling that I'm missing
All I need is your permission
To make loving you my mission
Last call is the beginning 
We'll leave the city limits
As long as you're here with me
Baby girl I'm winning


Nothing to lose 
If you're really about it
Don't gotta doubt it baby
We can cruise
Baby I want it
Just for the moment

Yeah

All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side
All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side

All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side
All I need 
All I need 
Is your love tonight
All I see 
All I see
Is you by my side
