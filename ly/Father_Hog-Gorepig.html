		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hang them high
Let their innards spill
Nowhere to run when they open the gates
YOU BITCH
Strangled and mangled
Suspended from a meat hook
Poking and prodding
Let me dig a little deeper
How does it feel to be prey to a predator
What a sweet face, it's a shame that I'll tear it up
Hunger of swine, blood-thirsty savages
Pray for your home as we march to ravage it
RUN FOR YOUR LIVES
OR BOW TO THE FATHER
Blood and bone under the hoof of a tyrant
Break their souls, a nightmare that's so vibrant
Burn their home, leave them nothing but ashes
Behold the throne built on feasting on masses
How does it feel to be prey to a predator
What a sweet face, it's a shame that I'll tear it up
Oh, Father
There will be no peace
Oh, Father
Slaughter all the weak
KILL, KILL, KILL THEM ALL
Leave them nothing, let them fall
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK THEM ALL
Lay waste to them fucking all
