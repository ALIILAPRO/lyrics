		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Christina Milian
Poli Paul
Spen Cow, baby

Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When it's a good boy
I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"

You getting bold, it's growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's time
And your thinkin' of leavin' but give it time
It's late at night, he's coming home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hair, let him know what's on
If you understand me, y'all, come on

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (show her what you got, daddy)

All my ladies wind it up
If you know just how to move
All my fellas jump behind
And show her what you want to do (ooh)

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"

We can move if you wanna
We can move if you wanna
We can move if you wanna
We can move

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"

Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thing
I'ma show you how to make your man say, "oh"
