		  (Look at me)

So
We'll keep it on the ground right there next to our clothes
Do what you want to me, nobody gotta know
You know I'm really good at puttin' on a show
Not so fast, I think we need to slow down
Oh, baby, pay attention, listen to my voice
Pick your position, baby, I'll give you the choice
I know you like it 'cause you're makin' all that noise
Oh

The way you look at me when you're on your knees
Girl, let me see those eyes
Oh, baby, say my name right to my face
You know just what I like

Red
Your lips are kissin' on my neck down to my chest
I grab your shoulders, flip you over, you know where I'm going
Hold onto my hair, girl, go ahead
I'm gonna make you feel so damn crazy

The way you look at me when you're on your knees
Girl, let me see those eyes
Oh, baby, say my name right to my face
You know just what I like
