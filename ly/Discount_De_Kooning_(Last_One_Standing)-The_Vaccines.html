		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing
I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing

I've been thinking about all the times you used to fill my streets
Until I got deserted like I'm boarded up with nowhere to eat
Maybe I'm looking for a Willem De Kooning at the discount store
I would buy anything, try anything, take anything to feel some more
It's gonna eat me up, it's gonna eat me up

So maybe we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing
I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing

Even if the song's all gone and it's the end of the world
No, nothing's gonna stop us, gonna stop us now
So we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing on and on

Started filling up the cracks in the calendar with discontent
Double checking junk to see where the apologies went
The best thing that I had since records began
I would do anything, take anything, I'm so Machiavellian
It's gonna eat me up, it's gonna eat me up

Don't know what I'll do now my luck is all spent
And I wish I had you here, tell me what it all meant
To get to grips, serenading the apocalypse

But maybe we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing
I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing

Even if the song's all gone and it's the end of the world
No, nothing's gonna stop us, gonna stop us now
So we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing on and on

I've tried to move on but nothing compares
I'm ready for anything, I'm not going anywhere
I'm playing it cool but I'm so damn scared
And I'm ready for anything, I'm not going anywhere

So maybe we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing
I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing

Even if the song's all gone and it's the end of the world
No, nothing's gonna stop us, gonna stop us now
So we should keep on dancing
Maybe we should keep on dancing on and on

I feel like something good is gonna happen
Don't care if I'm the last one standing
