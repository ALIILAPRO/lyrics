		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

Yeah, I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah you know word of mouth
The square root of sixty nine is eight something, right?
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, ow
Good weed, white wine, uh
I come alive in the night time, yeah
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio, oh
Let it play, say you gotta leave
But I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl
Say my name, say my name
Wear it out, it's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go, the text that I write is gon' say

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

Not everybody
Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But boy you stay up on it
You got the something
That keeps me so off balance
Baby you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent

Hey boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy, to take it over
Looking for a guy, to put in work uh
Ooh, ooh

Hey boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy, to take it over
Looking for a guy, to put in work uh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

Baby you got me
IT ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me, yeah
So I surrender, to every word you whisper
Every door you enter, I will let you in

Hey boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy, to take it over
Looking for a guy, to put in work uh
Ooh, ooh

You're so amazing
You took the time to figure me out
That's why you take me
Way past the point of turning me on
You 'bout to break me
I swear you got me losing my mind

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?

Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
Ooh na na, what's my name?
What's my name? What's my name?

Hey boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy, to take it over
Looking for a guy, to put in work uh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Hey boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh na na na na
I need a boy, to take it over
Looking for a guy, to put in work uh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
