		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold on tight for this lesson
Sexual heaven
Level eleven
Passion, affection
Plus no deception
Lay in my arms
We'll dance in the dark
Lay down and then arch
You pull me tight
Holding for your life
Breathing intertwined
As we motorbike
It's different, baby
It's different, baby
It's different, baby
We make love different, baby
We're special, baby
We're special, baby
We're special, baby
Our love is special, baby
Our love is special
Our love is special
Our love is special
Our love is special
Stayed up all night
Stayed up all night
Then you arrived
Then you arrived
And changed the whole room
With just your eyes
Let's take this far
We both know who we are
There is no pressure
No pressure
There is no pressure
No pressure
Hold on tight for what's next
Tell the world that you're mine
Tell them with your whole chest
From north to the east
Then South to the West
Just stare in my eyes
I'll stare at your heart
It's only the start
You pull me tight
And it feels so right
Demons intertwined
We're in this for life
Its different, baby
Its different, baby
Its different, baby
We make love different, baby
We're special, baby
We're special, baby
We're special, baby
Our love is special, baby
Our love is special
Our love is special
Our love is special
Our love is special
