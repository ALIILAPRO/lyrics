		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forever, forever, forever and ever
Forever, forever, forever and ever

Yeah, the universe is one big place
It's hard to cut through all the noise
And people tell you just to play it safe
Like you don't even have a choice

I don't know how to belong out here
I don't need to be somebody to some
One day I know that I'll disappear
So while I'm here

I run the red lights just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high, not even touching the wheel
Drinking the moonlight, and the heaven I feel
Goes on forever and ever and ever
I run the red lights just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high, not even touching the wheel
Drinking the moonlight, and the heaven I feel
Goes on forever and ever and ever

Forever, forever, forever and ever
Forever, forever, forever and ever

Know that I am just a drop in the ocean
But I would rather be the waves flowing in and out
To somewhere that I'm the first to go, yeah
What people only dream about

I don't know how to belong out here
I don't need to be somebody to some
One day I know that I'll disappear
So while I'm here

I run the red lights just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high, not even touching the wheel
Drinking the moonlight, and the heaven I feel
Goes on forever and ever and ever
I run the red lights just to see how it feels
Waving my hands high, not even touching the wheel
Drinking the moonlight, and the heaven I feel
Goes on forever and ever and ever

Forever, forever, forever and ever
Forever, forever, forever and ever
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Forever, forever, forever and ever
Forever, forever, forever and ever
