		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, when you called it quits
You coulda done it right
You coulda left this town out of it
When you said goodbye

You ruined everything I love
Ripped my heart right out my chest
Girl, it's like there ain't nothing left

You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

Can't hit that corner bar
Can't even ride them roads
Don't know my way around this place
I can't see through the smoke

Piled up every memory
Yeah, you took the good with all the bad
Why'd you have to strike that match

And set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire
You set my world on fire

Ain't nothing left for me
In this old nothing town
Guess all we'll be is ashes on the ground

So, I watch it burn, burn, burn on down
Ain't nothing I can hold on to right now
You set my

You set my world on fire
Yeah, it's all long gone
I'm watching flames get higher
And I can't move on
I just gotta let it burn, burn, burn on down
Girl, without you it don't turn, turn, turn around
You set my world on fire (oh-oh)
You set my world on fire (you set my world on fire)
You set my world on fire (yeah)
You set my world on fire (oh)
You set my world on fire
