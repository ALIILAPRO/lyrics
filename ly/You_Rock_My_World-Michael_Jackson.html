		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that
Ay, uh, uh, whoa, whoa
Whoa

My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

It feels so right (girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (like I)
Have finally found the perfect love this time (see)
And I finally found, come on, girl

You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine? (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (girl)
And everything I own I give (come on, girl)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine?

In time I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do (oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh) 

Who'd think that I (oh)
Finally found the perfect love 
I searched for all my life? (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find (whoa, oh, oh)
Such a perfect love 
That's awesomely so right? (Whoa, girl)

You rocked my world, you know you did (come on, come on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (you rocked my world, girl)
Someone like you to call mine? (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (you rocked my world)
And everything I own I give (girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine? (Girl)
You rocked my world, you know you did (oh)
And everything I own I give (you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine?
You rocked my world (oh), you know you did
And everything I own I give (to rock my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine?

And girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic's all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

You rocked my world (you rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (look what you did to me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (yeah, yeah, you, you, you, you)
Someone like you to call mine? (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (I cannot explain)
And everything I own I give ('cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (whoa)
Someone like you to call mine?
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (you, you, you, you did)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (see, it's you and me)
Someone like you to call mine? (And you, me)
You rocked my world, you know you did (know you did, baby)
And everything I own I give ('cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (hoo, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine?

You rocked my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me (you, you, you, you)
You rocked my world, you know you did
(Give it to me) (you and me)
(Yeah, yeah, you, you, yeah, and me, yeah, hoo)
You rocked my world you know you did (you rocked my world)
(You rocked my world) You rocked my world
(You rocked my world) You rocked my world (you, you, me)

(Come on, girl) You rocked my world, you know you did (come on, girl)
And everything I own I give (baby, baby, baby)
The rarest, love who'd think I'd find (and you, yeah, and me)
Someone like you to call mine? (You, me, and you, me hoo)
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (you rocked my world, hoo)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (you rocked my world, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine (yeah, yeah)
