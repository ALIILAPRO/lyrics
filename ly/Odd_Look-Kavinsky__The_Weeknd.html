		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
(Said) said nothing will never be, ever be the same when you're finished
I freed a couple souls, just yesterday, oh yeah

I had a good girl in my room
No tats on her skin, I put work all in her purse
She got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same every fucking where that I've been
All you girls try to be saints, I'll make you all wanna sin
Well, you can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper-planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, then I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck, baby
I can tell you're from a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, oh yeah
Ooh, no

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
(Said) said nothing will never be, ever be the same when you're finished
I freed a couple souls, just yesterday, oh-oh baby, ooh

Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh, girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life
Little life, little life, oh yeah
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
'Cause if you did, this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game baby, woo
Said nothing will never be, ever be the same when you're finished
I freed a couple souls, just yesterday baby, ooh-ooh
