		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders and wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
You see, you've got to feel it in your bones
Ah-ah
