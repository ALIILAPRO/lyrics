		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up bored
Outside the window there's a storm cloud above a crowd of one of me
You say
You wanna make it better
But you can't change the weather so just let me be

Hello
You wanna dress me up in yellow
Wipe my mouth and feed me jello, caramello
Maybe another time I'll say what's on my mind, just let me lie

I'm fine I'm fine
I'm fine I'm fine
Just let me lie sometimes

Radio's on
And I'm addicted to the static in my mind
It's alright
I don't wanna socialize, I don't wanna be polite tonight

Hello
You wanna dress me up in yellow
Wipe my mouth and feed me jello, caramello
Maybe another time I'll say what's on my mind, just let me lie

I'm fine I'm fine
I'm fine I'm fine
Just let me lie sometimes

You wanna make me a parrot it's apparent I can't bear it and I swear it
I'm a horse without a carrot and I'm staring at the wall did it fall 
I can't see the point at all watch me crawl into my room

Hello
You wanna dress me up in yellow
Wipe my mouth and feed me jello, caramello
Maybe another time I'll say what's on my mind, just let me lie

I'm fine I'm fine
I'm fine I'm fine
Just let me lie sometimes
