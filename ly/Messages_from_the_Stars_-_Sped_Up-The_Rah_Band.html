		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello
Do you read me?
I have a message
A message from the stars
Hello  hello....

I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

When I'm out there all alone
And feeling far from home
I'm fading into blue
And there's nothing I can do

Then out of the sky
Like a flash sending me high high high
You rescue me
You save me from a certain tragedy

I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

When I'm far out in the night
And searching for the light
There's darkness all around
And you're nowhere to be found

Then out of the sky
Like a flash sending me high high high
You rescue me
You save me from a certain tragedy

I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

Hello
Do you read me?
I have a message
A message from the stars
Hello  hello....

I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

I get messages from the stars
When you're making love to me
I get messages from the stars
You must be from another galaxy

Baby!
