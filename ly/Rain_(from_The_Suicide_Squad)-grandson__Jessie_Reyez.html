		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do not mind the rain sometimes
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
That's the only way the roses bloom

It's okay, I'm not okay
I feel the disarray of yesterday
Oh my
I need to feel the raindrops on my head, on my head
(Ooh)
I know I know nothing so (know nothing so)
Embrace what I cannot control
Oh my
Trouble walks beside me 'til my head, 'til my head
(Ooh)

I do not mind the rain sometimes (the rain)
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
'Cause that's the only way that the roses bloom

Ya, ya
It's better to have loved and lost
But
The feeling it comes at the cost
Oh my
My poor heart is my only friend, only friend
And I've come to love a heavy sky (heavy sky)
The lighting couldn't beat my shine
Oh my
Trouble walks beside me 'til my end, 'til my end
(Ooh)

I do not mind the rain sometimes 
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
'Cause that's the only way that the roses bloom

Hand on my heart
I swear I made peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Now I dance with the pain
Yeah
Hand on my heart
I swear I made peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Peace with the rain (peace with the rain)
Now I slow dance with the pain
('Cause that's when roses bloom)

(Roses)
(Roses)
(Roses)

(That's when the roses bloom)

I do not mind the rain sometimes
'Cause that's the only way the roses bloom
In my mind, when I cry, when I cry
'Cause that's the only way (that the roses bloom)
That's the only way that the roses bloom
