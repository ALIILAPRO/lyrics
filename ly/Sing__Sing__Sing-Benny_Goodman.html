		  Sing, sing, sing, sing everybody start to sing like dee dee dee, bah bah bah dah
Now you're singin' with a swing
Sing sing sing, sing, everybody start to sing like dee dee dee, bah bah bah dah
Now you're singin' with a swing.

When the music goes around,
Everybody's goes go to town.
But here is one thing you should know
Sing sing sing sing everybody start to sing like dee dee dee, bah bah bah dah
Now you're singin with a swing

Swing swing swing swing, listen to the trumpet swing
Blow blow blow blow, listen to the trombones go

Everybody's goes go to town.
But here is one thing you should know

When the music goes around, everybody goes to town

Start singing, keep swinging
Now you're singing with a swing
