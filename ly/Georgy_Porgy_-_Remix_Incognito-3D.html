		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Just think how long I've known you
It's wrong for me to own you, lock and key
It's really not confusing
I'm just the young illusion, can't you see?

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry

It's not your situation
I just need contemplation over you
I'm not so systematic
It's just that I'm an addict for your love

I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only girl
I'm not the only one that holds you
I never ever should have told you
You're my only world

Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry

Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy Porgy, pudding pie
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them high

Georgy, yeah, Porgy, yeah
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Georgy, yeah, Porgy
Kissed the girls and made them cry
Kissed the girls and made them cry
