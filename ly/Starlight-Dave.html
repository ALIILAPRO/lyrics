		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death
Five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

I do know my man but I don't trust him
Trust that, P's in the trap, disgusting
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA
Kiss that in public
South London, where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags
Two in the blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastime
'Nough pollution in the ends, I flew back yard 'cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrean, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress still gonna impress
I know them man talk on the kid but

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death
Five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

Any girl that I'm dating knows
Bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day
Public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
And put 'em down under, Sydney
That's bait, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know them man talk on the kid but

It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin'
Enough man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death
Five-five, eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts and the ring
But don't help in the gym?
'Nough girls dating their biggest haters
How her boyfriend don't want her to win?
Like reh
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there? 
(Fly, fly me to the moon) Yeah, yeah
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace (let me see what spring is like on Jupiter, Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste
Hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, serving face (in other words, hold my hand)
Hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer badge, she tone and tan (in other words)
Free my gang, 013's and 020's (darlin, kiss me)
Oh, God knows I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might

Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
Well, in other words, I love you
