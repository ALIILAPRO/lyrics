		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate waking up in an empty bed
I'm only capable of looking through my pictures of you
Got nothing better to do

Call all you want, I'll never let it ring
I'm in the best restaurant
Haven't had a bite of the food
I only wanna eat you

I don't really like to brag about it
But it's true

Nobody does it like you do (you do, you do, you do)
Nothing beats being under you (you do, you do, you do)
Marks on my back, I wonder who (you do, you do, you do)
Would understand what I go through? (you do, you do, you do)
Got your hands around my neck
Mama, keep it in check
What do you want done to you?

I don't believe in forcing conversations
Honest, I'd rather be in your heavy rotation
Than a guest list, paper wrist
Story that you tell to your friends

I don't remember how it started
But I think I'm pretty sure I know how tonight will end

Nobody does it like you do (you do, you do, you do)
Nothing beats being under you (you do, you do, you do)
Marks on my back, I wonder who (you do, you do, you do)
Would understand what I go through? (you do, you do, you do)
Got your hands around my neck
Mama, keep it in check
What do you want done to you?

I'll take that tension off your shoulders
Teach me a lesson, take me over
No, I don't really like to brag about it
But it's true

Nobody does it like you do (you do, you do, you do)
Like you do (you do, you do, you do)
Marks on my back, I wonder who (you do, you do, you do)
Would understand what I go through? (you do, you do, you do)
Got your hands around my neck
Mama, keep it in check
What do you want done to you?
