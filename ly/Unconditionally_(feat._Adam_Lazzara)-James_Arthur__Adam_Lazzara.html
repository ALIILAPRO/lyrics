		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said, "It's all your fault"
I said, "It always is"
She sang my favorite song
But with a little twist
Her lipstick, your collar, don't bother, angel
I know exactly what goes on
I know exactly what goes on

She said, I'm walking out this time
I've been waiting all my life
Did it ever cross your mind
Just what you do? Oh
All you ever had to see
Was love me unconditionally

And I won't go
I won't leave 'til it's over
No, I won't go
Until hell freezes over
And I'll be yours
And you'll be my supernova
Oh, darling, why was it so hard to see?
Just love me unconditionally

And after all your flaws
I'll still stay in this
There's no Santa Claus
I know he don't exist
Her lipstick, your collar, don't bother, angel
I know exactly what goes on
I know exactly what goes on

She said, I'm walking out this time
I've been waiting all my life
Did it ever cross your mind
Just what you do? Oh
All you ever had to see
Was love me unconditionally

And I won't go
I won't leave 'til it's over
No, I won't go
Until hell freezes over
And I'll be yours
I'll be your supernova
Oh, darling, why was it so hard to see?
Just love me unconditionally
