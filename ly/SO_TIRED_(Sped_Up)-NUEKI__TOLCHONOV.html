		  Now I poppin' real slow
They don't like to pack a ton
At-At-At in yo fuckin' head
Droppin' that boy when then you dead

Now I poppin' real slow
They don't like to pack a ton
At-At-At in yo fuckin' head
Droppin' that boy when then you dead

Now I poppin' real slow
They don't like to pack a ton
At-At-At in yo fuckin' head
Droppin' that boy when then you dead

Now I poppin' real slow
They don't like to pack a ton
At-At-At in yo fuckin' head
Droppin' that boy when then you dead

Now I poppin'
They don't like to
Than into yo
Droppin' that boy when

Now I poppin'
They don't like to
Than into yo
Droppin' that boy when
