		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do you hide when your phone lights up the dark 
Turning a cheek just to keep us apart 
Hiding a smile I see right through you 
Tell me the secrets I always knew

I don't know what's behind those eyes 
underneath all the pretty lies
haunting me leave me for dead

You said she's just a friend 
Don't let it get into your head 
I'll always love you 
& I'll never replace you 

Tell me that it's true
You didn't find somebody new 
Thought you're with me till the end 
But you just perfectly pretend 
That she's just a friend

Do you still feel her in your shotgun seat 
Flying down the 405 did you think about me 
Broken memories clouding up your mind 
I guess I'll never mean as much but I still try

I don't know what's behind those eyes 
Underneath all the pretty lies
Haunting me leave me for dead

You said she's just a friend 
Don't let it get into your head 
I'll always love you 
& I'll never replace you 

Tell me that it's true
You didn't find somebody new 
Thought you're with me till the end 
But you just perfectly pretend 
That she's just a friend

I don't know what's behind those eyes 
Underneath all the pretty lies
Who is that hiding deep inside 
Behind shadows of perfect lies 
Pushing me right to the edge

She's just a friend 
Don't let it get into your head 

I'll always love you 
& I'll never replace you 
I said tell me that it's true
You didn't find somebody new 
Thought you're with me till the end 
But you just perfectly pretend 
That she's just a friend 

She's just a friend
