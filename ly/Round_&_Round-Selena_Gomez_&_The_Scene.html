		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Round and round
Round and round
Round and round

You see me standing there
And act like you don't know me
But last night you were calling me
Saying you want me
Oh why you always make me feel
Like I'm the one that's crazy
You feel my heart racing
My-my heart racing

Boy, I need you here with me
We cant go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say we're
Going round and round
We're never gonna stop
Going round and round
We'll never get where
We're going
Round and round
Well your gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy
Going round and round
Round and round

You tried to pull me close
And whisper in my ear
You always told me lies
I cried out all my tears
I pushed my feelings to the side
But then you bring them back
B-bring 'em back
Now you got me singing

Boy, I need you here with me
We cant go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say we're
Going round and round
We're never gonna stop
Going round and round
We'll never get where
We're going
Round and round
Well your gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy
Going round and round
Round and round

Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch the drop
Love me or love me not
I'm staring at the clock
I pick them flower petals off
And then I watch them drop

Boy, I need you here with me
I can't go on this way
I'm falling hard for you
All I can say

Round and round
We're never gonna stop
Going round and round
We'll never get where we're going
Round and round
Well you're gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy
Going round and round and
Round and round

We're never gonna stop going
Round and round
We'll never get where we're going
Round and round
Well your gonna miss me
'Cause I'm getting dizzy
Going round and round and round
