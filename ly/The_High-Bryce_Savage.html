		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got that innocent face
But a dirty little mind
...c body like that should be a crime
She'll take over your life without warning
Got you addicted to the high in the morning
...Long legs and she taste so fine
I just wanna fuck around and make her mine
Cuz she took over my life without warning
Now I'm addicted to the high in the morning

...She a freak and yea she know it
Don't believe her then she'll show it
She got a body that's hypnotic
She get everything cuz if she want it then she got it
She a baddie
c little bratty
cnyone would pay the bills just to have her call'em daddy
c pretty savage
She living lavish
Just wanna feel her in the dark I gotta have it

Tattoos, her fit got me feeling some way
Those eyes and lips on a bad little face
She's one I'd miss can't let her get away
I wanna feel her in the morning....

She got that innocent face
But a dirty little mind
...c body like that should be a crime
She'll take over your life without warning
Got you addicted to the high in the morning
...Long legs and she taste so fine
I just wanna fuck around and make her mine
Cuz she took over my life without warning
Now I'm addicted to the high in the morning

(2x)
Tattoos, her fit got me feeling some way
Those eyes and lips on a bad little face
She's one I'd miss can't let her get away
I wanna feel her in the morning....
