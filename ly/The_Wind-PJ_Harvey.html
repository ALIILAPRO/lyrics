		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catherine liked high places
High up, high up on the hills
A place for making noises
Like whales
Noises like the whales
Here she built a chapel
With her image 
An image on the wall
A place where she could rest and
And a place where she could wash
And listen to the wind blowing
And listen to the wind blow
And listen to the wind 

She dreamt of children's voices
And torture on the wheel
Patron-Saint of nothing
A woman of the hills
She once was a lady
Of pleasure, and high-born
A lady of the city
But now she sits and moans
And listens to the wind blow 
Listen to the wind blow

I see her in her chapel
High up on the hill
She must be so lonely
Oh Mother, can't we give
A husband to our Catherine?
A handsome one, a dear
A rich one for the lady
Someone to listen with

And listen to the wind blow
And listen to the wind blow
And listen to the wind blow 
And listen to the wind blow
