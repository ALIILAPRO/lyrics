		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you have a problem, a problem?
Cause I can call my sister and my brother
Found a different lipstick on your collar
Turned your phone off, didn’t even bother
But when you come home
I’m still on my own
My intition told me you were trouble
I’m blaming you, only you
You drive me crazy
You, only you for that
Do you have a problem, a problem?
Cause I can call my sister and my brother
And if you break my heart
I’ll take you down dara down
Down dara down
On the ground
My baby
My baby
You think that you’re a God holding the power
And let me whither slowly like a flower
Who do you think you are?
I’m crying on the floor
You Made me hate myself like an asshole
I’m blaming you, only you
You drive me crazy
You, only you for that
Do you have a problem, a problem?
Cause I can call my sister and my brother
And if you break my heart
I’ll take you down dara down
Down dara down
On the ground
My baby
My baby
