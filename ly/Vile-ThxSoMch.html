		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't be the person
You brought me here to worsen
I'm garbage, man, take me out
Inject into my vessel
Treat you just like a Benzo
I'm tired of just getting by

Let's go grab our knives
Then act like we're still trying, carve our smiles
I'm tired
And I can't shake your vile and gorgeous mind

It goes quiet
Then it's a lil' louder
Swear if I'm the Devil
You're the Devil in a dress
When you're defiant I fear
I'm never good enough
But least I'm trying
'Cause I'm reliant on you, girl

Don't try it
Just open up to me
But all that talking
All that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
And now she crying
Well, if you wanna mend
Let's load our guns and start a riot
I'm jus kidding, I was lying

Let's go grab our knives
Then act like we're still trying, carve our smiles
I'm tired
And I can't shake your vile and gorgeous mind

Go to take a peak under the bed, get the gun to
Go to take the gun out of the bed, get the gun to
Go to take a peak under the bed, get the gun to
Go to get the gun-
Go get the gun out the bed

If you're craving war
Here is the noise that you been waiting for
I feel what you feel
All that ringing in your core
Break free, break free

Let's go grab our knives
Then act like we're still trying, carve our smiles
I'm tired
And I can't shake your vile and gorgeous mind
