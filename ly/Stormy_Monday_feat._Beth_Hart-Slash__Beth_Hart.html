		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
They call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday, just as bad
Wednesday's the worst
Thursday's all so sad (sad)

The eagle flies on Friday
And Saturday I go out to play
Eagle flies on Friday
Hey, hey
Saturday I go out to play
They gon' come around here and say to me
Maybe I should go to church on Sunday 
And get down on my knees and pray
And hey, nah, nah, I'd rather hear somebody play
Just like that

You better play, Slash
Shit, fuck yeah

Say, call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday's just as bad
Yeah, they call it stormy Monday
But Tuesday, just as bad
You know, Wednesday, it's gonna get worse
And Thursday, oh God, was so sad, yeah

But when the eagle flies on Friday, hey
And Saturday I gon' go out to play
Hell yeah, I do, huh, hey, hey, hey
But the eagle will fly on Friday
And Saturday I go out to play
And Sunday come around 
Shit, I ain't gon' get down on my knees and pray
No way, hell no

Yeah-ay

Well, Lord, have mercy
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord
Lord, have mercy on me
Lord, ain't have mercy on me

'Cause all you ever bring, all you ever bring
Misery, Lord, Lord, Lord

Come on, Monday
Bring on Tuesday
Don't hide Wednesday
Come on, sing it with me, Thursday
Hey, hey, hey, Friday
Yeah, I knew you, Friday
But Saturday, Saturday, I will play
I will play, all damn day
Sunday, I'm still thinkin' 'bout it
Sunday, I'm still thinkin' 'bout it
But I just might not, I just might not, I just might
Get down on my knees and pray

Oh God, that was fucking badass shit
Badass
