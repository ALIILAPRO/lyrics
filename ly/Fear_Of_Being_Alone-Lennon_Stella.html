		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Vices that I mix
No, they can't fix the type of silence that this is
But I can't take another lifeless empty kiss
Still I keep pushing back the time to call it quits

When I hold you
I get the feeling I don't know you
I get the feeling
It's not love that keeps us holding on
It's not love that keeps us holding on

Ah, ah
It's the fear of
It's the fear of being alone
Got me staying when I know

Ah, ah
It's the fear of
It's the fear of being alone
Got me never letting go
Ah, ah

(Being alone, it's the fear of being alone)

Easy as it is
The risk of wasted time is keeping me convinced
I shouldn't go ahead and give you up like this
And I really, really wish

I didn't have to make excuses
'Cause I'm scared to find out what the truth is
'Cause I'm scared to find out
It's not love that keeps us holding on
It's not love that keeps us holding on

Ah, ah
It's the fear of
It's the fear of being alone
Got me staying when I know

Ah, ah
It's the fear of
It's the fear of being alone
Got me never letting go
Ah, ah

Ah, ah
It's the fear of
It's the fear of being alone
Got me staying when I know

Ah, ah
It's the fear of
It's the fear of being alone
Got me never letting go
Ah, ah
