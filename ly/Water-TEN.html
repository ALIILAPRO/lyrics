		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you flowin' through my veins (veins)
Make me go insane (sane)
Never turn the faucet off

It's a cold night, look at the stars
Words can't explain (can't explain)
Know they shine bright, but you light the sky
Got my tongue tied

Saving every drop
My favorite kind of art
I'm just acting cool
'Cause I know you'll be my temperature so

Stay my water
Stay my water
I want you flowin' through my veins (veins)
Make me go insane (sane)
Never turn the faucet off
Stay my water

Can you please be my water, water, water?
Be my water, water, water

Like how you clear my atmosphere
Don't play no games
Washing my pain 'til I feel new
So into you

Saving every drop (oh, yeah)
My favorite kind of art (oh, yeah)
I'm just actin' cool (I'm just actin' cool)
'Cause I know you'll be my temperature so

Let me give back to you
Yes, please
Turning the tide on you
I'm diving in deep
Are you down to dive in with me? (Yeah, yeah)

Stay my water (stay my water, girl)
Stay my water (will you be there for me?)
I want you flowin' through my veins (veins)
Make me go insane (sane)
Never turn the faucet off
Stay my water

Can you please be my water, water, water? (Stay-ay-ay, whoa-oh)
Be my water, water, water

Now, I can still (I can still)
Turn this up a notch (up a notch)
Dive in deep (dive in deep)
Taking this real slow, whoa

Stay my water (oh, oh)
Stay my water (stay a little longer for me, girl, yeah)
I want you flowin' through my veins (veins)
Make me go insane (sane)
Never turn the faucet off
Stay my water (be more clear to me)

I want you flowin' through my veins (veins, let's go)
Make me go insane (sane)
Never turn the faucet off
Stay my water
