		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She smelled like 2 am
Took him back to her place
Where all the saints adorned the walls.
To never ending from grace
He knew he should leave
And this could only turn cold
She was a bad bad girl
So he told her so

Under the shadows engulfed
He had the whisper of lust
He said 'no touching tonight'
She closed her eyes in his trust
She said 'tuck me in'
He knew his judgment was sound
Still he pulled back the sheets
And said

You better lie down 'cause the angels are watching
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
'you can hurt me do whatever you like'

Her every word was in italics
As it would fall from her lips
The walls were made of broken promises
He hoped this wouldn't be his.
She said 'tell me what to do'
He knew right then he was done
Felling lonely and confused
He said

'you better lie down the angels are watching'
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
'you can hurt me do whatever you like'
So he said 'shut your mouth girl the angels are listening'
She crossed herself now the moments are missing
'you can hurt me do whatever you like'

glancing through the curtain
Questions unheard of
She spoke in third person
And he had seen everyone
Awkward and embittered
Said 'shut the door when you go'
Perhaps he should've reconsidered (oh no)
When he said

You better lie down the angels are watching
She closed her eyes and said with the talking
'you can hurt me do whatever you like'
So he said 'shut your mouth girl the angels are listening'
She crossed herself now the moments are missing
'you can hurt me do whatever you like'
