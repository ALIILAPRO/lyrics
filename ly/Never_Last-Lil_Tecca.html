		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (okay, woah, woah)
Alright (yeah, yeah)
Alright

I'm the reason why it's bad (oh my)
I know that we would never last
No, I can never get attached (attached)
I know it might hold me back
I know this ho takin' tabs (tabs)
I said, "Why you lookin' at my tags?" (tags)
I could tell you why we in the past 
I ain't never even have to act, yeah-yeah
I flex, I watch, I geek a lot (alright)
She wanna nod off of K9 (K9)
I got this loud, it's not the same high
I peep, I watch, I see a lot
I don't got the time for the same bullshit
You would've thought I'm not the same guy (same guy)

The way you slid, I thought I knew you
I ain't trippin' on you, get a new you
Oh, you thought that your bro was a shooter?
I can't trip on that bitch, get a new one
She say "You that nigga" I might be for you
You won't see no-one like me for you
Yeah, they twisted, it's probably I ain't sober
I could still fuck around like I don't know you
I been lit since a young nigga, ho, that's regular
I guess it's my bad when you gettin' checks
No, you don't even care if they checkin' up
I don't respond back
What made you think I was lettin' up?
Thought you had a play, but I set it up
Y'all niggas pray for some better luck
I really just want my time back

You fucked around and tried to play them mind games, yeah
I fucked up when I tried to show you fine things, yeah
I love it when you knowin' that they tryna play, yeah
I guess you never seen this in the time-frame

I'm the reason why it's bad 
I know that we would never last
No, I can never get attached (attached)
I know it might hold me back
I know this ho takin' tabs (tabs)
I said, "Why you lookin' at my tags?" (tags)
I could tell you why we in the past (past)
I ain't never even have to act, yeah-yeah
I flex, I watch, I geek a lot (alright)
She wanna nod off of K9 (K9)
I got this loud, it's not the same high
I peep, I watch, I see a lot
I don't got the time for the same bullshit
You would've thought I'm not the same guy (same guy)

Okay, alright
Okay, alright
Okay, alright
Okay, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Okay, alright
Okay, alright
Okay
