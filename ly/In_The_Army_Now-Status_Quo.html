		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A vacation in a foreign land
Uncle Sam does the best he can
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Now you remember what the draftman said
Nothing to do all day but stay in bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You'll be the hero of the neighbourhood
Nobody knows that you've left for good
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Smiling faces as you wait to land
But once you get there no one gives a damn
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Hand grenades flying over your head

Missiles flying over your head
If you want to survive, get out of bed
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Shots ring out in the dad of night
The sergeant calls (stand up and fight)
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You've got your orders better shoot on sight
Your finger's on the trigger
But it don't seem right
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

Night is falling and you just can't see
Is this illusion or reality
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now

You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
You're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, in the army now
Oh, oh, you're in the army, you're in the army now
