		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second
Minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power, power power power

They call me Willay
Stay so cool, I'm chillay
I done made that millay
On my way to that billay
Used to have a piggy bank, but now I got that bigger bank
Who who cares what the haters think
They hate on me 'cause we doing what they can't

I stay on that hustle, I flex that little muscle
Hate to bust your bubble
I'm on that other level
I'ma take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay in fly attire
Keeping burning like that fire

And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power, power, power, power

Y-y-yes y'all feeling funky fresh y'all
Work to be the best y'all
Work good under pressure
Been through all that stress y'all
Get-get this off my chest y'all
Made it out them projects with this project that's progress y'all

I did it for my mama
I told her when I was younger
That I'ma be that number
When you thought I be that number one
I take it higher and high and high and higher
I stay in fly attire
Keeping burning like that fire

Whatever doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger
So I'ma get stronger
Comin' like a bataram, bataram
I'm knockin' knockin' down that door again (door again)
Comin' like a bataram, bataram
I'm knockin' knockin' down that door again (door again)

And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And on, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
And on, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power

I got that power
I got that power
I got that power, power, power, power

And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power
And I'm loving every second, minute, hour, bigger, better, stronger, power
