		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He seems like the real thing, he's so slick and he's smooth, he gives you good feelings, but he means you no good. He will hurt and destroy you, it's all apart of the game, if you allow yourself to get sucked in, you'll have the self to blame.

The man has no conscience. He's just playing for sport
You're a score, not a heart or a love, you just make good report
He will hurt and destroy you
You need to know that's his aim
He will leave with his name on your heart, all he can offer is pain.
