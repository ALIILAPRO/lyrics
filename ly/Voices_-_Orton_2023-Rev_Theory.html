		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I  hear voices in my head
they council me
they understand
they talk to me

You've got your rules and your religion
all designed to keep you safe
but when rules start getting broken
you'll start questioning your faith
I have a voice that is my savior
hates to love and loves to hate
I have a voice that has the knowledge
and the power to rule your fate

I hear voices cryin'
I see heroes dyin'
I taste blood that's dryin'
I feel tension risin'

[chorus]
I hear voices in my head
they council me
they understand
they talk to me
they talks to me [man's faint echo]
they tell me things that I will do
they show me things I do to you
they talk to me [3x]
they talk to me [3x]

all the lawyers are defenseless
all the doctors are diseased
and the preachers all are sinners
and police just take the grease
all you judges you are guilty
all the bosses I will fire
all you bankers will have losses
politicians are all liars

I see darkness fallin'
I hear voices callin'
I feel justice crawlin'
I see faith has fallen

[chorus]

[guitar solo]

I hear voices cryin'
I see heroes dyin'
I taste blood that's dryin'
I feel tension risin'

[chorus]
