		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could brace, I could brace hard
Brace my heart for the big gun
I don't want, I don't want to, my love
I just want you to stay

Tried to keep you in my dreams
Tried to bottle with the kiss
Tradin' kisses with the stars
They won't listen, no one does
Tried to hold you with my word
Laid it down to offer all
But there's no sayin' words enough

'Cause out here, it's a battlefield
No savior, no yield
Out here, it's a ragin' war
Is anyone countin' tears at all?
Out here, it's a battlefield
We can't always get what we want

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Where do we go from here?
The horse on the run (oh, oh)
Where do we go from here?
When the last side reached the sun (oh, oh)
And when you brought me here
How can we be apart? (Oh, oh)

Out here, it's a battlefield
No savior, no yield
Out here, it's a ragin' war
Is anyone countin' tears at all?
Out here, it's a battlefield
No savior, no yield
Out here, it's a ragin' war
Is anyone countin' tears at all?
Out here, it's a battlefield, ooh
Out here, it's a battlefield, ooh
Out here, it's a battlefield
We can't always get what we want

Oh, oh, oh
Oh
