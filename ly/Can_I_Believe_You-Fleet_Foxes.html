		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
Can I
Ever know your mind?
Am I handing you mine?
Do we both confide?

I see it eat through every word I sow
See what you need to, do you doubt it's yours
Now I'm learning the ropes
Never get this close
I've been wounded before
Hasn't let me go

It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day

Can I believe you when you say I'm good?
I didn't need to when I wished you would
No it isn't enough
Never held that much
Now another way up
Been a row too rough

It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
But if I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day

Lately I'm wondering too
What type of desire I can break
When I'm one way with them, one with you
What half is it of me rearranged? (Ooh)

Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
I want to need you
I want to need you
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
