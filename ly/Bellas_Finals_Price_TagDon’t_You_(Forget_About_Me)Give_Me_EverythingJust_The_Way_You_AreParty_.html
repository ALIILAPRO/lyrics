		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seems like everybody's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first and the truth comes second
Just stop for a minute and smile

Everybody look to the left
Everybody look to the right
Can you feel that yeah
We're payin' with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just want to make the world dance
Forget about the price tag

It ain't about the (ugh) cha chang cha chang
It's not about the (yeah) ba bling ba bling
Want to make the world dance
Forget about the price tag
(Price tag forget about the price tag)

Hey Hey Hey Hey

Won't you come see about me
I'll be alone dancin' you know it baby
Tell me your troubles and doubts
Givin' me everything inside and out

Don't you forget about me
As you walk on by
Will you call my name
As you walk on by
will you call my name
As you walk on by
Will you call my name

I say la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight

Forget what they say
All my care they play
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy
Tell them hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Take advantage of tonight
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to do battle, perform for princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless

It's insane to wait and they ain't growin' money
Keep flowin', hustlers move beside us
So I'm tip-toeing to keep blowing
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my lap, baby
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow
But I'll promise tonight

Excuse me
But I might drink a little more than i should tonight
And I may take you home with me if I could tonight
(Don't you forget about me)
And baby i will make you feel so good tonight
'Cause we might not get tomorrow tonight

Hands up
I put my hand up

Don't you forget about me
(Party in the USA) tonight

I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
We might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
