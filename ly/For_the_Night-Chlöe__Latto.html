		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I asked myself why
We can't be closer
I played those same games a thousand times over
And you crave those long nights
With me, oh don't ya?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (we got LondonOnDaTrack)

I like how you rough around the edges (uh-huh)
Laying on your chest in my bed now
Loving all the days we together (uh-huh)
If they don't get it, then forget it, I do
Yeah, I do
The way I do

And they don't know me like you
All the things that we've been through

Love when you call me baby
Make me feel like your lady
And we go round for round
That KO love is never lazy
But when I wake up you ain't there
And now I'm going crazy

I asked myself why
We can't be closer
I played those same games thousand times over
And you crave those long nights
With me, oh, don't ya?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night

I know them other girls
Yeah, they all the same
You could have the world
Or you could have LA
I'ma give it to you
And I don't hesitate
If I call you up then you know that I'm on the way

You run your mouth
Cashing checks that you know gonna bounce
You say you promise and promise
You'll figure it out
But I cannot wait
You teasing me
I back down

I asked myself why
We can't be closer
I played those same games thousand times over
And you crave those long nights
With me, oh, don't ya?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (Big Latto)

Uh
That don't mean you good
They only love you at your best
You know where to come and crash
When your life a wreck
Walked in stressed, left with hickies on your neck
Pull up, get to spittin' on that mic like Funk Flex
You need a bitch know what to do with you
Call you up like, "Where you at and nigga who with you?"
I'm the only one know everything you like (you like)
You can have this for the night or for your life

I asked myself why
We can't be closer
I played those same games thousand times over
And you crave those long nights
With me, oh, don't ya?
You can leave your guard at the door
And let me love you for the night (we got LondonOnDaTrack)
