		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I gotta get outta here)

We live on different streets, but we share the same pain
Her stepdad doesn't even know her middle name
And you're so good at everything but loving me
And hate the man I hope to be

Two choices, stay or leave
What good is it to dream
If we ain't gonna move our feet? So

Saturday, runaway, get out of the circus
Little town, never found any kind of purpose
We both know our broken hearts deserve this
'Cause home is where the hurt is

We live on different streets, but we share the same world
Her stepdad doesn't even know she's into girls
And half my friends are drunk or hooked on something worse
The other half just wish they were

Two choices, stay or leave
What good is it to dream
If we ain't gonna move our feet? So

Saturday, runaway, get out of the circus
Little town, never found any kind of purpose
We both know our broken hearts deserve this
'Cause home is where the hurt is
Sunset, 40 west, head for that horizon
Don't you look back again, gotta keep on driving
We both know our broken hearts deserve this
'Cause home is where the hurt is

Saturday, runaway, get out of the circus
Little town, never found any kind of purpose
We both know our broken hearts deserve this
'Cause home is where the hurt is
Sunset, 40 west, head for that horizon
Don't you look back again, gotta keep on driving
We both know our broken hearts deserve this
'Cause home is where the hurt is

('Cause home is where the hurt is)
('Cause home is where the hurt is)
('Cause home is where the hurt is)
('Cause home is where the hurt is)
