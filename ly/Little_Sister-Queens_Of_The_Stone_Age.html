		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, sister, why you all alone? 
I'm standing out your window 
Hey, little sister, can I come inside, dear
I want to show you all my love 
I want to be the only one 
I know you like nobody ever, baby 

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind the shadow 
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind the shadow 

You whisper secrets in my ear 
Slowly dancing cheek to cheek 
Such a sweet thing when you open up, baby 
They say I'll only do you wrong 
We come together 'cause I understand 
Just who you really are, yeah, baby 

Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind the shadow 
Little sister, can't you find another way?
No more living life behind the shadow 

Now shake it up
