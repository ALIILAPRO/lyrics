		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You came to set us free (You came to set us free)
I am no longer bound (oh, Lord)
You came to set us free 
I am no longer bound, oh, Lord

Even in the valley of the shadow of death (yeah)
I can take rest 'cause the living God is living in my chest
Everyday I wake up feeling blessed (feeling blessed)
And even if I don't, I see it as a test (as a test)

'Cause I was lost until You found me
Now I know You're all around me
Nothing I could ever do
Could separate my love from You

You came to set us free (You came to set us free)
I am no longer bound (oh, Lord)
You came to set us free (came to set us free)
I am no longer bound, oh, Lord (yeah, yeah)

Say I'm so thankful You ain't drop me in that pit (hey, now)
Saw my soul inside that famine, said "That's it" (grace now)
You never flake in the cold winter
I just came to ball with the gold winners
Fast forward, turn to a road runner
Spirit caught me, He a go getter
Shared blood, gave me lemonade
On His Cole Bennett, uh (yeah, pick me up)
I was Timmy Turner, always chasing after Vicky, uh
Took me to His fountain
Gave me peace and chose to cleanse me up
Now I'm testifying of Your greatness, this a different love

'Cause it go whoa, oh, oh (uh)
Life been hittin' hard, let's take it slow
Take a walk by the river and let You flow
'Cause, Lord, You are all I ever want
You're all I ever want

'Cause I was lost until You found me
Now I know You're all around me
Nothing I could ever do
Could separate my love from You

You came to set us free
I am no longer bound, oh, Lord
You came to set us free
I am no longer bound
