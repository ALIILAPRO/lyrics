		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Californiacation got me on the run
I don't wanna face it that she not the one
Maybe we could make it, we could see the sun
Baby, I been wasted, if you wanna know
Californiacation got me on the run
I don't wanna face it that she not the one
Maybe we could make it, we could see the sun
Baby, I been wasted, if you wanna know
Californiacation got me on the run
I don't wanna face it that she not the one
Maybe we could make it, we could see the sun
Baby, I been wasted, if you wanna know
I don't got time I don't see you
Telling myself I don't need you
All by myself and I'm bleeding
I got some shit I ain't speaking
I don't got time I don't see you
Telling myself I don't need you
All by myself and I'm bleeding
I got some shit I ain't speaking
You could tear me up, you could break me down
You won't hit me up, but you in my town
You could tear me up, you could break me down
You won't hit me up, you don't make a sound
Californiacation got me on the run
I don't wanna face it that she not the one
Maybe we could make it, we could see the sun
Baby, I been wasted, if you wanna know
I don't think you hear me (Hear me)
Way you took the road, I swear to God you fear me
Even though I need you near me (Near me)
Way you took the road, I swear to God you fear me
I don't got time I don't see you
Telling myself I don't need you
All by myself and I'm bleeding
I got some shit I ain't speaking
I don't got time I don't see you
Telling myself I don't need you
All by myself and I'm bleeding
I got some shit I ain't speaking
Californiacation got me on the run
I don't wanna face it that she not the one
Maybe we could make it, we could see the sun
Baby, I been wasted, if you wanna know
