It's funny how a man only thinks about the-
You got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your-
You got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your-
Girl it ain't no pain in me lookin' at your-

I don't give a, keep lookin' at my-
'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're lookin' at my -
Ha, I'ma do my thing while you're playing with yo'-
(Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)

Every boy's the same since up in the seventh grade
They've been trying to get with me
Trying to (ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha)
They always got a plan
To be my one and only man
Wanna hold me with their hands
Wanna (ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha)

I keep turning' 'em down
But they always come around
Asking me to go around
That's not the way it's going down

'Cause they only want
Only want my ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na-ah-ah, na-ah-ah

It's funny how a man only thinks about the-
You got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your-
You got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your-
Girl it ain't no pain in me lookin' at your-

I don't give a, keep lookin' at my-
'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're lookin' at my -
Ha, I'ma do my thing while you're playing with yo'-
(Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)

Do you know that no don't mean yes it means no?
So just hold up, wait a minute, let me put my two cents in
One, just be patient, don't be rushing like your anxious and
Two, you're just too aggressive tryna get your

Do you know, that I know?
And I don't wanna go there

Yeah, they only want
Only want my ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha
Only want, what they want
But, na ah-ah, na, ah-ah

It's funny how a man only thinks about the-
You got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your-
You got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your-
Girl it ain't no pain in me lookin' at your-

(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha)

(Boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom)
(Boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom)

Ooh, you got it bad, I can tell
You want it bad, bad, oh well
'Cause, what you got from me is
Something I
Something I don't need
Hey!

It's funny how a man only thinks about the-
You got a real big heart, but I'm lookin' at your-
You got real big brains, but I'm lookin' at your-
