		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh so all my lovin' go's
Under the fog fog fog
And I will leave them all
Well I'm just a poor little baby
Cause well I believe them all

Oh so while your growing old
Under the gun gun gun
And I believe them all
Well I'm just one poor baby
Cause well I believe them all

I wish I could buy back
The woman you stole

Why-control, why-control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, out of control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, high control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners
Out of control, out of control
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners out

Oh so all my lovin' go's
Under the fog fog fog
And I believe them all
Well I'm just a poor little baby
Cause well I believe them all
