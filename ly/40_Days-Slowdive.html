		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forty days and I miss you
I'm so high that I've lost my mind
It's the summer I'm thinking of
Forty days and I'm blown away
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care
You said you're always sleeping
But if so, I'll be leaving
It's just that I'm always falling
And it makes me feel bad, yeah
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care
Just to try and watch you
Said I love the way that you smile, don't
Makes me try and watch you
I said I love the way that you smile, don't
Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile, don't
Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile, don't
