		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bury the priest and burn religion alive 
Baptize at birth with the black brush's wine 
The uncrowned king unholy 
Forget about the crucifix 
My rising sign is 666 

Can't you see the way they twist and turn 
You watch it burn 
Just sign right here and watch the tables turn 
You want the world 
I'll show the way 
Just raise your fist and let me hear you say 

Hey you want it 
Hey you need it 
Say hey you want it 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 
Get it, get it, go 

Incarnation can bring down the stars 
Five thousand times, and their service is ours 
Obscene, unclean, unholy 
The losers, dope-fiends, and don't forget 
The worthless, no good, piece of shit 

Come with me and we'll drink a toast to anarchy 
All we need is excess and ecstasy 
You want the world 
I'll show the way 
Just raise your fist and let me hear you say 

And you its plain to see 
In our society 
All of us will bleed 
But your war is not with me 
There are many of those who oppose us 

All of this could always be the way that you would want it to 
Come on down right now and sell your soul 
It's what you want to do 
This could be the only way 
Forget the fucking judgment day 
Ignorant is Bliss, so raise your fist and say Hey
