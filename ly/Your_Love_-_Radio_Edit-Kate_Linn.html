		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Counting stars
And my home was
Where you were
Washed away
All the love of
Yesterday

When you came around
All my walls just broke down
What a treasure I’ve found
Night by night we grew
Nothing that I could do
My heart melted for you

Your love, your love, your love
Loving every moment
Never ending story
You were mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your love, your love, your love
Loving every moment
Never ending story
You were mine

Love yourself
Before you’re loving
Someone else
Wanting you
Is the worst thing
I could do

When you came around
All my walls just broke down
What a treasure I’ve found
Night by night we grew
Nothing that I could do
My heart melted for you

Your love, your love, your love
Loving every moment
Never ending story
You were mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your love, your love, your love
Loving every moment
Never ending story
You were mine

When you came around
All my walls just broke down
What a treasure I’ve found
Night by night we grew
Nothing that I could do
My heart melted for you

Your love, your love, your love
Loving every moment
Never ending story
You were mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Your love, your love, your love
Loving every moment
Never ending story
You were mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
