		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was one of those nights
When you turned out the lights
And everything comes into view
She was taking her time
I was losing my mind
There was nothing that she wouldn't do

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
She knew we was making love
I was so satisfied
Deep down inside
Like a hand in a velvet glove

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She's got a touch, a touch too much

She had the face of an angel
Smiling with sin
A body of Venus with arms
Dealing with danger
Stroking my skin
Let the thunder and lightening start

It wasn't the first
It wasn't the last
It wasn't that she didn't care
She wanted it hard
And wanted it fast
She liked it done medium rare

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Too much for my body, too much for my brain
This damn woman's gonna drive me insane
She had a touch, a touch too much, touch me

Seems like a touch (touch too much)
You know it's much too much (much too much)
I really want to feel your (touch too much)
Girl you know you're giving me (much too much)
Seems like a touch
Just a dirty little touch
I really need your touch
'Cause you're much too much too much too much

Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much
Giving me a touch, a touch too much
Baby gotta a touch, a touch too much
Seems like a touch, a touch too much

A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch too much
A touch
Come on and touch me
Yeah
