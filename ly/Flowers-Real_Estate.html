		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We moved up here a year ago
I'm starting to feel alright
I'm gathering material
And holding it to the light

Flowers inside my head
Everywhere all of the time
My eyes are turning red
Always with you on my mind

You know what's right in front of you
Is always so hard to see
Feelings of dread are nothing new
No, certainly not for me

Flowers inside my head
Everywhere all of the time
My eyes are turning red
Always with you on my mind

We took a trip to Barrytown
The inn was closed for the night
The evening porter came around
And didn't put up a fight

Flowers inside my head
Everywhere all of the time
My eyes are turning red
Always with you on my mind

Always with you on my mind
Always with you on my mind
