Monday startin' to feel like Friday
Blendin' up the days in a week
Nothin' like I was when I met you
Back when I belonged to the streets
That pussy is on, elite
Plus the rain is gone, I can finally see
I been thinkin' 'bout gettin' on one knee
Turn a solo to a feat and make your heart skip a beat
Can't you see that I've been hostile for weeks?
Don't you know you change the patterns of my sleep?
They gon' say it's defeat, I'ma say it's a win
I'ma love you for free, they gon' think it's pretend
They don't know that you were there when I had more ideas than I had dollars
Now I say I'm proud with Chanaynay's and Prada
I look around, the pool is all dried up
These bitches only tryna fuck the vibe up

On days that I'm under pressure
Embracin' the highs and lows
It's hard, but I keep it alive, never been one to let go
Nights might keep me up 'cause this life ain't a walk in a park
But you know, just leap into love, wanna walk with you, baby (oh, oh-ooh-whoa)

Colors startin' to feel real vibrant
Remember it was all black and white
I'm nothin' like I was when I first dropped
'Cause I would hate to do the same thing twice
I had to learn bein' stubborn was a vice
I had to pick apart the trauma in my life
Wouldn't confide in my moms or my pops
So when you knocked, I did the Home Alone thing and hit the lights
I know you mad, the other night we had a fight
I tried to fix it, but the pain was still right
If I know anything, it's how to reignite
Satisfy your appetite, and that shit come as no surprise
I know we gon' be all, alright (alright, right, right)
I take that back, I know it's gon' be a delight
I'm at that age where nothin' can just suffice
I'm rollin' to get a prize, let's gamble on paradise (yeah, yeah)

On days that I'm under pressure
Embracin' the highs and lows
It's hard, but I keep it alive, never been one to let go
Nights might keep me up 'cause this life ain't a walk in a park
But you know, just leap into love, wanna walk with you, baby (oh, whoa)

I know it's been a while, since you heard from me
I know it's been a while, since you heard from me
I know it's been a while
But I'm still here
I know it's been a while (here)

If you askin' where I been, I've been offline (offline)
Tryna find my way through the mud (mud)
What I look like bein' caught up in the crossfire? (Crossfire)
That won't look too good for me, bro (good for me, bro)
I up the stakes for your love (stakes for your love)
Fuck around and pay for your love
Since I love you
