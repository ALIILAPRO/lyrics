		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you mind if I stay?
I'll blend in with the air
Oh, I've never felt this alone

Do you mind if I stay?
I'm the guardian of your nights
Turning your sorrow into gold

Would you pay for my loans?
'Cause I won't make it 'til old bones
Can you read my smoke signals?

Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared
Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared

Do you mind if I stay?
Your face is haunting me
I'll find the answers in my dreams

I'm still hung up on you
Your silence is a dusty death road
Who knows where the wind will blow

Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared
Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared

I'm just a man lost in space
Calling out, hoping to hear something back
Something back
I'm just a man lost in space
Calling out, hoping to hear something back
Something back

Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared
Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared
Listen to the universe, you may find an answer
Love is here and everywhere, don't be scared
Don't be scared, don't be scared
