		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a problem that I cannot explain
I have no reason why it should have been so plain
Have no questions but I sure have excuse
I lack the reason why I should be so confused

I know
How I feel when I'm around you
I don't know
How I feel when I'm around you
Around you

Left a message but it ain't a bit of use
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained
Playing the show when running down the plane

I know
How I feel when I'm around you
I don't know
How I feel when I'm around you

I, I know
How I feel when I'm around you
I don't know
How I feel when I'm around you
Around you

I, I know
How I feel when I'm around you
I don't know
How I feel when I'm around you

I, I know
How I feel when I'm around you
I don't know
How I feel when I'm around you

Around you
Around you
Around you
Around you
