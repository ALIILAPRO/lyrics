		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really can't stay (but, baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away (but, baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been (been hoping that you'd drop in)
So very nice (I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice)

My mother will start to worry (beautiful what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor (listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry (beautiful please don't hurry)
But maybe just a half a drink more (put some records on while I pour)

The neighbors might think (baby, it's bad out there)
Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how (your eyes are like starlight now)
To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)

I ought to say, no, no, no, sir (mind if I move in closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried (what's the sense in hurtin' my pride?)
I really can't stay (oh, baby, don't hold out)
But (oh), baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go (but, baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no (but, baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been (how lucky that you dropped in)
So nice and warm (look out the window at this dawn)

My sister will be suspicious (gosh, your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door (waves upon the tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (gosh, your lips are delicious)
But maybe just a cigarette more (never such a blizzard before)

I've gotta get home (but, baby, you'd freeze out there)
Say, lend me a coat (it's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand (I thrill when you touch my hand)
But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)

There's bound to be talk tomorrow (think of my lifelong sorrow)
At least there will be plenty implied (if you got pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay (get over that old doubt)
Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside
