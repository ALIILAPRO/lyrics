		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever I hear goodbyes, remind me baby of you
I break down and cry, next time I'll be true, yeah
Fever for lost romance remind me baby of you
I took a crazy chance
And next time I'll be true, I'll be true, I'll be true

Footsteps on the dance floor, remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

When I'm dancin' 'round, remind me baby of you
I really let you down, next time I'll be true, yeah
I took a crazy chance
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor, remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside, she cries on every tune
I break down and cry
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

Footsteps on the dance floor remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes, next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the powder room
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
No, no
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
No, no
And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh oh oh

Fever for lost romance
I took a crazy chance
Lovers holding hands, remind me baby of you
