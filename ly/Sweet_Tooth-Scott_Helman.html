		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I gotta have it
Whoa, oh, oh
So I ruffle through the cabinet
With a crooked moan
Kinda queasy on the red ones
So I took all of the blue ones
Feeling hotter than a glue gun
I said, "Let's go, go, go"

I hold hands with cosmic entities
I'll take this tube out if I please
I got this sweet tooth, baby
Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby
I exploit my opportunities
Some broken hearts, numb cavities
I got this sweet tooth, baby
Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby, yeah

I'm a savage in a basement
Whoa, oh, oh
I'm fightin' with the tchotchkes
In a stranger's home
I'm way over the street line
Roaring like a feline
Still coming up the incline
Saying, "More, more, more"
 
I hold hands with cosmic entities
I'll take this tube out if I please
I got this sweet tooth, baby
Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby
I exploit my opportunities
Some broken hearts, numb cavities
I got this sweet tooth, baby
Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby, yeah

When will they realize
Guy with the crazy eyes
Never had an invite?
Kick me out, I don't mind
Helicopter by the stop sign
Pretending that it's a strobe light
Kick me out, I'm not phased
I'm on another plane

I hold hands with cosmic entities
I'll take this tube out if I please
I got this sweet tooth, baby
Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby
I exploit my opportunities
Some broken hearts, numb cavities
I got this sweet tooth, baby
Yeah, I got this sweet tooth, baby, yeah

I can never find a refuge
Yeah, I've always had a sweet tooth
Maybe I'm a little cuckoo
'Cause I've always had a sweet tooth
