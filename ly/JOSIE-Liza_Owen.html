		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not like me to ask a million questions
Or wanna check your cell phone
No it's not like me but it's not like you
To act a little distant
Not kiss me out in public
No it's not like you

'Cause the change in the season
Is changing the way you look at me
And it gives me a feeling i know i know

Josie's back in town
I know it's gonna kill me, gonna kill me
When she comes around
I know because you're different
Wonder if she
Didn't leave would you still be with her
I wish that I could make believe
That you don't put her first
When Josie's back in town

Is it just me and my imagination
Is it running on it's own or is it just me

'Cause the change in the season
Is changing the way you look at me
And it gives me a feeling i know i know

Josie's back in town
I know it's gonna kill me, gonna kill me
When she comes around
I know because you're different
Wonder if she
Didn't leave would you still be with her
I wish that I could make believe
That you don't put her first
When Josie's back in town

And I know it gonna kill me gotta let it go
'Cause I know that I will
Never be your only one
Yeah, I know it's gonna kill
Me gotta let it go oh oh

Josie's back in town
I know it's gonna kill me, gonna kill me
When she comes around
I know because you're different
Wonder if she
Didn't leave would you still be with her
I wish that I could make believe
That you don't put her first
When Josie's back in town
