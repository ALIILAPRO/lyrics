		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Goddamn it, Dupri

It's a whole lotta girls 'round the world when I only want to see ya
In the VIP, cash on us, poppin' 'luxe bottles, open up, I only want to feed ya (feed ya)
In the club, single file in
Bad bitch, you can call, you can dial in
Money, power, bring in a dolly
I fucked a shawty, pussy cold, fucked her on a freezer
And I been had peeped it, shawty look too exotic (exotic)
I had no reason to lie, baby, I'm on and poppin'

Let me lick you
Eat it once, baby, I don't miss you (miss you)
Hammer in my pants, it's a pistol (pistol)
Pull up on a nigga, what's the issue?
Niggas want to know where the safe at (safe at)
Bitches want to fuck me with the latex (latex)
Gotta keep a strap like safe sex (safe sex)
She wanna fuck, we ain't even met yet (nope)
I'm down for the bitch, she up on my dick
When I turn around, she don't be runnin' her lips
When I I'm out of town, she be keepin' it lit
Next time a nigga want you, get another bitch
I just don't give a fuck
not tryna be in love
But I'll put you first in line
can't be with you all the time

Vibrate, vibrate (vibrate)
Why wait? Why wait? (She vibrate)
Bad bitch, it's a hot day (hot)
Ass fat, I'm lookin' at it sideways
I smoke an ounce sack (ounce sack, ounce sack)
I left a bitch where I found that
I let 'em switch, I want lap dances
I told her, "Bounce that, bounce that" (bounce that)

Yeah, hunnids on the floor (shoo)
Your body navigation tell me where to go (go)
Deep up in your ocean, baby, do you deepthroat?
You know I got a thing for your pretty white toes
You was there with me when a nigga was broke
Fly, get you everything if it's in the store (everything)
And I buy you wedding ring, just so you can show (show it)
Tell them other bitches that a nigga so dope (so dope)
I get blessings on me (me), I got blessings on me (me)
I'm what's missing, what you need
Some good sex is what you need
We link up and the rest is history
Close your eyes, count to three
Don't be cheatin', tryna peek
You know what you're gon' see
You're my little secret (secret)
If I put you on, can you keep it?

I'ma make that pussy
Vibrate, vibrate (vibrate)
Why wait? Why wait? (She vibrate)
Bad bitch, it's a hot day (hot)
Ass fat, I'm lookin' at it sideways
I smoke an ounce sack (ounce sack, ounce sack)
I left a bitch where I found that
I let 'em switch, I want lap dances
I told her, "Bounce that, bounce that" (bounce that)

You're my little secret
If I put you on, can you keep it?
Hunnids on the floor, gotta sweep it
She say money make her cum, get her so wet
Vibrate, vibrate (vibrate)
Vibrate, vibrate (vibrate)

We got bands, what was your excuse?
Jump over, TEC left 'em bruised
