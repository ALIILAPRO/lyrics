		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drifting through loss
We escape from the cost of the pain
The healing through years
So obscured by the tears and the strain
But this one-way street you're on
You'll never be fulfilled
And this one-way street you're on
Is gonna get you killed

Healing the lost
So delusional hollow and vague
Ascending through fear
As emotionless dreams of the grave
But this one-way street you're on
You'll never be fulfilled
And this one-way street you're on
Is gonna get you killed

Onto a higher ground, a youthful lie, no warning death
Hiding this truth in all us
Another fired down, do or die, it's just despair
Hiding the truth in all us

God asks not to kill
God asks not to kill
God asks not
Godless, sworn to kill
Godless, sworn to kill
God asks not

With inner peace gone, you pray
All those darker thoughts are coming back to stay
With inner peace gone you've paid
All those darker thoughts are coming back to stay

Godless sworn to kill
Annihilation
Godless sworn to kill (Godless sworn to kill)
Annihilation

God asks not to kill
God asks not to kill
God asks not
Godless sworn to kill
Godless sworn to kill
God asks not
