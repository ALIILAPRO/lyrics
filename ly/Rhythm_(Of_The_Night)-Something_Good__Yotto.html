		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah

This is the rhythm of the night

Oh yeah

Won't you teach me how to love and learn?
There'll be nothing left for me to yearn
Think of me you'll burn
And let me hold your hand

I don't wanna face the world in tears
Please think again, I'm on my knees
Sing that song to me
No reason to repent

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
The rhythm of the night
This is the rhythm of my life
My life, oh yeah
The rhythm of my life

This is the rhythm of the night
The night, oh yeah
The rhythm of the night

This is the rhythm of the night
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
This is the rhythm of the night

Oh yeah

This is the rhythm of the night

Oh yeah
