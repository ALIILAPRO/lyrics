		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gbemi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days
I want to spend them on enjoyment

It's plenty, ah
Order Hennessy, ah
Won ni won wa mi o, ah
Every day, party, ah

As I dey knack the gbedu
Start to dey move, start to dey move
Like you smoke kalaku
Just dey bounce with the groove, no carry do
If you lose guard, dem go bounce with your boo
I can vouch for my crew, I'm tellin' you
Them too dey do, lifestyle of a crook
Make you dance, no dey look
Dem go dey look, dem go dey look

Then say if it's not enough
If I do ninety-nine good e go remain one
Don't know how to show you my love without fuckin' up
But I can buy you a new AP straight from A Jewellers (cap, zobo)

Gbemi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days
I want to spend them on enjoyment

It's plenty, ah
Order Hennessy, ah
Won ni won wa mi o, ah
Every day, party, ah

Do me like I take Tramadol
Don't want to feel nothing at all (okay)
Be like Ojuju Calabar
Give me moral like I be bouncer
Mon para gan (let go)
Take me high, I don't want to land, oh
Up 'til now, I don't understand why

No matter what I do, it's not enough
If I do ninety-nine good e go remain one
Don't know how to show you my love without fuckin' up
Walahi, I'm faded, just dey shake head
Forget di label

Gbemi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye (no dey shalaye)
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg (give my matter K-leg)
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days
I want to spend them on enjoyment
Gbemi trabaye, make you no dey shalaye
I don't want nobody to give my matter K-leg
For this life I dey, I want to be celebrated
Don't wanna waste my days
I want to spend them on enjoyment (spend them on enjoyment)

It's plenty, ah (plenty)
Order Hennessy, ah (Hennessy oh)
Won ni won wa mi o, ah
Every day, party, ah
