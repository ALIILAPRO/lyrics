		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?
I see you coming and I don't wanna know your name
L-U-V, Madonna
I see you coming and you're gonna have to change the game
Y-O-U, you wanna?

Would you like to try?
Give me a reason why
Give me all that you got
Maybe you'll do fine
As long as you don't lie to me
And pretend to be what you're not

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You got to step into my world
Give me all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today
Give me all your lovin', give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

L-U-V, Madonna
Y-O-U, you wanna?
Keep trying don't give up, that's if you want it bad enough
L-U-V, Madonna
It's right in front of you, now tell me what you're thinking of
Y-O-U, you wanna?

In another place, at a different time
You can be my lucky star
We can drink some wine
Burgundy is fine
Let's drink the bottle every drop

Don't play the stupid game
Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You got to step into my world
Give me all your lovin', give me your love
Give me all your love today (give me all your love)
Give me all your lovin', give me your love
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away

(Give me all your love) 
Give me all your love, boy
You can be my boy, you can be my boy toy
In the nick of time, I can say a sicker rhyme
'Cause it's time for change, like a nickel or a dime, uh
(Give me all your love) I'm Roman, I'm a barbarian, I'm Conan
You was sleeping on me, you was dosin'
Now move, I'm goin' in, huh

You have all the L-U-V
I gave you everything you need (now move)
Now it's up to Y-O-U
Are you the one, shall we proceed?

Move it
Licks, I'm so swag shit (swag)
No one gave you this
It's a supersonic, bionic, uranium hit
So I break 'em off tricks
Let's pray that it sticks
I'ma say this once, yeah, I don't give a shit

Don't play the stupid game
'Cause I'm a different kind of girl
Every record sounds the same
You got to step into my world
Give me all your lovin', give me your love
L-U-V, Madonna (give me all your love)
Give me all your lovin', give me your love
Y-O-U, you wanna?

Give me all your lovin', give me your love (all your lovin')
Give me all your love today (give me all your love)
Give me all your lovin', give me your love (all your lovin')
Let's forget about time
And dance our lives away (give me all your love)
