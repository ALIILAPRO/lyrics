		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With a little bit of love (a huh a hu-aah a huh)
Are you lonesome tonight
Are you here on your own, can I get your attention?
So you're dancin' here tonight
With a smile that shines so bright
Could I hold you tonight?

With a little bit of love
With a little bit of hope
With a little bit of everything
Do you think that&iexcl;&macr;s enough?

Tell me now
Is it asking too much, to stay for a while
Cause time, precious time, is not my side
Tell me now
Is it asking too much, to stay for a while
Cause time, precious time, is not my side

With a little bit of love (a huh a hu-aah a huh)
If I could hold you tonight
Make you feel alright, gonna take you to heaven
I miss you being on my side
Make me feel alright
Take you through all the night

With a little bit of love
With a little bit of hope
With a little bit of everything
Do you think that&iexcl;&macr;s enough?

Little bit of love, little bit of hope
Little bit of love, little bit of hope
Little bit of love, little bit of hope
Little bit of love, little bit of hope

Tell me now
Is it asking too much, to stay for a while
Cause time, precious time, is not on my side
Tell me now
Is it asking too much, to stay for a while
Cause time, precious time, is not on my side
Cause time, precious time, is not on my side
