		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They never knew my struggle
Rose above the rubble
Rather live inside they bubble then go through the trouble of havin' they double double vision correct it
They neglect it and
I been thinking lately
Will the Devil take me? or will God protect me?
I know I ain't perfect, but you should respect me
They don't want me happy
They don't want to let me live

I'm young and I'm foolish, I make bad decisions
I block out the news, turn my back on religion
Don't have no degree, I'm somewhat na√Øve
I've made it this far on my own
But lately, that shit ain't been gettin' me higher
I lift up my head and the world is on fire
There's dread in my heart and fear in my bones
And I just don't know what to say

Maybe I'll pray, pray
Maybe I'll pray
I have never believed in you, no
But I'm gonna pray

I am me
I'm a man, I'm a sinner
But understand, aren't we all?
So when it comes to passing judgements I don't think that you're the one to make the call
Heaven want to cast me out for being me, I know there's like me that'll break the fall
I know you hater motherfuckers just can't relate at all
If I'm the first one to the line that's fine, I'll take it all
Well Logic, he gon' let 'em know
I ain't perfect, but I'm worth it
I'm alive, I deserve it
I been praying, I ain't playin'
I don't think you hear the words that I'm sayin'
I don't think you know the weight on my shoulders
That gets heavier as I get older
Callin' anybody, callin' anybody
"Can you hear me?"
I pray that you hear me
I pray that you hear me

Maybe I'll pray (Lord), pray (Lord), maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna

Won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end
Oh, won't you call me?
Can we have a one-on-one, please?
Let's talk about freedom
Everyone prays in the end
Everyone prays in the end

Oh, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray, I'm gonna pray
Pray for a glimmer of hope
Maybe I'll pray, pray, maybe I'll pray
I've never believed in you, no, but I'm gonna pray
