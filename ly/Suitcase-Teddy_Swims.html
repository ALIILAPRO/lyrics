		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I'm sorry for the way I've been actin'
Runnin' out of time and runnin' on fumes
I'm just tryna keep our very plane from crashin'
'Cause I'm afraid of what you'll find if we do

It ain't lost on me
What the cost gon' be

I got a suitcase
Packed full of lies I keep tellin' myself 
'Cause I'm too vain
I hope it's not too late
To leave all this baggage behind
Just need a little more space, a little more time
I just need a little more space, a little more time

A little more (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
A little more (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Every time I stumble for you
Two steps back and one step forward
And now I'm fallin' down more than I'm fallin' for you
But I adore you, I adore you

I got a suitcase
Packed full of lies I keep tellin' myself 
'Cause I'm too vain
I hope it's not too late
To leave all this baggage behind
Just need a little more space, a little more time
I just need a little more space, a little more time

A little more (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
A little more (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
A little more (ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I just need a little more space, a little more time
I just need a little more space, a little more time
