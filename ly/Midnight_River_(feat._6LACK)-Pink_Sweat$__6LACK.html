		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Momentary nights in your paradise
I need your moments every night
'Cause you make a wrong feel like a right
Open blinded eyes
I don't know what the end is like
But I wanna be there with you

Tell me it's love, you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears, I promise I'll be right here
When you need me, just call anytime
And we can float on the midnight river (mm, mm)
We can fly through the moonlit sky (mm-hm)
We can float on the midnight river
We can fly through the moonlit sky
For the rest of our lives

Appreciatin' every magical encounter
Let go of insecurities, they don't matter
All of the chatter, I'm in a mix, a batter
Had to play a batter, 'bout to swing and shatter
Any expectation, brand new revelation
Better conversation with no limitation
Got no time to play you like a station, ayy
You know I'm on the way and I can almost taste the day
Taste of you give a nigga déjà vu
Welcome back, I feel like Ma$e did too, true
Hallelujah to the sky, feel like I died and went to heaven
It's love and I just hope you get the message, yeah

Tell me it's love, you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears, I promise I'll be right here
When you need me, just call anytime
And we can float on the midnight river
We can fly through the moonlit sky (mm-hm)
We can float on the midnight river
We can fly through the moonlit sky
For the rest of our lives

Tell me it's love, you're not just craving my touch
Got some things to clean up, we'll be fine
While you face all your fears, I promise I'll be right here
When you need me, just call anytime
And we can float on the midnight river
