		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the end, as we fade into the night (whoa)
Who will tell the story of your life?
In the end, as my soul's laid to rest
What is left of my body?
Or am I just a shell?
And I have fought
And with flesh and blood, I commanded an army
Through it all
I have given my heart for a moment of glory (I gave it all)

In the end, as you fade into the night (whoa)
Who will tell the story of your life? (Whoa)
And who will remember your last goodbye? (Whoa)
'Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

Born a saint
Though, with every sin, I still wanna be holy
I will live, again
Who we are isn't how we live
We are more than our bodies
If I fall, I will rise back up and relive my glory

In the end, as we fade into the night (whoa)
Who will tell the story of your life? (Whoa)
And who will remember your last goodbye? (Whoa)
'Cause it's the end and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

In the end, as you fade into the night (whoa)
Who will tell the story of your life? (Whoa)
And who will remember your last goodbye? (Whoa)
'Cause it's the end, and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

Who will remember this last goodbye? (Whoa)
'Cause it's the end, and I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die

I'm not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
Not afraid
I'm not afraid to die
