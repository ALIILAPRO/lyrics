		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so mature
You and your dumb friends make me insecure
I can't believe I'm at your door
I've been tellin' my friends that we broke up two months before

I hate that it's like this every single time

1 AM, break up, 2 AM, make up, 3 AM, make love (ah)
Friday dinner, date me, Saturday, you hate me
Sunday mornin', "Baby" (can I see you tonight?)
1 AM, break up, 2 AM, make up, 3 AM, make love (ah)
Friday dinner, date me, Saturday, you hate me
Sunday mornin', "Baby" (can I see you tonight?)

In the city, feelin' pretty, Louis shoes
I'ma wear 'em out, runnin' back to you
Feelin' dizzy, the way you spin me around the room
Is a hurricane déjà vu

You hit me up, I'll come runnin'
We're toxic, it's all or nothin'
Now look at us self-destructin'
Over and over and over it goes

1 AM, break up, 2 AM, make up, 3 AM, make love (ah)
Friday dinner, date me, Saturday, you hate me
Sunday mornin', "Baby" (can I see you tonight?)
1 AM, break up, 2 AM, make up, 3 AM, make love (ah)
Friday dinner, date me, Saturday, you hate me
Sunday mornin', "Baby" (can I see you tonight?)

You hit me up, I'll come runnin'
You're toxic, it's all or nothin'
Now look at us self-destructin'
Over and over and over it goes
