		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She know, she know, she know (ta ta da ta da)
She know mi treat her better than her man (whoa)
But she a worry 'bout the millions, the millions, the millions
Girl, you love me for true
But certain things in life they say you waan fi do hey
So you see mi need fi understand
That you are made for a money man
But

If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
It only proves that you love di paper
My paper
If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator
For my paper

Girl do you love mi or do you love him
Who introduce you to kissin' and huggin'
And gentle rubbin', and sexy touchin'
Admit girl and mi'll gi you di proppa lovin' oh
The only thing is dat he rich pan mi
You shouldn't be because a money make a switch pon mi
'Cause if you leave girl
Don't botha come back (no, no, no)
Because mi heart won't offer you no other comfort so

If you can't love me now
Don't love me later (you can't love me later)
When my later is much greater
It only proves that you love di paper
My paper
If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator
For my paper

Girl I know you wan stability
But dat don't mean seh you fi sell your soul for vanity noo
Bright life fast cars a di city
And di Fastlane mek yuh loose your sanity but
Mi cyan believe yuh sell yourself so short
To get di money you will make man break you part but
A gal life make your choice because
Mi nah make yuh break mi heart no

If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
It only proves that you love di paper
My paper
If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator
For my paper, no

If you can't love me now
Don't love me later (you can't love me later)
When my later is much greater
It only proves that you love di paper
My paper
If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator
For my paper

I don't want you to learn the hard way
So am taking you to lover's school
You want money just for party girl
You take mi fi fool
Every piece of my heart I gave away
I gave it away to you
And I thought you'd understand baby
But time's running out on you, go

If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
It only proves that you love di paper
My paper
If you can't love me now
Don't love me later
When my later is much greater
Cah mi nuh waan no impersonator
For my paper, no
