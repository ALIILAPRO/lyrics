		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember when we used to be carefree
That was many moons ago, oh, oh
Remember when we, we always agreed
That we'd never leave each other, no

I was too young to foresee it
But now I can see all of your pain
Let me take it all away

Can you feel me?
Can you hear me?
Every time I look inside the mirror
Feels like you're coming a little closer
I can feel ya
You know I'm within ya
Whatever it takes, I'll find you so you'll come back
To the moon and back

Can you see me?
In your dreams, am I there?
I will find you to the moon and back

We'll weather the storm
Like we did before
Maybe castles in the air, ya, ya
But I know one thing
I'll do anything
Just to see your face again, yeah, yeah

I was too young to foresee it
But now I can see all of your pain
Let me take it all away

Can you feel me?
Can you hear me?
Every time I look inside the mirror
Feels like you're coming a little closer
I can feel ya
You know I'm within ya
Whatever it takes, I'll find you so you'll come back
To the moon and back

Can you see me?
In your dreams, am I there?
I will find you to the moon and back

I don't know if we can get back
The time that we lost but I know I have to try
I would die a thousand lifetimes
Just to see you once again

Can you feel me? (Can you feel me?)
Can you hear me? (Oh yeah)
Every time I look inside the mirror
Feels like you're coming a little closer
I can feel ya (oh yeah)
You know I'm within ya
Whatever it takes, I'll find you so you'll come back
To the moon and back

Can you see me?
In your dreams, am I there?
I will find you to the moon and back
