		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

Used to be sleeping on itchy beds
Bed bugs in the motel, now your bitch give me head
Twenty bitches in the hotel on a ramen noodle diet
Tour life wasn't so well
All my niggas starting riots, moshpitting on your toenails
Uncle T doing so well, first class from a old jail
T Ferg did fifteen in the feds, getting no mail
My daddy died and my cousin too
They didn't let them out of no cell
Provide jobs for my whole block, I cannot slow down
Nigga, I won't stop now, mothafucka this is my town
Take the block, make it hot now, 143rd with the drop down
Icy chain with the watch now, third piece full of rocks now
Niggas squint when they watch now, leveling up to the top now

I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezels, all my niggas put in work

Bought me some better bezels
Man and went to see my jeweler, woo and I re'd up
Went and bought some new jewels
Hit the car dealer, woo-woo re'd up
Who knew we would blow up like nitro, now these bitches need us
Woo I just tasted molly on me, Lude knew I just re'd up
Dib and dab in this some new designer
I just dib and dab with the semi-touch
We on the red carpet surrounded by pop stars trying to act tough
I got Actavis on me, nigga, and I, poured up
They say that we couldn't smoke in this bitch
And we fucked around and still rolled up

I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work

Daddy looking down, I know he see me blowin' up
My grandma would be so proud
Up in Heaven, Yamborgini, know my brother see me
I'ma make my bro proud
Tell his mama I'ma take her outta work
Know that I'ma hold my bros down
ASAP 'til a nigga die
You didn't know what you know now
I gotta get in my zone now
I gotta get in my zone now
Only a couple-a more down
Momma gon' get a new home now
Teach Marty Baller how to be a boss
So none of us ever go broke now
I'ma bring you to the water swim nigga
I cannot bring you the boat now

I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
I'm on a new level, I'm on a new level
Bought me a new shovel, put these niggas in the dirt
Chain with the new bezel, all my niggas put in work
