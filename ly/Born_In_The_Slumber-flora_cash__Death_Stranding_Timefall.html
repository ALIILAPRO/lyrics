		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were born in the slumber
No one really cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents, the government's dead

We were born in the slumber
No body cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents, the government's dead

You'll be alright child
No healthcare, no education
'Cause we don't want the smart ones, yeah

You'll be alright girl
Don't choose what you do with your body
Please somebody, save us

We were born in the slumber
Nobody cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents
The governments dead 

We were born in the slumber
Nobody cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents
The governments dead 

We already know
We've seen it before
They've been throwing us crumbs
Don't be asking for more

You know what it's for
You know what it's for
You know what it's for

What if we got out
What if we went back
Get somebody unstuck
Get somebody untrapped

What if we held on
What if we stood strong
What if we got out, damn

We were born in the slumber
Nobody cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents
The governments dead 

We were born in the slumber
Nobody cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents
The governments dead 

We were born in a slumber
No one really cared about us
'Cept for our parents, parents, parents
The governments dead
