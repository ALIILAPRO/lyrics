		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hoo hoo hoo
I love hearing that shower turn on
Bet there's nothin' but a towel on-on you
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin'
But he ain't got nothin' on you
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring
A goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah
Sounds like leavin' you, oh

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Love the sound of the thunder rollin'
It makes you move a little closer to me
And girl I bet that your neighbors hate us
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep
We can worry 'bout the world in the mornin'
Light up a candle and lock the door
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that

Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights
I ain't goin' nowhere, I'm all yours tonight

It's a little too loud on the highway
I wanna pull back in your driveway
It's way too quiet at my place
Wanna come on over, come on over
I just wanna hear that ringtone
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone
Wanna hear you say come on over
'Cause when you tell me to come on over
I like the sound of that

Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound and I love the sound of that
Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Oh, oh, oh
I like the sound, I like the sound of that
Yes I do
I like the sound of that
Oh
