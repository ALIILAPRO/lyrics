		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll do that
Whenever things messed up
You're my partner
And we're ready to have some love
I'll do that
Whenever things messed up
You're my partner
And we're ready to have some love
On the back
There's a place we can do it right
Otherwise I'm gonna be alone tonight
On the back
There's a place we can do it right
Otherwise I'm gonna be alone tonight
Say you bite me off the shoulder
Along the neck as I grew
Lovin' you is really good
You don't have to tell me
I'll do that
I'll do that
Whenever things messed up
You're my partner
And we're ready to have some love
I'll do that
Whenever things messed up
You're my partner
And we're ready to have some love
Be alone tonight
Otherwise I'm gonna be alone tonight
Say you bite me off the shoulder
Along the neck as I grew
Lovin' you is really good
You don't have to tell me
I'll do that
