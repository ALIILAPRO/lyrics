		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna take you everywhere I go
Have you by my side
Take a walk round in every town
Drive across state lines
Like the sun sends a golden stream
Into our front room
I could be the same old light for you

Like the morning is always new
Give it back to you
Like the rain, it just passes through
For all you give
I'll give it back to you

I think about it like a man in need
Every time I'm gone
Wait to see you like a mile-long train
Is passing by your door
And my life is set around you now
Tangled up the same
And I'll be the one who calls your name

Like the night comes black and blue
I'll give it back to you
Like a road runs straight and true
For all you give
I'll give it back to you
