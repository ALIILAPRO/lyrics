		  (State of emergency)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Remember the time, baby 
Yeah, yeah (yeah)

I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soul mates
Talk to me, girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped 
Can you handle me the way I'm are?
I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
And let me see you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like

I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me, girl

Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go Dutch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby, if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped 
Can you handle me the way I'm are?
I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy, I like you just the way you are
And let me see you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way (yeah) you are

Baby girl (yeah, yeah)
I don't got a huge ol' house, I rent a room in a house
Listen, baby girl (yeah, yeah) 
I ain't got a motorboat, but I can float ya boat
So listen, baby girl (yeah, yeah)
Once you get a dose of D.O.E., you gon' want some mo'
So listen, baby girl (yeah, yeah)
When I make it, I want you there, want you there, yeah

Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
