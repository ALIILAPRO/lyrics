		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey boy what's your fantasy
I like the way you're kissing me
I wasn't sure if you were the one
The one that's gonna stay with me

You and I, have taken this decision
You and I, we know

Nothing's gonna change our love
Just you and me, to live our life forever
Nothing's gonna take our love
From you and me, yes we'll be here together

Hey boy what's your fantasy
To put your love inside of me
Now I know that you are the one
That can not stop carresing me
So take my arm don't pull away
I'll take you to my hiding place

You and I, have taken this decision
You and I, we know
You and I, have lived with this decision
You and I, we know

Nothing's gonna change our love
Just you and me, to live our life forever
Nothing's gonna take our love
From you and me, yes we'll be here together
