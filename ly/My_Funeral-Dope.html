		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now, as I lay here in the dark
And I think back to the start
I know some things have to end
For the next one to begin
I walk alone free at last
I feel the pressure letting go
From the very bottom of my soul
Flash your bone from the past
Light the ashes in the rain
And fade away
It's my funeral

Welcome you home
This is the end of the night
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't wanna leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own

Now, as we stand two worlds apart
The times hardened up my heart
From a world of no regrets
That I hope won't soon forget

I walk the line on broken glass
I let the passion take control
Of the very bottom of my soul
Cross the line, fade to black
Hold the candle to the flame
And light the way
To my funeral

Welcome you home
This is the end of the night
So thank you for coming along
My time has come
I don't wanna leave you behind
But this one I'll do on my own (3x)

It's my funeral!
