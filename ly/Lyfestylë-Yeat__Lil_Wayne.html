		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you wanna see is diamonds
All I wanna see is violence
You don't know how inside of my mind gets
Shut your mouth, close your eyelids

Pay your price, I'm not surprised that I live this life
Could you do what I did and do it twice?
Could you make your money up and tell a lie?
Could come inside the building all night?
Could you work around the clock all night? Yeah
Could you work on the job all night?
Could you work on the job all night? Yeah
All that molly, why your jaw so tight?
And you almost lost your job tonight
This not Breaking Bad, I bring my motherfuckin' pipe

Yeah, I love the feeling when it's wrong, not right
Yeah, I'm sick and twisted, know my brain not right
It's on autopilot, let it fly all night
But don't let it go crazy, don't let it turn you to a lie
But don't get so damn crazy that it stab you with a knife
Lock in with all the voices, yeah, don't let 'em tell you lies
And you probably see a demon if you look me in the eyes

Look me in the eyes, you see my eyes bleedin'
Oh, that bitch give me head, that bitch give me brain
I feel like a mind reader
Ooh, look up, it's a bird, look up, it's a plane
No, bitch, it's a Desert Eagle
Got the niggas on pins and needles, on thin ice like ballerinas
I ain't playin' with they bitch asses, Lil' Tunechi, I spit acid
Small feet, but I kick asses, call me and your bitch answer
I been on the job twenty-four seven, I keep the AK-four-seven
I'm cheese-head, but my whore yellow, I'm outside like Coachella
Her mouth dry, but her throat wetter, I fly by and leave no feathers
Rock a wife beater in cold weather, brown skin nigga, I'm a gold metal
All my watches on demon time, all these diamonds, I can't even see the time
Pockets, they be on dinner time, Thanksgiving time, November slime
Judge always tryna give me time, gave me fed time and that's plenty time
And I ain't got time like the end of time, I'll kill a nigga, like I'm killin' time
Uh, it's me and lil' Yeat, what's happenin'?
Sick and twisted evil bastards
Smoke a nigga, where the matches?
And let his mama have the ashes, Mula

All you wanna see is diamonds
All I wanna see is violence
You don't know how inside of my mind gets
Shut your mouth, close your eyelids

Don't you join a world that you can never live a life, yeah
Don't it feel amazing when you playing with the spite?
I know you feel crazy when you put it on your life
I know you getting lazy when you say you'd rather die
I know I'm getting lazy when I say I'll let it fly
Pull up with the Martians and they know I'm 'bout to fly
I do this for my life
All this money, it get trifling (trife, trife)
But I'm trifling, 'cause I'm on bad timing
But it's also perfect timing, 'cause I need to remind you
Of all the shit you said when I was behind you

Pay your price, I'm not surprised that I live this life
Could you do what I did and do it twice?
Could you make your money up and tell a lie?
Could come inside the building all night?
Could you work around the clock all night? Yeah
Could you work on the job all night?
Could you work on the job all night? Yeah
All that molly, why your jaw so tight?
And you almost lost your job tonight
This not Breaking Bad, I bring my motherfuckin' pipe
