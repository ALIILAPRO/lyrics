		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me a break
From your take and your take
Come on and give me a break
What do you want from me

Feeding the rich
With that song of a bitch
Well that song ofa bitch
He looks just like me

Thanks for nothing
Absolutely nothing
Thanks for all your bullshit too
Thanks for nothing

Positively nothing
Thanks for everything you didn't do
Thanks

Something for free
You got something from me
You want something for free
What do you want from me

Give me a break from your take and your take
Come on and give me a break
What do you want from me

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Thanks
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Thanks
