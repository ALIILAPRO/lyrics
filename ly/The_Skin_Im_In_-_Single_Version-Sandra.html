		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  people say
i need a new direction
people say
that i won't last

people change
opinions with their dresses
i have learned
how to protect

i don't need
to run for cover
always feel
like i am home

i don't care
what people think
it's just because
i like the skin i'm in
come what may
my love is true
it's double shelter
when i'm with you

can't deny
you're scared of their reaction
just understand
what's on my mind

my only fear
is love won't last forever
come over here
and look me in the eye

you don't need
to run for cover
make you feel
like you are home

i don't care
what people think
it's just because
i like the skin i'm in
come what may
my love is true
it's double shelter
when i'm with you

i don't care
what they might think
can't leave you
can't leave the skin i'm in
come what may
you must be true
we stick together
cause i'm in you

you see
people can do you no harm
do you feel
the way i feel
safe in your arms
