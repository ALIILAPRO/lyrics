		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, few have seen it, but everybody talks
Spirits follow everywhere I go
Oh they sing all day and they haunt me in the night
Oh they sing all day and they haunt me in the night

Yes I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and what ain't living can never really die
You don't want me baby please don't lie
Oh but if you're leaving, I gotta know why
I said if you're leaving, I gotta know why
Oh I sing all day and I love you through the night

Yes I know that love is like ghosts
Oh and the moonlight baby shows you whats real
There ain't a language for the things I feel
And if I can't have you then no one ever will
Oh, if I can't have you then no one ever will

I don't feel it till it hurts sometimes
Oh go on baby, hurt me tonight
I want ours to be an endless song
Baby in my eyes you do no wrong
I don't feel it till it hurts sometimes
So go on baby hurt me tonight
All the spirits that I know I saw
Do you see no ghost in me at all
Oh I sing all day and I love you through the night
