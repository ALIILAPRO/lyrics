		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh

If they saw what I saw
They would fall the way I fell
But they don't know what you want
And baby, I would never tell
If they knew what I know
They would never let you go
So guess what?
I ain't ever lettin' you go

'Cause your lips were made for mine
And my heart would go flatline
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time

So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no

Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel

Every time the phone rings
I hope that it's you on the other side
I wanna tell you everything ('Thing)
Everything that's on my mind
And I don't want any other guys
Takin' my place, girl, I got too much pride
I know I may be wrong
But I don't wanna be right

'Cause your lips were made for mine
And my heart would go flatline
If it wasn't beatin' for you all the time, uh

So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no

Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel
Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel

Owner of my heart
Tattooed your mark (tattooed your)
There for the whole world to see
You're the owner of my heart
And all my scars
Baby, you got such a hold on me, so

So if I get jealous, I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish (guess I'm selfish)
It's bad for my mental, but I can't fight it, when
You're out lookin' like you do, but you can't hide it, no

Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you (Glad your mama made you)
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel (You must be an angel)
Put you in a frame, ooh, baby, who could blame you?
Glad your mama made you (Glad your mama made you)
Makin' me insane, you cannot be explained, ooh
You must be an angel

Jealous, but I can't help it
I want every bit of you, I guess I'm selfish
