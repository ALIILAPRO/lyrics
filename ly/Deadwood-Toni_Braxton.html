		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't believe that I'm home all alone
Doesn't stop me from wanting to see you
Why the hell won't you pick up the phone? (Hello?)
Don't which way is up anymore
No excuses and nothing to cling to
Oh, you're shaking me right to the core

Just want to let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn around

All my friends say that "I told you so"
They ain't making me feel any better
Bottoms up and it's on with the show
Got me aching inside of my skin
No excuses and nothing to cling to
You gon' pay for the state that I'm in

Just want to let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn around

But you gon' see, wiser me
And I won't break down easily

Just want to let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Heavy like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn around

Just want to let you know
I won't let this one go
You got me down, but I ain't out
Think you got me good
Left me like some deadwood
I may be down, but I'll turn around

Don't you go
Don't you go
Stay here, oh oh
