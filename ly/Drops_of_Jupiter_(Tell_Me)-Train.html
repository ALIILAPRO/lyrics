		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a-time to change, hey, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey
Hey, hey

But tell me 
Did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way 
To see the lights all faded?
And that Heaven is overrated?

Tell me
Did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, hey
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a-room to grow, hey, hey, yeah

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane, told a story about a man 
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me 
Did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

But tell me 
Did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?

And tell me 
Did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?

And tell me 
Did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself?

Na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na
And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?
Na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na
And did you fall from a shooting star?
Fall from a shooting star?
Na-na, na-na, na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na
And are you lonely looking for yourself out there?
