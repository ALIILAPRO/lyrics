		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m not the same 
That I was
When I was seventeen

All those old friends
That I had
They don’t remember me

Musta blocked me out
Of their memories
It’s so heavenly 
Who they pretend to be

I can’t keep up
Can’t sit still
There’s no reason
I should chill

On my own
So alone
I can’t tell
If this real

Someone pinch me 
Wake up
Someone tell me to get up
Someone pinch come get me
Come help cause it’s too much

I’m too protective 
With my friends
I start projecting
Onto them

I guess I’m not
Everything I thought that I was 
Wish I had it in me to stop
But I can’t (fuck)

I’m distant
I’m passive
Unavailable 
And reactive
I’m sick and tired
Of the action
I need some melatonin
And a fraction
I need everyone
To stop acting
I’m so past it
So I’m passing
On everything 
That you’re passing
I’m tryna make something
That’ll last

I can’t keep up
Can’t sit still
There’s no reason
I should chill

On my own
So alone
I can’t tell
If this real

Someone pinch me 
Wake up
Someone tell me to get up
Someone pinch come get me
Come help cause it’s too much

Sold my soul so i could make rent
I’m running out of patience
I’m trying hard but it don’t make sense

It’s like I’m half asleep
Like I’m living in a dream 
Feels like everything i see
Is just so slightly out of reach

It’s like I’m half awake
Barely getting through the day
Feels like everything i say
Don’t come out the right way


I can’t keep up
Can’t sit still
There’s no reason
I should chill

On my own
So alone
I can’t tell
If this real

Someone pinch me 
Wake up
Someone tell me to get up
Someone pinch come get me
Come help cause it’s too much
