		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the sunlight
You're not on my mind
But then it always comes down to you and I'm
Reminiscing what we've been through
At first I though it was better this way
I guess I'll just get by
I will try to let go
Now there's nothing I can do I'm stuck in my head with you
I still hear the goodbyes
Should have known from the get go
But now there's nothing I can do I'm stuck in my head with you
I gotta find
A way out
Cuz I'm
Stuck in my head with you
It's alright
We'll be friends
When we die
In the end
It's alright
Don't look back
You're alone
In your head
And when the morning comes again
It all feels the same
I could use an easy way to freeze my brain
I could do this all day
I can't find my way into the maze
And always end up in the same state of mind
I guess I'll just get by
I will try to let go
But now there's nothing I can do I'm stuck in my head with you
I still hear the goodbyes
I Should have known from the get go
But now there's nowhere else to go I'm stuck in my head with you
Ouh ouh
Stuck in my head with you
Ouh ouh
Yes I'm stuck in my head with you
It's alright
We'll be friends
When we die
In the end
It's alright
Don't look back
You're alone
In your head
I gotta find
A way out
Cuz I'm
Stuck in my head with you
I gotta find
A way out
Cuz I'm
Stuck in my head with you
