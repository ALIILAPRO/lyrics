		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
ohohohoh, yeah

All my attention baby
My extra time
There's nothin' I won't give you
Girl if you were mine
Six million times I'm thinkin'
About your face
You know I'm crazy for you
Let me count the ways
Too many girls I'm chasin'
I've had my fun
But all the time was wasted
Girl you know that you're the one

It's a countdown to your love
You're my number one girl
It's a countdown fallin' faster
Don't think I'm gon' last now
(Oh, Oh) Wait a minute
I said wait a minute, wait a minute (Oh, Oh)

There's only one in your life
I want it to be me
Gon' set your heart on fire
Burnin' in the fourth degree
Serenade you, call your name
For you to come around
9, 10 back again
Count the ways I love you now

It's a countdown to your love
You're my number one girl
It's a countdown fallin' faster 2x
Don't think I'm gon' last now
(Oh, Oh) Wait a minute
I said wait a minute, wait a minute (Oh, Oh)

Ooh Ooh
10, you're beautiful
9, you're amazing
8, you're contagious
Every time I look at you
6, you're a star
5, who you are
4, 3 know you want me
Don't you know that I want you too
You're the one (Yeah)

It's a countdown to your love
You're my number one girl
It's a countdown fallin' faster
It's a countdown fallin' faster
Don't think I'm gon' last now
(Oh, Oh) Wait a minute
I said wait a minute, wait a minute (Oh, Oh)

It's a countdown to your love
You're my number one girl
It's a countdown fallin' faster
It's a countdown fallin' faster
Don't think I'm gon' last now
(Oh, Oh) Wait a minute
I said wait a minute, wait a minute (Oh, Oh)
