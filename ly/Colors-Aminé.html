		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be happy like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin' like the colors in between
Stranger to my family, so now I get no sleep
My insides colored blue, but girl, my range is colored green

Happy like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin' like the colors in between
Stranger to my family, so now I get no sleep
My insides colored blue, but girl, my range is colored green

Green, blue, blue, blue, green
Pink, pink, green
Blue, blue, blue, green
Like the colors, blue, blue, green
Blue, blue, blue, green
Like the pink, pink, green
Like the blue, blue, blue, green

I got no time for all these bitches
But they keep on ringing on me
Yeah, these girls they think we cuffed up
But this ain't no matrimony
When it come to being numb
That's how I feel on the daily
I'm Adam Daniel to mama
But young Aminé to ladies
Okay, yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow
How the fuck you do this shit?
I've been getting green
But somehow I can't find no happiness
Purple in the sky, so I'm high
But ain't no sloppiness
Red eyes from my red eye
But her red eyes from the Aniston

I wanna be happy like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin' like the colors in between
Stranger to my family, so now I get no sleep
My insides colored blue, but girl, my range is colored green

Happy like when I find a Starburst that's colored pink
And then I find myself feelin' like the colors in between
Stranger to my family, so now I get no sleep
My insides colored blue, but girl, my range is colored green

Look, please be humble, don't end up broke
Heart's full when it beat the most
Cherish moments with homies
I spent 20k up in Mexico
Portland, Paris, I'm coast to coast
Bottega from knee to toe
Need my family, I keep 'em close
Me and my girl, we Cheech & Cho'
Lames want me to fail
But then their girls want me to rail (jheeze)
Built the name Aminé
Got no help and gave 'em hell (jheeze)
When it's a gray area, it colors out itself (yeah, yeah)
The real just stay the real 
And yeah, the fakes just stay themselves

I wanna know how you feel about it
Does every hour feel like it's counted?
Tell me, do you think you can manage?
I wanna know how you feel about it
'Bout it, 'bout it 
Wanna know how you feel about it
Tell me, do you think you can manage?
I wanna know how you feel about it
