		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me, we come from different worlds
You like to laugh at me when I look at other girls
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby 'cause the dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I've been looking for a girl like you

You look at me, you've got nothing left to say
I moan and pout at you until I get my way
I won't dance, you won't sing
I just wanna love you but you wanna wear my ring

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you

Put on a little Dylan sitting on a fence
I'll say that line is great, you ask me what it meant by
Said, I shot a man named Gray, took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can't help it if I'm lucky
I only wanna be with you
Ain't Bobby so cool?
I only wanna be with you

Yeah, I'm tangled up and blue
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
Only wanna be with you

Sometimes I wonder if it'll ever end
You get so mad at me when I go out with my friends
Sometimes you're crazy and you wonder why
I'm such a baby, yeah, the dolphins make me cry

Well there's nothing I can do
I only wanna be with you
You can call me your fool
I only wanna be with you
Yeah, I'm tangled up in blue
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
I only wanna be with you
