		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate
(Until you burn to the ground)
I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground

I'll watch you hate
(Until you burn to the ground)
I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate, hate
('Til you burn to the ground)
I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate, hate
(Until you burn to the ground)

You're acting like a psychopath, my dear
One day you know it's wrong, the next is clear
It's getting really hard to hear that bullshit
Talking, when the money's all in my ear
You're just another wrong and worthless hack
One day you know it's blonde, the next it's black
If you wanna seal the deal and come stab me
Then you better pull the knife out of my back

I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate, hate
(Until you burn to the ground)
I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate, hate
(Until you burn to the ground)

Be careful hon'
Stop telling me on
And I can't move on
Think I'm probably flawed
And I'd kill myself at four in the morning
Pills probably gone
I think I hate myself, you make me wanna say
They know, they know, they know, they know

I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate, hate
(Until you burn to the ground)
I always hate, hate, hate
When you running around
I wanna shake, shake, shake
Bitch, I wanna be drowned
I'll watch you hate, hate
Until you burn to the ground
I'll watch you hate, hate
(Until you burn to the ground)
