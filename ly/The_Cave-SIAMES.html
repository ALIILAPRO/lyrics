		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  YOU RUNAWAY 
WITH THE LOVE THAT YOU GAVE ME
YES, YOU RUNAWAY 
WITH A SMILE ON YOUR FACE
DEEP INSIDE MY HEAD 
IS THE CAVE WHERE I BEGIN
TO FEEL LOST WITHOUT YOU

WOULD YOU RATHER TALK 
OR POUR THIS BOTTLE OF BOURBON DEAR
CAUSE NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY, 
THE BOAT WANTS TO SINK
DEEP INSIDE MY HEAD IS THE CAVE WHERE I BEGIN
TO FEEL LOST WITHOUT YOU

THEN WE WALKED AWAY, 
JUST TO BE OK
AND WE'RE FALLING HARD 
AND WE'RE CRAWLING EMPTY

WE RUNAWAY 
BUT THERE IS NO PLACE
NOW THE MOON IS HIGH 
AND MY SOUL IS EMPTY

WE WILL FADE AWAY 
BUT I'M NOT OK
CAUSE THE LOVE YOU GAVE, 
THE LOVE YOU GAVE IS LOST
LOST

CAUSE I'M NOT DEAD, 
BUT SOMETHING KILLED ME THAT NIGHT
IT HURTS TO BE OK 
WHEN YOUR ARE NOT OK
I'M NOT OK.

THEN WE WALKED AWAY 
JUST TO BE OK
AND WE'RE FALLING HARD 
AND WE'RE CRAWLING EMPTY

WE RUNAWAY 
BUT THERE IS NO PLACE
NOW THE MOON IS HIGH 
AND MY SOUL IS EMPTY

WE WILL FADE AWAY 
BUT I'M NOT OK
CAUSE THE LOVE YOU GAVE, 
THE LOVE YOU GAVE IS LOST
LOST
