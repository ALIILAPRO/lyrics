		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know what you want
Let's have a bit of fun
'Til I downfall
My love, if you feel like I do right now
Don't say you're on the run
To the other side, my love

I don't know what you want
Let's have a bit of fun
'Til I downfall
My love, if you feel like I do right now
Don't say you're on the run
To the other side, my love

You say you wanna try
But you never do
Sugar there's a reason
Why we lose

Baby, come on
You say you wanna try
But you never do
Sugar there's a reason
Why we lose
You say you wanna cry
But you never do
Sugar there's a reason
Why we lose
