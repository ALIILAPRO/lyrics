		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ladies and gents
Turn up your sound system 
To the Sound of Carlos Santana 
And the G&B (it's The Product)
Ghetto Blues from the Refugee Gang

Oh Maria, Maria
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria (ayo, Maria)
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner (ah, yeah)
See as the rich is getting richer
The poorer is getting poorer (ah, yeah)
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better (ah, yeah)
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said, "See you later"

Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (East coast)
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula 

Maria, Maria (West Coast)
She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
I said to the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

I said a la favela los colores
The streets are getting hotter (ah, yeah)
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza (ah, yeah)
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better (ah, yeah)
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise

Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (North side)
Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (South side)
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (worldwide)
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (open up your eyes)

Maria, you know you're my lover
When the wind blows, I can feel you
Through the weather 
And even when we are apart
Still feels like we're together 
Maria, yeah

She reminds me of a West Side Story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
Oh, she fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar
Played by Carlos Santana

Put 'em up, y'all
Carlos Santana with the Refugee Gang
Wyclef
Jerry Wonda
Mr. Santana
G&B
Yo, Carlos, man, you makin' that guitar cry
