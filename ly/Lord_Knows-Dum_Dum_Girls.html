		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to live a pure life, 
I'd say that it's about the time
Don't judge me for the things I've done
To get off the only one
The place I've found in ignorance
A slow burning of
I fear I am resigned
To the sky and up my mind

Oh boy, I can't hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can't hurt you anymore
Lord knows, what I've hurt
My love, my love

To be so blind I could not see
To save you and the some tells me
Sanctuary in his kiss, 
We still can't find to end of this
Cause every time you think of me
The black covers what might be
The no, no, calm that down
Together but all alone

Oh boy, I can't hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can't hurt you anymore
Lord knows, what I've hurt
My love, my love

When love is smothered out in fear
Gonna hate until the cold
The day we wake up feeling clear

Oh boy, I can't hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can't hurt you anymore
Lord knows, what I've hurt
My love, my love
