		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

I know He got His hands on this
I know we got a chance on this
No, I never planned on this
I might need a band on this
This might get banned off rip
Gon' say somethin' for y'all quick
Let me know something, who y'all with?
Don't know nothing, I know this

I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Breathed on this
Breathed, breathed
Oh-oh

More than I can say for you
Before the sons and the daughters
Before the sun and the water
More than I can say for you
But the truth still for you
Once I saw what the Lord do
God, the Son, all the glory
God the Father like Maury
Don't care what you say, nothin' on me
I don't care 'bout the lawyer fees
I don't care 'bout your loyalties
God'll solve it all for me
Trust man, he a failure
Trust and God'll heal you
Dustin, he a Hoffman
Don't fall what they offerin', uh
Fall far too often, yeah
Call God but don't call enough
Fall down but don't fall in love
I know God is all in us

I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this
I know God breathed on this

Devil on my shoulders, I can't let 'em breathe
Brush 'em off my sleeve, I'm filled with memories
Pray they remember me, oh, oh-oh
And I know there's an angel watchin' over me
All times, I inhaled and breathed
They hearts are filled with greed
Okay, now they want the old me
Not too big on peoples talkin'
Okay, now they gotta show me
Okay, okay
Devil's talkin' to me
Angel's talkin' to me
But Angels start to tell me
"It's okay to not feel okay"
I know that you'd be proud if you was here today
But it's okay 'cause I'm okay

I know God breathed on me
I know God breathed on me
Know God breathed on me
Know God breathed on me
