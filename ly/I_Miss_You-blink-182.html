		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss you, miss you

Hello there 
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim 
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you I miss you

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stared I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop the pain tonight
Stop this pain tonight

Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me 
You're already the voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
