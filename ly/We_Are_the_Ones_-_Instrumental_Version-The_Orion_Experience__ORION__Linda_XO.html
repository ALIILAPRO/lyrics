		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We cre the Ones 

We are the ones you thought you owned.
We are the ones you said were stoned.
We are the ones that you wish would go away
( we're here to stay ).
Yeah, we are the ones that are gonna run the world some day.

We are the ones you can't control.
We are the ones that won't be sold.
We are the ones that you can't get to look the other way
( we won't obey )
Yeah, we are the ones that are gonna run the world some day.

You might laugh, and you might doubt it,
there's nothing you can do about it,

We are the ones you can't ignore.
Every day we're more and more.
We are the ones who believe in the Un-cmerican way
( hip hip hooray ).
Yeah we are the ones that are gonna run the world some day.

You might laugh, and you might doubt it,
there's nothing you can do about it,
cause we are the ones we're gonna run the world some day.

You are the rich, the white, the old.
Selling your children's blood for gold.
Lie to the world and you act like it's O.K.
( no fucking way ).
Yeah we are the ones that are gonna run the world some day.

You may laugh, and you may doubt it,
there's nothing you can do about it,
cause we are the ones we're gonna run the world some day.
Yeah we are the ones, we're gonna run the world some day.
