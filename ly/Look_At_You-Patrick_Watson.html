		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Such a beautiful day
Must have been the company

It's not that it was extraordinary
Just that the ordinary
Stood up and was staring back at me

There's not a thought that I could hear
There's a thousand-person choir singing in my ears
And you're drowning into it happily, hmm

And are you scared
Of how good it feels?

There's a shimmering light in the back of my mind
I know it sounds cheap 'cause everything rhymes
I think it's just the way that I look at you

There's a shimmering light in the back of my mind
I know it sounds cheap 'cause everything rhymes
I think it's just the way that I look at you

Does anybody have the time and how old am I?
Can someone tell me what is happening?

There's a shimmering light in the back of my mind
I know it sounds cheap 'cause every rhymes

Can someone tell me what is happening?
Maybe it's just the way that I look at you
