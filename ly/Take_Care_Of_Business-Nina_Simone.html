		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't talk just hold me closer 
Let me sit on top of your knee 
Go ahead and take care of business 
For me for me for me 

Oh Lord, don't keep me waiting 
Be as firm as can be 
Go ahead and take care of business 
For me for me for me 

In all my life no-one has touched me so close 
Nor made me feel so sweet 
I said to you you are God's gift to all womanhood 
Take it from me take it from me 

You know you know that I love you truly 
And I want the whole round world to see 
How you can take care of business 
For me for me for me 

Go take care of business for me 
Yeah yeah go take care of business for me
