		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  IN ITS WATER-LILY FIELD
WIDE AND GREEN GROWS A TREE
AND FROM THE TREE HANG APPLES
NOT FOR YOU TO EAT
IN A WAY IT MATTERS MORE
THAN IT DID BEFORE
TO SEE THE EAST VOYAGING THROUGH
TRUE HEARTS OF DOOMS
MIRTHBIRTH
REVERIE
IN HARMONY
SOMERSAULT CARAVANS OF FOOLS
AS HE PASSES FOR REPLY
TO SING HIS SONGS AGAIN.
HE SWAYS O KISS THE HORIZONTAL GROUND
AND FROM THE GROUND A DOVE RISES
AND AS A MARK OF HONOR
A MASK IS LEFT BEHIND
MIRTH
BIRTH
REVERIE
IN HARMONY
TO GENTLE FORM A NOBLE FORCE
MASTER'S VOICE CASCADES
FROM HIS GENTLE STAGE
CALM AND VAST THE CITY LIES
ON A HORIZONTAL GROUND
KIND AND CALM JULIUS LIES
FOR OCTAVIAN TO PREVAIL
MIRTH
BIRTH
REVERIE
IN HARMONY
TRAVERSES THE PENINSULA
ALL THOSE DISMISS THE WINDS DESTROY
WITH HIS GENTLE KISSES
THE RIGHTEOS AND WISE
AND DOOM AMBITIOUS PRAISE
WITH HIS WILL
HIS WILL AND ORDER
MIRTHBIRH REVERIE
IN ITS WATER-LILY FIELD
WIDE AND GREEN GROWS A TREE
ABD FROM THE TREE HAND APPLES
NOT FOR YOU TO EAT
AND 'NEATH THE AEGAN SEA
WHERE STATUES AND PILLARS AND STONES ARE TOSSED
REST FOR ALL HIS ACHING BONES
TO GUIDE US FAR FROM ENERGY
MIRTH
BIRTH
REVERIE
