		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wait for an invitation
No need for reservation
This life is an exploration
And you gotta see what I see in you

I can't wait one minute more
The sun will shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine

Just think of the destination
I'll be your transportation
We'll find there's a kind of place
That can only be seen with a naked mind

I can't wait one minute more
The sun will shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine

There's a key that opens a door
Will you find it and turn it?
Take your time, don't take too long
There's a map that's washed ashore
Will you find it and burn it?

Unleash your imagination
Two stars, one constellation
Bright lights just to guide the way
Can you see what I see in you?

I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine

I can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
We can't wait one minute more
The sun does shine
The sun does shine
