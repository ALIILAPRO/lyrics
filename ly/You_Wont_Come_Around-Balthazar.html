		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You woke up with a smile
And it struck me, it was gonna take a while
Oh, before I'd ever see that again
What was I thinking back then?
Oh honey, how I miss
I miss you, babe, but that don't pass for love, I guess
I shouldn't reach out after all that I did
I'm looking at your pictures instead
Yeah, fuck it

I know that you won't come around
After all I've done
I know that you won't come around
After all that I said
I know that you won't come around
Girl, and I know I can't be blamin' you

I turn the words 'round in my head
Looking for anagrams in everything you said
Oh, it's such fun, until you have to come down from it
Until you have to clean up your shit
You wrote my love was wild
But we both know that I was just a child
You were patient while in the water I hid
Until I started drowning in it
And that was it

I know that you won't come around
After all I've done
I know that you won't come around
After all that was said
I know that you won't come around
And I know I can't be blamin' you

I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
And it's hurting me it's not with you
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
And it's hurting me it's not with you

But I'm in love
I know that you won't come around
I'm in love
I know that you won't come around
I'm in love
I know that you won't come around
And it's hurting me it's not with you
Give me all that anger
I know that you won't come around
Give me all that anger
I know that you won't come around
Give me all that anger
I know that you won't come around
And it's hurting me it's not with you

I'm in love
It's gonna be out in the water
It's gonna be out in the water
It's gonna be out in the water
And it's hurting me it's not with you
