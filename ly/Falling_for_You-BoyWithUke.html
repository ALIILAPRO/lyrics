		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want me to, I'll go
And sit next to you
All my thoughts, but I am alone

I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you

I close my eyes but I'm too slow
I can't travel on this winding road
Oh, baby, save me, take me home

I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you

I'll hold my breaths which should too stretch
Foot steps, first tune
Never thought that I would ever
Fall in love with you
Black out on the bad thoughts of you
Falling out of forfeit, I lose
My bad, 'til I catch a glimpse of your shoes
And knew that you were broken too
So I'll lock you up before I circle too
Never thought that I could ever fall for you
Broken love, but paper heart
I'll juke 'cause then you'll love but I'm

I'm falling for you
I'm falling for you, oh, oh
I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
I said I'm falling for you
