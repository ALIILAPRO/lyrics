		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch I'm that shadow crawling in your fucking basement
Creeping underneath your bed
A smell of rotten bones
Hanging from my flesh
Body
Body full of poison
Venom's spreading through my veins
Yung Waste has died, he's faded
Spread my ashes round the waves
Grave made of bugs and them thorns
Followed by demons and crows
Reaching my lowest I'm not that heroic
But fuck 'em I decomposed
Hidden but all of these creatures are creeping
Summon my demons they kill and mislead me
There ain't nobody that's near while I'm speaking
Fuck all these humans they all be deceiving
I'm $carecrow
I'm $carecrow
Say something please hear me
A shadow
A shadow
I think I'll be leaving
I'm weeping and weeping just call me a demon
Think that I'm dying
My body is freezing
My bones all are broken
The devil, the devil is scheming
Devil is scheming
The devil is scheming
Bitch I'm fucking going insane
Devil is scheming
Think that I'm, think that I'm dying
Think that I'm dying
My body is freezing
My bones all are broken
The devil, the devil, the devil is scheming
I am the Bird of Hermes swerving down your fucking lane
I got no armies of undead, the fuck you thinking mane
I'm scouting the block beware of evil go like Kurt Cobain
Smoking my blunt I'll walk the plank got wrapped in cellophane
I am the Bird of Hermes swerving down your fucking lane
I got no armies of undead, the fuck you thinking mane
I'm scouting the block beware of evil go like Kurt Cobain
Smoking my blunt I'll walk the plank got wrapped in cellophane
