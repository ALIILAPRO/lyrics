		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do I have to stay here on the ground it's overrated
The city scape escapes you with a sound
It's delineated  
I waited at the station for an hour
But I won't make it 
You take off on an updraft by the tower
And you over take it

Every moon that I
See you on the rise
You're drawn across the sky 
Now that ink has dried
And I can't tell you why 
Oh, Mimi can you
Tell me there's an issue 
I've seen it clouded all around you 
I hear you tell me there's an issue
You've seen before
Oh, Mimi can you
Tell me there's an issue
I've seen it clouded it all around you 
I hear you tell me there's an issue
You've seen before 
I can't tell you why 
No I can't tell you why

Why do you have to stay here on the ground it's overrated
The city scape berates you with a sound
It's delineated
And no one here has even learned your name 
But they all claim it
They saw you land and ran to do the same
But they won't make it

Every moon that I 
See you on the rise 
You're drawn across the sky
Now that ink has dried 
And I can't tell you why 
Oh, Mimi can you
Tell me there's an issue 
I've seen it clouded all around you 
I hear you tell me there's an issue
You've seen before
Oh, Mimi can you
Tell me there's an issue
I've seen it clouded it all around you 
I hear you tell me there's an issue 
You've seen before 
And I can't tell you why
And I can't tell you why
And I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why

Tell me there's an issue 
I've seen it clouded all around you 
I hear you tell me there's an issue
You've seen before
Oh, Mimi can you
Tell me there's an issue
I've seen it clouded it all around you 
I hear you tell me there's an issue you've seen before 
And I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
