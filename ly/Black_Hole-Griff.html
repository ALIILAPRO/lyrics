		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now and then
Your name comes up in conversation with my friends
I hate how much I feel it right there in my chest
I hate how much I feel it, yeah
Like, how are you?
It seems like things are going really well for you
I wish that I could say the same about me too
I wish that I could say the same

And boy, you know I've tried to pray, I've bruised my knees
I've tried to bring you back to me
I've tried my best to find some kind of peace
Don't you see?

There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I've tried my best to fill it up with things I don't need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me
There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I wish that you would realize I'm all that you need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me

Without a trace
You disappeared and took some of me with you, babe
Like the way I used to laugh until my belly ached
Well, that's all gone away now, yeah

And boy, you know I've tried to pray, I've bruised my knees
I've tried to bring you back to me
I've tried my best to find some kind of peace
Don't you see?

There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I've tried my best to fill it up with things I don't need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me
There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I wish that you would realize I'm all that you need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me (that you left in me)

Oh, oh, oh, oh (there's such a big black hole)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh (that you left in me)
Oh, oh, oh, oh

There's a big black hole where my heart used to be
And I've tried my best to fill it up with things I don't need
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy
To fill this gap that you left in me (oh, that you left in me)
There's a big black hole where my heart used to be (oh, yeah, you left in me)
And I wish that you would realize I'm all that you need (no)
It don't work like that, no, it's not easy (oh no, it's not easy)
To fill this gap that you left in me (that you left in me)
