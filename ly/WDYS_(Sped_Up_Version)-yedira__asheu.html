		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey it’s been awhile
Let’s meet tonight we’ll go run away
Hey I know it’s been hard
I know this feeling it’s empty

But you make me smile
I cannot lie
Your touch is a melody played on my mind
When you're out of sight
I cannot lie
I can't stop thinking of you

Baby let's meet tonight
Take my heart away
I know it's been awhile
Let's go far away
Oh oh
What do you say

Baby let's meet tonight
Take my heart away
I know it's been awhile
Let's go far away
Oh oh
What do you say

Address me as another home
We'll build a place of our own
Our destiny seems to be overdue
But I'm lucky to be under the same stars as you

Smile
I cannot lie
Your touch is a melody played on my mind
When you're out of sight
I cannot lie
I can't stop dreaming of you

Baby let's meet tonight
Take my heart away
I know it's been awhile
Let's go far away
Oh oh
What do you say

Baby let's meet tonight
Take my heart away
I know it's been awhile
Let's go far away
Oh oh
What do you say

Oh oh
What do you say
