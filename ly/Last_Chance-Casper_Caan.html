		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I hate this city for being such a weapon
Taunting its cheap thrills as distraction time
But pour me a drink, let's talk of heaven
The Jack and rye
Let's hear stories of people struggling forever
Turning to run to forget those endeavors gone awry
The story is dear because the story is
The story is mine

And it seems such a waste of time
To be drinking while my mother is tired
And my father's sulking into his chair
They've had enough of my share
Of promising it's the last time
Of thinking I won't fail if I try
Last chance we make it out there
Last chance we get out there

And all these times we've been pounded by the pressure
They've been around and they never wanna let ya inside
They just wanna talk about the weather
They just wanna buy the same song, same sound
So now who's gonna get ya?
It's your end in this town or the end of a century coming 'round
You just wanna scream about your instincts
You just wanna hide

And it seems such a waste of time
To be drinking while my mother is tired
And my father's sulking into his chair
They've had enough of my share
Of promising it's the last time
Of thinking I won't fail if I try
Last chance we make it out there
Last chance we get out there
Last chance we get out there
Last chance we get out there
Last chance we make it out there

And it seems such a waste of time
To be drinking while my mother is tired
And my father's sulking into his chair
They've had enough of my share
Of promising it's the last time
Of drinking 'til a candy sunrise
Last chance we make it out there
Last chance we get out there
Last chance we get out there
Last chance we make it out there
