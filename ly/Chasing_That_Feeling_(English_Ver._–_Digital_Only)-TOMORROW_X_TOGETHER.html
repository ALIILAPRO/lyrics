		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost on a moonlit night
Summer, one-nine
Thought it would last forever
Never felt more alive
Life was so simple then
A perpetual high
Those days that I knew may be gone
But I won't let them die

Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
I just keep on chasing that feeling
Won't give up, won't stop believing
I just keep on chasing
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
It's all I know, it's all I know

Didn't know what I had, did I?
Left it all in the past
Hoping for twice in a lifetime
Is that too much to ask?
Lightning across the sky
Went by in a flash
I'll keep running faster chasing one more chance

Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
I just keep on chasing that feeling
Won't give up, won't stop believing
I just keep on chasing
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
It's all I know, it's all I know

I'm chasing, chasing
I'm chasing

In my kaleidoscope
Are pressed butterflies
Reminding me I've only one life

Time's a thief that keeps on stealing
I just keep on chasing that feeling
Won't give up, won't stop believing
I just keep on chasing
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
Chasing that feeling
It's all I know, it's all I know

I keep chasing, chasing
I'm chasing, chasing
Chasing that feeling
