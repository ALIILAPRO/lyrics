		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay in bed sometimes turning to my right
Until I close my eyes

This is not a song about sleep or death
It's about something much smaller
And paler than that
I'm not going to show it to my friends
'Cause when I came home
I'd lost thirty-something pounds
I didn't leave my bed
I threw up in a bathroom in Baltimore
Before dancing with a girl
I'll probably never talk to again
We won't be friends
And I won't be nice to anyone
Because I don't see why I should
I don't see the point
I won't, I won't get clean
For the rest of my life i won't be nice
