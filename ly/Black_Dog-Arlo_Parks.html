		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd lick the grief right off your lips
You do your eyes like Robert Smith
Sometimes it seems like you won't survive this
And honestly it's terrifying

Let's go to the corner store and buy some fruit
I would do anything to get you out your room
Just take your medicine and eat some food
I would do anything to get you out your room

It's so cruel
What your mind can do for no reason

I take a jump off the fire escape
To make the black dog go away
At least I know that you are trying
But that's what makes it terrifying

Let's go to the corner store and buy some fruit
I would do anything to get you out your room
Just take your medicine and eat some food
I would do anything to get you out your room

It's so cruel
What your mind can do for no reason
It's so cruel
What your mind can do for no reason
