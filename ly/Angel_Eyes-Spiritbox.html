		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Innocence is a game that I have lost

I purify myself in the black of a velvet sky
I look behind myself in the back of an angel's eye

Mirror lies, angel eyes
A vision of despair, crystallized

I'm trying to keep it
Any sense of the frame that I have lost
At the door where I leave it
Tributary of pain I left to rot
Take me (take me)
Flowing under my skin, I lock it up
Break me (break me)
Innocence is a game that I have lost

A vision of despair, crystallized

I know where I wanna go, but the body is too close
Take a piece of my history, now it's too late to repose

This time
I break the mirror when I die
The hourglass inside my mind
Turn it once to touch the sky
Scouring my life

I'm trying to keep it
Any sense of the frame that I have lost
At the door where I leave it
Tributary of pain I left to rot
Take me (take me)
Flowing under my skin, I lock it up
Break me (break me)
Innocence is a game that I have lost
Innocence is a game that I have lost
