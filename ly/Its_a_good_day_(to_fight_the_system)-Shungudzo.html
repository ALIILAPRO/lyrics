		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up feeling great
The birds are in the trees
They're singin' me a melody
La-la-la-la, fuck the police
My head is on straight
My heart is in peace
My soul is incredibly
Ready to change history

It's a good day
To fight the system, to fight the system
It's a good, good, good day
Yes, a good, good, good day

We're never gonna stop
We're gonna make it count
When one of us is tired out
The other one will hold it down
We're gonna spread the love
We're gonna spread it 'round
We're all over the city now
And way down in the underground (come on)

It's a good day
To fight the system, to fight the system
It's a good, good, good day
Yes, a good, good, good day
It's a good day
To fight the system, to fight the system
It's a good, good, good day
Yes, a good, good, good day

It's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good, it's a good
It's a good, it's a good, it's a good

It's a good day
To fight the system, to fight the system
It's a good, good, good day
Yes, a good, good, good day (come on)
It's a good day
To fight the system, to fight the system
It's a good, good, good day
Yes, a good, good, good day
