		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The one before you wasn't careful
The one before you kicked my heart around the corner
The one before you wasn't gentle
Nobody told me love was a contact sport

So, no, it's not your fault
That I can't love you yet
But can I be with you after the healing
After the healing is done?
Can I be with you after the hurting?
After the monsters in my head are finally gone?
But can I be with you after the healing?

The time before you wasn't easy
The time before you pushed me right over the edge
And now I got some trouble sleeping
I'm kept awake by knife left in my bed

So, no, it's not your fault
That I can't love you yet
But can I be with you after the healing
After the healing is done?
Yeah, can I be with you after the hurting?
After the monsters in my head are finally gone? (Gone)
Can I be with you after the healing?

So, give me just a little time
'Cause I just gotta let me cry
This isn't your responsibility

But I wanna be with you after the healing
After the healing is done
Can I be with you after the hurting?
After the monsters in my bed are finally gone?
So, give me just a little time
'Cause I just gotta let me cry
This isn't your responsibility
Can I be with you after the healing
After the healing is done?
Can I be with you after the healing?
