		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bullet in my head
Seeing everything in red
Every thought tastes like lead
Am I living or dead
Fucked around and found out everybody's shit
Now I'm on the edge of some mental shit
Blood
I've been walking tall since the jump
Had enough, now I'm up
What the fuck do they want from me
I think they like the sound of my rage
Flowing through my veins
Take a breath before you drown in hate
Start it from the top, that's a lot
Killed the sender for the message that I got
He won't talk, no he won't
Knuckles turn to white
Get a fuckin grip on life
There is nothing but the fight
Do it out of spite
Let's go
Bullet in my head seeing everything in red
Damn it feels good to be used
I'm just a mad motherfucker with more than a couple issues, and I got nothing to lose
I'm gonna
Hit the dirt with a smile
Make it worthwhile, I got nothing to prove
It's a long, long drop to a sudden stop
But God you gotta love the view
Yeah
Blood
This a villains game, keep my name out of your mouth
Never waste a body, make a point and feed the hounds
Break the ceiling made of glass
Take the world and paint it black
Drown in hate, take a breath
Started from the top, that's a lot
Killed the sender for the message that I got
He won't talk, he won't talk
Bitch I'm getting what I want
What I want ain't enough
They said Oscar that's enough
That's enough
That's a
Let's go
Bullet in my head seeing everything in red
Damn it feels good to be used
I'm just a mad motherfucker with more than a couple issues, and I got nothing to lose
I'm gonna
Hit the dirt with a smile
Make it worthwhile, I got nothing to prove
It's a long, long drop to a sudden stop
But God you gotta love the view
That's enough
That's a let's go
Bigmadyellynoise
Dammit!
There's a storm coming
Molotov in my hand, yeah the war starting
No pity for the weak
Motherfucker start running
I'll paint everything black
