		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess I'm doing the same shit I did before
Relationships back-and-forth and I
Still get bored
Light a match, you react, love to start a war
Then I back, nothing new
And you block the door
Telling me I should stay
And I say "what for?"
Then I lapse, say goodbye
Slam my car door, such an eye sore

But we know I'll be back and I hate that

I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the drama
Sending boys back crying to their mama
I could change but I really don't wanna
Dirty little habit, at least I'm good at it
I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the drama
Sending boys back crying to their mama
I could change but I really don't wanna
Dirty little habit, at least I'm good at it

Therapy isn't cheap, but I need somе help
So I keep coming back to distract myself
Pulling up to your house, doing it all again
Thе part that never ends

But we know I'll be back and I hate that

I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the drama
Sending boys back crying to their mama
I could change but I really don't wanna
Dirty little habit, at least I'm good at it
I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the drama
Sending boys back crying to their mama
I could change but I really don't wanna
Dirty little habit, at least I'm good at it

You're my bad habit, can't have it
You're too magnetic, so reckless

I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the drama
Sending boys back crying to their mama
I could change but I really don't wanna
Dirty little habit, at least I'm good at it
I'm an addict, I'm addicted to the drama
Sending boys back crying to their mama
I could change but I really don't wanna
Dirty little habit, at least I'm good at it
