		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm singing at hill.
Sing about the life's mystery.
Music is wonderful.
Can you hear my voice?
On the road.
In all over the world.
Why people keep causing pain?
Pride comes into ego.
And fairys goes away.
Stars are telling me.
"This is the journey
of your own.
it's starting from here."
Heart is burning like a fire.
The sky is blue and the rain
makes colorful rainbow.
Then find out the meaning
of life.
What a wonderful feeling!
Are you too scared about it?
Then, fight for yourself.
Suspense, Destroy, Survival,
So open the door.
There's something
waiting for you.
Here comes the fantasy.
Fate. This is the fate.
Any people dies any way.
Life is beautiful.
You won't even know.
And l'm singing right here.
Realize that life's mystery.
Music is wondeful,
fact can't solve
with one answer.
The sky is blue and the rain
makes colorful rainbow.
Then find out the meaning
of life.
What a wonderful feeling!
Are you too scared about it?
Then, fight for yourself.
Suspense, Destroy, Survival,
So open the door.
There's something
waiting for you.
Suspense, Destroy, Survival,
So open the door.
There's something
waiting for you.
la la la Here comes the fantasy
