		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An aptitude to self-destruct
Some get lost, shit out of luck
Your position is unjust
Who can trust you?
You got them eating out your palm
Back them up against the wall
Gotta kill them, watch them fall
Down around you
Down around you
Down around you
Down

Who can ignore this waging war?
It all became a blunder
When will you attest?
Life is a whore
Who will you fight in your
Dark, dark world?

Time to call upon the troops
Play a melancholy tune
Can you face the naked truth staring at you?
Never up to something good
Always could've, should've, would
Never not misunderstood
What can we do?
What can we do?

Who can ignore this waging war?
It all became a blunder
When will you confess?
Life is a whore
Who will you fight in your
Dark, dark world?

Form a coalition
With just one condition
You're always at the center of your
Dark, dark, dark, dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark world

Who can ignore this waging war?
It all became a blunder
When will you attest?
Life is a whore
Who will you fight in your
Dark, dark, dark, dark world?
