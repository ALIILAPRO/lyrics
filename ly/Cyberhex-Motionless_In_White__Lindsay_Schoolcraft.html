		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

There's no tomorrow
Life is but an echo
Scars become mementos
This is war (war)
Extinction
Ashes on your pale skin
Love becomes a symptom
Of the cure

Initiate cyberhex
Eliminate threat

I'd pull the sun from the sky
To freeze the future of time
And drift as one through the infinite (hold on)
I found asylum inside
Your armageddon eyes
I'd kill to kiss your apocalypse

Cold and corrosive
Fatal diagnosis, ring around the roses
Say goodbye (say goodbye)

We broke it down, to build it up
'Cause analogue life's digital enough
Initiate the cyberhex (cyberhex)
The only way to win is to reconnect
Stay alive, stay alive

I'd pull the sun from the sky
To freeze the future of time
And drift as one through the infinite (hold on)
I found asylum inside
Your armageddon eyes
I'd kill to kiss your apocalypse

Do you wanna live? (yeah)
Are you willing to die? (hoorah)
When heaven falls, I will be your light
Love will survive
In this hell, you are my paradise, ugh 

Ahh, walk with me to the edge
Take my hand, oblivion
My heart is yours till we meet again
I'll see you in oblivion

I found asylum inside
Your armageddon eyes
And drift as one through the infinite (oh, oh)
And though our fates synchronized
I wasn't willing to die
Until I kissed your apocalypse
Pick it up

Annihilate our end of days
Love will find a way
Death shatters, and after
A thousand suns (suns)
Hope has not rust (rust)
Love has found a way
I will not terminate
I will annihilate
