		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
These voices up in my head

All these voices up in my head
Making me dread, when I sleep at night
Visions of people with evil intentions want to fly my sight
Visions are changin, engagin, and ragin', I'm in a stage and a fight
Listen, the system is pissin' me off, you want to feel my pipe
Fingers pointed, anointed people, day better up to the knight
Whispers, darkness the hardest, time ain't never gonna feel alright
Feelin' my soul in the hole,
I can't breathe, and I'm frightened for my life
Think I need help or I dwell in hell, 'cause I got a grip too tight!

[Chorus: x4]
Will you ever get out of my head? 

Through every dimension as tension ahead, I gotta go my main
Dreams are like beans up like coming through my brain,
Then I know I'm baked
For every single minute that's in it, each and every brand new day
Denial of trial I'm vile, whatever that bullshit they say
I'm sinking so low in my self, help me gain, never give no break
Confusion is using me sinking me up, now the sky's all gray
I'm blazing and lifting my mind with kite, let me hit that J
Holding, controlling my self over, but the shit won't stay!

Will you ever get out of my head? [Repeat: x3]
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
Will you ever get out of my head? (Will you ever get out of my head!)
