		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's quiet
I can't breathe
I'm losing grip
And you just slip away from me
In the summer
Where you left me
I'm on the edge of losing it
Almost empty

To my senses now
To my senses now

Falling into you
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)
I'll come crashing through
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)

You're deadly
When you love me
I feel your pain as it runs through my body
Just a memory
That you can't see
These walls are filled with regret
Don't remind me

Falling into you
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)
I'll come crashing through
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)

To my senses now
To my senses now

To my senses now
To my senses now

Falling into you
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)
I'll come crashing through
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)
Falling into you
You only save yourself (you only save yourself)
