		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

I had a dream, I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind the walls of doubt 
A voice was crying out

Say you, say me
Say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Someone who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got someone there to say, "I'll show you"

Say you, say me
Say it for always (oh)
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me
Say it together, naturally

So you think you know the answers? Oh no
Well the whole world's got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
Time to start believing, oh yes
Believe in who you are
You are a shining star

Say you, say me
Say it for always
Oh, that's the way it should be
Say you, say me 
Say it together, naturally
Say it together, naturally
