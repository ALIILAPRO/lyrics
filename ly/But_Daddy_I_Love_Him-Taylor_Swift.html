		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you to cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutching their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

Too high a horse for a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door on my whole world
The one thing I wanted

Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, "But, daddy, I love him
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

"Stay away from her"
The saboteurs protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, "But, daddy, I love him
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me 
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinking it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

There's a lot of people in town that I 
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holding out, but fuck 'em, it's over

Now I'm dancing in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

Screaming, "But, daddy, I love him
I'm having his baby"
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
