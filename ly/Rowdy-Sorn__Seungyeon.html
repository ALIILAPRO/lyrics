		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a face they like to taste
Tasty-taste it gets em so rowdy, rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy

They got a face that don't behave
Fussy, fussy, why you so rowdy, rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy

Stop, take one step back 
Now what's this mess?
Explain yourselves
I'm not impressed 

You want a bite
But have you found
Your manners? No
So sit back down

Down, boy you acting so
Wild, get a grip on yourself
Gonna get the ick
If you don't stop now

Do you want to be caged?
If you like it that way
Come with me!
I know just the place 

What you doing with your shirt so ragged?
Haven't you noticed I got sta-sta-standards?
Think it's cute you think it work like that
M-m-maybe on another planet

I got a face they like to taste
Tasty-taste it gets em so rowdy, rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy

They got a face that don't behave
Fussy, fussy, why you so rowdy, rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy

Stop, take one step back 
Now what's this mess?
Explain yourselves
I'm not impressed 

You want a bite
But have you found
Your manners? No
So sit back down

When the beat get boring 
I get boys warring like it's Troy falling
I'm a Top 40 moment

Didn't mean to start a competition on a one-off invitation
I don't really wanna play 
Hard to get, I'm in a good position but you're messing up my vision with your ego barricade

I got a mission babe
Venus in retrograde 
We on a mission babe
Get out my way, way!

What you doing with your shirt so ragged?
Haven't you noticed I got sta-sta-standards?
Think it's cute you think it work like that
M-m-maybe on another planet

I got a face they like to taste
Tasty-taste it gets em so rowdy, rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy

They got a face that don't behave
Fussy, fussy, why you so rowdy, rowdy, rowdy
Rowdy, rowdy, rowdy

Stop, take one step back 
Now what's this mess?
Explain yourselves
I'm not impressed 

You want a bite
But have you found
Your manners? No
So sit back down
