		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo Joc
Yeah
I don't think they ready for this one

Cherish
They make me wanna lose control
Yeah
You know who it is
Joc, Dark Child

I''m in a wife beater two seater cruise control
Pull up and ya girl might lose control
Not playa's circle but a duffel bag boy
Guarantee they cant get enough of dat boy

Saw him from a distance and I watch him make his way to the bar
He walked up to me slowly whispers and he says I know who you are
I wanna get to know you

I can tell he was playa
But he knows just how to make ya
Lose control
Somehow I knew

[Chorus]
Shawty is a killa
But I really want him
And I gotta have him
Tonight
Shawty a heartbreaker
But it really don't matter
'Cause I really want him
Tonight

The way he licks his lips
I'm in a infatuated state of mind, oh yeah
He's so hard to resist
I gotta tell you baby boy you're so fine
Just gotta have you oh yeah

I can tell he was playa
But he knows just how to make ya
Lose control
If you only knew that Shawty is a killa

[Chorus]
Shawty is a killa
But I really want him (But I really want him)
And I gotta have him
Tonight (And I gotta have him)
Shawty a heartbreaker,
But it really don?t matter
'Cause I really want him
Tonight (Tonight)
Shawty is a killa
But I really want him
And I gotta have him
Tonight
Shawty a heartbreaker, (Heartbreaker)
But it really don't matter
'Cause I really want him
Tonight (Cause I really want him tonight Oh oh)

It feels so wrong that it must it must be right
And I'm so high don't wanna come down, just let me fly

[Young Joc]
Ay ay let me talk to um
My whips push but no car keys man
Pop the top like a sardine can
Wrist stay flooded like New Orleans man
Lil' boy cant stop I be ballin' man
Yeah I?m pretty sure dat ya heard da rumors
Got beef bull wit some big cawholas
I'm a pretty slick nigga like rick da rula
Keep one eye open and my hand on dat ruda
I rock da cladio
My shades gazel
I break hearts
I heartbreak hotels
I treat yo chick like a pair of ones
Wear ha ass out one good time and shawty

[Chorus]
Shawty is a killa (Shawty is a killa)
But I really want him (Oooh)
And I gotta have him
Tonight (Tonight)
Shawty a heartbreaker, (Shawty a Heartbreaker)
But it really don't matter (But it really don?t matter)
'Cause I really want him (Ohhh baby)
Tonight (Tonight)
Shawty is a killa (I want you baby)
But I really want him (Gotta have you baby)
And I gotta have him (Even if it's for tonight, I gotta have you)
Tonight
Shawty a heartbreaker, (Oohh)
But it really don't matter
'Cause I really want him (Cause I really want you)
Tonight (And I gotta have you)
