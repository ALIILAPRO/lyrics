		  (Once again, I'm locked in with TP, we finna make a hit)

I was writin' my raps while tappin' my chest 'cause I ain't even had no beat
I stopped complainin' 'bout my shoes, I saw a man had no feet
Nobody would throw your dog a bone, and I ain't had nothin' to eat
Now niggas wanna sit at Gucci table but I ain't even got no seats (no)
Ain't got no time but nothin' but money, niggas be broke and bummy (bums)
Nigga think I spent mine all on jewelry they must be a dummy (duh)
I'm hidin' in plane sight in they face they don't see me comin' (nope)
I never wanted to go to space, just point me to the money (go)
I ain't wanna go to college, went straight to the league (I went)
Start sellin' candy in school then I graduated to weed
Hung with the neighborhood OGs but none of the game was free (no)
When they in the kitchen they told us leave, they ain't even want us to see (skrrt-skrrt)
I seen a teenager turn to a crack and it was so depressin' (damn)
It made him age but he nineteen but his hairline regressin' (well, damn)
Them boogie hoes they turned me down they know they missed they blessin'
So broke I remember my girlfriend birthday came it had me stressin' (fuck)
This duck keep throwin' out subliminals like I wouldn't catch it (catch)
Like I won't send a nigga to the graveyard to send a message
Little bitch just dine and dashed, she ate my dick, couldn't stay for breakfast (eugh)
I'm a human lie detector test, I can peep who really flexin'

It's business it's not personal so don't get all emotional
If it ain't about the money what the fuck you in a business for?
Blood thicker than water but it's business it's not personal
And if you know like I know you would never take shit personal
It's business it's not personal so don't get all emotional
If it ain't about the money what the fuck you in a business for?
Blood thicker than water but it's business it's not personal
And if you know like I know you would never take shit personal (go)

I don't know you personally but get some business 'bout yourself (go)
All that bein' a yes man and dick ridin' that shit bad for your health
And when you stand on business, do it solo and please watch your step (well, damn)
And please don't go on IG live self-snitchin' and incriminate yourself
Rap game like the WWF, this shit fake as fuck
Nigga say he gon' rob me but he have better luck with an armor truck
The blogs keep bringin' my name up in a negative way to frame it up (no)
I got friends and they can't comprehend the way I leveled up (no)
Artist think we friends we really ain't, we just business partners 
Go off what you know not what you thin', mind your business partner
I just put a Lambo in each ear, I'm not talkin' Urus (shawty, swing my way)
You ain't worth a hundred million I can't take you serious (it's Gucci)
I'm at The Palms in the pitch spend 25K I'm workin' on my J
Niggas really Js and they be gay so I don't believe nothin' they say
Gucci how long have you been havin' your way? Since y'all done swing my way
Tell the haters I said fuck 'em go have a nice day, shooter got a Russian AK

It's business it's not personal so don't get all emotional
If it ain't about the money what the fuck you in a business for?
Blood thicker than water but it's business it's not personal
And if you know like I know you would never take shit personal
It's business it's not personal so don't get all emotional
If it ain't about the money what the fuck you in a business for?
Blood thicker than water but it's business it's not personal
And if you know like I know you would never take shit personal
