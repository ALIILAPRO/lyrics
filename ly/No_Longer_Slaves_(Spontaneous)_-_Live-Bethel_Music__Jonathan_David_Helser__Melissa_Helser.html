		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears have gone
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again, into a family
Your blood flows through my veins

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I am surrounded
By the arms of the father
I am surrounded
By songs of deliverance

We've been liberated
From our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters
Let us sing our freedom

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me and I
Stand and sing
I am child of God

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it
You drowned my fears in perfect love
You rescued me and I will
Stand and sing
I am child of God, yes I am
I am child of God
I am child of God, yes I am
I am child of God, full of faith, yes
I am child of God
I am child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
