		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to hurt you
I don't deserve you
Unlace your body, I want total control

Like maggots from the host
You drain, I decompose
Swallow your faith, submit and fuck until we overdose

We said this was the last time, over and over again

Blind eyes
Hands tied

The closer I get is the further I feel
And I am losing my grip on remembering what's real
'Cause our synthetic love is all that we know
My head is a mess and it's going to explode

I want to watch you,
Expose and drill through
Inject the poison, I have lost all control

Crawling inside of you
(The) fruit of the flesh is bruised
Swallow the pain, relive and fuck until we feel like new

We lost our heads and minds explode
I don't want trust in losing control
I'm just a slave to how this feels
(But) baby please don't believe this is real

I wrap my hand's around your throat
Bury your face, remove all your clothes
We're both just slaves that can't refuse
And everything that we have loved in the end we will lose
