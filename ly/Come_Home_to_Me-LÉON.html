		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left in the pouring rain
Saying I wouldn't be home again
I get so caught between everything I feel
I'm stubborn and I won't say sorry
Write it out 'cause I know that you worry
Wonder where I've been
Got you questioning

These tears are making me blind, I don't know why
I start a forest fire and burn us down
But you know at the end of the night, I'll come around

Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed
Maybe you made mistakes that got me on my knees
And maybe we're a mess, but it works for me
'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me

You keep to your side of the bed now
Cold shoulder, turning your head
Saying things that you don't mean, painful honesty
You cut me right through the centre
Throw my hands up, but I won't surrender
When did words become all our weapons? Mmh

These tears are making me blind, I don't know why
We start a forest fire and burn us down
But I know at the end of the night, you'll come around

Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed
Maybe you made mistakes, and that got me on my knees
Maybe we're a mess, but it works for me
'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home

Oh, love, hold me closer 'til we're old 'cause
You know that in your arms I feel at
Home, love, take me over, say you know now
You know, you know, you know, you know

Maybe I did you wrong and made you bleed
Maybe you made mistakes and it got me off my feet
Maybe we're just a mess, but it works for me
'Cause I know that every time you leave, you come home to me

Come home, come home, come home
