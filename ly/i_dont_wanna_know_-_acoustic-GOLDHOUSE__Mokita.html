		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "I've seen better days
Sometime's life's hard to take
It gets hard to face it all alone

You looked into my eyes
Your face I memorized
Didn't say a word but you felt like home

Fill my head up with dreams and melodies
Think I'm needing you more than you need me
Please don't let me go
Don't leave me alone
Think I'm needing you but I don't wanna know

If the skies about to fall
Or if we lose it all
If we make it or we don't
I don't wanna know
If the music starts to fade
And this feeling slips away
Don't wake me when you go
Cause I don't wanna know

I don't wanna know

I've been locked away
These shackles that I've made
Built a wall that couldn't keep you out
Baby don't tell me when, when this moments going to end
Like precious gold, I can't let you go

Fill my head up with dreams and melodies
Think I'm needing you more than you need me
Please don't let me go
Don't leave me alone
Think I'm needing you but I don't wanna know

If the skies about to fall
Or if we lose it all
If we make it or we don't
I don't wanna know
If the music starts to fade
And this feeling slips away
Don't wake me when you go
Cause I don't wanna know

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

If the skies about to fall
Or if we lose it all
If we make it or we don't
I don't wanna know
If the music starts to fade
And this feeling slips away
Don't wake me when you go
Cause I don't wanna know"
