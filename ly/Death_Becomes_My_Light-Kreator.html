		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe this is happening to me
Like the ultimate lucid dream
From dust to dust, to where I belong
Into the void, I'm coming home

A disembodied voice, a whisper in my ear
"Tell me why, why are you here?"

As we sail across the river Styx
Into Elysium or into the dark abyss?
The dark abyss!

My body separating from my soul
First time I can see
For the first time I am whole
Brightness, like shiny chromium
As I leave - this pandemonium
No mourning for the one I left behind
The source of everything
No more space and time
A universe, yet for you to see
All is one, and all is you and me

This must be my destiny
Death becomes my light
The only true reality
Death becomes my light
And in fear devils take my life away
And in peace all the angels sing to me
"Let us free YOU from this earth"
Death becomes me
Death becomes my light

Noli timere messorem
The beginning existence without end
Looking down as I become the light
The ones that went, before me in my sight
In this bleak, faceless entity
Religions will be joined a shamanic odyssey
Extol into a higher atmosphere
All my doubts and worries disappear

This must be my destiny
Death becomes my light
The only true reality
Death becomes my light
And in fear devils take my life away
And in peace all the angels sing to me
"Let us free you from this earth"
Death becomes me
Death becomes my light

Noli timere messorem
The beginning existence without end
Looking down as I become the light
The ones that went, before me in my sight
In this bleak, faceless entity
Religions will be joined a shamanic odyssey
Extol into a higher atmosphere
All my doubts and worries disappear

This must be my destiny
Death becomes my light
The only true reality
Death becomes my light
And in fear devils take my life away
And in peace all the angels sing to me
"Let us free you from this earth"
Death becomes me
Death becomes my light

All of the roles I have chosen to play
Now they mean nothing at all
All my celestial knowledge returns
Reviving as I leave the ground
The exhibit's open as I see my life
Pictures in ten golden frames
The end of the tunnel is leading a way
To where life and death are the same
I hear the voices surrounding my soul

Feeling the words they're repeating:
"You're not alone"
You're never alone

I hear the voices surrounding my eternal soul
Feeling the words they're repeating
"Your time has not come"
"Back to earth your time is yet to come"

I can't believe this is happening to me
Why have I returned to hate and tragedy?
Where confusion turns the world into hell
Back to famine, jealousy and greed
Tell me now, can no one see
This is all we have, we only fall as deep as
Into the arms of the universe
Don't be scared please don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
Please don't be afraid
