		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took a piece of my heart
I never thought that this could fall apart
You said you fell in love
And this was more than I had ever been afraid of
Another life
Another happy ending cuts like knife
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You got me deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, cause our souls have divided
How can it be that you're ready for love

Ready for love

How can it be that you're ready for love

Time will tell
A single day had helped me break this spell
Don't want to be alone
When will I be understood when is my kingdom to come
Another boy, another life
Another happy ending, and I'll be alive
Another place, another time
Another hand to touch, another sun to shine

You got me deeper than deep, I'm constantly blinded
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, cause our souls have divided
How can it be that you're ready for love

How can it be that you're ready for love

How can it be that you're ready for love
