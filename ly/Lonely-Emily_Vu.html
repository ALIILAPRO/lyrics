		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know you built some walls around you
And you're scared to break them down
But I love what I see behind 'em
Wanna make you feel strong at all your weakest points
That's what I feel, what I feel, what I feel for you, yeah
What I feel for you, yeah
And I been away for too long
On an island that's been cast away from better days
Tryna find my way through this maze to you
So now that we're together
I don't wanna be lonely
I just wanna waste all my time with you and you only
I don't wanna let go of all the dreams I had of starting something new
Take the chance and run away with you
I don't wanna be lonely
I just wanna waste all my time with you and you only
I don't wanna let go of all the dreams I had of starting something new
Take the chance and run away with you
Know it's hard to let your guard down
Cause you're used to getting burned
All I got are good intentions
Wanna make you feel strong at all your weakest points
That's what I feel, what I feel, what I feel for you, yeah
What I feel for you, yeah
And I been away for too long
On an island that's been cast away from better days
Tryna find my way through this maze to you
So now that we're together
I don't wanna be lonely
I just wanna waste all my time with you and you only
I don't wanna let go of all the dreams I had of starting something new
Take the chance and run away with you
I don't wanna be lonely
I just wanna waste all my time with you and you only
I don't wanna let go of all the dreams I had of starting something new
Take the chance and run away with you
