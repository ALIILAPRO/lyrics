		  Mmh
Ooh
Higher
Higher
Saying higher
Ayy

Tell me why you're crying now kini big deal 
(Higher, higher, higher, higher)
When you gave me something I don't really feel
(Higher, higher, higher, higher)
But you knew that already 
When I found you on the ground
You were dying (higher, higher, higher, higher)
Now you come into my yard, uninvited
Can you see me on the edge?
I'm enlightened (higher, higher, higher, higher)

If the world was ending
Would you cry or would try to get me?
Tell me now, I want you to be clear, yeah (tell me)
Tell me now, I need you to be clear, yeah (tell me)

I will wait for you, for you 
I will wait for you 
I will wait for you 

Get me
Can you put the time on a rewind, yeah?
Help me understand, can you tell me now?
Why you made the war that we're fighting now?
(Higher, higher, higher, higher)
And you fall and you run when you see my big guns
Run around, run away as the rebel comes out 
Then you call, call on me when you call me I come 
But there you go again (there you go)

With your deaf ears 
Open your mind to the sound of the trumpet
What do want from a life of the hopeless? (of the hopeless)
Now here you are and you're begging and crying (and your crying)
I want to fly, yeah, I'm flying 'til morning
Running away to the land of discovery 
Running away from the suffering, I'm gone, yeah 
Running away from the darkness, I'm out here, yeah (higher, higher)

Higher than all the limits 
Going way beyond the noise and your feelings
When you speak all I can hear is silence 
Turning back from all the pain and violence

Big tunes, now it's big tunes I'm killing
Cry now from the side now, call my name
Fall down when you see me, you know that
You know that I won't stay for you, you

I will wait for you for you, for you 
I will wait for you 
I will wait for you
