		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Usually, I put something on TV
So we never think about you and me

But today I see our reflections clearly in Hollywood
Laying on the screen

You just need a better life than this
You need something I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now

You can't fight it
You can't breathe
You say something so loving but
Now I've got to let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been faking me out
Can't make you happier now
