		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say you want a taste, then bottle me up
But I should warn you, once is never enough, uh, uh
Zero to sixty from the second we touched
You say you're falling in love

You just might get what you want
So you better think carefully
I'll have you upset the moons with me

I'll turn ya to a
Sleepwalker, dream of me wherever you go
If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker, eyes are burnin' open or closed
Thought you should know

I'm an obsession, not just a game
It feels like inception stuck in your brain, ooh
Sleepwalker, dream of me wherever you go
Remember, I told you so

So call me karma for the hearts that you broke
What goes around, comes back to kick down your door, uh, uh
I'll have you screamin', they'll call me Murder She Wrote
Before you hit the pillow

You just might get what you want
So you better think carefully
I'll have you upset the moons with me

I'll turn ya to a
Sleepwalker, dream of me wherever you go
If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker, eyes are burnin' open or closed
Thought you should know

I'm an obsession, not just a game
It feels like inception stuck in your brain, ooh
Sleepwalker, dream of me wherever you go
Remember, I told you so

I'll turn ya to a (yeah)
Sleepwalker, dream of me wherever you go
If I take you home, I'll turn you to a
Sleepwalker, eyes are burnin' open or closed
Thought you should know

I'm an obsession, not just a game
It feels like inception stuck in your brain, ooh
Sleepwalker, dream of me wherever you go
Remember, I told you so
