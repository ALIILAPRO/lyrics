		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She woke up in the morning
With the sunrise in her eyes
But all that she's seeing is darkness
She won't tell you why

No more butterflies 'cause they don't never last
Stolen from the light by demons of the past
It's always raining
But she keeps on praying

Oh, sunny days
Lift me when I'm down
Oh, sunny days
Break you through the clouds
Oh, sunny days

Oh, oh, ooh
She keeps on praying
Oh, oh, ooh
She keeps on praying
Oh, oh, ooh
She keeps on praying

All she needs is shelter
Shelter for the night
And this one could be heaven
But she's looking down the line

No more butterflies 'cause they don't never last
Stolen from the light by demons of the past
It's always raining
She keeps on praying

Oh, sunny days
Lift me when I'm down
Oh, sunny days
Break you through the clouds
Oh, sunny days

Oh, oh, ooh
She keeps on praying
Oh, oh, ooh
She keeps on praying
Oh, oh, ooh
She keeps on praying

Sunny days
Lift me when I'm down
Oh, sunny days
