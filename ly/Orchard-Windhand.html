		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss the feeling of the landslide
shaking the dust off my skin
what chokes the breath out makes my heart sigh
and now I feel at home again
this gun is good enough for meÂ 
I'm having trouble with the down-slide
can't pick myself up off the floor
getting so far up in the mean time
I am so high can't ever come back down
this gun is good enough for me
oceans apart now from your blue skies
I've found the water is too deep
but there is some comfort in this black tide
there is no secret that I can not keep
this gun is good enough for me
