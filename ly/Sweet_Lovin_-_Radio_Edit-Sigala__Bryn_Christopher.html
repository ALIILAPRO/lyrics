		  Sweet
Your sweet

Your sweet, sweet loving, won't you put it on me?
Keep me coming 'cause you're all that I need
You give me love, I'll give you everything that you want
As long as you love me

Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
Keep me coming, coming, me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
As long as you love me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
Keep me coming, coming, me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
As long as you love me

Your sweet
Yeah
Your sweet
Oh

Never felt like this
Prayers have been answered
Memories I won't forget
Always blind to see

Your sweet, sweet loving, won't you put it on me?
Keep me coming 'cause you're all that I need
You give me love, I'll give you everything that you want
As long as you love me

Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
Keep me coming, coming, me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
As long as you love me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
Keep me coming, coming, me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
As long as you love me

Anticipating what
You're gonna do with my love
In your arms, you will hold me
Hold me down with your love

Your sweet, sweet loving, won't you put it on me?
Keep me coming 'cause you're all that I need
You give me love, I'll give you everything that you want
As long as you love me

Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
Keep me coming, coming, me
Your sweet, sweet loving, loving, loving me
As long as you love me

Your sweet
Yeah
Your sweet
Oh
