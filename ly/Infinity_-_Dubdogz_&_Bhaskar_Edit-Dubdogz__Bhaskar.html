		  (Oh, you know we are the infinity)
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity

(Oh, you know we are the infinity)
Oh, you know we are the infinity

Don't know when it started and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I'm gonna get the bends
And I'm rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity

If you wanna, oh
You know we are the infinity 
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity

(You know, you know)

Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity

Oh, you-
Oh, you-
Oh, you-
Oh, you-

Oh, you know we are the infinity
Oh, you know we are the infinity

Don't know when it started and I don't know when it ends
I feel so much pressure that I'm gonna get the bends
Rolling and controlling in your vicinity
That's why everybody calls me Mr. Infinity

If you wanna be
Oh, you know we are the infinity
And if you wanna see
Oh, you know we are the Infinity

If you wanna be
Oh, you know we are the infinity
And if you wanna see
Oh, you know we are the Infinity (oh, you-)
