		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the house of a dead man (dead man)

The wind blows through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand

Missin' a part of me
I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be
The only one alone inside your head
Missin' a part of me
I know I need to shut my eyes again
I know it's hard to be
The only one alone

The wind blows through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand
The wind blows through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand

Drowin' in all my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend
Drowin' in all my regrets
All just the same in the end
Over and over again
All that we do is pretend

Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend
Lay me down, I'll start again
You're not around, I can't pretend
That I won't drown, that life won't end
I'm bleedin' out, I lost a friend

The wind blows through the window
At the house of a dead man
All alone in limbo
Holdin' onto a cold hand
