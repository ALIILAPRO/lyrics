		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Body shakes
I got rainbows running through my veins
And now
I just can't come down

Flying high
I'm still drowning in the chemicals
And now
I just can't come down
Diving head first into a black hole
Becoming unstable mentally
I'm tryin' hard to ride these tidal waves
Of un-filtered ecstasy

Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna heal so I'm self-medicating
And I don't wanna feel it now
Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Another dose just to keep me sedated
And let reality float away

Body shakes
I got rainbows running through my veins
And now
I just can't come down
Sinking deeper into a pit of snakes
As they dance to the melody
I got a time-bomb ticking in my chest
That's never felt so heavenly

Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna heal so I'm self-medicating
And I don't wanna feel it now
Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Another dose just to keep me sedated
And let reality float away

Take me over the edge
Don't wanna stop
And I'm not coming down again
Take me further away
Not gonna stop
And I'm never gonna be the same

Take me over the edge
Not gonna stop
And I'm never gonna be the same

Flying high
I'm still drowning in the chemicals
And now
I just can't come down

Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wanna heal so I'm self-medicating
And I don't wanna feel it now
Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Another dose just to keep me sedated
And let reality float away

(Another dose just to keep me sedated)
(And I don't wanna feel it now)

Another day but I don't wanna face it (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Another dose just to keep me sedated
And let reality float away
And let reality float away
Take me over the edge
