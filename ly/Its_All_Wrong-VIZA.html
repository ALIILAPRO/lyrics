		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hang with stalkers cause they're never a bore.
I play piano for the babies of war.
It's All Wrong!

I'll bring you roses, I'll spit on your chest.
I wear my heart on a bullet-proof vest.
It's All Wrong!

Suddenly there's light that hides your face...erase it.
Suddenly it's all wrong!

I'm made of honor, i'm made of the best.
I'm made in Chernobyl that's everyones guess.
It's All Wrong!

Suddenly there's light that hides your face...erase it.
Suddenly it's all wrong!
