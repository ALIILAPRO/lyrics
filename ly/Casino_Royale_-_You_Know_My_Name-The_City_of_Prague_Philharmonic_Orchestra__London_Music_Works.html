		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seven James Bonds at Casino Royale,
They came to save the world and win a gal at Casino Royale!
Six of them went to a heavenly spot,
The seventh one is going to a place where it's terribly...hot.

The formula is safe with ole double-oh seven!
He's got a redhead in his arms!
Oh, he's a lover, when you're in trouble

Have no fear, look who's here...James Bond...
They've got us on the run名ith guns再nd knives...
We're fighting for our lives...Have no fear, Bond is here...
He's gonna to save the world at Casino Royale!

Never fear, Bond is here!

The formula is safe with ole double-oh seven!
He's got a redhead in his arms!
Oh, he's a lover, when you're in trouble

Have no fear, look who's here...James Bond...
They've got us on the run名ith guns再nd knives...
We're fighting for our lives...Have no fear, Bond is here...
He's gonna to save the world at Casino Royale...
