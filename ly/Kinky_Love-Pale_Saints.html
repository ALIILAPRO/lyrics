		<p>
		  Kinky love
Kinky I'm mad about you
Kinky love
I need you so bad
I need you kinky love
Kinky you're all that I've been thinking of
Kinky take me inside and let the honey slide
I need you kinky love


Good to me
Kinky do all the things you should to me
Wake up I'm nervous
Sleep inside of me
Open your gates and let the river free
Oh kinky take me inside and let the honey slide
I need you kinky love


Late at night
In my bed as I lie here
Somewhere in limbo land
Half awake half asleep
Halfway somewhere else
I know I should be sleeping
But how can I close my eyes
When you know I understand you're mad(? )
And you've got to have your kinky love


I know I should be sleeping
But how can I close my eyes
When you know I understand you're mad(? )
And you've got to have your kinky love
Kinky I'm mad about you
Kinky love I need you so bad
I need you kinky love
Kinky you're all that I've been thinking of
Kinky take me inside
And let the honey slide
I need you kinky love
Oh kinky take me inside
And let the honey slide
I need you kinky love
