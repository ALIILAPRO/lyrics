		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me

See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me

Huh
Huh
Huh
Falling in and out of love
In love, in love,
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love,
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love,
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love

See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me

Huh
Falling in and out of love
In love, in love, in love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Your love, your love, your love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love
Huh
Falling in and out of love
Your love, your love, your love

Why can't you see it
Why can't you feel
In and out of love each time
Why can't you feel it
Why can't you see it
In and out of love

I keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Love is fade away

You keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Love is fade away

Keep keep running
I keep keep falling
Love is fade away

Huh
Away, away, away,
Away, let it fade away
