		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
Hey

Hey, I just fucked my ex bitch
Pull up on the next bitch
Like, "What's up? Give neck, bitch"
Please open your legs, bitch
No, I'm not your daddy, bitch
But I can be your daddy, bitch
Grab my legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the Addy, bitch
Know your daddy 'bout it
You a real bad bitch with a attitude
Know the whole school was fuckin' you
Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable, hey

So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
Hey

Hey, I just fucked my ex bitch
Pull up on the next bitch
Like, "What's up? Give neck, bitch"
Please open your legs, bitch
No, I'm not your daddy, bitch
But I can be your daddy, bitch
Grab my legs like a caddy, bitch
Really wanna fuck, send the Addy, bitch
Know your daddy 'bout it
You a real bad bitch with a attitude
Know the whole school was fuckin' you
Really mad a nigga was cuffin' you
Really make a nigga uncomfortable, hey

Hey
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
So where we go as we walk this lonely road?
So where we go?
