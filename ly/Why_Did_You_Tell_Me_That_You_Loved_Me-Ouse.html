		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the scars and they're not going
I laid eyes on you and i was frozen
You stole my heart and left me broken
There’s just one thing i’d like to know

Why did you tell me that you loved me?
Why did you tell me that you loved me?
You should have told me just to go

I should have told you i was broken
I never thought it would be this hard 
Now i'm alone and your with someone else
Can't seem to keep you of my mind

Why did you tell me that you loved me?
Can't seem to keep you of my mind
Why did you tell me that you loved me?
You should have told me just to go

The skies fall
There's a flaw in every star
When i'm lost
Always hope to hear your call
When you were there
I felt like i had it all
I strive on
But i'm afraid i’ll go to far
