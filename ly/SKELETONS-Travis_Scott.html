		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, ooh)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed (yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Louder (louder)
Higher, higher, higher, higher, higher (uh, yeah)
It's like standing in the ocean

We just rocked Coachella, I gave her half of the check
It was good sex, honorable mention to the neck
Didn't pass the loud, that was out of respect
Afterwards, pass the towel, I was out of Kleenex
If you take your girl out, do you expect sex?
If she take her titties out do you expect checks?
First visit, I gave her a pearl necklace
Next visit, I'ma need your girl naked
Took a church visit, you know, 'cause the world hectic

Like floating, if I can't be in time
I don't know, I don't know (wash on me, wash on me, yeah)
In the ocean, I can't be loved
I don't know a sound
(That's right)

Standing in the ocean (standing in the ocean) (ooh)
Echoing (echoing), echoing
Standing in the ocean
(Oh baby)
Feels like slow motion, we're floating at the speed
