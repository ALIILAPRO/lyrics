		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It took two days
For me to figure out
This isn't working out
But I lost my way

I drove all night
Just to be with you
But you weren't worth the view
I gotta hit the brakes

Now you know, get up and go

Arizona, Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona, Arizona
Is a million miles from Florida
Now you're history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Deep in your soul
Lies a lonely heart
That only ever pumps
For you alone

And I can't relate
So I gotta leave you here
I can breathe without you, dear
Just start walking away

Now you know, get up and go

Arizona, Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona, Arizona
Is a million miles from Florida
Now you're history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Tell me, how does that feel
With the Grand Canyon between me and you
Tell me, how does that feel to see me waving goodbye

Took two days
For me to figure out
This isn't working out
I gotta hit the brakes

Arizona, Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona, Arizona
Is a million miles from Florida
Now you're history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home

Arizona, Arizona
A car wreck on the highway
Now you're burning by the side of the road
Arizona, Arizona
Is a million miles from Florida
Now you're history
I'm stranded, get me out, I'm going home
