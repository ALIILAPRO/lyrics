		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life be like ooh-ah (yeah), ooh-ooh (yeah)
My life be like ooh-ah, ooh-ah (yeah), ooh-ooh
Ooh-ah (yeah), ooh-ooh (yeah)
My life be like ooh-ah, ooh-ah (yeah), ooh-ooh
My life be like (yeah)

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay
Feel me like a fingertip
(F-fingertip, f-fingertip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire, be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

I'm on an island by my lonesome stranded
Low key and stayin' candid, reflect on all the things I try my hand at
Search for the equations to persuasions I'm used to
Finding comfort in the zones of closet bones I get loose to
A mountainous fontaine, spinnin' and monsoonin'
Grinnin' it's high octane, explosive how I came
Rollin' down hills 'cause life's a hassle
Encircled by my folly like a moat surround a castle
Stay afloat catch a second wind, thin is the air I breathe
Teary eyed nose runnin', wipe the snot on my sleeve
I'm callin' on the savior to be all that I need
Please forgive me, my behavior had me lost at light speed

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay
Feel me like a fingertip
(F-fingertip, f-fingertip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire, be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

The fear of never fallin' in love
And the tears after losin' the feelings of what you thought love was
Like the dirt still up under the rug
(My life be like) bad characteristics covered in Christ's blood
The joy of new birth and the pain of growin' up
The bliss between giving my all and givin' up
The highs and lows, paths and roads I chose
In the cold I froze tryin' to ease my woes
In this world of sin, clothes to thin to fend
So to God I send words of help to win
In grumblings so deep, letters could never express
So the sounds of ooh-aah beneath my breath projects

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me. Please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay
Feel me like a fingertip
(F-fingertip, f-fingertip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire, be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

My life be like (don't be bad)
My life be like, ooh-ah-ooh
Dum dum diti, here comes that boy from the capital city
Last up on the Grits new ditty
But eight bars of the truth will do, uh
I believe there's a bride that's stunning
And I believe in the kingdom coming
I believe if you seek the truth
You don't need to look far 'cause it's gonna find you
So why-oh-why do I trip and stumble?
And ooh-ah as commitment crumbles
I can't believe I'm here again

My life be like
It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me, please come my way
Leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay
Feel me like a fingertip
(F-fingertip, f-fingertip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire, be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

It's times like these that make me say
Lord if you see me, please come my way
Like leavin' bread crumbs for when I stray
Rely on sacrifice and the price you pay
Feel me like a fingertip
(F-fingertip, f-fingertip)
Sometimes I fall, I slip
My heartfelt desire, be more like you
Trying not to quench your fire with the things I do

F-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip
My life be like
F-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip
My life be like
F-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip
My life be like
F-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip, f-fingertip
My life be like
