		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wake up early, sometimes at 5:30 to run
My mom got too worried, I had to tell her it was fun
Oh, I feel like a failure if I don't skip breakfast and lunch
I'm chasing a body I know that I'll never outrun

'Cause I'll always wish I was smaller than this
And I just can't quit pulling at my skin
Oh, I'm scared that I'm never gonna like
How I look and I wish I knew why
'Cause I'll always wish I was smaller than this

I'll set a goal for myself and I'll try to work hard
I'll reach it but swear I look just like I did from the start
I know that it's not true but I feel like I'm the only one
Who's chasing a body I know that I'll never outrun

'Cause I'll always wish I was smaller than this
And I just can't quit pulling at my skin
Oh, I'm scared that I'm never gonna like
How I look and I wish I knew why
That I'll always wish I was smaller than this

I was smaller, I was smaller, I was smaller
I wish I was
I was smaller, I was smaller, I was smaller
I wish I was

I'll always wish I was smaller than this
And I just can't quit pulling at my skin
Oh, I'm scared that I'm never gonna like
How I look and I wish I knew why
That I'll always wish I was smaller than this
