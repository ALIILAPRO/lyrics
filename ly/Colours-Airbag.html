		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time for you to fix me 
'Cause I can't breathe
It wasn't my intention
to let things go this far
All the big ideas 
I've kept inside 
I guess it doesn't mean 
that much to you

Don't you wanna hear
Don't you wanna see
The colours in my head

No need to lose your hope now
I owe you all you need
But I'm out of function
cold and scared inside
This fairytale is almost complete 
Like a million lies
But I guess it doesn't 
mean that much to you 

Don't you wanna hear 
Don't you wanna see 
The colours in my head 
The colours in my head
