		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who fears the ticking of the clock
When centuries are passing in seconds
Black is the color of my past
A product of society's abuse

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You're the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
Forever be my therapy

I need your voice to fill the void
A lullaby to sooth my rejection
Pure disinfection of the heart
Before this silence tears my soul apart

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You're the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
Forever be my therapy

I walk alone
On the path of self-extinction
With all these chains to pull me down
Come at night
Luminate my inner chambers
And leave the light on when you go
Please don't go
Please don't go
Don't go

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You're the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
Forever be my therapy

Come and take me off my daily dose of pain
Take me off and shelter me
From this static nothing
You're the antidote
For solitude injected in my veins
May the touch of your hand
Forever be my therapy
