		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This town will never change
People come and go, it's all the same
Speed the roads on our doubting days
To any place that's far away
I never learned anybody's name
We all vowed that we wouldn't stay
Kissing signs on the interstate
All we do for now is sit and wait

In our idle town
in our idle town

Yeah, we invent our own little games (in our idle town)
When the lights out at the stadium, hey (in our idle town)
Making life a spinning arcade (in our idle town)
And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
We watch the sunrise
We watch the sun

Springtime when the air is thin
We're getting antsy and they're noticing
While everybody's off partying
We're watching stars over ice-cream
And now we're kicking up to seventh gear
And we're breathing in the atmosphere
And I don't even need a sip of beer
Yeah, I can feel it all

In our idle town
In our idle town

Yeah, we invent our own little games (in our idle town)
When the lights out at the stadium, hey (in our idle town)
Making life a spinning arcade (in our idle town)
And curfew's at midnight, we watch the sunrise
We watch the sunrise
We watch the sun

And they watched the sunrise
Blinking out of red eyes, and sore minds
The airplanes keep flying by, and they cry
'Cause they've never even touched the sky
No, they'll never even touch the sky

Yeah, we invent our own little games (in our idle town)
And everybody's trying to escape (in our idle town)
Killing time at the yellow caf√© (in our idle town) 
And curfew's at midnight (in our idle town)

Yeah, I think that we'll all be okay (in our idle town)
The idle town will stay as it stays (in our idle town)
And everyone I love's in this place (in our idle town)
'Til curfew's at midnight
We watch the sunrise
