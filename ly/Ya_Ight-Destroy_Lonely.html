		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah ight, come through I'm fly like a mufuckin' kite
Lil' bitch you should know that I'm already high
I'm a young nigga and I been reachin' new heights
Psht, Okay... Yeah, ight 
Yeah ight, I didn't hit that bitch once 
I hit her twice
I look at the clock and it say it's bout five
Goddamn, I been stuck in this bitch all night
And I couldn't get no sleep had to catch me a flight

Damn, it feel like I'm stuck in the sky
Damn, I keep workin' I don't get tired
Damn
Yeah
Okay
Ight
I got an iPhone ten not the five
That's not my main phone, that's just the side
Damn, that's not my main bitch, that's just the side
"Which one do I choose dawg? I can't decide"
Yeah don't come outside
We got that fye and you fuck niggas fried
These blue hundreds my main dish lettuce the side
And this is a real bad bit let that hoe come inside
My boy got that shit on his side
Don't try him or this shit get violent
This Margiela shit, whisper in libraries
Dollar signs just keep 'em in silence 
Damn
Yeah
Okay
Ight
Yes I'm a car on the beat how I ride
I'm touchin' so many racks they think I signed
And I pay like 45 bucks for a line
If these hoes wanna fuck make 'em line up
And these boys they not tough they not tryin' us
Yeah break her back make that bitch pick her spine up
And then I got buy her expensive designer
This money it get all my time bruh 
That lil' boy he burnt and his mufuckin time up
I cook this shit up I need me a timer
And I'm lookin' for your bitch but I can't find her
I got her wet like an island
Ya know I'm a slimeball
Yeah Im sippin' lean it's not wine dawg

Yeah ight, come through I'm fly like a mothafuckin' kite
Lil' bitch you should know that I'm already high
I'm a young nigga and I been reachin' new heights
Psht, Okay
Yeah, ight 
Yeah ight, I didn't hit that bitch once I hit her twice
I look at the clock and it say it's bout five
Goddamn, I been stuck in this bitch all night
And I couldn't get no sleep had to catch me a flight
