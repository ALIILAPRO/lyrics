		  Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride

Lavender Lamborghini, roll up in a blue bikini
Bitches on the beaches, lookin' super cute and freaky
All my friends are princesses, we keep it whipped and creamy
Ice cubes on our tongues, because we like to keep it freezy
Lavender Lamborghini, get out on the right side
Chauffeur stayed at home, because my girl wanted to ride
Lookin' luxe and tastin' plush, I'm feelin' so alive
Want to take it to the highway, come on, let's go for a drive, uh

All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time
So let's ride

(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride
(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride

Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride
Let's ride

Bubblegum-pink Ferrari, yeah, I'm so bossy
Speedin' like Alonso just to crash your party
People are goin' loco when I'm pullin' up, takin' your puppy
Don't think about consequences, 'cause they're never gonna stop me, what?

All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time, a good time
So let me ride, let me ride
(Let me ride, let me ride)
All my life, I've been waitin' for a good time
So let's ride

(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride
(Vroom vroom) Bitches know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Cute, sexy and my ride's sporty
(Vroom vroom) Those slugs know they can't catch me
(Vroom vroom) Beep beep, so let's ride

Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Boom, boom, boom
Hear me comin' through the radio
(No they can't catch me)
Watch me go zoom, zoom, zoom
(No they can't catch me)
Try to catch me, but you're too slow
Too slow, too slow
