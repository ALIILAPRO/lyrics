		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been down this road before, and I don't know what to do
I've my same mistakes, and Lord, I can't help myself, it's true
When we go all night
Forget everything I do
I've been down this road before, and tonight I'm taking you
Let's get it

I've been down this road before, and I don't know what to do
I've made my same mistakes and Lord, I can't help myself, it's true
When we go all night
Forget everything I do
I've been down this road before, and tonight, I'm taking you
Yeah

Four, five, six, hit all the right shit
Showin' up the party in a red lipstick
Spending all the money 'til they got nothing
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (hit it)
Tight shirt, tight jeans, so mean
Everybody looking at the dancing queen
She lookin' at you, and you know that she means
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Get it

It's true
It's true
Heaven ain't calling me
Heaven ain't calling me
Yeah, it's true
It's true
Heaven ain't calling me
Heaven ain't calling me

I've been down this road before, and I don't know what to do
I've made the same mistakes and Lord, I can't help myself, it's true
When we go all night
Forget everything I do
I've been down this road before, and tonight I'm taking you
Let's get it
Let's get it
I'm taking you
Let's get it, yeah
I've been down this road before, and tonight, I'm taking you
Let's get it
Yeah

Four, five, six, hit all the right shit
Showin' up the party in a red lipstick
Spending all the money 'til they got nothing
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (hit it)
Tight shirt, tight jeans so mean
Everybody looking at the dancing queen
She lookin' at you, and you know what she means
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop (yeah)

It's true (it's true)
It's true (it's true)
Heaven ain't calling me
Heaven ain't calling me
Yeah, it's true
It's true
Heaven ain't calling me
Heaven ain't calling me
Heaven ain't calling
