		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You might think i've got it all figured out
But i'm as lost as you
And yeah i try
To work on all my problems
But i keep on falling down
I been laying all night
Waiting for your call
Waiting for you coming, running back to me again
And i been going crazy
Lookin' at the photos
Look back at the past yeah
Was it all a dream?
Mmm
Mmmm
It might be dark outside
But there's a sun behind the clouds
So just hold on a little longer
I promise things gonna be alright
I been laying all night
Waiting for your call
Waiting for you coming, running back to me again
And i been going crazy
Lookin' at the photos
Look back at the past yeah
Was it all a dream?
Yeah i been going crazy
Lookin at the photos
Look back at the past yeah
Was it all a dream?
