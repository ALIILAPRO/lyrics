		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should have seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was somethin' missin'
You should have known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead, but you never bled
Instead you laid still in the grass, all coiled up and hissin'

And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us
Baby, way before them, and we're still together
And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on lovin' you

And I meant
Every word I said
When I said that I love you I meant that I love you forever

And I'm gonna keep on lovin' you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on lovin' you

Baby, I'm gonna keep on loving you
'Cause it's the only thing I wanna do
I don't wanna sleep, I just wanna keep on lovin' you
