		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every man gotta right to decide his own destiny
And in this judgment there is no partiality
So arm in arms with arms 
We'll fight this little struggle
'Cause that's the only way 
We can overcome our little trouble

Brother, you're right, you're right
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We gon' fight (we gon' fight)
We'll have to fight (we gon' fight)
We gonna fight (we gon' fight)
Fight for our rights

Natty dread it inna (Zimbabwe)
Set it up in (Zimbabwe)
Mash it up-a inna Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans ah liberate (Zimbabwe), mh

No more internal power struggle 
We come together to overcome the little trouble
Soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionary
'Cause I don't want my people to be contrary

And, brother, you're right, you're right
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We'll have to fight (we gon' fight)
We gonna fight (we gon' fight)
We'll have to fight (we gon' fight)
Fighting for our rights

Mash it up inna (Zimbabwe)
Natty trash it inna (Zimbabwe)
Africans ah liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
I and I ah liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)

Brother, you're right, you're right
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We gon' fight (we gon' fight) 
We'll have to fight (we gon' fight) 
We gonna fight (we gon' fight)
Fighting for our rights

To divide and rule could only tear us apart
In every man chest, mh, there beats a heart
So soon we'll find out who is the real revolutionaries
And I don't want my people to be tricked by mercenaries

Brother, you're right, you're right
You're right, you're right, you're so right
We'll have to fight (we gon' fight)
We gonna fight (we gon' fight) 
We'll have to fight (we gon' fight)
Fighting for our rights

Natty trash it inna Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Mash it up inna Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Set it up inna Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans ah liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans ah liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Natty dub it inna Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Set it up inna Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)
Africans ah liberate Zimbabwe (Zimbabwe)

Every man got a right to decide his
