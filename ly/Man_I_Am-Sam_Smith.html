		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This one is for the boys
With your greased up and heavy metal toys
So beefed up, you can't get through the door
It's your time to break through
Bad man to the rescue
Barbie, your time is up
You will not take our voice

See, I'm the groove catcher, hottest thing
Six pack and tight G-string
No, I'm not gay, bro
But I've been on that lay low
Strip clubs and dollar bills
Wall street and dirty deals
Popstars, exotic pills
Cars with dirty wheels

'Cause that's the man I am
Baby, treat me right, I'm free tonight
That's just the man I am
Super sleazy, born to be easy

And all the papers say that there's no Ken without Barbie
But, baby, there's no woman who could possibly stop me
That's just the man I am
Super sleazy, sexy and freaky Ken, tonight

Whoa, whoa
Sexy and freaky Ken, tonight
Whoa, whoa
Sexy and freaky Ken, tonight

It's time you realize
That in this world, we've all been taught a lie
You think that women rule the world
But, baby, where I've been
All the things I've seen
This Ken has crossed the borderline

See, I'm the groove catcher, hottest thing
Six pack and tight G-string
No, I'm not gay, bro
But I've been on that lay low
Strip clubs and dollar bills
Wall street and dirty deals
Popstars, exotic pills
Cars with dirty wheels

'Cause that's the man I am
Baby, treat me right, I'm free tonight
That's just the man I am
Super sleazy, born to be easy

And all the papers say that there's no Ken without Barbie
But, baby, there's no woman who could possibly stop me
That's just the man I am
Super sleazy, sexy and freaky Ken, tonight

Whoa, whoa
Sexy and freaky Ken, tonight
Whoa, whoa
Sexy and freaky Ken, tonight

Whoa, whoa
Sexy and freaky Ken, tonight (this one is for the boys)
Whoa, whoa
Sexy and freaky Ken
