		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I've been out walkin'
I don't do that much talkin' these days
These days
These days I seem to think a lot
About the things that I forgot to do
For you
And all the times I had the chance to

And I had a lover
But it's so hard to risk another these days
These days
Now if I seem to be afraid
To live the life I have made in song
Well, it's just that I've been losin' for so long

Well, I'll keep on movin', movin' on
Things are bound to be improvin' these days
One of these days
These days I'll sit on corner stones
And count the time in quarter tones to ten, my friend
Don't confront me with my failures
I had not forgotten them
