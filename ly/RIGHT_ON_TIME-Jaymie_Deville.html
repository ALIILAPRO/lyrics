		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need someone 
To help me forget 
All my problems 
All my problems 
Feeling unstable 
Walking in the darkness 
What's a woman like you
Doing in this place anyway? 
I don't want to stay in LA 
I be on a morning flight 
Maybe, you can change my mind?
Maybe, we can meet up in middle of the night? 
And you could make me feel alright?
Baby, I can see it on your eyes 
You don't want to say you're in love
When it's lust
Wanna go slow, baby
I don't want to rush 
I don't want forever
I don't want no love
Won't you give me that?
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Get it
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Hit it right on time
Hit it more than twice
Hit it right on time
Give me that
Put it on me, babe (put it on me, babe)
I like the feeling when you put it on me, baby (put it on me, baby)
And you like the feeling when I'm fucking on you babe (babe)
And I got the feeling that you, (Feeling that you)
The feeling that you
You want to know
What's on my mind
How about you find out?
What I've been thinking about
Well, you're about to find out 
Baby, I'll give you the things that you can't live without.
If you want it right now. 
You've got to give it to me 
Right on time
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time (Ooo)
Get it
Right on time (Right on time)
Hit it
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Hit it
More than twice
Hit it
(Right on time)
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Get it
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
Give me that
(Right on time)
Hit it
Right on time
Hit it
More than twice
Hit it
Right on time
Give me that
Right on time
Hit it
Right on time
