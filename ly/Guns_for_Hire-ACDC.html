		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The word is out that I'm about
And I've come gunning for you
I'm a real entertainer, a mischief maker
A lover of no fixed abode
Quick draw on the floor
No law give you more
Sweet talker, lover of sin
You are what you got 
You get what you want
Look out woman

I got guns for hire
Shoot you with desire
The guns for hire
Shoot you with desire

I'm a wanted poster
A needed man
Running right across the land
I'm a smooth operator
A big dictator
Gonna mark you with my brand

My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
Got gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire

(Quick draw on the floor, big shot)

Hot to trot, big shot
Take a lot
Never get the drop on me
I'm a real entertainer
Mischief maker
Lover in seven languages

My gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire
This gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire

Shoot you with desire
Shoot you with desire
A gun's for hire
Shoot you with desire

What you get, but shot
You can't get the drop on me, girl
