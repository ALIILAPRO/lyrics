		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lights exploded
She stood burning in front of me
She ripped my heart out and gave it to me
My eyes wouldn't open, cemented to her face
Have I begun a feeble chase?
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
It's only everything standing in front of me
I know what you did to me
I know what you did was wrong
You're allowed to torture me
Wait a moment until I'm gone
I know you're the ticket, you gotta be
Cause I let you be alone for long
Got to be so completely
Got to be so I can't hang on
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
I'll just stare and hope you'll care
It's only everything standing in front of me
I'll be down, I'll be around
I'll be hanging where eventually you'll have to be
They're not there, you're standing there
Now you'll have to decide the fate of my sanity
