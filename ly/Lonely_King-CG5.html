		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The role of the king is a lonely one to play,
But cards in the ring have been dealt in the wrong way.
The role of the king is a lonely one to play,
No matter the lives of the people before me,
All that I seek is the path to glory, glory.

Chips in my pocket and blood stains on my hands,
I'm building my legacy right here in the sand.
Iâ€™ll stay until the end and watch it go down in flames
Yeah, maybe the path is gory,
Whatever it takes to get my glory, glory.

I was told I had to walk away,
Leave my enemies to rot in their own grave.
But scars don't heal, I've given blood a taste.
I'll fake the smile they've seen before,
They'll see I am so much more.

SO,
The rule of the land, it's so crucial to obey.
Believe in yourself, or you won't be appreciated.
Don't you overthink it, just do what I say.
Lay the politics out before me,
Whatever it takes to get my glory.

YOU!
You need all the power and the fame.
Cuz that's the game.
You've been kicked into the sand.
I've built something better than
What you could ever dream of on your own.

The role of the king is a lonely one to play,
But cards in the ring have been dealt in the wrong way.
The role of the king is a lonely one to play,
No matter the lives of the people before me,
All that I seek is the path to glory.
