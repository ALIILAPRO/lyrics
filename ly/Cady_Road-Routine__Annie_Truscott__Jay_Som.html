		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking under the desert sun
Every day this week
I ask myself the same things
And that's okay
And that's okay

Relax
It's fine
You don't have to know this time

Stoking the fire of the past
The present melts away
And that's okay
Phone a friend or two
Tell me nothing new
And that's okay
And that's okay
And that's okay

Relax
It's fine
Just give it time
Time, time, time
