		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Super love
They will never love you babe, like I love you babe

I'm sophisticated, super classy, Uncle Luke, freak, nasty
I'm tryna make you my baby daddy
Got me bouncing on it, I'm acrobatic
You got me riding on that, riding on that, grinding up in this bitch
Banana all in that split, bet them girls can't do you like this
So I heard you're out here looking for me, and I wanna know if it's true
If you've been looking for love, then I've been looking for you

I want you, I want you, I want you to be my baby
Settle down, we'll settle down then give you a baby
Put it down, boy, put it down and make me act all crazy
I might let you change me, boy I can arrange it, yeah

They will never love you babe (They will never love you)
Like I love you babe
Say you'll never take my love away
Say you'll never take my love away
They will never touch you babe (They will never touch you)
Like I touched you babe (They will never, no, no)
Baby, say you promise you will never change
You know, you know, you know

This the one right from the start (What?)
Hitting on your girl like, "ooh Lord!"
This the type of boy who want to break your heart
So I'm praying for you, baby, like, "ooh God!"
First one to make me wanna drag a hoe
I could care less about this before
Jealousy, envy, madness
On this song like asterisk
I'm so in love, I'm passionate
Fuck that shit, I'm passionate
This is what love in Paris is
That young love, immaculate

I'm your girl, and I wanna be forever
You my world and we'll always be together
Superlove, nothing will ever break this up
And my love will be enough

They will never love you babe, like I love you babe
Say you'll never take my love away (Say you'll never, say you'll never)
Take my love away
They will never touch you babe, like I touched you babe
Baby, say you promise you will never change
You know, you know, you know

You got me riding on that, riding on that, grinding up in this bitch
Banana all in that split, bet them girls can't do you like this
You got me riding on that, riding on that, grinding up in this bitch
Banana all in that split, bet them girls can't do you like this
(Superlove)

They will never touch you babe (No, no, no, no, no)
Like I touched you babe (Like I touch you, baby)
Baby, say you promise you will never change (Promise you will never change)
You know, you know, you know
