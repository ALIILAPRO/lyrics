		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Listen

I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh)
I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock

Know when you criticize me, before you try to, do me a solid
Take a short walk in my shoes
My boots, my kicks, my flip-flops, whatever
I done seen rain and I ain't just talkin' weather
But I'm a survivor
Shame on you if you thought I would ever leave
I'm a be right there where the legends be
I am unbreakable, I'm Rock, I am never weak now
I feel weak sometimes, but you'll never see
I'm going through one of the roughest times in my entire life right now
Still I got a slight smile
I'm knowin' it's gonna be better days, like Tupac said
And we go make it like Eve & them two LOX said
Whos not fed up with something
Life's about struggling and overcoming your shortcomings
Not about huffing and puffing and crying without doing nothing
Take them sour lemons, make lemonade, and stop sucking

I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh)
I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock

Rock like coal is, old and dusty
But, y'all already know what's underneath
Give me some time, and keep applying pressure
Watch me shine like the ex-BadBoy
It'll all be fine (all be fine)
Just dig down deep, search for that energy
I can't lose, get in touch with that inner energy
Game face on, see this mug, you'll remember me
Focus out the pain, ignore any injury
Then again, I am Rock, can't really injure me
Chip off a piece, all you're gonna get is a little me
Got one from almost every tough time in my history
Hence the new team, ROCK BROVAAAAAAZ, are you still with me?
Got a bunch more, they're in my last stage of misery
My little Gz, that's strength in me, are you kidding me?
I get stronger every time they try to finish me
We don't die, we multiply, can I get a witness, please?

I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh)
I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock

Sometimes I can't go on
But I am so strong, I really can go on
I ain't saying so long, I ain't goin' home
Rock Man goin' hard, 'til I can't no more
Tomorrow is Friday the thirteenth, me and bad luck
Been have beef, he can't hurt me, he can't serve me
I win every time I see him, even with all his undermining cheatin
Every time I beat him I think the odds must be his crew (huh?)
Word, they've always been against me, too (huh?)
They can't see me neither, anyone thinking he could, keep me out my championship, he fooled

I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh)
I am Rock, it ain't no breakin' me
I am Rock, it ain't no shakin' me
I am Rock, that ain't no earthquake, it's me
I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock (ohh) I am Rock
