		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Oh my God, Ronny

It's a vibe, yeah
Feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet
Got a nigga throwed (yuh, yuh)
So much ice, yeah
Fantasize, yeah
The city lights, got a nigga so
Yeah, day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night, got a nigga so
Yeah, day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night

Don't crash, don't crash, you're movin' too fast now
More cash, more cash, might throw it on her ass now
Butterfly on the whip, that's a nigga doors
All my hoes super thick and don't keep no legs closed
I got stripes like Adidas do, uh
My whip the color of Betelgeuse, uh
Peter Pan, Gucci Mane, look at you, uh
Nigga you hatin', you bitchin', you, ayy
Niggas be watchin' like bitches and, uh
Niggas boyfriend gon' get that shit, ayy
These niggas bored, they irrelevant, ayy
Niggas be watchin', these niggas be

It's a vibe, yeah
Feeling right, yeah
Keep it quiet
Got a nigga throwed (yuh, yuh)
So much ice, yeah
Fantasize, yeah
The city lights got a nigga so
Yeah, day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night, got a nigga so
Yeah, day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night
Through the day and night
