		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I found a reason to wake up
Coffee in my cup, start a new day
Wish we could do this forever
And never remember mistakes that we made

I told you I loved you when we were just friends
You kept me waiting and I hated you then
Gave it a few a years, you settled your debts
But I never got over the secrets I kept

It all works out in the end
Wherever you go, that's where I am
Boulders turn into sand
Wherever you go, that's where I am

Now when I wait in your doorway
Covered in flowers, I think of her
The woman that you once dated
I couldn't relate to her glitter and furs

Who were you then and who is she now?
Did she know that we were together somehow?
You never touched me, but I felt you everywhere

It all works out in the end
Wherever you go, that's where I am
Even boulders turn into sand
Wherever you go, that's where I am

That's where I am
That's where I am

No, I'll never find another, no one else can do it better
When we're together it feels like heaven
You're the only one I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you
No, I'll never find another, no one else can do it better
When we're together it feels like heaven
You're the only one I ever wanted
All I ever really wanted was you

It all works out in the end
Wherever you go, that's where I am
Even boulders turn into sand
Wherever you go, that's where I am

That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am (wanted was you)
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am
(You're the only one I ever wanted)
(All I ever really wanted was you)
That's where I am

Ooh
