		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seen all good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so
Battered and brought to the ground
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, saying
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?

If you walk out the door
Will I see you again?
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends

When I'm like this
How can you be smiling, saying
How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore)
How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore)
How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore)
How can you be sure? (I don't want you anymore)

I don't want you
I don't want you
Anymore
I don't want you
I don't want you
Anymore
