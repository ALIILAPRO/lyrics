		  (Wheezy outta here)

Everybody 'round me say I'm doin' too much
When I got some problems, yeah, the drugs come clutch
Shoutout to the opps, we got another cold case
Shoutout to my shooter, he ain't showin' no face
Shoutout to the driver, fuck 12, he did the race
They typin' on computers, only letter I know is K's
Pull up to the show, I send a hit and hit the stage
Married to the game, I go to war and I engage

What you think? We got all the drink, I'll pour a gallon up
I'm a jerk, take a half a Perc, I fuck with stamina
Money and fame, with a little game, I get the best of her
Eco friendly, I just went electric, bought the Tesla

Wheezy play some beats, I think the E kicked in, I'm ready
Grindin' on my teeth, I got no food inside my belly
I just put all my diamonds on, I'm feelin' petty
Get my cake, I will always be there for my confetti
Animal inside a Lamb', got horses inside the motor
Got a bitch named Nina, and she love it when I tote her
We ain't fallin' for that tough guy shit, that huff and puffin'
It's end of discussion, you don't want these repercussions

I just bought lil' shorty twenty Birkins, now they scared of her
Louis drenched her off and I walked in and I'm Hermes up
I told that bitch to call me papi, I got my turbans up
I'm rich as fuck, really you need to switch the topic up
Hickory, dickory, dock, gotta run up my salary and run my credits up
I just bought four bitches the same watch because I'm petty as fuck
Camera in the rearview Lambo and I seen them speedin' up
Ayy, what you want? I keep my bitch to get her tummy tucked
Too many cameras in the club gotta keep it low, gotta hit his tummy up
Pushed up nose on a brand new with a .44 but today I'm Tommy'd up
Sick of these broke ass, petty ass niggas and hoes, bitch, I'm goals
Birthday came and I bought me a two-tone roof and it's suede and it's Rolls
Cash got the two-tone AP, Vegas edition, my nigga, you're bold
Birthday on cake and these bitches, not fakin' with bitches, I'm real as the road
Keep a few tools and niggas that's all in they feelings and ready to explode
Drop my chain on the ground and now this bitch gotta dry her toes

Wheezy play some beats, I think the E kicked in, I'm ready
Grindin' on my teeth, I got no food inside my belly
I just put all my diamonds on, I'm feelin' petty
Get my cake, I will always be there for my confetti
Animal inside a Lamb', got horses inside the motor
Got a bitch named Nina, and she love it when I tote her
We ain't fallin' for that tough guy shit, that huff and puffin'
It's end of discussion, you don't want these repercussions
