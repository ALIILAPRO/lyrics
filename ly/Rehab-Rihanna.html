		  Baby, baby
When we first met, I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped in one with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shock that spun me around
And now my heart's dead
I feel so empty and hollow

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like

Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease

Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'd do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way than I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
It gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you

And I never gave myself to another the way I gave it to you
You don't even recognize the way you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like

Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease

(Uh, uh, now, ladies, gimme that)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
(Uh, now gimme that)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
(My ladies, gimme that)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
(Uh, now gimme that)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed

It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
And, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause, baby, you're my disease
