		<p>
		  (Sil on the beat)
I got the late hours on the way home
She told me to pull up and it won't take long
Drama, won't put up with that, I'll take phone
(That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby)
Yeah, she get it back when shee leave 'cause she grown
Yeah, she get it back when she leave 'cause she grown

Pick up my babies then drop me a hit
I'm underrated, been poppin' my shit
I came up off of CDs I bought from a lick (oh)
Niggas can't see me, I'm raw as it get
Stiff on these bitches, you not what it is (no)
Can't give you nothin', this all for my kids
Steppin' on niggas, I'm walkin' on shit
Play, it's gon' go down like Joc in '06

Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Uh, let's go
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
(Steppin' on niggas, I'm walkin' on shit
Play, it's gon' go down like Joc in '06)
Yeah (let's go)

You can call the police or get burnt (mhm)
Make his family go make some new merch' (ha)
They run in our blood, bitch, we turnt (tst)
Y'all niggas scared, go to church (mhm)
Pull out that motherfuckin' Phantom, that bitch long as Hell
It sit up like a Hearse (bitch)
My daughter got bread in her purse
She know she the shit, she gon' stand on that curb (yeah)
I done been eatin' for so fuckin' long, I don't think I can handle desert (yeah)
Velour on my lap right now while I'm rappin', chillin' with her daddy while he work
Nigga, it was back in 2010 when I seen a pound of Percs
Y'all bitch-ass niggas need to skirt
See a nigga play, but you ain't leave a nigga on the scene
You ain't built like me if he'll lurk (let's go)

Pick up my babies then drop me a hit
I'm underrated, been poppin' my shit
I came up off of CDs I bought from a lick (oh)
Niggas can't see me, I'm raw as it get
Stiff on these bitches, you not what it is (no)
Can't give you nothin', this all for my kids
Steppin' on niggas, I'm walkin' on shit
Play, it's gon' go down like Joc in '06 (come on)

Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Uh, let's go
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
(Steppin' on niggas, I'm walkin' on shit
Play, it's gon' go down like Joc in '06)
Yeah (let's go)

Play, it's gon' go down like Joc (yeah)
He think he like me, he not (no)
Nigga, let's play a motherfuckin' game
Play with me, you gon' get shot (boom)
Known 'round the world as a popstar
Baby, how many niggas you popped?
Is you 21? Say, "Bitch, a lot"
One with the F&N, the others got Glocks, nigga

Uh-huh, yeah (damn)
Baby, how many niggas you dropped?
Uh-huh, uh
Uh-huh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Pick up my babies then drop me a hit
I'm underrated, been poppin' my shit
I came up off of CDs I bought from a lick (oh)
Niggas can't see me, I'm raw as it get
Stiff on these bitches, you not what it is (no)
Can't give you nothin', this all for my kids
Steppin' on niggas, I'm walkin' on shit
Play, it's gon' go down like Joc in '06 (come on)

Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
Yeah-yeah (uh-huh)
