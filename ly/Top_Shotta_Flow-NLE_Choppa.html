		  Shotta
Turn the reverb down a lil' bit
I'ma call this bitch the "Top Shotta Flow" right here
"Top Shotta Flow" on some shit
NLE, Top Shotta (think we found a loophole)
Turn my vocals up some (brrt)
Brrt, nigga, brrt
NLE, Top Shotta (ayy), got the bombs like Al-Qaeda
NLE, Top Shotta, got the bombs like Al-Qaeda (ayy, yeah)
NLE, Top Shotta, got the bombs like Al-Qaeda (grrt, grrt, ayy)
NLE, Top Shotta, got the bombs like Al-Qaeda (ayy, yeah, ayy, ayy)

Cut off some niggas, they say that I'm fake (cut off)
Them niggas was bitches, weren't makin' shit shake (makin' shit shake)
Had to run this shit up, make a K in a day (K in a day)
We was robbin' and schemin' and duckin' them Ks
I'ma take me a risk, I'ma take me a gamble (take me a gamble)
I was down on my dick, had to ride for a gavel
In the stolo ridin', now we ride in the Lambos (in Lambos)
I give you my problems, I bet you can't handle (ayy)

My niggas, they trap out the vacant apartments and bandos
Band man, gang, drum on the choppa, commando (commando)
Choppa go on repeat, on repeat just like Sopranos (brrt, brrt, Sopranos)
Think that you steppin' to me (ayy), I'll leave you where you stand, ho (ayy)
Slide on that boy, yeah, we ride in the night (ayy)
I don't care the circumstance he dyin' tonight (tonight)
Left my phone at the crib, I'm doin' it right (doin' it right)
My nigga on the drill, my Glock on the right (grrt)
Step one, step two, hop out on feet (Hop out)
Why the fuck is he runnin'? He playing with me (ayy)
Put one in his noggin, he layin' asleep
They call me, talk shit like I'm they enemies
Make a killin' off a show, then get a nigga killed
Get a nigga peeled, put him on the quilt
Drank in the cup, sip out the seal
He went out, said, "he not my nigga"
We do this for real, we never gon' squeal
We know what it is, we see that he deal
We ain't gonna do it unless he off a pill
I swear I was sober on all of my drills

Cut off some niggas, they say that I'm fake (cut off)
Them niggas was bitches, weren't makin' shit shake (makin' shit shake)
Had to run this shit up, make a K in a day (K in a day)
We was robbin' and schemin' and duckin' them Ks
I'ma take me a risk, I'ma take me a gamble (take me a gamble)
I was down on my dick, had to ride for a gavel
In the stolo ridin', now we ride in the Lambos (in Lambos)
I give you my problems, I bet you can't handle (ayy)

These niggas be bruisers, niggas ain't shootin'
Twenty K on his head, you still ain't do it
Who did you call when y'all got into it?
You know I be tweakin', you know how I pull it (You know how I pull it)
One shot, niggas must think I'm pussy (What?)
Bitch, you seen me leave niggas gushy (c'mon)
Big dawg in the hoodie, call me Tookie (What?)
Big man on the block, ask Drew Gooden (ayy)
Walk down in my ski mask and a hoodie (ayy)
Say "I'm not killer," you niggas be foolin'
Go at my nigga, he seen me do it
Shoot up the party, we droppin' them bullets
It's a hunnid sum' Grapes, he ain't stoppin' them boys
Fuckin' with me, you get put in a morgue
I ain't threaten no man, I'm a big lil' gangsta
Whole lotta gun residue on my finger
When them niggas be hidin' I get a lil' anxious
I'ma shoot up the crib, shoot that bitch through the blanket
I'm a real Top Shotta, put it on the map
Niggas turn ghost when it's time to ride out
This shit is tatted on my stomach, Top Shotta, it ain't wrong
Bitch, I'm rasta, for real, Jamaica, it be my stompin'

Cut off some niggas, they say that I'm fake (cut off)
Them niggas was bitches, weren't makin' shit shake (makin' shit shake)
Had to run this shit up, make a K in a day (K in a day)
We was robbin' and schemin' and duckin' them Ks
I'ma take me a risk, I'ma take me a gamble (take me a gamble)
I was down on my dick, had to ride for a gavel
In the stolo ridin', now we ride in the Lambos (in Lambos)
I give you my problems, I bet you can't handle (ayy)

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, Top Shotta
Ayy, Top Shotta, Top, mm
Top Shotta, Top, mm, Top Shotta, Top, ayy
Top Shotta, nigga, bitch, mm, ayy
