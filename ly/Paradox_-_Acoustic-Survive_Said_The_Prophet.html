		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun, it burns the night
The moon, it breaks the sky

Defining lines between the victims
And what will soon become the prey
I've giving up on counting blessings
The Gods can judge me when I'm dead

'Cause I can not take this anymore
I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox 
Lost in paradox 

The feeling of hatred burns my soul
I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox
Lost in paradox

I'm maybe crazy enough to break myself inside my head 
'Cause lately I couldn't find these answers to live by instead 
Some will call it giving up
I just call it getting lost in my own revenge

Burning out and fading away

I feel my eyes, they're paralyzed 
Beyond the path of civilized 
All that I had was the past 
Drown me out what was once what I had burn me out of my misery 
Down to the ashes 
Ashes, we all fall down to the ashes 
Carry on, I've been gone from the place where I belong

'Cause I can not take this anymore
I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox 
Lost in paradox

The feeling of hatred burns my soul
I'm done with the feelings that I've known in paradox 
Lost in paradox

I'm maybe crazy enough to break myself inside my head 
'Cause lately I couldn't find these answers to live by instead 
Some will call it giving up
I just call it getting lost in my own revenge

I'm maybe crazy enough to break myself inside my head 
'Cause lately I couldn't find these answers to live by instead 
Some will call it giving up
I just call it getting lost in my own revenge

Burning out and fading away
The moon, it breaks the sky

(The song) 逃れられない憎しみや悲しみに
向き合うことは辛いけれど
過去の幸せを忘れるほど 不幸な人間にはなりたくはない
進んでいくんだ 一歩ずつ進んでいくんだ

I'm maybe crazy enough to break myself inside my head
'Cause lately I couldn't find these answers to live by instead 
Some will call it giving up
I just call it getting lost in my own revenge

I'm maybe crazy enough to break myself inside my head 
'Cause lately I couldn't find these answers to live by instead 
Some will call it giving up
I just call it getting lost in my own revenge
Burning out and fading away
