		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sing, get on up and dance to the music
Get on up and dance to the music

Dance to the Music, dance to the music
Dance to the Music, dance to the music

All we need is a drummer
For people who only need a beat, yeah
I'm gonna add a little guitar
And make it easy to move your feet

I'm gonna add some bottom
So that the dancers just won't hide

You might like to hear my organ
I said ride Sally ride, now
(Cynthia, what? Gerry, what?)
If I could hear the horns blow
Cynthia on the throne, yeah

Listen to me
Cynthia and Jerry got a message that's sayin'
All the squares, go home, yeah-yeah

Listen to the voices

Dance to the Music, dance to the music
Dance to the Music, dance to the music
