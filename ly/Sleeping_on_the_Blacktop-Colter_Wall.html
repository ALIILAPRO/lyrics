		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunshine beating on the good times
Moonlight raising from the grave
String band playing worn out honky-tonks
Pretty young thing going dancing in the rain

High heel lady spitting at the nickajack
Business man with a needle and a spoon
Coyote chewing on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys going howlin' at the moon

Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

Three dead in a crash on the number four
Two witnesses below and up high
Not sure whose will be done
You can call me a sinner for wondering why

Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

Corn liquor tastes sweeter in this town
Could it be it's the same as the last?
I swear I've seen ya face elsewhere before
Just as familiar as a bottle and a glass

Hey darlin'!
Sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin'!
Running through the trees honey
Hey darlin'!
Leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me
