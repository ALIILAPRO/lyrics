		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Excuse me, beg your pardon, girl
Do you have any idea what you startin', girl?
You got me tingling, come to me mingling
Steppin' off lookin' bootylicious and jingling
When you walk, I see it, baby girl
When you talk, I believe it, baby girl
I like that, thick, petite and pretty
Little touch of saditty
Love to work the kitty, like

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza (ah-ah)
Shake ya body like a belly dancer (ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza (ah-ah)
Shake ya body like a belly dancer (ah)

I must say, you're the flyest thing in here
You're so hot, we gon' need some rain in here
Type to make ex-gangstas bang in here
Girl, you could do anything you want in here
Clown if you want to, frown if you want to
You ain't even gotta drop down if you want to
'Cause I'd rather see you shake it standin'
Either way you do it, girl, you look outstandin'

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

Hey, ladies drop it down
Just wanna see you touch the ground
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer

(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza (ah-ah)
Shake ya body like a belly dancer (ah-ah)
(Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Don't be shy, girl, go bananza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
