		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the Ivy and the
Ink blue, yayo, yeah you, yayo

You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park
Life now, yayo, how now, yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger,
Let me put on a show

I need you like
A baby when I hold you
Like a drug
Like I told you

Yayo, yes you, yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Let me put on a show

Hello Heaven
You are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark night (Dark night)

Yayo, yes you, yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama

Let me put on a show for you daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you tiger
Let me put on a show
