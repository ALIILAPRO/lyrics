		  (Everything Foreign)

I know you don't do one night stands
So I'm the closest thing
Now can we fuck and still be friends, though?
And if you haven't fucked a friend (I'm just sayin')
I'd be the closest thing (haha, I, I'd be the closest thing)
So can we fuck and still be friends, though?

You know?
Bitch, you can't be my girlfriend
I got a girl, and my girl got a girl too (too)
Scarface crib, it's my world too, uh (it's my world too)
My pillow recognize her perfume
Tell her man, "Relax," she'll make it home by curfew (haha)
Tom Ford cologne (oh), I look like I'm on (ay)
Playboy Mansion, "Honey, I'm home" (honey I'm home)
Backdoor to Oracle, fuck it I'm home (woo)
King of the Bay, getting dome on my throne, uh
Dime and in the rough, uncut gyms
She not my girlfriend though, we just friends (just friends)
Somehow I fit six, all in one Benz (one Benz)
All of us fuck buddies, all fuck friends
Lookin' like a snack, she'll devour me (ay)
Your boyfriend's whole salary's my hourly (haha)
Throwin' bands in Miami, it's showerin' (it's showerin')
Bad boy, I'm the white Mike Lowrey (haha, yee)

I know you don't do one night stands
So I'm the closest thing (I'm the closest thing, baby)
Now, can we fuck and still be friends, though?
(Can we fuck and still be friends, you know?)
And if you haven't fucked a friend, I'd be the closest thing (haha)
So can we fuck and still be friends, though?
(I'm just sayin', yee)

Yeah, T-Raww
I can pull any bitch, man, it's automatic
Pussy, money, alcohol, I'm a big fanatic
And my diamonds OD, so dramatic (big)
Like I'm Adam Sandler, she call me "Big Daddy" (yeah)
I'm insane in the brain, what you know 'bout it? (Ay)
I got shawty and her friend, waitin' in the lobby (yes)
Loggin' in my account, that's my favorite hobby (yes)
I like a new bitch, with a new body (ah)
Bad bitch, I need all that (all that)
Here's my number, you can call that (call that)
Tell your nigga he can fall back (fall back)
I'm wanna make you mine, wanna my own at (own at)
Go shawty, it's your birthday (birthday)
Simon says, "Do what I say" (I say)
Drink it up, I know you're thirsty (thirsty)
She said, "Baby make it hard, but don't hurt me," ay

I know you don't do one night stands
So I'm the closest thing
Now can we fuck and still be friends, though?
And if you haven't fucked a friend
I'd be the closest thing
So can we fuck and still be friends, though?

Lil' mama thirsty, I said thirsty
Shawty, they ain't fuckin' with you on your worst day
And she cut a nigga off, give 'em first-aid
How the hell she fit the gym and a work day?
I got wristwatch I got big Glocks
I got bunch of pretty bitches tryna liplock
See the Rollie on my wrist, and it don't tick-tock
If you nasty when I fuck you, let my bitch watch
I said, "Right cheek," I said, "Left cheek"
Hit it so good, you gon' feel it next week
When I kill the pussy they gon' arrest me
I be lookin' at it like, "Don't test me"
Shake that ass on a nigga like, duh duh duh
I be all up in the pussy 'til there's none left there
In the nighttime, 'til the sun up, yeah
No pun intended, shawty you a come up, yeah, ay

I know you don't do one night stands
So I'm the closest thing
Now can we fuck and still be friends, though?
And if you haven't fucked a friend
I'd be the closest thing
So can we fuck and still be friends, though?
