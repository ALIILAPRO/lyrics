		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you guys ready?
One, two, three, one, two, three

Train roll on, on down the line,
Won't you please take me far, far away.
Now I feel the wind blow, outside my door,
I'm leavin' my woman at home, oh yeah.
My baby's gone
Tuesday's gone with the wind,
My baby's gone, gone with that wind
Long Gone (Gary)

(Pepper)
And I don't know, oh, where I'm goin'.
I just want to be left alone.
When this train ends, I'll try again.
I'm leavin' my woman at home.
My baby's gone

Tuesday's gone with the wind. (oh yeah)
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
My baby's gone, with the wind.
Train roll on (Jean paul)

Tuesday's gone with the wind.
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
My baby's gone, with the wind.

Train roll on
Train roll on many miles from my home,
See I'm, I'm ridin' my blues, babe, blues away, yeah.
But Tuesday you see, oh, she had to be free.
Somehow I got to, to carry on.
My baby's gone.

Tuesday's gone with the wind.
Tuesday's gone with the wind. (Tuesday's gone)
Tuesday's gone with the wind.
My baby's gone, with the wind.

Train roll on, train roll on
Ride on train, ride on train, ride on train
Train roll on, (train rolls on)
The train, it rolls on

Train rolls on (train rolls on)
Lord, I can't change (I can't change)
Lord, I can't change (I can't change)
Lord, I can't change
Lord, I can't change (I can't change)
Train roll on
Ride on train
I can't change
Train roll on
Ride on train
Lord, I can't change, no
I can't change
Ride on Train
