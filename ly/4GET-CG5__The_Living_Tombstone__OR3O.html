		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Moving on, moving on,
It doesn’t really matter,
My brain follows a pattern.
Forget about it.
Breaking up, breaking down,
You think it’ll get better, but it never does.

I feel like I’m dying.
Nobody tells me I’m lying.
Couldn’t hear when I was crying.
It’s defeating when I’m trying
To forget about it.
All the silence getting louder,
And louder and louder.
Maybe I’ll forget about it.

I’m spending every day,
Wishing I was okay.
Surrendered to a world of gray.
(Hey.)
My car is broken down,
I can’t get out of town.
So I’ll walk along a road of shame.
Headache!

All my thoughts are getting scattered.
Am I madder than a hatter?
Climbing up an endless ladder to forget about it.
All the silence getting louder,
And louder and louder.
Maybe I’ll forget about it.
Maybe I'll forget about it.
