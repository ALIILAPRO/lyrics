		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shed my skin
Reject the hand I’ve been dealt
Am I becoming a waste of myself

Shed my skin
Reject the hand I’ve been dealt
Take a chance so I can better myself
Give me the strength
So I can be reborn
I choose not to believe
that the cycle goes on and on

The cycle goes on and on

When all hope is gone
Still fucking holding on
To stop me slipping away
(Stop me slipping away)

No longer blind to see
An opportunity
Look in the mirror
And see it staring back at me

Am I becoming a waste of myself
(Am I becoming a waste of myself)

Shed my skin
Shed my skin
Now I am reborn, go!

No longer blind to see
An opportunity
Look in the mirror
And see it staring back at me

Am I becoming a waste of myself
(Am I becoming a waste of myself)

I will never become a fuckin waste of myself
