		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Call it a war, you can do what you like
Heavens above don't care how you're living
Carry across your devotional ties
Where do you run when you're like a child? 

What you said was nice, when you said my face turned a memory
What you said was nice, when you said my heart broke a century

Harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor

Call it a life, you can call it a night
Days linger on, quicker than a minute
Bravery's just an emotional bribe
Into your arms and I'm like a child

What you said was nice, when you said my face turned a memory
What you said was nice, when you said my heart broke a century

Harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor, harbor
Harbor

It's the rest of your life
It's the rest of your life
It's the rest of your life

What you said was nice, when you said my face turned a memory
What you said was nice, when you said my heart broke a century
