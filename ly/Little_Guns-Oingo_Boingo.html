		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tiny people, with little guns 
Little armies march, to little drums 
What do they want? 
What do they want? 

Tiny soldiers, with little guns 
Little tanks, no bigger than your thumb 
They want you 

Little people, with tiny brains 
Little bullets flowing, in their veins 
What do they want? 
What do they want? 

Tiny people with little guns 
Little armies march, to little drums 
They want you, you 
You, you, you, you 

Little airplanes, with tiny bombs 
Little squadrons, dropping thimbles of Napalm 
They want you 

What do they want? 
What do they want? 

Tiny people, with little guns 
Little armies march, to little drums 
You, you 
You, you, you, you 

Tiny people, little guns 
Tiny people, little guns 
Tiny people, little guns
