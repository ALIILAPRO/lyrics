		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We didn't vibe on the first night, but you're so enticin'
We didn't vibe then, but now I want you

So, I-I-I, pure desire
So heart racin', entire body sayin', "Ah-ooh-ah"

I want you to make you my girlfriend (yeah)
Wait 'til the world ends
Badmon deserves ya (yeah)
Badmon buy Birkins
For you, for certain
Search, I been searchin'
Woah, woah, ah
And I want you, and I want you
And I want you, and I want you
And I want you

Tried on the first night, I extended my hand and let go of my pride
I got a bottle of '42 I could pour for you
I'm not sayin' no tonight, yeah
While you dance, I'ma hold you tight, you know how I want you
And sometimes, I feel like I need you
The pressure of love, the pressure of, woah, oh-oh

So, I-I-I, pure desire
So heart racin', entire body sayin', "Ah-ooh-ah"

I want you to make you my girlfriend (yeah)
Wait 'til the world ends
Badmon deserves ya (yeah)
Badmon buy Birkins
For you, for certain
Search, I been searchin'
Woah, woah, ah
And I want you

Hey, y'all head home?
Yeah, what're you gon' do?
I dunno, I dunno, I think I might hit a few more spots, and stay out a lil' longer
Okay, I guess I'll see you when you get home
Mhm
