		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooohhhh, ooohhh
Oooohhhh, ooohhh

Well now if you want blood with your money,
You can help yourself,
And if you want a lot more then you got coming,
I will never tell,
I will weigh all your time and your wealth,
If it makes you smile,
But now if you want something worth while,
I can show you how
Listen to me now

Come on Give
Look them in the eye and
Give
There's nothing to decide
Come on Give
Look them in the eye and
Give
And take it all in stride

When you got enough food on your table
Blood in your mouth
Now you wanna taste something better
Then just spit it out
Listen to me now

Come on Give
Look them in the eye and
Give
Theres nothing to decide
Come on give
Look them in the eye and
Give
And take it all in stride

Oooohhhh, Ooohhh,
Oooohhhh, Ooohhh,

Give
Look them in the eye and
Give
Theres nothing to decide
Come on give
Look them in the eye and
Give
And take it all in stride

Give...
Give...
Give...
Give...
Give...
