		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You open up and what you gain is another hole
Reaching out for a hand and I know
The fear of losing all the trust that it craves
And feel that parts of you are never coming back

I used to think that life was ugly and a mess
Well I was right but what else to do other than your best
The meaning of it all you find within yourself
I hold the key but where's the door
I kick it in

Whatever that I want I will get
I'll take the beatings too and all the blame
But father you're the one that I miss
I'm thankful that I have our loved ones near
