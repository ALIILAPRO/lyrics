		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feeling kind of sick tonight
All I've had is coffee and leftover pie
It's no wonder why
Ooh, still you take up all my mind
I don't even think that you care like I do
I should stop
Heaven knows I've tried

One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Someday
Someone will like me like I like you
Until then I'll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again

I'm just tryna understand
What I am to you
More than songs we've exchanged
Midnight calls
Sunset views
Promise I don't mean to cry
But I get overwhelmed and confused
If only you knew
What I felt like

One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Someday
Someone will like me like I like you
Until then I'll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again

Someday
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Until I do
I'll be thinking of you
Let you break my heart again
