		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could I have supposed that I'd 
See such an attractive light 
No one ever warned me 
No one ever warned me 
And I took a step that way 
Now I know I'm here to stay 
Oh somebody, free me 
Please somebody, free me! 
 
Oh God, I wish that I could breathe 
Oh God, I wish that I could breathe 
Start up my heart again 
I wish that I could breathe 
I loved my life 
I loved my life 
 
Enemies... Memories 
Set me free 
Save my soul 
Memories 're enemies 
Oh somebody, free me 
Please somebody, free me! 
 
Oh God, I wish that I could breathe 
Oh God, I wish that I could breathe 
Start up my heart again 
I wish that I could breathe 
I loved my life 
I loved my life 
 
Could I have supposed that I'd 
No one ever warned me 
And I took a step that way 
Oh somebody, free me 
Please somebody, free me! 
 
Enemies... Memories 
Set me free 
Save my soul 
Memories 're enemies 
Oh somebody, free me 
Please somebody, free me! 
 
Could I have supposed that I'd 
No one ever warned me 
And I took a step that way 
Oh somebody, free me 
Please somebody, free me! 
 
Oh God, I wish that I could breathe 
Oh God, I wish that I could breathe 
Start up my heart again 
I wish that I could breathe 
I loved my life 
I loved my life
