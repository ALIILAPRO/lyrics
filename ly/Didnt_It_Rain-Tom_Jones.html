		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Didn't it rain children, talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't, Didn't, oh my Lord Didn't it rain

Didn't it rain children, talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't it, Didn't it, oh my Lord Didn't it rain

Rain, rain, oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't it, Didn't it, oh my Lord Didn't it rain

When you read in the Good Book you'll understand
Why Noah lived as a righteous man
The Lord called Noah and gave him a plan
Said: "Build me an ark at my command"
Just listen how it's raining, all day, all night
Water rising in the east, water rising in the west
Men groaning in the north, some moaning in the south
All day, all night oh oh oh oooo
Just listen how it's raining all day all night

Didn't it rain, talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't it, Didn't it, oh my Lord Didn't it rain

Rain, rain oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't it, Didn't it, oh my Lord Didn't it rain

Then the Lord told Noah take 'em two by two
The ox and the fox an the kangaroo
The wicked man if he don't repent
Leave 'em there until my judgment

Just listen how it's raining all day all night
Water rising in the east, water rising in the west
Men groaning in the north, men moaning in the south
All day all night, well well well well well well well well
Let me hear you groan some tune
Let me hear you moan some children
All day, all night,
Water rising in the east, water rising in the west
Men groaning in the north, some moaning in the south
All day, all night
Didn't it rain, talk about rain oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't it, Didn't it, oh my Lord Didn't it rain

Rain, rain oh my Lord
Didn't it, Didn't it, Didn't it, oh my Lord Didn't it rain.
