		  (Dance with a knot?)
(That's a real sign)

Wherever I go I'm only as good as my mind
Which is only good if you're mine
Which is only good if you're mine
Wherever I go I'm only as good as my mind
Which is only good if you're mine
Which is only good if you're mine
(Good if you're mine)

(You can untie those knots)
(Why won't you dance with a knot?)

I hope I'm making sense to you

Where are my wings?
They're loading, they're loading
They're loading
Where are my wings?
They're loading, still loading
They're loading
Pull back my fringe
Exposing, exposing, exposing
There's something you should know

Wherever I go, I'm only
Wherever I go, I'm only
Wherever I go, I'm only
Wherever I go, I'm only
(You can untie those knots)
Wherever I go, I'm only
Wherever I go, I'm only wherever I go

Wherever I go I'm only as good as my mind
Which is only good if you're mine
Which is only good if you're mine
Wherever I go I'm only as good as my mind
Which is only good if you're mine
Which is only good if you're mine
(Good if you're mine)

(That's a real sign)
(You can untie those knots)
(Why won't you dance with a knot?)

I hope I'm making sense to you (that's a real sign)

Where are my wings?
They're loading, they're loading
They're loading
Where are my wings?
Lo- they're loading, still loading
They're still loading
Pull back my fringe
Exposing, exposing, exposing
There's something you should know

Wherever I go I'm only as good as my mind
Which is only good if you're mine
Which is only good if you're mine
Wherever I go I'm only as good as my mind
Which is only good if you're mine
Which is only good if you're mine
(Good if you're mine)

(Why won't you dance with a knot?)
(That's a real sign)
