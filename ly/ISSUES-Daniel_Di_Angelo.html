		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you don't love me, baby just pretend
I wanna have you all inside my head
All I see is demons in and out my bed
And baby all my bullshit is getting out of hand
And I'm fucked up on some molly but that shit never helps
It always makes me silent instead of seeing red
You look like Aphrodite just laying in my bed
It's too easy to love you, so we just fuck instead
I know your girls don't like me
I know your boys don't like me
They talking shit about me
And they've been really trippin'
But baby this ain't their love that you're giving
So take on my issues and bring out your problems
Fuck like you love me so I'm not forgotten
Take on my issues and shine in the light
And bring all your problems, we can fuck all night
Take on my issues
Right after we fuck
You can say goodbye
You can stay the night
You could even stay for life
Girl, it's only right
Cause I see you in my mind
When there's bitches in my eyes
And it's fucked up
You don't know how many drinks I have taken
To try to get you out of my mind
Baby, I can't do this anymore I'm giving up trying to get you
Out my life
I can't take my advice
I need some drugs, I need some high
I need to make you all of mine
Baby all my bullshit is getting out of hand
And I'm fucked up on some molly but that shit never helps
It always makes me silent instead of seeing red
You look like Aphrodite just laying in my bed
It's too easy to love you, so we just fuck instead
So take on my issues and bring out your problems
Fuck like you love me so I'm not forgotten
Take on my issues and shine in the light
And bring all your problems, we can fuck all night
Take on my issues
