		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wanna slide
Like it's 2055, huh
I just wanna ride (Great John on the beat by the way)
Like it's 2055, huh
Huh, huh, huh

I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice, huh

Why would you sacrifice, huh
Knowing you could die? Ain't nobody by your side, huh
I know niggas cap (cap), and bitches lie
Came from dirt, can't go back, you could see it in my eyes, huh
Real niggas cry blood (blood), hope my kid never try drugs, huh
All I wanted was some love, would trade that for a gun, huh
Big pack on me now, 'member back then I was fucked up, huh
I don't really want friends, everybody fake, I don't got trust, but

I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (water and some ice, water and some ice)
I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice

Shawty get energized, huh, livin' life
Spilled some liquor on her inner thigh, but she ain't tired
She just turn it up, huh, I could get you brushed, huh
ZaZa got me stuck, sorry I can't open up
Fuck it, we tried (huh), gotta compromise (huh)
He want beef with gang, but he don't know it come with fries (huh)
That's AKs and Nines (huh), please don't play with mines (huh)
My body different, I know they love that line but

I just wanna slide, huh
Parties in the sky like it's 2055, huh
She said, "Boy you nice, boy you nice", huh
Heart cold like some water and some ice (water and some ice, water and some ice)
