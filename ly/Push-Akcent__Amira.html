		  Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down
Seek around

Didn't I treat you well?
Didn't I treat you well?
With my moves like ulah, ula-hey
Ulah, ula-hey

You know I want you more
I tell you this for sure
You make me wanna ulah, ula-hey
Ulah, ula-hey

I keep my eyes on you
My eyes on you
My eyes on

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down
Seek around

I'm not like any girl
I can rule your world
With my moves like ulah, ula-hey
Ulah, ula-hey

Tell me what is wrong
We used to be so strong
And then you gotta ulah, ula-hey
Ulah, ula-hey

I keep my eyes on you
My eyes on you
My eyes on

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down
Seek around

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down

Oh, baby please don't push, push, push
Please don't push, push, push
Push me down
Seek around
