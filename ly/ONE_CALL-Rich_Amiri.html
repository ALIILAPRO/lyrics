		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't trust a soul, I don't trust nobody
Threw up off some pills, I don't trust my own body
You would take her shoppin', you took her to Chrome probably
It only took me one call, got the dome out her
Just hit this ho, her boyfriend book me for a show, ah
I'm rockin' white and gold, it look like I got mob ties
Water comin' in and out, it never was a drought
Fuck the opposition, hit they strip then air it out

Pay attention, pay attention
Pay attention, finna show you how to get it
First you make a hundred movin', whippin' chickens
Then you stay down, stack your racks, don't ever spend 'em
Forgiatos, Panoramas smooth spinnin'
Extra green up in my pocket look like spinach
I put gold all in my mouth, I hate the dentist
Gon' pour two more lines then I'm finished
I said, "Better late than never, better late than never"
Yeah, better late than never, better late than never
I said, "Better late than never, better late than never"
Yeah, better late than never, better late than never
Yeah, yeah
I call my black bitch, "Wet Throat"
She ain't pop it out, I left her at the Loews
They won't get up out my way, I run 'em over

I don't trust a soul, I don't trust nobody
Threw up off some pills, I don't trust my own body
You would take her shoppin', you took her to Chrome probably
It only took me one call, got the dome out of her
Just hit this ho, her boyfriend book me for a show, ah
I'm rockin' white and gold, it look like I got mob ties
Water comin' in and out, it never was a drought
Fuck the opposition, hit they strip then air it out

I said, "Better late than never, better late than never"
Yeah, better late than never, better late than never
I said, "Better late than never, better late than never"
Yeah, better late than never, better late than never
