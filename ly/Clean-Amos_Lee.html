		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been so cold up here
Sky won't clear, no, the sky won't clear
Will you come to see?
What's become of me, what's become of me?
Nothing can come between us
Except for my fevers, except for my demons
And they will not leave my side
They will behind
Oh, they will be

Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?

It's been snowing now for days
Can't get away, no, I can't can't get away
I smile but it fogs the glass
Time slowly passes, yes, time slowly passes
And babe, oh babe, going crazy, yeah

Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?

You said that you would wait for me
You said that you would climb
Up any mountain I was stranded
I think about it all the time
But I know the words I said to you
I was broken, I was blind
I took so much and never gave back
But do I ever cross your mind?
I was swallowed by the avalanche
Now I watch the hourglass
I need one thing I can remember
So I don't surrender

Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?

Will you wait, will you wait
Will you wait for me?
If I get clean
(Will you wait, will you wait)
(Will you wait for me?)

If I get clean
