		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, hello
Can you hear me as I scream your name?
Hello, hello
Do you need me before I fade away?

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

Hello, hello
Nice to meet you, voice inside my head
Hello, hello
I believe you, how can I forget?

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become?
Walk along the path unknown
We live, we love, we lie

Deep in the dark I don't need the light
There's a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live, we love, we lie

(We live, we love, we lie)

We live, we love, we lie
