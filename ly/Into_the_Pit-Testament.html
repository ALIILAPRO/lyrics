		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in the pit and lying alone
Where death has reared itself a throne
We're all the good, the bad
The worst and the best
And where they land is their eternal rest

Foul plays of passion
At twilight's dim
In joy of woe, of good and sin
Winds of storm and fates overcast
Darkly my presence
Is now your past

Join the insanity
Or die as you fall
Into the pit!
The mass production

And the killing of all
Into the pit!
The future screams for help
Are fading away

Into the pit!
The world tomorrow
Will it die for today?
Into the pit!

So in the sad, silent watches of night
The lonely pathway envisions my sight
Echoes of laughter
And boundless cries
Son here I wander under infinite skies

Join the insanity
Or die as you fall
Into the pit!
The mass production

And the killing of all
Into the pit!
The future screams for help
Are fading away

Into the pit!
The world tomorrow
Will it die for today?
Into the pit!
