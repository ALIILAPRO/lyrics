		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On my mind
Almost all the time
Holdin' me
Is where you need to be

Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide
No, child
Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide

Sweet babe
My soul you saved (my soul you saved)
All the games I play
I won't play the game
Oh, no no no

Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide
No, child
Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide (no, no)

The beauty is ice
In the grassy roles of my mind
Sweet like sunrise
Here to save my life

Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide
No, child
Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide
No, child
No, child

Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide
No, child, no, child
Stay right by my side
I won't run
I won't hide
