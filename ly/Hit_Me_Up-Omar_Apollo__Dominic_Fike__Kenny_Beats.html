		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, said, I've got some time I'm abusin'
Change my mind if you ever switch it up (yeah)
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me (you pursue me)
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up (hit me up)

Pretty boy, pretty boy, not a city guy
I ain't intimate, I don't wanna feel ya
Feel you up, feel you up, put your head down
Find my headphones, I don't get it, put
Pullin' up, pullin' up in my car
All my friends comin' down
Say you won't, say you won't ride with me, yeah (yeah)

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin' (did it, girl, I don't wanna get it)
Change my mind if you ever switch it up (switch it up) 
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me (if you pursue me)
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up (yeah)

You know I wouldn't tell you where to go (you know I wouldn't)
Nobody listens to the radio, baby
We're bendin' corners like we're runnin' from the sun
The whip is turnin' different colors and you're takin' on changes
Wish I could see you come around and feel you up
Waitin' for you, baby, but you stood me up (you stood me up)
Reckon what you gave me wasn't good enough
What you gave me wasn't good enough
Wish I could see you come around like one more time
Faded, like numb it down, over quick just like summertime
Baby, let's double down, I bet you would fuck with me now
I bet, I bet, I bet you would fuck with me now (yeah)

Said, I've got some time I'm abusin' (did it, girl, I don't wanna get it)
Change my mind if you ever switch it up (switch it up) 
And I'll waste my time if you pursue me (if you pursue me)
I'll let you know if you ever hit me up (ooh)

(City girl, I don't wanna get it done)
(Switch it up)
(Pretty girl, pretty girl)
(Yeah)
