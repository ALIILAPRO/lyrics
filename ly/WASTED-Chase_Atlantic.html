		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a dream, it was so realistic
Woke up in tears with a bottle of whisky
Overslept once again, if there was sunlight, I missed it
Crucified to my bed
Crucified to my bed (my bed)
I like to sleep because it feels like I'm dead (feels like I'm dead)
Blood in my dreams, see vivid scenes full of red, oh
Feels like the devil put a gun to my head
Pulled on the trigger but missed
Pulled the trigger but missed me, oh, uh

Yeah, that motherfucker missed me (that motherfucker, that motherfucker)
Uh, now I'm ridin' with the top dropped off
Through the city feelin' goddamn tipsy, yeah (goddamn tipsy)
Me and all my demons jumpin' down when we hit the corner left side, yeah (left side)
You should see us on our best nights, yeah (best nights)
We all got vices, mine is
Every single night I roll the dices

And now I'm wasted
Come pick my face off the floor
Some GTA shit
She says I've been here before
And she fucking hates me
Our life was better before
All of this fame hit
I'm fucking wasted, no

Oh, oh, what a mess (what a mess)
Honestly, you think that I'm depressed, yeah (pressed)
But nonetheless, I'ma down another bottle
Keep my foot up on their necks (necks yeah)
Tried to go to rehab but I passed out
So I'ma drown my body full of Jimmy every single night until I blackout

I'm wasted
Come pick my face off the floor
Some GTA shit
She says I've been here before
And she fucking hates me
My life was better before
All of this fame hit
Every day I'm faded, fuck

I'm wasted
I won't play his games, yeah
I just wanna do what make, what makes you happy, yeah
Take your motherfucking hood and face-off
I've been waiting for a week, no days off
I won't run away, girl, do you wish that?
I don't wanna sleep, yeah
I'm fucking, I'm wasted, uh
I'm wasted
