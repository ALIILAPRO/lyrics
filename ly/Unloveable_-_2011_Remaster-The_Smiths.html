		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh... 
I know I'm unloveable 
You don't have to tell me 
I don't have much in my life 
But take it - it's yours 
I don't have much in my life 
But take it - it's yours 
Oh... 

I know I'm unloveable 
You don't have to tell me 
Oh, message received 
Loud and clear 
Loud and clear 
I don't have much in my life 
But take it - it's yours 

I know I'm unloveable 
You don't have to tell me 
For message received 
Loud and clear 
Loud and clear 
Message received 
I don't have much in my life 
But take it - it's yours 

I wear black on the outside 
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside 
I wear black on the outside 
'Cause black is how I feel on the inside 

And if I seem a little strange 
Well, that's because I am 
If I seem a little strange 
That's because I am 

But I know that you would like me 
If only you could see me 
If only you could meet me 

Oh... 
I don't have much in my life 
But take it - it's yours 
I don't have much in my life 
But take it - it's yours 
Mmm... 
Oh...
