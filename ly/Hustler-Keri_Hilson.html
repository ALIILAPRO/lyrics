		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was I supposed to come so close to loving you
That I couldn't see
Was I supposed to drown myself in thoughts of you
To where I could no longer breathe
You're just a silhouette
Of a perfect man
Cos you take me higher
Than I have ever been
Just to break me down
Into a thousand pieces
Boy you make me wish I was a hustler

So I could move the weight
Off of my shoulders
And I could run away
If I could be a hustler
Then I would move the weight
Off of my shoulders
And I would run away
Away home

Such a waste of my time
You are everything you shouldn't be
And how one seconds introduction
Could become a lifetime of misery
You're just a silhouette
Of a perfect man
Cos you take me higher
Than I have ever been
Just to break me down
Into a thousand pieces
Boy you make me wish I was a hustler

So I could move the weight
Off of my shoulders
And I could run away
If I could be a hustler
Then I would move the weight
Off of my shoulders
And I would run away
Away from you
So I could move the weight
If I could be a hustler
And I could run away
From this corner you got me stuck on
And I would move away
Boy you make me wish I was a hustler
Aye
If I could be a hustler
Yeah

So I could move the weight
And I could run away
Then I would move the weight
The I would run away
