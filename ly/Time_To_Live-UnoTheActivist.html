		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God, God, God, God damn, pimp
You must be a punk ayy
Ayy, let me tell you something what? What?
What? What? Dig? Lit
What? Oh, wait
Uno, I killed it (Dream, this shit go dummy)

What a time to be alive
What a time to live, Lamborghini coupe
It's parked outside
Said she wanna get in, told
That bitch, "Let's go, let's ride"
"Uno, where you been?" I'm somewhere
With all the vibes
Vibes, vibes, vibes, I got vibes, vibes
You know that's my gang
'cause they gon' slide
I know that she love me 'cause
She suck this dick with pride
This shit could get ugly
Fuck around and start a riot

Riot, riot, riot
I'm gon' shoot 'til thе bullets gone
I'm seizing shit, comе and take you home
Please your bitch, yeah, I turn her on
So much drip, gotta hold my nose
Fucking your ho, make her hold her toes
Mm, something like clothes, they fold
Wave ranned off, I'm Uno boat
Bitches passed out on the floor
12 came in and kicked the door
Project X, I'm lit as shit
I got lean and she got coke
I'm on acid, face-melting
I can see my way to heaven
Drugs make me feel so angelic
Bullets beatin', I repel 'em

What a time to be alive
What a time to live, Lamborghini coupe
It's parked outside
Said she wanna get in, told
That bitch, "Let's go, let's ride"
"Uno, where you been?" I'm somewhere
With all the vibes
Vibes, vibes, vibes, I got vibes, vibes
You know that's my gang
'cause they gon' slide
I know that she love me 'cause
She suck this dick with pride
This shit could get ugly
Fuck around and start a riot
