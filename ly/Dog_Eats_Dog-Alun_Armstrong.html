		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here's a hint of gold stuck into a tooth
Pardon me, M'sieur
You won't be needing it no more
Shouldn't be too hard to sell

Add it to the pile, add it to the stock
Here among the sewer rats
A breath away from Hell
You get accustomed to the smell

Here's a tasty ring, pretty little thing
Wouldn't want to waste it
That would really be a crime
Thank you, sir, I'm in your debt

Here's another toy, take it off the boy
His heart's no longer going
And he's lived his little time
But his watch is ticking yet!

Well, someone's got to clean them up, my friends
Before the little harvest disappears into the mud
Someone's got to collect their odds and ends
When the gutters run with blood

It's a world where the dog eats the dog
Where they kill for bones in the street
And God in His Heaven, he don't interfere
'Cause he's dead as the stiffs at me feet
I raise my eyes to see the heavens
And only the moon looks down
The harvest moon shines down!
