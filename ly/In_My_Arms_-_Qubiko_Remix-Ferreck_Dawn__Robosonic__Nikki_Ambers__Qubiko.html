		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my arms, it'll
I got you in my arms, it'll

Don't wait for too long, we will be just fine
Stay, we belong and we're flying high
Don't break in my arms, it'll be alright
We'll be alright, I'm right by your side

Don't nobody wanna see us together
Ain't nobody wanna see you smile
I got your back whatever the weather
Whatever the time, whatever the time, whatever the time

I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you in my arms, it'll be alright

In my arms, it'll
I got you in my arms, it'll
Ooh

Know you got to work for it
It's not a game 'cause I'm all in if you want it
Better keep it up once you got it
And I'll ride along
You're all that I want through the night and day
Love in my heart takes my breath away
Your touch is a drug running through my veins
Through my veins, takes my breath away

Don't nobody wanna see us together
Ain't nobody wanna see you smile
I got your back whatever the weather
Whatever the time, whatever the time, whatever the time

I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you in my arms, it'll be alright
I got you

Know you got to work for it
It's not a game 'cause I'm all in if you want it
Better keep it up once you got it
And I'll ride along

I got you in my arms, it'll
I got you in my arms, it'll
I got you in my arms, it'll
I got you in my arms, it'll
