		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Through a different kind of silence
I'm waiting
I'm wasting
Into the road of sadness
I'm walking
Without you

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is it gonna last?
Why don't you come and take me with you?
And so I know you had to go
I'm dreaming of the past
An echo of the years we passed through

Asleep in your arms I'm drifting
I'm falling
In sorrow
Dead to the world you left me
In footsteps 
I follow

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is it gonna last?
Why don't you come and take me with you?
And so I know you had to go
I'm dreaming of the past
An echo of the years we passed through

Hello, hello, hello, hello
Is it gonna last?
Why don't you come and take me with you?
And so I know you had to go
I'm dreaming of the past
An echo of the years we passed through
