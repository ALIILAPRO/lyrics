		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I stay for a while know that I've been longing for this patiently
Would it be worthwhile for your effort to quell my anxiety?
Do tell if I need to expound the languor of my demon which drags me out

Here I stay for a while with the evil who I kept permanently
But there you are in profile rally round the venture of my phantasy
A serene fervor so profound arises from upon you to calm me down

Just let me stay here for a while
Be altogether with the onliest of you in pairs
Amidst forever and a brief of nothing flat to spare

Just let me stay here until I die
How I would rather spend the latter with you in this place
Whithersoever to the aether everlasting space

Here I just stay until I lay myself down to the ground at once not for a while
Hither I sway onto what may become the grave of mine the death of my devotion

Just let me stay here for a while
Be altogether with the onliest of you in pairs
Amidst forever and a brief of nothing flat to spare

Just let me stay here until I die
How I would rather spend the latter with you in this place
Whithersoever to the aether everlasting space

Just let me stay here for a while
Just let me stay here until I die

Here I stay for a while know that I've been longing for this patiently
Would it be worthwhile for your effort to quell my anxiety?
