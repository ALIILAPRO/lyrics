		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk to me
Want my Love
Talk to me
But not that stuff

You ain't enough
Just usin' my love
N' you call for me
N' again I see

In the heat of the night
You'll lose your heart
And sell your soul
I lose control
In the heat of the night
It's much too late
To leave the trade
But I can't stand it anymore
You'll lose your heart
And your soul
I lose control
In the heat of the night

Talk to me
Want my Love
Talk to me
But not that stuff

Who's on my side
Losin' my pride
N' you call for me
N' again I see

In the heat of the night
You'll lose your heart
And sell your soul
I lose control
In the heat of the night
It's much too late
To leave the trade
But I can't stand it anymore
You'll lose your heart
And your soul
I lose control
In the heat of the night
