		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the desert plains
They ride
Two faced killers on the battle line
No defeat
One kind deed
And bullets to your brain

Here they wanna go to sleep
To wait the coming morrow
Looking for a lucky strike
Everlasting sorrow
Hearts of granite, eyes of steel
No faith appear to be within
Following the promised land
Unmerciless and grim

Tombstone

Republicans
Against democrats
The good, the bad, and the ugly
Martial law
Covered up
Return good for evil

The cowboy conspiracy
Will find a wicked end
Meeting on the battleground
Under threat of death
Inseminate with hatred
Now the guns decide
Who broke the law
Surrender or fight

Tombstone

Blood on the ground
Lead in the air
The war has just begun
O.K. Corral
Side by side
To kill the dirty bunch

A brother murdered brutal
Ambushing yellow rats
Now they have to pay the price
Selected for revenge
Malicious and blind
No use to hide no place to run
Wendetta burns inside
Until his work is done

Tombstone
