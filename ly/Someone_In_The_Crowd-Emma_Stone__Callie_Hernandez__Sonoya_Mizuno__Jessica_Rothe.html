		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You got the invitation
You got the right address
You need some medication?
The answer's always yes

A little chance encounter
Could be the one you've waited for
Just squeeze a bit more

Tonight we're on a mission
Tonight's the casting call
If this is the real audition
Oh, God, help us all

You make the right impression
Then ev'rybody knows your name
We're in the fast lane

Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
The one to finally lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
If you're the someone ready to be found

you're the someone ready to be found

Do what you need to do
'Til they discover you
And make you more than who
You're seeing now

So with the stars aligned
I think I'll stay behind
You've got to go and find

That someone in the crowd

That someone in the crowd

Is someone in the crowd the only thing you really see?
Watching while the world keeps spinning 'round?
Somewhere there's a place where I find who I'm gonna be
A somewhere that's just waiting to be found

Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
The someone who could lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd could take you where you wanna go
Someone in the crowd could make you
Someone in the crowd could take you
Flying off the ground
If you're the someone ready to be found
