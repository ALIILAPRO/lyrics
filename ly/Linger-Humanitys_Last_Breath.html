		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to hear
I don't want to see
All truths forgotten
Replaced by confusion
What is this feeling
Lingering in me

I don't want to feel
I don't know what's real
What is this feeling
Lingering in me

It sets in, it hangs heavy
There is no light here
It's setting in
I feel the pain become me

The burden instilled in us all
Consumed by tainted truths
What do you require of me?
I feel the pain become me

It's setting in, it hangs heavy
What is feeling
Lingering in me

It sets in, it hangs heavy
There is no light here
It's setting in
I feel the pain become me

It sets in, it hangs heavy
There is no light here
It's setting in
I feel the pain become me

Eyes forced open
And I ache
Starved of hope
Await to surrender
