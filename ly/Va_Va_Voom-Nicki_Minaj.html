		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could come inside of my play pen
'Cause he look like a superstar in the makin'
So I think that I'm going in for the takin'

Hear through the grapevine that he cakin'
We could shoot a movie, he could the tapin'
Boom-boom pow, this thing be shakin'
I ain't even tryin' to find out who he datin'

'Cause I know that he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them kiddin' games
I'm a runaway-eh, I'm a runaway-eh-eh

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you're looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va-va-voom-voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom-boom

If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va-va-voom-voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom-boom

Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could become my little problem
Cause he look like he modellin' clothes in Dublin
So I think that he gettin' that green a goblin

Heard through the grapevine that he hang low
We could shoot a movie, could bang like Rambo
Boom-boom pow, this thing's so bingo
Wondering if he can understand my lingo

'Cause I know, he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playin' them kiddin' games
I'm a runaway-eh, I'm a runaway-eh-eh

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you're looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va-va-voom-voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom-boom

If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va-va-voom-voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom-boom

Boy, I'm in this club slow-mo
Don't mind if I do
And I can tell you're feelin' me from the jump
I wanna ride too
You got that hot shit, boy you're blessed
Let me feel up on your chest
Flexin'
You the man, you the man, one hundred grand
The same old game go
Yes, I play it very well
Come baby lay it down, let me stay down
Let me show how I run ting in my playground
Come and get this va-va-voom-voom (woo)

I-I-I wanna give you one last option
I-I-I wanna give you one last chance
If-if you're looking for the main attraction
Just hold on tight and let me do my dance

If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va-va-voom-voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom-boom

If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va-va-voom-voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom-boom
