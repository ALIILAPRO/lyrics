		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We could tear it down if you don't want it up
I'd be another page that you just crumpled up
You probably love it that you chose to point the gun
Bullets you covered with the venom from your heart
I'm counting on this alibi or a lullaby
Deciding if I'm gonna make it tonight
Cuz all the ride or die you can kiss goodnight
When misery's my only friend
I don't understand
Cuz I know that sorry's never enough
And I fumbled all of what you want and the trust
And if you just think that I'm not enough
Consider me overthrown

Take what you want and leave it alone
The cracks in the clouds you pouring it on now
And sorry's just never enough for you and I just don't know what you want
I pray that it hurts you more than myself
To make some sense of all of this hell
Sorry's just never enough for you and I deserve to feel something real

Criminal mind the way you take all the time
I figured you out and you're just one of a kind
I stumbled in your maze and it's a hell of a ride
But I'm just running out of time
Pressures on my mind to break out of here
Bring me back to myself
Off this carousel
No more motion sickness from all the abuse
All the memories
Take it all from me
Throw the lighter on the flint I'm better myself
You're selfish baby
I know you hate me
No need to dig in what you hollowed out
I'm begging for mercy I can't weather the storm
You left me fucking broken so consider me overthrown

Take what you want and leave it alone
The cracks in the clouds you pouring it on now
And sorry's just never enough for you and I just don't know what you want
I pray that it hurts you more than myself
To make some sense of all of my hell
Sorry's just never enough for you and I deserve to feel something real
