		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Counting all this money with my brothers
I've been counting all this money with my brothers
And I'mma get money motherfucker

Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
We just want the money the respect and all the power
The money and the power fucking up a check
Check, check, check, check
These bitches fucking for a check
Check, check, check, check

Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
Jumping out them Rari's nigga do we have a problem
They say we ain't bout it wonder why they never tried us
We be flexing on the bitches and be cutting on the robbers
Fucking up them 36's with 30 bitches
No love for them dirty niggas we pouring liquor
The way we ball they know we richer
I feel like Richard, put her on pay fo
Get that G like 30 pictures
Look at all these young niggas, looking like we robbed the plug nigga
I only shop if its in blood nigga
And hold that chopper like a grudge nigga

Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
We just want the money the respect and all the power
The money and the power fucking up a check
Check, check, check, check
These bitches fucking for a check
Check, check, check, check

Count up that money they know we balling for sure
We stack them fifties and hundreds and leave the ones on the floor
I tell her get what you wanted I bet she coming for sure
Them bad bitches be flocking soon as we come in the door
Young Philly nigga fuck a check up on your main ho
Busting down the Rollie diamond dealing like a rainbow
I do what I want to I go places that you can't go
Leaning in my motherfucking Phantom like a Kangol
I fuck all my bitches on the jet, jet, jet, jet
You fuck all your hoes and pay a check, check, check, check
She could bless the kid out of respect, pect, pect, pect
Let her count the money now she wet, wet, wet, wet

Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
We just want the money the respect and all the power
The money and the power fucking up a check
Check, check, check, check
These bitches fucking for a check
Check, check, check, check

Look at all these young niggas, drug dealers
Lookin' like we came up on the plug nigga
Pick that fuck that check up in the club
And then buy your bitch a bag straight out of love nigga
I'm talking young niggas, drug dealers
Swerving in the Phantom sipping mud nigga
This the hit they love nigga

Look at these at all these young niggas flexing from the bottom
We just want the money the respect and all the power
The money and the power fucking up a check
Check, check, check, check
These bitches fucking for a check
Check, check, check, check
