		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hearing the wind
Hang up the phone but I'm feeling all night
Empty pillows, 2 AM

I cannot pretend that won't be long
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
'Cause baby you're the one

I can't even face the daylight
'Cause I'm already missing you
Baby we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

You got me lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
Lo-lo-lo-loving you
You got me lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
Lo-lo-lo-loving you

Loving you
Loving you

I'm missing your touch, I'm missing your smile
Love to feel your hands on my skin
Feeling a rush, it makes me go wild
Crazy how you know what I think

I cannot pretend that won't be long
Every minute that you're gone
But trust me, in the end it will be worth it
'Cause baby you're the one

I can't even face the daylight
'Cause I'm already missing you
Baby we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

You got me lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
Lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
You got me lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
Lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you

See the clock , close my eyes
Wishing I just have the hands of time
Make this kiss last forever
Forever, we gotta live our lives
That there won't stop me from loving you

I can't even face the daylight
'Cause I'm already missing you
Baby we'll say we'll be alright
But I'm already missing you

You got me lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
Lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
You got me lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you
Lo-lo-lo-loving you, loving you

Loving you
Loving you

Driving all night just to say goodbye
Windows down, hearing the wind
I'm mad at myself, I'm struggling now
But we've done this again and again
