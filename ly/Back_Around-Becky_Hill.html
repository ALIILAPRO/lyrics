		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the future's hard to see
When your troubles don't wanna leave
The highs ain't hitting like they used to do
You should know by now that I got you

When the nights are getting cold, cold, cold
And you're reaching for a hand to hold
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
You might be low, but you ain't down
Love is coming back around
Back around
Back around, back around
Love is coming
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
You might be low, but you ain't down
Love is coming back around
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
You might be low, but you ain't down
Love is coming

When you need reminding, I'll reassure (I'll reassure)
When you got nothing left, I'll give you more
Love is sweeter when you have to lose
And you should know by now that I got you, yeah, you, yeah

Oh
Oh-whoa
I got you, yeah
Yeah, yeah, hey
Oh
I got you, yeah, you, yeah
Oh, oh

When the nights are getting cold, cold, cold
And you're reaching for a hand to hold
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
You might be low, but you ain't down
Love is coming back around
Back around
Back around
Love is coming back around

Back around
Love is coming
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
You might be low, but you ain't down
Love is coming back around
Back around, back around, back around
Back around, back around, back
Love is coming
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
You might be low, but you ain't down
Love is coming back around
