		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
-
When the lights go out
And the smoke gets loud
Talkin' dirty in my ear
And you sitting on my lap
Tell me your intention
Or baby pipe down
Tell me your love language
We can talk it out

She stuck in the city for nights
She know Imma do her just right
She told me to book her a flight
My baby you just have arrived
One hunnid and 150 miles
Blue benzes and snow on the island
I know you be all on my line
Yeah you just be all on my line
-
Those hands on me
You dance for me
Got plans with me
Make bands with me
Those hands on me
You dance for me
Got plans with me
Make bands with me
-
When the lights go out
And the smoke gets loud
Talkin' dirty in my ear
And you sitting on my lap
Tell me your intention
Or baby pipe down
Tell me your love language
We can talk it out
-
She stuck in the city for nights
She know Imma do her just right
She told me to book her a flight
My baby you just have arrived
One hunnid and 150 miles
Blue benzes and snow on the island
I know you be all on my line
Yeah you just be all on my line
