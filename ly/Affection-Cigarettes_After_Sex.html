		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you say I get mean when I'm drinking, but
Then again, sometimes I get really sweet, so
What does it mean if I tell you to go fuck yourself
Or if I say that you're beautiful to me?

It's affection, always
Ooh, you gonna see it someday
My attention for you
Even if it's not what you need

Sometimes we talk all night long, we don't shut up
And when it's late we'll say we're still wide awake so
We love to talk about how you'll come up to visit me
And we'll rent a car and we'll drive upstate

It's affection, always
Ooh, you gonna see it someday
My attention's on you
Even if it's not what you need

I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you
I think of you, I want you too
I'd fall for you

It's affection, always
It's affection, always
