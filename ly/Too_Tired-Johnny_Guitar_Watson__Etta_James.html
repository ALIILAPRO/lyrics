		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I laid down last night, too tired to wake
I had a chill this mornin', too tired to shake
I got a good poker hand, too tired to win
I can hear my baby knockin', too tired to let her in

I'm tired
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm tired, woo
Too tired
Too tired for anythin'

I'm too tired to walk
Too tired to run
I can hear my baby callin'
Too tired, too tired

I'm tired
Yes, I'm tired
I'm tired
Too tired for anythin'

Take over Albert
I'm too tired for this

I'm tired of prosperity
I'm tired of luck
I'm sittin' on a pin
I'm too tired to get up

I'm tired
I declare I'm tired
I'm too tired
Too tired for anythin'

Oh, Albert I'm tired
You better take over Albert
I'm too tired baby
