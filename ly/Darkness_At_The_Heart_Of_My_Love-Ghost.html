		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the summer dies
Severing the ties
I'm with you always, always

Will you walk the line?
My path serpentine
Remember always
That love is all you need
Tell me who you wanna be
And I will set you free

There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
For you

Will you spill the wine
To summon the divine?
I'm with you always, always

Now paint a pair of eyes
And let's watch as it dries
Remember always, that love is all you need
Tell me who you wanna be
And I will set you free

There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
So bold, so sweet

There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
For you

Remember always
That love is all you need
Tell me who you wanna be
And I will set you free

There's a darkness at the heart of my love
That runs cold, runs deep
The darkness at the heart of my love
So bold, so sweet

There's a darkness at the heart of my love (my love)
That runs cold (runs cold), runs deep (runs deep)
The darkness at the heart of my love (my love)
So bold (so bold), so sweet (so sweet)

And all this time you knew
That I would put you through
The darkness at the heart of my love
For you

When the summer dies
Severing the ties
I'm with you always, always

Paint a pair of eyes
Let's watch as it dries
I'm with you always, always
