		<p>
		  (Sundown somewhere)

The one that's gonna make me wanna give her everything
Slow down my wild side, take me on a wild ride
The one that's gonna get me thinkin' 'bout a diamond ring
The one my mama meets, my little meant to be
I wanna make her fall, say some things I never said
The only problem is I ain't met her yet

But right now, some town, sundown somewhere
Ray-ban, windows down, blowing 'round her long hair
Don't even know her name, but I know she's out there
Right now, some town, sundown somewhere

She might be out in California, might be Tennessee
Maybe the Gulf coast, maybe right down the road
Can't help but wonder if she's wondering about me
Feeling a little lost, waiting on our paths to cross

Right now, some town, sundown somewhere
Ray-ban, windows down, blowing 'round her long hair
Don't even know her name, but I know she's out there
Right now, some town, sundown somewhere
Sundown somewhere

Right now, some town, sundown somewhere
Someday, it's gonna be worth the wait

But right now, some town, sundown somewhere
Ray-ban, windows down, blowing 'round her long hair
Don't even know her name, but I know she's out there
Right now, some town, sundown somewhere
Sundown somewhere
Sundown somewhere (I know she's out there)
Sundown somewhere (I know she's out there)
