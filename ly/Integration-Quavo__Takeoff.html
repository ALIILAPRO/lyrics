		<p>
		  Okay, so I just need to know how you reject white guys
Because I feel so bad when I do it
(Infinity)
(I love you, Atake)
The other day, this white guy stopped to me and he was like
"Hey, do you wanna hang out sometime?" And I was like
"Yeah, sure, can you send me a picture?"

White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(All my diamonds white but I'm not racist)
White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(All my diamonds white)
Wh-Wh-White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(All my diamonds white but I'm not racist)
White-White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(All my diamonds white, yeah)
White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(Ooh, Huncho)

Wh-Wh-White stones
White 1's, white laces (oh)
White teeth
They not veneers, but they the straightest (straight)
Off-white molly, she'll do anything to taste it (oh)
All white tee, told her to pull it out the basement (skrrt)
White squares, told aunt to come take it (white)
They right there and they sittin' up adjacent (uh)
Heads or tails (yeah), get your fifty back, you made it
I want white stones on my white clothes, I'm not racist
White see-through wraps (white)
Chrono with my watch (flame)
White drop top, heart stopped, body rock (white)
Ten karats an earlobe (ten)
I push it out the box (box)
They white, not clouded up (all my diamonds white, no, I'm not racist)
White see-through wraps (white)
Chrono with my watch (chrono)
White drop top (all my diamonds white)
Ten karats an earlobe (ten)
I push it out the box (box)
They white, not clouded up (all my diamonds white, no, I'm not racist)

White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(All my diamonds white)
White collar shirt, white shoes, white jeans, it's a white colony
(All my diamonds white)
Black collar shirt, black shoes, black jeans, it's a black colony
(All my diamonds white but I'm not racist)
Black collar shirt, black shoes, black jeans, it's a black colony
(All my diamonds white, yeah)
Black collar shirt, black shoes, black jeans (white)
It's a black colony
(White, white)

Black collar shirt
Hit up Eliantte if I want a black diamond link (brr)
Black Panther AP, came out the Wakanda factory
Black Force's lookin' like I'm 'bout to do a robbery
All black staff team
Fuck it, blackout everythin'
Black whips, black chains
Black owners but the difference is we is not slaves (no)
Migo QC family and nah, I'll never trade (Migos)
Blackout the nines
Out the window, let it spray (brrr)
You ain't gettin' money, don't talk to me
Blacked out lookin' like coffee beans (black)
What's a zebra without the white stripes?
All-black piano keys
What is it? You know I'm poppin' out the night
Feel like Biggie, I'm the black Frank White (B.I.G.)
I got my Loc's on, they some dark shades, hell yeah, I get high (high)
I'm in the field, you ain't never seen a Wraith, but know a black bird fly (brr)
They say Black men don't cheat, I say Black men don't cry (hell nah)
Like I'm gothic, clothes same color as an eyebrow (black)
Black mink, black ink, New York City blackout

Oh
And he sent me a picture, and he's white as can be
And I'm like, I can't, I, I just can't
It's not my fault, okay
So I just didn't answer him and now he's textin' me twenty times
And I just don't know how to tell him that I don't wanna
'Cause he's white and I can't date white guys anymore
'Cause I'm so stuck on black guys
(DJ Durel)
