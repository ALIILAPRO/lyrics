		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Charge it to the game I guess
Turn L's into lemons and zest
Double D's and a book on investing
Tryna get all of my shit up in check
I could never be a friend of a foe
But I fold at the sight of an are you up text 
Now I know what I gotta to do next Cause a nigga had me moving obsessed 
True yeah and still I let it slide
Electric
Now I've got you blocked like it's Tetris 
And now I only get it where the check is 
Like Look at all the baggage I just deadlift 
You ain't gotta tell me what attached is
I guess I really went and found my matching 
I ain't never gonna let you bring me down (down, down)

Cause even when you let me down (I'll wait)
I don't wanna watch you leave
(Night day)
See me when the sun goes down yeah
(Find me)
Wait I think I'm in too deep yeah
(I'll stay)
Cause even when you let me down I'll
(I'll wait)
I don't wanna watch you leave Break beats and heart breaks Late nights and heartache Fuck it I'll charge it
Fuck it lets charge it
Charge it to the game no fee
Book a flight red light
In the hopes that I might find peace
Cause my mother didn't raise a fool
But I do act one on the occasional
Cause I'm trying to stay a float like sailor do
But I'm fighting for my life like I'm sailor moon
Who told you to play yourself
You might just run it back
There's a thousand way to counter this
And yet I find I'm back
Plans too keep me wrapped around you 
Like a single piece of thread
Clearly somethings disconnected in my head

Cause even when you let me down
(I'll wait)
I don't wanna watch you leave
(Night day)
See me when the sun goes down yeah 
(Find me) Wait I think I'm in too deep yeah
(I'll stay)
Cause even when you let me down I'll
(I'll wait)
I don't wanna watch you leave 
Break beats and heart breaks 
Late nights and heartache 
Fuck it I'll charge it
Fuck it lets charge it

Cause even when you let me down (I'll wait)
I don't wanna watch you leave
(Night day)
See me when the sun goes down yeah
(Find me)
Wait I think I'm in too deep yeah
(I'll stay)
Cause even when you let me down I'll
(I'll wait)
I don't wanna watch you leave 
Break beats and heart breaks 
Late nights and heartache 
Fuck this lets charge it
Fuck it I'll charge it
