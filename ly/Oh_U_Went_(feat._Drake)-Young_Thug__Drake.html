Ayy, you went flyin' Bentley Spur
Ayy, you went drivin' 'round the world
Ayy, you went brown like a squirrel
Ayy, you went Chanel pearls
Ayy, you went Rolls-Royce car
Ayy, you went Rolls-Royce truck
Oh, you want war with all my hoes
Oh, you want to line it all up
Ayy, I'ma play it how it is
Ayy, I been player for some years
Ayy, you tryna steal all the spill
Ayy, I'm in the field on a pill
Ayy, you wanna spill, then let's spill
Ayy, you not real, niggas is
Rolls-Royce still Uncle Phil
Yeah

Oh, you went top off, oh, you went Flintstones
Oh, you took the lil' Rollie off, oh, you went big stones
Oh, you made two extra M's, oh, you went ringtones
Oh, you went train on that bitch, oh, you went, "Ding-dong"
Oh, you went kingpin, oh, you went wings in
Oh, you went hands-on, oh, you ain't seen it?
Oh, you went Demon, shootin' out the Demon (man)
Oh, you had came in
Now, they were streamin'

Ayy, you went flyin' Bentley Spur
Ayy, you went drivin' 'round the world
Ayy, you went brown like a squirrel
Ayy, you went Chanel pearls
Ayy, you went Rolls-Royce car
Ayy, you went Rolls-Royce truck
Oh, you want war with all my hoes
Oh, you want to line it all up
Ayy, I'ma play it how it is
Ayy, I been player for some years
Ayy, you tryna steal all the spill
Ayy, I'm in the field on a pill
Ayy, you wanna spill, then let's spill
Ayy, you not real, niggas is
Rolls-Royce still Uncle Phil

Yeah, look
6 God, he a visionary
I'm the definition like the dictionary
Baby, turn around, forget the missionary
If they pull up on me with some bad intentions
You gon' read about it in obituary
I got more soldiers than the military
I got more stones than a cemetery
I got more streams then y'all in February
It's gettin' hard to put a price on a show, can't even pick an amount now
If a nigga really try to jam me, get jammed first like the countdown
I thank God for that flight straight from the 9 side goin' Southbound
They say that life's about balance, baby
And the balance is in my account now
Okay, she gotta Perc' in her Birk'
I got her twerkin' in Turks
She probably let both of us hit
The way that she smirkin' at Durk
She gettin' cake off the picture she take
I say, "Girl, if it work then it work"
Fuck a wedding dress, I'm tryna merk it and skrrt

Ayy, you went flyin' Bentley Spur
Ayy, you went drivin' 'round the world
Ayy, you went brown like a squirrel
Ayy, you went Chanel pearls
Ayy, you went Rolls-Royce car
Ayy, you went Rolls-Royce truck
Oh, you want war with all my hoes
Oh, you want to line it all up
Ayy, I'ma play it how it is
Ayy, I been player for some years
Ayy, you tryna steal all the spill
Ayy, I'm in the field on a pill
Ayy, you wanna spill, then let's spill
Ayy, you not real, niggas is
Rolls-Royce still Uncle Phil
Yeah
