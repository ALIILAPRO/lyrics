		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I can tell you're bitter, babe)

It's like
Bein' on the outside of an inside joke
It's like
When they only got Pepsi and you really want Coke
It's like
You finally get a text back and it's just your mom
It's like
When you just broke up and they play your song

I know I said it's kinda stupid
But it's just the way I'm feeling right now
And I hate that I can tell
That someone's probably in my shoes by now
Right now

I know she thinkin' that she found herself a winner
I know you fucked her on the counter 
Right before you cooked her dinner, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth
Can she taste me now
That you threw out all our furniture and pictures
I bet you sugarcoat the truth
I bet you're real sweet with her, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth
Can she taste me now

I'm bitter
(I'm bitter, I'm bitter
I'm bitter, I'm bitter)

Hear about your new life and the brand new you
It's like
Heard you got a new job but I heard you moved
It's like
I don't wanna hear it, don't wanna hear about you
It's like
I don't give a fuck (yeah, I do)

I know I said it's kinda stupid
But it's just the way I'm feeling right now
And I hate that I can tell
That someone's probably in my shoes by now
Right now

I know she thinkin' that she found herself a winner
I know you fucked her on the counter 
Right before you cooked her dinner, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth
Can she taste me now
That you threw out all our furniture and pictures
I bet you sugarcoat the truth
I bet you're real sweet with her, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth
Can she taste me now

I'm bitter
(I'm bitter, I'm bitter
I'm bitter, I'm bitter)

You're still in my head, but
You're not in my bed, now
You're not in my bed, now
You're still in my head, but
You're not in my bed, now
You're not in my bed, now

I know she thinkin' that she found herself a winner
I know you fucked her on the counter 
Right before you cooked her dinner, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth
Can she taste me now
That you threw out all our furniture and pictures
I bet you sugarcoat the truth
I bet you're real sweet with her, yeah
I know you think about me when you kiss her
I left a taste in your mouth
Can she taste me now

I'm bitter
(I'm bitter, I'm bitter
I'm bitter, I'm bitter)

Well you know I'm bitter
