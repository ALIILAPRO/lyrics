		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In still water crocodile lies
Until something inside will rise
A thought quietly coming up
It's not sorry to interrupt
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Songbird driving himself insane
Forgot why he even came this way
His new feathers are made of gold
Will shine on, you know he won't get old
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)

Everyone's got opinions 'bout it
"Soon you'll like the sound"
Tired of hearing them talk around it
But soon you'll like the sound
Yeah, soon you'll like the sound

Maybe something to ease the pain
Maybe already in your veins
Your now golden scales blind the eye
One more songbird rises to the sky
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)

Everyone's got opinions 'bout it
Tired of hearing them talk around it
"Soon you'll like the sound"
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-oh-oh-oh)
