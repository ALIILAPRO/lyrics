		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine, the girls around town assemble
The traveler's son they come askin'
Where he came from
'Cause they've watched him
Washing his face near the pond
A curious boy and they wonder
Where he came from

He says, "I, I have seen the world's most beautiful places
Still I feel, as If I'm a walking machine
Watching it all through a screen
There is nothing in between to me
This might as well not be real"

Imagine, the girls take him up on a hill
It's an Indigo night, there's a chill
The boy is confused but he's still
As they gather around him
So many of them, they all sing
About the pleasures of life

And he cries, "Why can't I sing along with some feeling, or some meaning?
It feels like I've always been blind
I don't know why you girls are so kind
For there are so many in line
Whose lives aren't as lost as mine"

Now something happened there
The smell of the grass, or maybe the air
There was no more despair
Just something about that night
Maybe the girls, they lit some light
And made everything right
'Cause he's never been
More alive
