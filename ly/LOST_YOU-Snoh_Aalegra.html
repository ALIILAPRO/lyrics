		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Didn't know that love could change up
Then I woke up to a stranger
After all this time I thought that I knew
You and I was no debating
Now it's up for conversation
Tell me was it all a lie? I'm confused (mmm)

But then you say what I wanna hear
'Cause you know it's gon' get me here
Every time I say that I'm through
And even though I know it ain't right
Said I wasn't gon' spend the night
Here I am right back with you

Although I lost you
I, I'll always want you
'Cause you take me high (high)
See I'll always want you
But I know I've lost you (ah)

Say it, right
Ah, ah-ah-ah

I won't hold the past against you
When you hold me, I forget to
I can never draw the line with you, no
Wish I knew what you were thinking
But that probably wouldn't change shit
So deep in, I'm still falling for you

But then you say what I wanna hear
'Cause you know it's gon' get me here
Every time I say that I'm through
And even though I know it ain't right
Said I wasn't gon' spend the night
Here I am right back with you

Although I lost you
I, I'll always want you (I'll always want you)
'Cause you take me high (high)
See I'll always want you
But I know I've lost you

Ah-da-da-da-da (yeah)
Ah-ah-ah
