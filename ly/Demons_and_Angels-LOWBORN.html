		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still living in a knife fight
Living like a bad guy
Can't stand what I look like
I keep praying like a saint be
Leaving it'll change me
But the voices won't leave

I see the tunnel full of light again
I never reach it and it's getting dim
I feel the darkness try to pull me in
It just won't end it's sinking in my skin

I'm stuck in a war
I️ am broken and torn
Dividing my head and my heart
Between the good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
They're tearing me apart

Good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
Good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels


I keep begging for these bad things
Living out my dark dreams
Don't you try to save me
I'm just looking for forgiveness
Someone who can end this
Can I get a witness

It's good for my flesh
It ain't good for my soul
I want it to stop
But I got no control

I'm stuck in a war
I️ am broken and torn
Dividing my head and my heart
Between the good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
They're tearing me apart

Good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
Good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels


I'm stuck in a war
I️ am broken and torn
Dividing my head and my heart
Between the good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
They're tearing me apart

Good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
Good and the evil
God and the devil
Demons and angels
