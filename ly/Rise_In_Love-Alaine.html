		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before you...... 

[Intro] Before you, I was empty Nothing left, was just a shell Before you, loneliness was all I felt 
[Verse 1] didn't want to fall in love no more, Was so sad I, felt so many times I hit the floor, hurt so bad I didn't want no one to bring me down, was sick and tired Then you came to lift me off the ground, and you take me higher 

[Chorus] We rise, we rise in love You and I, keep rising We rise, we rise in love Higher, were flying Our love will rise 

[Verse 2] Rescuing me from all the pain I felt, before I met you Dried my eyes and made me smile again, you helped me get through Now I know what loves supposed to be, its like you're flying Now I know the love I've found is real, cause it keeps on rising 

[Chorus] We rise, we rise in love You and I, keep rising We rise, we rise in love Higher, were flying Our love will rise 

[Bridge] Were so high and we keep rising We keep climbing, higher and higher And we keep soaring, we keep growing, we keep loving Our love is flying We rise, we rise You and I (keep rising) 

[Chorus] We rise, we rise in love You and I, keep rising We rise, we rise in love Higher, were flying Our love will rise
