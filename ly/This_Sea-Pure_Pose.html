		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You
You came in and they see you run You did
You come in
Oh
You come in as the sea So bright
I don’t mind
And you
You came in, took the key and ran It’s what they say
Oh oh oh
I’ve been called into this sea This sea of love
of lo-ove
I’ve been hauled into this pit of love/ Alone
of love/Alone
You
You blame me and I knew you won You did
You let go
Oh
You ran into the sea So Wild
It’s undone
And you
You came in, took the key and ran Just as they said
