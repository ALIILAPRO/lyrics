		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do I do?
When the drugs aren't working anymore?
She don't love me like she did before
When I should be fine, but I'm just bored
Alone
What do I do?

Sat down and cried to myself, I'm alright
This whiskey's been tasting like teardrops on ice
There's so much that's playing back inside my mind
I hate that I miss you
Damn, near every night

I just can't risk it darling
I've been broken for too long
I'ma put up my guard and just move along
'Cause everything that I believe in always proves me wrong
And I'm alone again
Tell me, baby

What do I do?
When the drugs aren't working anymore?
She don't love me like she did before
When I should be fine, but I'm just bored
Alone
What do I do?

What do I do?
Tell me, baby
What do I do?

This feels like a film I've seen too many times
The problem with pain's that it's not black and white
There's so much that's playing back inside my mind
I wish we could talk
Please give me one more night

But I just can't risk it darling
I've been broken for too long
I'ma put up my guard and just move along
'Cause everything that I believe in always proves me wrong
And I'm alone again
Tell me, baby

What do I do?
When the drugs aren't working anymore?
She don't love me like she did before
When I should be fine, but I'm just bored
Alone
What do I do?

What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
