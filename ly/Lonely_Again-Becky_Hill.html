		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You never speak to strangers, do you?
You hate when talk is small
Always looking at your trainers on you
Instead of standing tall

And you hide all your fears with arrogance
But I see all the way through
You can find me with your skeletons
I'll dance with the darkness in you

So tell me how it feels to know you'll never be lonely again?
You'll spend the rest of your life knowing you
Refuse to ever be lonely again and again and again
So tell me how it feels to see your future is right here with me
Believe that you got the freedom to choose
Refuse to ever be lonely again and again and again and again

Again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh)
And again and again, never lonely again

You've never known a love before me
I'll show you what it takes
All you gotta do is reassure me
And my faith will never shake, hey, yeah

With my hand in the air, I'll make an oath
To always stay by your side
I will be there through your darkest nights
I'm here 'til the day I die

So tell me how it feels to know you'll never be lonely again?
You'll spend the rest of your life knowing you
Refuse to ever be lonely again and again and again
So tell me how it feels to see your future is right here with me
Believe that you got the freedom to choose
Refuse to ever be lonely again and again and again and again

Again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again (oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (no)
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again (never be lonely)
And again and again, never lonely again
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (never be lonely, yeah)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh, oh)
And again and again, never lonely again (oh-oh)
And again and again, never lonely again
