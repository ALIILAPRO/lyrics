		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But did you know
I hold my breath through every tunnel?
And wish I could get over this feeling of slipping under
I never get that far

Everything's so uncertain
Can't find the right direction
You look in the mirror and tell me you see clear
I lie, say I can see me but I can't get past this feeling
I'd talk but no one listens
Can't make my own decisions

Every night I lay asleep
And try to wake up from this dream

Numb but I still feel it crawling under my skin
I threw it all away but it still stays the same
Try and forget my name but it's something I just can't shake
I threw it all away but it still stays the same

Every night I lay asleep
And try to wake up from this dream

But did you know
I hold my breath through every tunnel?
And wish I could get over this feeling of slipping under
I never get that far
