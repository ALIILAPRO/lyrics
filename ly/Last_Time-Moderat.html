		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was dead asleep
Behind
Towering walls

They built a world outside
And I
Missed the wake-up call

My stony breath crawled
To glory heavens be
There was a sea of sound
But it was silence 
That stole my sleep

When I was dead asleep
Behind 
Towering walls

They built a world outside
And I
Missed the wake-up call

When I break cripple legs
Through long winding streets
Fill me with suffering
And the people
Would see right through me
