		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She asked me how to be funny
But that's not somethin' you can teach
What seemed so blue in the sunlight
By the night was a pale green

And I tried to hold her
But it didn't really last long
And she's gettin' older
I guess she's gotta cut her blue hair off

She asked me if she was pretty
Well, it's clear that the girl's a fraud
There's really no way of winning
If in their eyes you'll always be a dumb blonde

And she cried over nothing
So there was nothing I could do to stop
Her from cutting
Her beautiful blue hair off

It looked like cotton candy
And just as quick to get licked away
Last I heard she was livin'
With a boy who acts his age

And I guess I'll just miss her
Even though she isn't even really gone
But things are just different
Ever since she cut her blue hair off
