		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake up on my deathbed
It ain't time to rest yet
The reaper fuckin' hate him
Because I always crawl back
I tried to be a savior
When I needed a savior
Where were you when I was
Down, out on the pavement
Where were you when I was
Drowning in the wastewater
Minutes from death's cold hands
It aint just entertainment
Am I ghost
I tried my best just to be an angel
Where was I when you needed me most
You still tried your best to be my savior
And I crashed down by your side and said
What's life like when everyone that you used to know is a ghost
What's life like when you're lost and got nowhere to even go home
Who's life is this I'm living I don't recognize me no more
I asked you for an angel but all that you sent me were ghosts
What's life like when everyone that you used to know is a ghost
What's life like when you're lost and got nowhere to even go home
Who's life is this I'm living I don't recognize me no more
I asked you for an angel but all that you sent me were ghosts
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
I'M CRUSHED
