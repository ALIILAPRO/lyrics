		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

The drink you spilt all over me
'Lover's Spit' left on repeat
My mom and dad let me stay home
It drives you crazy, getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

We can talk it so good
We can make it so divine
We can talk it good
How you wish it would be all the time

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

This dream isn't feeling sweet
We're reeling through the midnight streets
And I've never felt more alone
It feels so scary, getting old

I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
How all the thoughts (how all the thoughts)
Moved 'round our heads (moved 'round our heads)
I want 'em back (I want 'em back)
The minds we had (the minds we had)
It's not enough to feel the lack
I want 'em back, I want 'em back, I want 'em

You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
Laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough

You're the only friend I need
Sharing beds like little kids
Laughing 'til our ribs get tough
But that will never be enough
