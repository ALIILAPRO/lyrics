		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We want to see some blood
We need a new whore
We don't give a fuck
We just want more
Blood
We want
Blood
We want blood
I'm gonna fuck the whole in Kennedy's head
Revolt deface resist
Push the button
Legalize freedom
Let's shoot the president,
Rape the queen
And feel the flowers breath again
Inside this dead machine
Swimming into nowhere
Thrill kill avenue,
Cuttin' her slowly
Liberty, she crawls to me
I slept the last mile on our way to endsville
Shove it inside her
Spectro-trippin on
I slept the last mile on our way to endsville
Spread your legs,
Don't look at me
Cut me, rape me, make me free
Breeders screaming dreaming bloodless
For the loveless
White sound, oceans of dreams
I won't be another number on the screen
Shh I want to hear you scream
I won't be another number
White sound, jet black scream
Vomiting this cold mass of hate
I'm gonna push my love
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her
I have heard abortion
Stories from the leather nun
Holding hands with dead girls
Hiding from the sun
I did a line
I did a line 
I did a line 
I did a line 
The lines that define begin to gray and fade now
We shoot out the lights and swallow razor blades
I feel nothing for the meat that came before
Liberty, she crawled to me playing the whore
