		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Laying here waiting for sleep to take me
But that dream just hasn't been coming lately
My thoughts are left to their own devices
They tend to drift toward what might have been

Ooo
Am I running out of ways to get to you?
Is it something that I've been holding on just to lose?
Am I running out of ways to get to you?

Sometimes it feels like I feel things too much
I hold back my heart like it's too hot to touch
And you can believe it's the last thing I want
To put any more space in between us

Ooo
Am I running out of ways to get to you?
Is it something that I've been holding on just to lose?
Am I running out of ways to get to you?
To get to you

Lend me your, lend your ear
And I'll tell you any secret that you want to hear Hold 
Lend me your, lend me your voice
And sing with me until we drown out the noise Hold 
Lend me your, lend me your eye
And pull into focus what I couldn't find
Lend me your, lend me your mind
Cuz here with you I don't feel lonely tonight and you

*Choir alt:

Am I running, am I running, am I running
Am I running out of ways to get to you?
Is it something that I've been holding on just to lose? Running, am I running, am I running
Am I running out of ways to get to you?
To get to you

Ooo Am I running, am I running, am I running
Am I running out of ways to get to you?
Is it something that I've been holding on just to lose? Running
Am I running out of ways to get to you
To get to youuuuuuuu Cut on beat 1

Am I running out of ways?
