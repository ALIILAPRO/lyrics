		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got two strong arms 
Blessings of Babylon 
Time to carry on and try 
For sins and false alarms 
So to America the brave 
Wise men save 

Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where an old man of Aran 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where an old man of Aran 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
He'll never, never fight over you 

Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where a old man of Aran 
Goes around an around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where a old man of Aran 
Goes around an around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
He'll never, never fight over you 

I got plans for us 
Nights in the scullery 
And day instead of me 
I only know what to discuss 
Of for anything but light 
Wise men fighting over you 

It's not me you see 
Pieces of valentine 
With just a song of mine 
To keep from burning history 
Seasons of gasoline and gold 
Wise men fold 

Near a tree by a river 
There's a hole in the ground 
Where an old man of Aran 
Goes around and around 
And his mind is a beacon 
In the veil of the night 
For a strange kind of fashion 
There's a wrong and a right 
He'll never, never fight over you 

I got time to kill 
Sly looks surround it all 
Without a plan of yours 
A blackbird sings on bluebird hill 
Thanks to the calling of the wild 
Wise mens' child
