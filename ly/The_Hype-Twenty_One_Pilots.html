		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed
My interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I'll dissipate
I'll record my step through for my basement tapes

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

Yeah, they might be talking behind your head
Your exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt
But you don't get thick skin without getting burnt

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around

No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
No, I don't know which way I'm going
But I can hear my way around
But I can hear my way around

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype (don't believe the hype)

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype

Nice to know my kind will be on my side
I don't believe the hype
And you know you're a terrible sight
But you'll be just fine
Just don't believe the hype
