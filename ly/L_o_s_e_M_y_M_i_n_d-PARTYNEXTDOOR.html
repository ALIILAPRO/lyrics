		<p>
		  Okay

Jahron, meet Jada
Jada, meet Jahron

Ayy, y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Fuckin' two bitches at one time
Couldn't make me choose if it depended on my life
One's half-Spanish and one's half-white
Ooh-whoa, and my tattoo is on her body
Whoa, oh-whoa, there's no controllin' her

When she's off that molly (molly)
When she's rollin' that body (body)
When she's talkin' that softly (softly)
Hard to get her off me (me)
Drippin' in Dior, you like it
I could put ten on the floor, if you like it
If y'all keep fuckin' me more then y'all might be
Bad for me

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
(Y'all gon' make me lose my mind)
(Up in here, up in here)
(Y'all gon' make me go all out)
(Up in here, up in here)
(Y'all gon' make me act a fool)
(Up in here, up in here)
(Y'all gon' make me lose my cool)
(Up in here, up in here)

All I can think about is your booties, and
Y'all ridin' me like Suzukis, and
Y'all sayin' y'all never do this, but
Tonight, you're doin' it to me
And I say, oh-ooh
My hands are all on her body
Tryna control it, I can't control it when she's off that-

When she's off that molly (when she's off that)
When she's rollin' that body (when she's rollin')
When she's talkin' that softly (when she's talkin')
Hard to get her off me (off)
Drippin' in Dior, you like it
I could put ten on the floor if you like it
If y'all keep fuckin' me more then y'all might be (be)
Bad for me (me)

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind (yeah, yeah)
(Y'all gon' make me lose my mind)
(Up in here, up in here) ooh
(Y'all gon' make me act a fool, fool, fool, a fool)

(I love to love)
(I really don't need a girl)
(I don't wanna get married)
(I could be single for the rest of my life)
(Why would I date one girl)
(Spend a million dollars on her, on gifts)
(When I could date ten)
(And spend a hunnid thousand dollars on them?)
