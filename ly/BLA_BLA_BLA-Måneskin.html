		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
You broke my heart so I crashed your car
You say you're sorry, well I bet you are
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah

And bla-bla, bla-bla-bla, bla, bla
I hate your face but I like your mom's
You play it smart but you look so dumb
Du-du, du-du-du, du-dumb
And ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah

I wanna fuck, let's go to my spot
But I'm too drunk and I can't get hard
Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha, ha-hard

And bla-bla, bla-bla-bla, bla, bla
You said you love me but it's just for fun
Give me a chance and I'll make you a lady
Gaga-gaga-gaga-ga

And ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
You like cocaine but you don't like pot
You say I'm a loser 'cause I want a puff
Pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-puff

And bla-bla, bla-bla-bla, bla, bla
You said, "Goodbye" so guess what I've done
I called your best friend and I said, "Wassup?"
"Let's fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fuck"

So ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
And then we went to your favorite club
She drank too much and she said you are
A twa-twa-twa-twa-twa-twa-twat

And ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Then I drove into a parking lot
She smiled and told me, "You have a massive car"
Ca-car, co-co-co-cock

And ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
I don't get how I felt in love
I guess I liked playing with your dog
It made me feel like we had a son
But fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fuck you

My mama told me that she never liked you
My life sucks and the blame is on you
So fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fuck you, again

And no-no, no-no-no, no, no
You got me angry and now I love punk
I listen to The Smiths crying alone
So please, please let me get what I want

So fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fuck you
All my friends they were right about you
You are so basic and you've got stupid tattoos
So fu-fu-fu-fu-fu-fuck you, again

And do no-no, no-no-no, no, no
You said I'm ugly and my band sucks
But I just got a billion streaming song
So kiss, kiss my bu-bu-bu-bu-bu-butt
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah
