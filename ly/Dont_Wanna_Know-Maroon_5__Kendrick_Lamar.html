		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

Wasted (wasted)
And the more I drink the more I think about you
Oh no, no, I can't take it
Baby, every place I go reminds me of you

Do you think of me? 
Of what we used to be?
Is it better now that I'm not around?
My friends are actin' strange 
They don't bring up your name
Are you happy now?
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

And I every time I go out, yeah
I hear it from this one, I hear it from that one
That you got someone new
Yeah, I see but I don't believe it
Even in my head you're still in my bed
Maybe I'm just a fool

Do you think of me? 
Of what we used to be? (What we used to be)
Is it better now that I'm not around? (That I am not around)
My friends are actin' strange (yeah)
They don't bring up your name (mhm)
Are you happy now? (Mhm)
Are you happy now?

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know

No more, please stop
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this, do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we gon' let the past be
May be his right now, but your body's still me, woah

I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, no
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home
And loving you so, so, so, so
The way I used to love you, oh (the way I used to love you)
I don't wanna know, know, know, know
Who's taking you home, home, home, home (you)
And loving you so, so, so, so (you)
The way I used to love you, oh
I don't wanna know
