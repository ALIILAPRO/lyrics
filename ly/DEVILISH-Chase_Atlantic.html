		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yuh
Sever off the head and watch the body fall
See you in the depths, that ain't a metaphor (ay)
Sex, blood, fashion, drippin' holy water
Holy shit, she worshiping my dick like it's the holy father

Triple the six, abandon your God 'cause he don't exist (ay)
I keep the blade on me, talk if you wish then I cut off your wrists (ay)
Medication got me higher than Heaven, but God I'm the shit
I got fixes straight from Hades, I'm poppin' the pills like I'm sick (ay)

I only exist to fall
Habits like the ghost of God
I just walk the earth 'til I'm gone
Feeling homesick, fire up and burn, bitch, yuh, yuh

Devilish, fuckin' with my guys, yuh
I make sacrifices, you make lies up
Heaven lost an angel when I signed up
I might fuck her friend, ain't made my mind up
I'm devilish, yuh, I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh, I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, Satan the plug, he love me, yuh
The devil works, 'cause Satan the plug, he love me

Settle down
You don't wanna see me drag the devil out
You don't wanna see no demons in your fucking house
You don't want severe damage to your mental health, yuh

I take drugs on the daily
I take pity on the people tryna save me, yuh
God doesn't exist and he's a mythical lil' bitch
And you will never catch me prayin', oh

I only exist to fall
Habits like the ghost of God
I just walk the earth 'til I'm gone
Feeling homesick, fire up and burn, bitch, yuh, yuh

Devilish, fuckin' with my guys, yuh
I make sacrifices, you make lies up
When I signed up
I might fuck her friend, ain't made my mind up
I'm devilish, yuh, I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh, I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh, I'm devilish, yuh
I'm devilish, yuh, I'm devilish
