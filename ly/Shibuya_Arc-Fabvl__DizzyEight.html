		  VERSE 1:

Yea

I’ve been living with the devil up inside my head and now I think it’s showin’

Cause if God’s giving all his hardest battles to the strongest than I must be glowin’

Fire spitter hit em’ something like Jogo

Putting a hit on my head that’s a no no

Look at my

Look at my

Neck and my wrist

I could take your whole f***in’ team on solo

OH NO!

I never knew what the city meant to me until I was watching it burn

Now imma settle the score and b***h I won’t sit around waiting my turn

King of the curses, put em’ in urns

I don’t think that I could ever return

But I was always a man of my word

I’m gonna end it, they’re gonna learn

Ya’ll threw the crown to me

And ever since this pain’s been a noun to me

The green grass is nothing but a fallacy

Another channel for the everyday crowd to see

Yea my only reality

Ends in fatalities

So tell me you’re proud of me

Get this s***t outta me

Cause all this power I though that I

CONJURED

Turned me straight into a

MONSTER


CHORUS:

I hear demons calling

Singing to me in the dark

They’re telling me I’m crawling

“CLOSER TO THE EDGE SO JUMP NOW!”

There’s no fear of falling

When the devil’s in your heart

No more need for stalling

“GIVE IN TO THE HATE AND PLAY YOUR PART!” 


VERSE 2:

I’m losing my mind 

I’m losing my people 

They losing they’re lives 

I Used to have vision 

I’m losing my eyes 

The darker my days 

Then the more I go blind 

I’m Blinded by pain 

Blinded by hate 

Blinded by shame 

I’m losing my faith 

I’m going insane But through my insanity Feel like the man in me Broke from his cage 

And that’s when it changed 

They want the demon in him Free 

then his whole demeanor switching 

Killing everybody I don’t see a difference 

Ill be the one to make a villain a victim 

was stuck in the prison of feeling like I was a monster 

think it’s time to embrace it

He got what he wanted 

don’t be afraid when I slowly walk up to erase him 

GO!!!

Look in my eyes for a minute 

You’ll find that my light start dimming and my heart augmented 

The beast been unleashed

I don’t care if there’s blood on my hands 

if at-least I know yours what I’m spillin 

Returning the feeling of fear 

and it’s chillin the calm in the spirit

Committed in paying back all of the pain that was given to who I hold dearest

don’t care if that mean that I’ll turn to menace cause RIGHT NOW!!!


CHORUS:

I hear demons calling

Singing to me in the dark

They’re telling me I’m crawling

“CLOSER TO THE EDGE SO JUMP NOW!” 

There’s no fear of falling

When the devil’s in your heart

No more need for stalling

“GIVE IN TO THE HATE AND PLAY YOUR PART!”

BRIDGE:

I’ve been beaten

I’ve been broken

(Yea I been beaten I been broken)

A new me’s been awoken

I used to feel like I was chosen

( A new me’s been awoken)

Now I couldn’t tell you where the hope went

(No I couldn’t tell you where the hoop went I’m so spent I’ll…)

I’ll never be the same

It get wicked when you really in the rain

only thing I feel is venom in my vein

All I feel is rage, when you feel afraid, I don’t feel a thing

AND I BEEN SO AFRAID OF MY OWN DAMN THOUGHTS

I FINALLY KNOW THE COST!!!

CHORUS:

I hear demons calling

Singing to me in the dark

They’re telling me I’m crawling

“CLOSER TO THE EDGE SO JUMP NOW!”

There’s no fear of falling

When the devil’s in your heart

No more need for stalling

“GIVE IN TO THE HATE AND PLAY YOUR PART!”
