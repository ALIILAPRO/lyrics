		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is pounding
My stomach's inside out
I'm feeling find-a-shaky
My mind is full of doubt

All I ever think about
Is fearing fear itself
Wish I could unscrew my head
And put it on the shelf

You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange
You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange

Everything is twisted
Everything is oh so tight
Don't know what I'm lookin' at
The lights are all too bright

My brain's about to crumble
Spill out on the floor
Sweep 'em up, Throw 'em away
Don't want 'em anymore

You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange
You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange

Clouds race across the sky, Day turns into night
Still there are the questions, No answers in sight

Everything is twisted
Everything is oh so tight
Starin' out the window
Everything is just too bright

Brain's about the crumble
Spill out on the floor
Wish I could unscrew my head
And kick it out the door

You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange
You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange
You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange
You know I'm feeling kind-a...Strange
