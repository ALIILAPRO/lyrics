		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes
Are you there?
(Is it) wonderful to know
All the ghosts
All the ghosts
Freak my selfish out
(My) mind is happy
Need to learn to let it go
I know you'd do no harm to me
(But) since you've been gone I've been lost inside
Tried and failed as we walked by the riverside
Oh I wish you could see the love in her eyes
The best friend that eluded you lost in time
Burned alive in the heat of a grieving mind
Oh what can I say now?
And it couldn't be more wrong 'cause there's no one there
Unmistakably lost and without a care
Oh lost all the love that we could have shared
And it's wearing me down
And it's turning me round
And I can't find a way now
To find it out
Where are you when I need you
Are you there?
