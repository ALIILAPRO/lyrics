		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time can be so cruel sometimes
It washes all sadness,
death, and deep wounds away
The black ashes name "war"
has been washed away
by a shower of rain
And it only left the legacy
Which twisted and we believed
But we were born without
knowing the truth of the war
We are living in the country far
from the war
The weak are to be blamed and
blames the weaker
It spreads and repeats
liKe a ripple of water
In each country
we find a different
text of history we know
Buried lives and painful truth
It's a flower over a soldiers
fought with noble pride
What will bloom on
this world of contradiction?
It doesn't mean who's bad
to a blood that spilt over
Torn apart love
Crushed youth is forever gone

This place where we stand
This air that we breath
It's just another
soldiers piece of dream
The coffee that we drink
in the morning time
The view of the park wet
in morning dew An everyday
happiness There's a flower that
blooming over a
soldiers fought with noble pride
The sound of morning bell
A sad song of heroes
It's a flower over a soldiers
fought with noble pride
What will bloom on
this world of contradiction?
It doesn't mean who's bad
to a blood that spilt over
It doesn't matter who is really
right or wrong anymore
There's no responsibility
It doesn't matter who is really
right or wrong in the war
There's no left or right in here
Just we must
keep our pride of soldiers
The sound of morning bell
A sad song of heroes
