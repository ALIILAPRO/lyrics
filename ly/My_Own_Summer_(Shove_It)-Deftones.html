		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey you, big star
Tell me when it's over (cloud)

Hey you, big mood, guide me to shelter
'Cause I'm through
When the two hits the six and it's summer (cloud)

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)

I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowds in the street
And no sun 
In my own summer

The shade is a tool, a device, a savior
See, I try and look up to the sky
But my eyes burn (cloud)

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)

I think God is moving its tongue
There's no crowd in the street
And no sun
In my own summer

Come (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Shove (shove it, shove it, shove it)
The sun (shove it, shove it, shove it)
Aside (shove it aside)
