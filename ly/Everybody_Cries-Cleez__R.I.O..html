		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody cries just a little
Sometimes there's a riddle
When will those days go by
Everybody cries in the middle
Of the night just a little
I need you by my side
Cause i can't move on
I don't wanna be alone
Can't make it on my own
Everybody cries just a little
Sometimes there's a riddle
I need you by my side

Everybody cries just a little
Sometimes there's a riddle
When will those days go by
Everybody cries in the middle
Of the night just a little
I need you by my side
Everybody cries
Everybody cries
Days go
Everybody
Everybody cries
Everybody cries
Days go
Everybody

Everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody cries just a little
Sometimes there's a riddle
When will those days go by
Everybody cries in the middle
Of the night just a little
I need you by my side
Cause i can't move on
I don't wanna be alone
Can't make it on my own
Everybody cries just a little
Sometimes there's a riddle
I need you by my side

Everybody cries just a little
Sometimes there's a riddle
When will those days go by
Everybody cries in the middle
Of the night just a little
I need you by my side
Everybody cries
Everybody cries
Days go
Everybody
Everybody cries
Everybody cries
Days go
Everybody
