		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're saving the saved,
Men and women enslaved,
Propagating the messiah conception
The rich getting richer,
Paint you into the picture,
Give the poor immaculate deception

Where are you Father?
Why don't you save us?
The fallen are dying alone
How can you shut off their cries?
Ignore a new genocide?
So come on, Jesus,
We're all here waiting just for you

How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are keepin' me, keepin' me down
How long? Cause my faith is breaking,
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down

Do you live in the light
Or in the dead of the night?
Sanctimonious promises broken
Hypocritical sin,
Dying slowly within,
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?

Life ever after,
Bohemian rapture,
Beware the dark side of the sun.
You're just a self-made messiah,
Selling brimstone and fire
So come on, Jesus,
Don't keep us waiting just for you

How long must we keep on waiting?
The faithful and blind are bringin' me, bringin' me down
How long? Cause my faith is breaking,
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down

How will I know you, Mr. Jesus Christ?
Have you already been here once or twice?
The son of man are obsolete facade,
How will I know that you're the son of God?
Yeah
