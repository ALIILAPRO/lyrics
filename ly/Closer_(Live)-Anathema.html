		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your dream world is a very scary place 
Your dream world is a very scary place 
Your dream world is a very scary place
To be trapped 

Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place
Your dream world is a very scary place 
To be trapped inside
To be trapped inside 
To be trapped inside 
All your life 

Shine in time 
Shine in time 
Shine in time 
Until you find 

You're closer 
You're closer 
To the truth 

Within you 
Within you 
Within you 
Is the truth 

That your dream world is a very scary place 
That your dream world is a very scary place 
That your dream world is a very scary place 
To be trapped inside 
To be trapped inside 
To be trapped inside 
All your life 

You're closer 
You're closer 
You're closer 
To the truth 

Within you 
Within you 
Within you 
Is the truth
