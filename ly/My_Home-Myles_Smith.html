		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like shelter from the storm
A fireplace that keeps me warm (hm, hm-mm-mm)
Like a match can spark a flame
You start a fire inside my veins (hm, hm-mm-mm)

Somehow with you, I don't feel alone, hm-mm

You'll always be my home, my heart
I'll be with you wherever you are
My home, my heart
I feel you with me when we're worlds apart

You'll always be my home
Ho-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome

You accept me for my flaws
You give me everything and more (hm, hm-mm-mm)
Even in my darkest nights
I know you're there right by my side (hm, hm-mm-mm)

Somehow with you, I don't feel alone, hm-mm

You'll always be my home, my heart
I'll be with you wherever you are
My home, my heart
I feel you with me when we're worlds apart

You'll always be my home
Ho-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome
You'll always be my home
Ho-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome

(Home) Bring me home, close to you
I miss your arms wrapped around me
Bring me home, close to you, I miss your arms

You'll always be my home, my heart
I'll be with you wherever you are
My home, my heart
I feel you with me when we're worlds apart

You'll always be my home
Ho-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome
You'll always be my home
Ho-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome, ho-o-o-ome
You'll always be my home
