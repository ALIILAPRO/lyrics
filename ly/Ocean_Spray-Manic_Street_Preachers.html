		  "Me totemo utsukushii desu ne
Totemo utsukushii me wa shitemasu"

It's easy to see, it's easy to see
To see only white where colour should be
It's easy to feel, it's easy to feel
But it's not good enough, even though it's real

Oh please stay away
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray
Oh please stay away
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray

It's easy to breathe, it's easy to grieve
To breathe only air where life should be
It's easy to laugh, it's easy to cry
To cry so so hard that it can't be denied

Oh please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray
Oh please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray

Oh please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray
Oh please stay awake
And then we can drink some Ocean Spray
