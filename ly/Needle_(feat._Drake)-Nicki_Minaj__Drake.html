		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I mean, I don't ever fight girls, I saw Sheila at Seraphin
Maybe we had too much Tequila
Actually, yeah, we definitely had too much Tequila
'Cause I don't know why I'm even playin' on your phone right now
I'ma just block you, bye

If these diamonds in my ear can't weigh me down now
What makes you think you could weigh me down? Stop it right now
Friends were pessimistic 'bout our love, heard they tight now
We both know they're miserable at home, fuck 'em all
If this Rollie on my wrist can't weigh me down, mm-mm-mm
What makes you think you could weigh me down? Stop it right now
Friends they like it better when you're down, let's not talk about it
It's just you and me and

I just wanna pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Please, obey that, don't delay that 
My lil' wild eye, been a shy guy all of my life, we should change that
Pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Let's engage that, don't delay that
You're like a needle, life's a haystack
Friends they can leave, but you could stay back

I could stay back, I could take that
Calm and laid back on our way back
Make a movie, watch the playback
Nah, don't save that, I don't play that
(Pon di, pon di) pon di buddy whining
A badman, he wanna taste the icing
Gyal haffi, gyal haffi, haffi give me my ting
Commission for the game that I be providing
I was in Trinidad, let us consider that
Immigrant to a boss, bitches bitter and mad
Poppin' out like a cork, duckin' 'em like Bj√∂rk
Bitches get out of line, I give 'em them one of dem talks
I tell 'em, "Send a jet," a Valentino drip
See, like the way it grip
My hips, cuppin' my breasts
Shadin' like silhouettes, spinnin' like pirouettes
It gave nothin', bitch, thank you for zero, next
Damn, Drizzy, another bitter ex
Shout out my intellects

I just wanna pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Please, obey that, don't delay that 
My lil' wild eye, been a shy guy all of my life, we should change that
Pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Let's engage that, don't delay that
You're like a needle, life's a haystack
Friends they can leave, but you could stay back

Baby 
And you're still my baby
I know I get crazy
I know I get facety (ah-ah-ah)
Baby 
And you're still my baby
You said I would make it
I'm so glad we made it (so glad we made it)

Gyal ah gwan from the likkle island gyal to CEO
Man ah gwan from Toronto, Canada to OVO
Ghetto gyal have di the wickedest slam, everybody know
Gyal haffi, gyal haffi, haffi give me my ting
Commission for the game that I be providing-ing

I just wanna pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Please, obey that, don't delay that 
My lil' wild eye, been a shy guy all of my life, we should change that
Pull up the Maybach and bend your leg back
Let's engage that, don't delay that
You're like a needle, life's a haystack
Friends they can leave, but you could stay back

You can stay back, you can stay back, you can stay back
Can stay back, can stay back
Mm-hmm
