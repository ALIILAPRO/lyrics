		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head
Running through my head
Running through my head
All the things she said
All the things she said
Running through my head
Running through my head
All the things she said (all the things she said)
This is not enough (enough, enough, enough)
Bring, bring it back
Bring, bring
Bring it back 
Bring, bring
Bring it back 
Bring, bring
Bring it back
Back, back, back,
Mother looking at me
Tell me what do you see?
Yes, I've lost my mind
Daddy looking at me
Will I ever be free?
Have I crossed the line?
Bring, bring it back
Bring, bring
Bring it back 
Bring, bring
Bring it back 
Bring, bring
Bring it back
Back, back, back
