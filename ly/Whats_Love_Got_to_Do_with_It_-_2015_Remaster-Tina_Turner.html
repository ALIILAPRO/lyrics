		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that
Oh, oh, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me
Oh, oh, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

Ooh

I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way
Oh, oh, oh

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

What's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a sweet old fashioned notion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

(What's love got to do) Ooh got to do with it
(What's love but a second hand emotion)
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
(What's love) Oh oh (got to do with it)
(Got to do with it)
