		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're like an earthquake, where you go the ground shakes
There's only heartbreak where you've been
But you talk the good game, loving with no shame 
Knowing that you'll take all you give

The way that you do damage to yourself, but
End up wounding someone else
How do you manage? I can't tell if
You like living life like hell

'Cause, baby, you're a disaster, how you only hurt
Leave everyone in the dirt, always make everything worse
Baby, you're a disaster with nothing to gain
All you ever cause is pain, don't know how you never change
But, baby, you're a disaster
Baby, you're a disaster

You're like a volcano 'cause there's no way I'll know
Whenever you're about to explode
People watch in amazement, like how does she do it?
How something so beautiful unfolds

The way that you do damage to yourself, but
End up wounding someone else
How do you manage? I can't tell if
You like living life like hell

'Cause, baby, you're a disaster, how you only hurt
Leave everyone in the dirt, always make everything worse
Baby, you're a disaster with nothing to gain
All you ever cause is pain, don't know how you never change
But, baby, you're a disaster
Baby, you're a disaster

The way that you do damage to yourself, but 
End up wounding someone else
