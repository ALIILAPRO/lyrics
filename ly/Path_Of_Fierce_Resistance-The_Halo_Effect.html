		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From the pain that gives
You what you should not be taking
You fail the outreach
A lonely mind subdued
The pressure brought upon us
Surmounts the suburban ideal
Defences broken down
What can we do

Where do we go from here on out
When will the outside match what's burning  inside
We're forced to be
To not be seen
We're forced to be
The players in someone else's game

Don't let what the other's say
Lead you from what noone can
Be the path and do not fail
Don't bend to what anyone says
Or take away from what you are
Be the path of fierce resistance

Drawn to the underground
Far from the expected norm
Scorned, lost and indecisive
What can we do

Where do we go from here on out
We're stuck in someone else's game

Don't let what the other's say
Lead you from what noone can
Be the path and do not fail
Don't bend to what anyone says
Or take away from what you are
Be the path of fierce resistance

We are merely players
Performers and portrayers

We're forced to be
To not be seen
We're forced to be
The players in someone else's game

Don't let what the other's say
Lead you from what noone can
Be the path and do not fail
Don't bend to what anyone says
Or take away from what you are
Be the path of fierce resistance
