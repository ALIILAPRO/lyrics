		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've drifted off the edge
And I can't
See this for what it was
So you asked
If everything was fine?
And I laughed
I've tried so many times
It's still bad
I didn't wanna talk
Yet you called
Don't try and give me hope
But you pull
And it didn't really mean much
At all
You didn't seem to mean much
To me at all
I'm clawing up the edge
But I can barely see right now
You wanted me to stick around
But it's getting too damn loud
I just wanted you to be here now
But you said you're gonna stall it
I liked that you watched my world falling
I hoped that you'd be the one drowning
Such a shame that you never had the courage
Oh
Life is such a dream right?
