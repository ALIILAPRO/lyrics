		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it feels like there's nothing
Is that a pro or a con?
Whatever happened to our dreams?
Are we too far gone?

I wanna scream against the noise
But what's the point?
No one's listening
I wanna scream against the noise
But what's the point?
No one's listening

And when the night falls upon
I just can't ignore the urge
Don't wanna hurt you my love
But my heart can feel the surge
The more you're sinless
The more I wanna bite
I am lost inside of the night
So leave me here where I roam
All on my own

Sometimes I'm close to believing
But something shatters my hopes
I wouldn't say I'm a cynic
But I think I'm pretty damn close

I wanna scream against the noise
But what's the point?
No one is listening
I wanna scream against the noise
But what's the point?
No one is listening

And when the night falls upon
I just can't ignore the urge
Don't wanna hurt you my love
But my heart can feel the surge
The more you're sinless
The more I wanna bite
I am lost inside of the night
So leave me here where I roam
All on my own

I know I'm not the only one who feels this way
I know I'm not the only one who feels this way
Feels this way

And when the night falls upon
I just can't ignore the urge
Don't wanna hurt you my love
But my heart can feel the surge
The more you're sinless
The more I wanna bite
I am lost inside of the night
So leave me here where I roam
All on my own
On my own
On my own
