		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Okay)
(Alright)

A nigga never learned to say
I be ballin' anyway (I be ballin' any)
God don't make no mistakes
God don't make no mistakes (uh, uh)
A nigga never learned to say
I be ballin' anyway (yeah, swish)
God don't make no mistakes
This life is give and take

Needed somethin' wavy to get my point across (yea)
I work for myself so I guess I work for a boss
Look up at the scoreboard, it'll tell you who took a loss
Aim it at your Adam's apple, turn it to apple sauce (sauce)
Yeah, cats done turned Peter street in the motor cross (skrt)
Last one with Def Jam but I'm still goin' off (I'm still goin' off)
And it ain't about my masters, I been ownin' mine
Had a white friend mad at me because I know Farrakhan (boom)
And you know this is a hit, Berry Bonds
And my shawty gonna ride me like a Peloton (ride)
Sophomore year I sold more crack than a windshield (shield)
Dunk contest jumped over a lamb and did a windmill (jump)
They ask me how I feel, I told them never better (better)
Smokin' on opp, I roll more L's than Pelle Pelle
I stay fly, yes, I'm fly, land on Mike Pence
I do some stupid shit, don't let them dog me like Mike V

A nigga never learned to say (yeah, uh)
I be ballin' anyway (uh, all anyway)
God don't make no mistakes (respect it)
This life is give and take (uh, uh, Southside)

Don't let them make you feel a way
Could've freed more if they only knew that they were slaves (slaves)
Man, we gotta get away
Man, your boy done caught a way
You should hear the way I say (Southside)

Talk, talk, talk to them people
Man, y'all don't even know the language
Man, I ain't finna do no lame shit
This a yacht and that's a long way from a slave ship
How they control our mind? (mind)
How they control us though? (What?)
How they get us so (uh), so emotional
You think you Natt Turner
What you want the folks to know
(When Larry Jackson called
They let Frank Ocean go)
Middle name Mandela
Me and mama sold dope together
I can't hear you, Helen Keller
Since fifteen I've been a felon
A felon can vote, spread the message
Exhale acapella
I still throw my diamond up
Oh, you still reppin' Roc-A-Fella 
Me and Dame in the studio, diamond up (what up Dame?)
Me and Biggs in the studio, time is up (what up Biggs?)
Wooh and I bet they feel a way
Thirteen thousand acres, I don't know where to stay (Southside) 

A nigga never learned to say (yeah, uh)
I be ballin' anyway (ball anyway)
God don't make no mistakes (respect it)
God don't make no mistakes (uh, uh)
A n- never learned to say (yeah, uh)
I be ballin' anyway (uh, ball anyway)
God don't make no mistakes
This life is give and take (uh, uh)

(Southside)
