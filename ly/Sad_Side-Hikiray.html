		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we going another way?
I feel alone
Are we going another day?
I just wanna go home

Are we going another way?
I feel alone
Are we going another day?
I just wanna go home

Down stairs running through my mind
I’m about to blow it
Fuck ‘em all around everyone’s gonna
Throw it

Sippin’ while we growing
I could never throw it
Fuck em all around
I wanna be lonely

Things are remind me
Don’t fly without wings
I’m gonna cry all night
I’m gonna cry on your knees

Yeah, yeah I tried
Fuck suicide, I'm gonna cry all night
Down dance floor
Thank the god blessed you
I don’t want the money
I just wanna be alone with you

Fuck them all, yeah, I am lonely
I just wanna be alone with you

Are we going another way?
I feel alone
Are we going another day?
I just wanna go home

Are we going another way?
I feel alone
Are we going another day?
I just wanna go home
