		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's always summer on the-
It's always summer on the-

Don't worry 'bout the future
Don't worry 'bout the past
And if you're feeling lonely
I can help you out with that

Sunset Boulevard
Leave your broken heart at the door
If you wanna cry
Let your teardrops hit the floor

It's always summer on the west coast
Fall in love with someone that you don't know
Dance until the morning with our eyes closed
Tonight we're going where the night goes
Baby, we're not living for tomorrow, tomorrow
Baby, we're not living for tomorrow, tomorrow
Mm-mm-mm

I know you've got your secrets
I know 'cause so do I
Some pain just ain't worth keeping
Don't you hold it all inside

Sunset Boulevard
Leave your broken heart at the door
If you wanna cry
Let your teardrops hit the floor

It's always summer on the west coast
Fall in love with someone that you don't know
Dance until the morning with our eyes closed
Tonight we're going where the night goes
It's always summer when you're with me
Glitter on your skin making me dizzy
Dance until the morning with our eyes closed
Tonight we're going where the night goes
Baby, we're not living for tomorrow, tomorrow
Baby, we're not living for tomorrow, tomorrow
Oh, oh

Sunset Boulevard
Leave your broken heart at the door
If you wanna cry
Let your teardrops hit the floor

It's always summer on the west coast
Fall in love with someone that you don't know
Dance until the morning with our eyes closed
Tonight we're going where the night goes
It's always summer when you're with me
Glitter on your skin making me dizzy
Dance until the morning with our eyes closed
Tonight we're going where the night goes
Baby, we're not living for tomorrow, tomorrow
Baby, we're not living for tomorrow, tomorrow
Oh, oh
