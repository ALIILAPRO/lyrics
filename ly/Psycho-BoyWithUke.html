		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tobi tells me lies when I'm sleep-deprived
Tobi says that I'm the worst of my kind
The voice that trails behind makes me petrified
Thinking I won't live to see twenty-five

They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They say I have no home, no home
They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They tell me I'm a psycho, psycho

(Sweatshirt's dirty, my friends hurt me
My girlfriend is flirting with another dude
Tobi tells me that he doesn't like her attitude)

Through all this plain, I fear my health
Are you insane? Why are you calling for help?
After all this time we've spent together
You really gotta leave me cooped up all to myself
With all this pain and suffering
I let the raindrops hit my friends
Excuse myself in the kitchen table
I don't have a clue of what you want me to do

They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They say I have no home, no home
They tell me I should go, go, go, go
They tell me I'm a psycho, psycho
