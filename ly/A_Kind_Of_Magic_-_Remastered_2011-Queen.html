		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)
(A kind of magic)

One dream, one soul, one prize, one goal
One golden glance of what should be
(It's a kind of magic)
One shaft of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day

(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
It's a challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)

The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
It's a kind of magic
(It's a kind of magic)
There can be only one

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies

(It's a kind of magic)
The bell that rings inside your mind
Is challenging the doors of time
(It's a kind of magic)
(It's a kind of magic)

This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be, will soon be
Will soon be gone

This is a kind of magic
There can only be one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone (gone)

Magic, it's a kind of magic
It's a kind of magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic
Magic, ha ha ha ha it's magic

Ha ha
Yeah, yeah

It's a kind of magic
