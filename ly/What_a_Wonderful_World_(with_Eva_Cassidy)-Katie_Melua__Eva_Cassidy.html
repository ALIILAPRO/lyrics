		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see trees that are green red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

I hear babies cry I watch them grow
And they'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself oh what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
But they're really saying I love you

I see trees that are green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself oh what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of the people passing by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
But they're really saying I love you

I see trees of green and red roses too
I watch them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world

I think to myself oh what a wonderful world
