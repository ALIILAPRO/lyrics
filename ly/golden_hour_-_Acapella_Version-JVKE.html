		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was just two lovers 
Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde
Fallin' for each other (fallin' for each other)
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super Childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi

I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

Shine (see you shine)
It's your golden hour, oh (it's your, your golden)
You slow down time
In your golden hour, oh (in your, your golden)

We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer (burnin' through)
Radio on blast, make the moment last
She got solar power (oh)
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes (in her eyes)
I don't need no light to see you

Shine, it's your golden hour (golden)
Golden hour, it's your time to shine
I don't need no light (no)
I don't need no light (don't need no light)
I don't need to light to see you (don't need no light)
To see you (see you)

Shine, it's your golden hour
You slow down time (oh)
In your golden hour, oh (in your, your golden)
