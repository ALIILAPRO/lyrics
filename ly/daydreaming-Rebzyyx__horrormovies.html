		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna leave you out here in the open
I know that you're broken
Baby, we're both broken
I'm gonna give you my heart
Baby, please be careful, you're so fragile
I won't be an asshole
I'll never stop talking about you ever
Will you hold me until December?
You make me feel good like it's Heaven
Been daydreaming you said

Been daydreaming you said, said
Been daydreaming you s-s-s-said
Been daydreaming you s-s-s-said
Been daydreaming, b-b-been daydreaming
I'll never stop talking about you ever-r-r
Will you hold me until-til-til December?
You make me feel good like it's Heaven
Been daydreaming, b-b-been daydreaming

Blood on my hands, baby
I'm gonna need some help
Slit my fucking thigh
Yeah, 'cause you're the only one
Only one in my heart, baby
You're so fragile
Cuts on your wrist, don't do that
Back and forth, I'm feeling hurt
Baby, I just wanna die
Leave me in the fucking dirt
Baby, I'm alright, overdosed love
She's my motherfucking best friend
Burning cigarettes on my skin just
To keep track of time
Yeah, you love it when I cry
And I cry every night, suicide on my mind
Baby, I just wanna die, I just wanna
Wanna fucking, wanna die, I just wanna die

Been daydreaming you said, said
Been daydreaming you s-s-s-said
Been daydreaming you s-s-s-said
Been daydreaming, b-b-been daydreaming
I'll never stop talking about you ever-r-r
Will you hold me until-til-til December?
You make me feel good like it's Heaven
Been daydreaming, b-b-been daydreaming
