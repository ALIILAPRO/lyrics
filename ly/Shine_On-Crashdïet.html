		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leave this world behind me
Nothin' that surprise me
We belong in the same old song tonight

Higher than the top line
Swirlin' like a mad man
You and I got too much time tonight

As we stay a little longer
And we feel the deadly hunger

And you want it all 
Nothin' less and nothin' more
Want it all
Shine on 
Shine on
And you want it all 
Nothin' less and nothin' more
Want it all
Shine on 
Shine on

Blinded by the moonlight
Tryin' to make it alright
Blood and bones I’ll bring it to the fight

Shine so bright it’s madness
You and I could care less
Lust and praise gone different ways tonight

As we stay a little longer
And we feel the deadly hunger

And you want it all 
Nothin' less and nothin' more
Want it all
Shine on 
Shine on
And you want it all 
Nothin' less and nothin' more
Want it all
Shine on 
Shine on

Shine on

And you want it all 
Nothin' less and nothin' more
Want it all
Shine on 
Shine on
You want it all 
Nothin' less and nothin' more
Want it all
Shine on 
Shine on

And you want it all 
And you want it all 
And you want it all 
And you want it all
