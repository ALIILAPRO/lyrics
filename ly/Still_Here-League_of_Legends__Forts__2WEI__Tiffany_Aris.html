		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gripping with my cold hands
The shapes I used to take
Hollow like a straw man
But it's easier to push away

'Cause it could all end here
With a strange daylight caught in our eyes
And my shadow stretching out
Through all the things I left behind

It's in my blood and it's in my veins
Oh, it's in my blood and it's in my veins

Got my heel crushing the snake
There is nothing you can take
In my blood, it's in my veins
I'm still here

Maybe it's a far stretch
That I won't come undone
But I would brave the cold edge
To finish up what I've begun

'Cause it could all end here
With a strange daylight caught in our eyes
And my shadow stretching out
Is it all enough this time?
I'm still here

All my reasons cut like knives
Keep replaying in my mind
All the times I've had to fight
I'm still here
I'm still here

It's in my blood and it's in my veins
(I'm still here)
(I'm still here)
(I'm still here)

I'm still here
Got my heel crushing the snake
There is nothing you can take
In my blood, it's in my veins
I'm still here
I'm still here
And I'm still here
I'm still
