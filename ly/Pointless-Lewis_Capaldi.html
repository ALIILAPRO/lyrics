		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bring her coffee in the morning
She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am

I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost and she knows when I feel alone

From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room
I hope that she'll love me forever
She hopes I'll be back soon
I take her out to the movies
She takes away my pain
She is the start of everything
And I'll be there 'til the end

I love when she laughs for no reason
And her love's the reason I'm here
She knows when I'm hurt and I know when she's feeling scared, mh

From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
You'll wait for me too
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
You'll wait for me too

From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you
Everything is pointless without you
