		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not an innocent 
I bleed my place 
That settle turning smirk 
That's always fixed upon my face 
Walking weakness 
Hope I die without a sound 
I'm that little boy 
With my feet nailed to the ground 
I know I'm guilty 
My stomach always hurts 
Milking your attention 
For the little it is worth 
I'm turning browner every day 
I'm really turning down a stay 
Tired of your little van 
I've been around too long 
Tired of walking 
Talking with me 
Edging me along 
Well, I detest your patience 
I know you've always known 
You know that I'm a thief 
It's so great to be alone 
Alone (That's that) 

I don't care It's lie, I wound 
I'm a stupid baby 
Hope it breaks in two
 
Jesus Jesus Jesus
Jesus Jesus Jesus 
Jesus is Christ 
Jesus Jesus is Christ 

I don't see I don't feel 
Like every little moron 
I think nothing's real 
I don't care It's lie, I wound darling, skip the faith 
That only breaks in two 

Through a dozen layers 
And there's no evil here 
Only this great power 
We misunderstand 
So please relax 
Take a pain 
Laugh out loud 
When you forget your name 
Jesus laughs 
Take the pain 
Laugh out loud 
When you forget your name 
It doesn't live 
There's no evil here 
These great powers 
We misunderstand 
Tell you about everything 
Tell you about everything 
(Go) (Go) (Now)
