		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I, I love little girls
They make me feel so good
I love, little girls
They make me feel so bad

When they're around
They make me feel
Like I'm the only guy in town

I love, little girls
They make me feel so good

They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror
They're not frightened by my cold exterior

They don't, ask me questions
They don't, want to scold me
They don't, look for answers
They just, want to hold me

Isn't this fun?
Isn't this what life's all about?
Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?

Oh, oh, oh I love little girls
They make me feel so good
I love, little girls
They make me feel so, bad

When they're around
They make me feel
Like I'm the only guy in town

I love, little girls
They make me feel so, good

They don't care about my inclinations
They're not frightened by my revelations

Uh oh (uh oh), take a second (take a second)
Uh oh (uh oh), it's a mistake (it's a mistake)
Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Uh oh (uh oh), the little girl was just too little 
Too little, too little, too little, too little

Isn't this what life's all about?
Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?

And I don't care, what people say
And I don't care, what people think
And I don't care, how I look
When I'm down my street

They make me feel so--
I love, little girls

They don't care if I'm a one-way mirror
They don't care about my cold exterior

They don't (they don't), ask me questions (ask me questions)
They don't (they don't), want to scold me (want to scold me)
They don't (they don't), look for answers (look for answers)
They just (they just), want to hold me (want to hold me)

Uh oh (uh oh), I'm in trouble (I'm in trouble)
Uh oh (uh oh), the little girls was just too little
Too little, too little, too little, too little
Too little, too little, too little, too little

Isn't this what life's all about?
Isn't this a dream come true?
Isn't this a nightmare too?

Oh, oh, oh, I, I, I love little girls
They make me feel so good
I love, little girls
They make me feel so, bad

When they're around
They make me feel
Like I'm the only guy in town

I love (I love), little girls
They make me feel so good
I love
