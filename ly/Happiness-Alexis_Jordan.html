		  Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

I gotta turn this car around
I never should have left you there
Boy, this traffic is making me sick
Boy, I can't wait to have you near

I gotta hurry, hurry, hurry
Now quick, quick, quick
Just step on the gas 'cause I don't wanna miss this
This opportunity will only come once in my life, my life

I gotta hurry, hurry, hurry
Now quick, quick, quick
Just step on the gas 'cause I don't wanna miss this
See what you're bringing me, boy, is priceless
I gotta be out of my mind not to try this

Through the strength, I found love
In time, I found myself in happiness with you
Through the strength, I found love
In time, I found myself in happiness with you

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Boy, I need to say what's in my heart
I was scared, but I'll do my part
I came back to tell you face to face
So what we have won't go to waste

I gotta hurry, hurry, hurry
Now quick, quick, quick
Just step on the gas 'cause I don't wanna miss this
This opportunity will only come once in my life, my life, yeah

Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm coming down to fix this
You should know how I feel, I know I got you twisted
See what you're bringing me, boy, is priceless
I gotta be out of my mind not to try this

Through the strength, I found love
In time, I found myself in happiness with you
Through the strength, I found love
In time, I found myself in happiness with you

The things that you can give to me
I can feel it when you're holding me close
Feel like one of the world wonders
I know I'm going under
Come see that I'm ready for this
And you're so good for me
You're my true joy
You make me wanna say

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

Through the strength, I found love
In time, I found myself in happiness with you
Through the strength, I found love
In time, I found myself in happiness with you
