		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem (yeah)
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it, ay

Hold up, bitches simmer down (uh)
Takin' hella long, bitch, give it to me now (uh)
Make that thing pop like a semi or a nine
Ooh, baby like it raw with a shimmy shimmy ya, huh?
A$AP (yeah), get like me (uh)
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me (yeah)
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me (uh)
But the chrome to your dome make you sweat like Keith
'Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga, nigga, like how you figure?
Getting figures and fuckin' bitches
She rollin' Swishers, brought her bitches
I brought my niggas, they getting bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act nigga-ish
But at least a nigga nigga-rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fuckin' boys, beast

I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it, ay

Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leading on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fucking read-along
Ain't a fucking sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju' (okay, I got it) then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then mothafucka' get to bustin'
Yes Lord, I don't really say this often 
But this long dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I beast

I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

Uh, yeah, hoe, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside in the Valley now
Vacay'd in Atlanta, then she going back to Cali, mmm
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar, mmm
A.K.A. Benz is to me is just a car, mmm
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow, mmm
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back I'll do ya, beast

I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
I love bad bitches that's my fuckin' problem (problem)
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem (true)
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it, ay
