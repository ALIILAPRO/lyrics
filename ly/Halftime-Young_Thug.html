		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hit the streets and tear this bitch up like I'm Willie B
No Tennessee but the chain on my neck is a T
No Memphis Bleek, bitch I own the Roc not Jay Z, ya dig?
War Ready like Tracy T, ya dig?
Racks on racks on racks just might pull up on my Spider
All my diamonds black you can motherfuckin' knight 'em
All these pussy niggas whack, I'm a murk 'em every night'll
Pull up screamin' blat, got my motor out a Viper
Got 100 mil flat like my motherfuckin' idol
I might eat it, I might lick it, but I swear I'll never bite 'em
Every time I dress myself it go motherfuckin' viral
They say niggas stealin' swag, bring my shit back like recycles
I'mma ask her for some head
I don't know that ho, I act like she dead
Insurance on my money like a wreck
Every time I see her, she lick the cleavage
Fuck her on a $10,000 bed
I could never love her, fuck her
And suck my dick like Beavis no Butthead
Cocaine white like Justin Bieber bitch
I might show the racks and tease the bitch
I might want it but I don't need the bitch
I been flooded out my Jesus bitch
I want your pizza, Little Caesar's bitch
Ninth Ward, I buy my diesel bitch
I don't wanna talk or see a snitch
No teacher, we chalkin' shit
I pass school, I pass all the styles
I just want that neck like a giraffe
I like fish in water, I'm a bear
175, I shave it like it's Nair
Lay out, watch the kids like a daycare
I don't play games, no I'm not the fair
I got Hot Wheels like a motherfuckin' chariot
Chanel Vintage but this shit is real

Heyyy let's have a good time!
Heyy let's a have a very good time!

I done figured this shit out
If you think you gone bite on my swag it's a virus
I don my swag and I pull up on bitches dressed in all white like Miley Cyrus
No, I'm not gay, I fuck bitches on bitches
I whip out she suck on my private (Suck it!)
Lil nigga play, I'mma catch him down bad and then stick 'em fold 'em like a wallet
I swear to God there's only one of me and these bitches 3D like a trolley
I'm walkin' through it like tons of the ones and these bitches grabbin' on my phallus
Fuck nigga try me I swear to God lil whodie done pull up and pop at his noggin
Bitch I got water I look like I'm fresh from Hawaii
Having the time of my motherfuckin' life
I'mma buy everything I want, I can't think twice
You can turn the ice tray off baby I'm havin' ice
As long as I live I never want a wife

Heyyy let's have a good time!
Heyy let's a have a very good time!
