		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit lonely
And you're never coming round
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around 
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes

Turn around, bright eyes
Every now and the I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes 
Every now and the I fall apart

And I need you now tonight 
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight 
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right 
'Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turn around 
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy
Who always wanted to be
Turn around 
Every now and then I know you'll always be
The only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around 
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe
As magical and wondrous as you
Turn around 
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better
There's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around, bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around, bright eyes 
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight 
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight 
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right 
'Cause we'll never be wrong 

Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love 
Now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time I was falling in love 
Now I'm only falling apart
Nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
