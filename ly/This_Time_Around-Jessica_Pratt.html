		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time around has it gone so grey that my faith can't hold out?
Haven't you heard there's a somber wind gets my head away now

Hallowed be thy name, had you come to claim it?
Too hard, too hard
All upon her face were the lost and strange years
It's too hard, too hard ah ah ah ah

I don't wanna try no longer your songbird singing the darkest hour of the night
I don't wanna find that I've been marching under the crueler side of the fight
It makes me want to cry

Well I won't tell, the halfway blues hang on
Sure enough a sorry angel
Hurrying a song on her way

This time around has it gone so grey that my faith can't hold out?
Haven't you heard there's a somber wind gets my head away now

Hallowed be thy name, had you come to claim it?
Too hard, too hard
All upon her face were the lost and strange years
It's too hard, too hard ah ah ah ah

I don't wanna try no longer your songbird singing the darkest hour of the night
I don't wanna find that I've been marching under the crueler side of the fight
It makes me want to cry

Well I won't tell, the halfway blues hang on
Sure enough a sorry angel
Hurrying a song on her way
