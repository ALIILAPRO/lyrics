		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  What a hell of a day
I been trying to make it work
Nine to five I'm just here thinking of you
At the end of the day
I been lying to myself
Cause I'm waiting at a table for two

I know you like the red one
So I ordered you the best one
It's been a hell of a day
Maybe let's just have fun, have fun
You always take your time
Guess I'm the last in line
Sitting here alone
Starring at my phone
When you don't show up
I know I'm out of luck
Back to work again
I hope to see you then

What a hell of a day
I been trying to make it work
Nine to five I'm just here thinking of you
At the end of the day
I been lying to myself
Cause I'm waiting at a table for two

They telling me we're so wrong
Cause I been waiting for you too long
But I know there's a way
And I'm counting up the days till I find you
Only you
But my life is flashing by and I've got no clue

What a hell of a day
I been trying to make it work
Nine to five I'm just here thinking of you
At the end of the day
I been lying to myself
Cause I'm waiting at a table for two

What a hell of a day
Why do you keep getting away?
At the end of the day
You still just keep on getting away

What a hell of a day
I been trying to make it work
Nine to five I'm just here thinking of you
At the end of the day
I been lying to myself
Cause I'm waiting at a table for two
(Table for two)
(Table for two)
(Table for two)
