		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why (why?)

Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off kilter, off kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a dead head zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set if off
Tell me "time's up", let the water run, let my body run

Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why (why)

Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die during sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimming
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I been sleeping with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinking deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

They said "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame?

Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why (why)

Everything I have (is a mirror)
And everywhere I stay (isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (to me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again
Tryna to figure it out
I'm tryna to figure it out
I'm tryna to figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna to figure it out

I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

Everything you wear
I'll be the one to care
So I see you braid your hair
Hold me and you'll stay young (don't go)
Tell me why
Tell me why
