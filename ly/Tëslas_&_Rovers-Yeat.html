		<p>
		  Uh, yeah (Woo)
Uh, mhm yeah, uh huh, uh huh

Yeah, Teslas and Rovers
If I had the Tesla, it'd be a Roadster
(Skrrt) i'm on Mars, I'm on a rover
She said she wanna fuck me, come on over
No, no, no, don't call my phone up
Half of y’all broke as hell
Got me sick, huh, yeah, corona
Yeah, I like my bitches rich
I like 'em older (yeah)
Yeah, I see y'all smoking rocks
Y'all smoking boulders (Uh, huh)
Yeah, we going up to the
Top so they wanna copy
Yeah, chain made of ice cream I scoop, scoop
Mhm we turn them boys into soup, soup, mhm
We'll never tеll you the truth, mhm
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (A coupe, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupе (That coupe, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (It's true, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (It's true, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (It's true, mhm)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh, ha) yeah, yeah (Ooh, ha)

I fell in love with the
Yerkie, no, y'all not fly, y'all a turkey
I watched y'all copy how I sound, bitch
Y'all some parakeets
I just want diamonds to be sitting
In a pair of teeth
I said quiet down with that chit-chat
I don't wanna hear you speak
(yeah, I) break that bag down
Like a KitKat, yeah, and I sell it for weeks
(yeah, I) put paint on
That lil' bitch's face
Just like the Margiela feets
(yeah, I) took an X, I'm outer space, bitch
I been on it for weeks
(I can't) go copy nobody wave, bitch
I cannot be replaced
(yeah, I) put pointers all up in the watch
Got big stones sitting in the face
(I can't) talk to the pussy-ass cops
Talk to the pussy-ass jakes
(I can't) , yeah, chopping it up
Yeah it's the Cayenne
You broke as hell, don't really
Got money, don't call me, declining
I bought me Arc'teryx so I feel like
Mountain climber when she climb in
Yeah, pour up the Wock', I
Might sip on the snot, sipping on slimy
Yeah, my brother he really been
Scamming a lot, Swiper, no swiping
I been getting high as hell
I'm still rich but I been shipping kale
I take this X so much, my body pale

Yeah, Teslas and Rovers
If I had the Tesla, it'd be a Roadster
(Skrrt) i'm on Mars, I'm on a rover
She said she wanna fuck me, come on over
No, no, no, don't call my phone up
Half of y’all broke as hell
Got me sick, huh, yeah, corona
Yeah, I like my bitches rich
I like 'em older (yeah)
Yeah, I see y'all smoking rocks
Y'all smoking boulders (Uh, huh)
Yeah, we going up to the
Top so they wanna copy
Yeah, chain made of ice cream I scoop, scoop
Mhm we turn them boys into soup, soup, mhm
We'll never tell you the truth, mhm
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (A coupe, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (That coupe, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (It's true, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (It's true, mhm)
Bitch, I'm in a 911 coupe (It's true, mhm)
Yeah, yeah (Ooh, ha) yeah, yeah (Ooh, ha)
