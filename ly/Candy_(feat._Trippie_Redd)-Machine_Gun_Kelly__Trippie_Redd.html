		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haha, Big 14, know what the fuck going on

Ayy, you know I keep that candy, yeah
I need more like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take Addies, yeah
I'm tryna fix this damage, yeah
You know I keep that candy, yeah
I need more like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take Addies, yeah
I'm tryna fix this damage, yeah

I'm in my head again
I took more medicine
Ripped up the parts from my heart and my chest again

Ayy, fuck it, I was raised like that
So I guess I never really changed like that
I be takin' shots to the brain like that
Blacked out drunk and I came like that
Helpin' me to get through all the pain like that
Yeah, driving through the rain like that
Running from the fame like that
On the front page like that
I'ma go insane like

You know I keep that candy, yeah
I need more like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take Addies, yeah
I'm tryna fix this damage, yeah
You know I keep that candy, yeah
I need more like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take Addies, yeah
I'm tryna fix this damage, yeah

I'm in my head again
I took more medicine
Ripped up the parts from my heart and my chest again

Huh, my bitch taste like candy, yeah
Play with death like I'm Billie and Mandy, yeah
I keep the chopper in the Phantom, yeah
Make a fuck nigga sleep like a Xanny, yeah
On the beach, chillin' where it's sandy, yeah
I just bought a whip for my granny, yeah
I fucked her raw, hit her with the Plan B, yeah
Bitch, I'm on, put that on my mammy, yeah

You know I keep that candy, yeah
I need more like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take Addies, yeah
I'm tryna fix this damage, yeah
You know I keep that candy, yeah
I need more like Mandy, yeah
Stay up, take Addies, yeah
I'm tryna fix this damage, yeah

I'm in my head again
I took more medicine
Ripped up the parts from my heart and my chest again
