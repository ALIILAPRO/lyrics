		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  in the marbled reception hall, i received a three band gold
ring, from mark, a token of esteem, running through ghost 
closet locker rooms, to hide from peter, who has fallen to 
the old cold stone floor, wheezing and emitting a seemingly 
endless flow of ectoplasmic white goo from ears and mouth.
a wind rushes through hall, whistles as it breezes through
the narrow slits in the green locker doors, i hide in one
of these, no. 13.
barely concealed but hopeful
blackout
blackout!

i will climb this high wall
in remembrance of clancy
to regain or re-earn my life
as i died just a flicker of an eyelid ago,
the wall has many holes
and many foot pieces to fasten to.
the wall is dangerous, and this is my penance
my penance and my task

i did it once and they wondered
yet i need to go, once more around
up breathtakingly
across rigidly
down easily- and foolishly
i endeavoured again 
to climb the wall in vain
and capture back my chain
of lillies and remains
of lillies and remains
of lillies and remainsin the marbled reception hall, i received a three band gold
