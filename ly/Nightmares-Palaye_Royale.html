		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drift into eternal madness
Wear a mask to hide my sadness

I've been losing too much sleep
No one can hear when you scream
I've been losing too much sleep
No one can hear when you scream

My dreams become my nightmares
My mind won't go to sleep
So I embrace the terror
My soul is yours to keep
Coming down
Coming down

Heart is racing, pounding faster
God above is not your master

I've been losing too much sleep
No one can hear when you scream

My dreams become my nightmares
My mind won't go to sleep
So I embrace the terror
My soul is yours to keep
Coming down
Coming down

And I try just not think about my life
So I do another line
It keeps me numb, just for the night, yeah
And I try just not think about my life
So I do another line
It keeps me numb, just for the night
It keeps me numb just for the night

My dreams become my nightmares
My mind won't go to sleep
So I embrace the terror
My soul is yours to keep
Coming down
Coming down
Down, coming down
