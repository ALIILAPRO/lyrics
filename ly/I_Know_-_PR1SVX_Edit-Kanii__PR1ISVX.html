		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you understand
I can't leave you alone
I gave you my time
But you can't pick up the phone
Life done been so tragic, huh
It won't leave me alone
Try not to be obsessive

I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know

You only gon' text me when you're bored
Don't like the feeling of being ignored
Told you we too grown for this, make your choice
Told you I'm too bold for this, already on it
She wanna spend some time away, she wanna spend some time
I can't give my heart away, I'm too in my mind
I can't give my cards away, I'm too in my grind
Learned this shit the harder way, now I'm in my prime

I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know, I know, I know

I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I fucked up, oh girl, I know
I know, I know
