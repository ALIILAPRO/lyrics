		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left without no goodbye in the night 
Walked out for miles, I'm not surprised 
You said it was not about you and I 

And I wish somehow, somehow you could stay 
Can you stay for a while? 
Stay for a while just the way we are 
In the great divide 
Inside, I will know when to let you go 
Stay for a while just the way we are 

You left without no goodbye in the night 
Lost in a long forgotten dream 
You masquerade all you feel inside 

Wherever you go somehow you find ways 
To slowly keep on stealing 
Concealing love that is left behind 

And I wish somehow, somehow you could stay 
Can you stay for a while? 
Stay for a while just the way we are 
Will I ever know when to let you go? 
Just the way you are 
I’ll let you go just the way you are 

You said it was love 
Love was not enough for you and I 
You said it was love 
Love was not enough for you and I 
You said it was love 
Love was not enough for you and I 
You said it was love 
Love was not enough 
Enough
