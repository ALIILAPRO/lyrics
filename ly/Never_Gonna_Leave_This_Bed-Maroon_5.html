		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You push me, I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
So take me down
Take me down

You hurt me, but do I deserve this
You make me so nervous
Calm me down
Calm me down

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed

So come here and never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down
Slows me down
So fall down I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me

Help me out why don't you help me out

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
You say go
It isn't working and I say no
It isn't perfect so I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back
And fake it, fake it I'll take what I can get
Knocking so loud, can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake but you can't forget

Wake you up in the middle of the night to say,
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed
Oh, you say go
It isn't working and I say no
It isn't perfect so I'll stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all take all that I have
Take it, take it all take all that I have
