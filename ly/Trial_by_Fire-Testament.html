		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Accuse you of a crime
Sentenced to endless time
The price you have to pay
Won't get away!
Sworn in by the stand
Your rights are gone
The system's banned
They think you are a liar
A trial by fire

Hey!
This is what the people say,
A new way
A trial by fire!

Locked in an empty cell
Your life becomes a living hell
The river of fire flows
Time only knows!
Trapped by flames of fury
Ordered unto by the jury
Death is their desire
Thrown in the fire!

Hey!
This is what the people say,
A new way
A trial by fire!

Quiver by the fiery light
Cringing as your soul ignites
The book of law's been thrown away
Starting today!
The system before the war
Is gone for now and evermore
There is no sentence higher
A trial by fire!

Hey!
This is what the people say,
A new way
A trial by fire!
