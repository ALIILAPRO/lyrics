		<p>
		  Oh my
Oh my God, Ronny

Hold my dick, woah, woah, woah
Flood my wrist, woah, woah, woah
She gon' fuck, woah, woah, woah
On some dick, woah, woah, woah
In her pussy, she gon scream, like the Slasher movie, huh
You should have Charlie Sheen, you fuck dirty groupies, huh
And bruh, I want your shawty, please
She got big ol' boobies, huh
Hey, boo, hold my Draco, huh
She don't got no cable, huh
You wan' fuck for clouty, shawty
Bitch, why ain't you stay so? Huh
Take flight, red tomato, huh
You boys soft like Play-Doh, huh

Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it
Huh, okay
Okay, uh, uh

Eat a plate, eat a plate
You look like you need a steak, yeah
Bitch you need to gain some weight
Two houses, do real estate (yuh)
Throw the pussy at me like a Batrang, huh
When I'm on the jet, get catering, uh
Shawty wanna fuck, how flatterin', huh
Dove in the pussy, caught a battery, huh
Batter up, uh, hey, throw it at me, uh, ayy
I'm your daddy, huh, huh, grandpappy, huh, huh
I'm your father, I'm your grandfather, I'm your father's father
Pull up on you like I'm Darth Vader, bitch Luke Skywalker

Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, oh, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it up
Eat it up, eat it
Ayy
