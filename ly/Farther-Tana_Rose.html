		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
I will walk into the storm
There's no need to be warm
I can feel the avalanche coming
But it changes my dreams by nothing
The currents of the river are strong
But I know where I truly belong
My heart would never let me drown
Nobody can stop me now
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
The ground is telling me to quit
But the sky said there is no limit
I can feel the earth shaking
But my heart ain't even close to breaking
The cold never bothered the queen
Nor did the scorching heat
Never minded the temperature change
All I wanted was to find my way
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
Climb every mountain
Tread through any water
Withstand any weather
Just to get a little farther
