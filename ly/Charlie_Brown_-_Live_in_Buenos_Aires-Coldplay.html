		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

Ooh-ooh-ooh

In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete
Be a cartoon heart

Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

We'll run wild
We'll be glowing in the dark, ooh-ooh-ooh
We'll be glowing in the dark, ooh-ooh-ooh ah

All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world
All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs
All the highs, all the lows
As the room a spinning goes

We'll run riot
We'll be glowing in the dark

Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh (oh)
So we'll soar
Luminous and wired
We'll be glowing in the dark
