		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So come and follow me to the land
Because I love you, take my hand
And from South Africa to Japan
Down to Colombia to Sudan, over to you

Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (over the moon)
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (sanbonani)

Uh, big ol' bird, I fly across the world and don't look down
I make love to you with nothin', this life can sit around
Pride'll get you killed, baby, and death don't wait on love
Time to open up, now y'all, said gon' release the doves
Down in Joburg, I met a girl she was painted up like an alien (two time)
Told me, "Call her Mother Earth"
And I laid with her, now I can't wake up
We got babies on top of babies
Raisin' freedom fighters, made for super love
Won't you follow me? We gon' lead the way
Watch the whole world get high like us

So come and follow me to the land
Because I love you, take my hand
And from South Africa to Japan
Down to Colombia to Sudan, over to you (sanbonani)

Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (over the moon)
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love

Crash land, hop out the whip, did the flag plant
One giant leap hit the moonwalk, M-J 'til your shoes drop
You ain't 2Pac 'til you shoot cops, just another
Black man, every day a episode of Boondocks
And it's really nothin' you can do about it
Play a throwback on the juke box
Oh shit, '06, O-J, Guwop
Got me in a mood now
Hit it out the ballpark, different kind of heartthrob
Aubrey tried to tell me, "It's a Rollie, not a stopwatch"
When you from the bottom, every shot a long shot
So don't try to tell me that it matter what I call God, I don't get that
Y'all be lookin' big mad, lyin' up, Aunt Viv
And this ho like Sinbad stickin' to my side like Tip hat
You ain't strapped, better get strapped

So come and follow me to the land
Because I love you, take my hand
And from South Africa to Japan
Down to Colombia to Sudan, over to you

Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (over the moon)
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (if you wanna wrap it up)

Take me high, don't take me low
You know we got a really long way to go
I gotta thank God for the Sun above
'Cause my Black skin can't shake the cold
Unlock your doors, open up your soul
You ain't gotta be so Minnesota
They love me in Cologne, I ain't talkin' 'bout the odor
I love it when I'm home, on my sin, on my soldier, I'm demanded
(Dumelang) I met a man alone standin' (is "Hello" in Sesotho)
Holdin' a sign in his hand it read "Stranded"
I take a chance pulled some money out my pants
And said, "Sorry, it's not much, it's what I have"
He laughed, said, "It's love when you do what you can and you don't have to
I got a mother and dad, they don't even care where I'm at nigga, thank you"
Brother, go buy you a gun and rob a bank

So come and follow me to the land
Because I love you, take my hand
And from South Africa to Japan
Down to Colombia to Sudan, over to you (sanbonani)

Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (over the moon)
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love all 'round the world
Spread the love (one, two, three, get down)
