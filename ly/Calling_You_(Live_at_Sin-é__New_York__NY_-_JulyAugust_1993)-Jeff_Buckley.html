		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend

I am calling you
Can't you hear me
I am calling you

A hot dry wind blows right through me
The baby's crying and I can't sleep
But we all know a change is coming
Oh, coming closer sweet release

I am calling you
I know you hear me
I am calling you, oh

Oh, oh
Oh
Ooh, oh
I am calling you

A desert road from Vegas to nowhere
Some place better than where you've been
A coffee machine that needs some fixing
In a little café just around the bend

A hot dry wind blows right through me
Your baby's crying, I can't sleep
Oh, but we all, we all, we all know a change is coming
Oh, coming closer sweet release, sweet release, sweet

I am calling you
I know, I know you hear me
I am calling you, oh
