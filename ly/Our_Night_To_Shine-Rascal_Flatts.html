		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every heartland, farm town, fence post son
Every west coast big break queen
All you high rise, skyline, concrete kids
Every zip code in between
Grab your first time front porch pounding heart
And gas up your Chevrolet
Cause the sun's half gone and it won't be long
Til' we make our getaway

This is our time
Our night to shine
Oh take my hand, hold on tight
Don't look back to the morning light
Let the world go, player spin slow
Tell tomorrow not to hurry, we're just fine
This is our night to shine

Pin a flower on that sport coat
Lace up your new church shoes
Grab your favorite pair of denim
Patched up knees and faded blue
Fold two twenty's in your pocket
Kiss your mama at the door
Take a picture perfect post card
And send it all across the world

This is our time
Our night to shine
Oh take my hand, hold on tight
Don't look back to the morning light
Let the world go, player spin slow
Tell tomorrow not to hurry, we're just fine
This is our night

Rock back on your heels
Lean into the crowd
Take hold of this chance
There's no backing down

This is our night
Our night to shine
Oh take my hand, hold on tight
Don't look back til' the morning light
Let the world go
Let it spin slow
Tell tomorrow not to hurry
We're just fine

This is our night (this is our night)
This is our night to shine (this is our night)

(This is our night)
(This is our night)
(This is our night to shine)
(This is our night)
(This is our night)
(This is our night to shine)
(This is our night)

This is our time
This is our night to shine

(This is our night)
(This is our night)
(This is our night to shine)
