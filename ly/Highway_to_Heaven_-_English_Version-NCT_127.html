		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My body's callin' callin'
Can you pick up? (can you pick up?)
One on one
Your body's talkin' talkin'
Say what you want (say what you want)
Girl, who are you waiting for
You know that you wanna go
Yeah

We'll take the highway to heaven
And I can't wait to love you all alone
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)
We'll take the highway to heaven
On the one-o-one, let's see just where it goes
Ha (oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah) look! 

Pull up
Baby you a bad girl, watch yo mouth
When I'm with you it's a vibe, baby I can't lie
Hit my line anytime
Girl I wanna make you mine, spend some time
Look! Skrr pull up in the coupe beep beep (skrr, skrr)
Girl I got your lovin' on repeat (pull up)
And I bet you never had it like this
Real good lovin', light up your wrist

Last call, are you coming with me
I got some things you want to see
Tell all your friends that you're busy, they know
They know we got the chemistry
Love how your body feels on me
When you get back, let me get that

We'll take the highway to heaven
And I can't wait to love you all alone
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)
We'll take the highway to heaven
On the one-o-one, let's see just where it goes
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)

We'll take the highway to heaven
Highway to heaven
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)
We'll take the highway to heaven
Highway to heaven
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Baby you should know
I won't let you go
I'll show you the world if you say so
Oh she's so bad
I'll make it last
And baby I can't leave you alone

We'll take the highway to heaven (hoo)
And I can't wait to love you all alone (I can't wait to love ya)
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)
We'll take the highway to heaven (highway)
On the one-o-one, let's see just where it goes (let's see where it goes)
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh yeah yeah)

We'll take the highway to heaven (highway yeah highway)
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah, come on)
We'll take the highway to heaven (take the highway)
Highway to heaven
(Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah)

We'll take the highway to heaven (highway yeah)
We'll take the highway to heaven
