		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do this shit daily
Every single day
You come outside with me
To smoke the pain away
You know I don't mind if
We don't spend all-day
'Cause baby this won't last
And baby it's too late, yeah
Yeah, I've been on a roll, come and see me all night
Never miss a show, baby dressed in all white
She love to get loose but her pussy's so tight
I got 20 more, I could never lose face
They get on the floor but they never touch base
Pussy on my mind and it's still in my taste
She was too good, such a lady
She was too wild, but she tamed me
She was so wet, like the navy
I was never unaware that you saved me
All this time I couldn't think about it
I didn't know how I would feel without it
I hide my love, just crawling all around it
All around it, and I tell her like
Yeah, I've been on a roll, come and see me all night
Never miss a show, baby dressed in all white
She love to get loose but her pussy's so tight
I got 20 more, I could never lose face
They get on the floor but they never touch base
Pussy on my mind and it's still in my taste
This never lasts
Either too late
Or it's too fast
I got two girls
And they both bad
I got two drinks
But I'm too sad
Yeah
All this time I couldn't think about it
I didn't know how I would feel without it
I hide my love, just crawling all around it
All around it, and I tell her that
All this time I couldn't think about it
I didn't know how I would feel without it
I hide my love, just crawling all around it
All around it, and I tell her like
Yeah, I've been on a roll, come and see me all night
Never miss a show, baby dressed in all white
She love to get loose but her pussy's so tight
I got 20 more, I could never lose face
They get on the floor but they never touch base
Pussy on my mind and it's still in my taste
I do this shit daily
Every single day
You come outside with me
To smoke the pain away
You know I don't mind if
We don't spend all-day
'Cause baby this won't last
And baby it's too late, yeah
