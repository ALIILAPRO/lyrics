		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go again, in the wind, with my tec-nine
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, here I go again
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, in the wind, with my tec-nine
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, here I go again
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime

Here I go again, in the wind, with my tec-nine
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, here I go again
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, in the wind, with my tec-nine
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, here I go again
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime

Here I go again, in the wind, with my tec-nine
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, here I go again
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, in the wind, with my tec-nine
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
Here I go again, here I go again
Cocked on my feet as I sneak closer to the crime
