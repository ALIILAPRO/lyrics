		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew, straight up when I met ya
I saw it in your eyes
Thought it would be like minds
Don't think I'll ever forget you
No, no, no, but

Those moments spent with you
'Til the sky's turnin' blue
I'll see you on the other side

We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight
Can we keep this high alive tonight?
I'll see you in another life
Do it all again sometime
We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight

A bittersweet goodbye
Bittersweet goodbye
We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight
Can we keep this high alive tonight?
We'll say a bittersweet good-

I knew straight up when I met ya
I saw it in your eyes
Thought it would be like minds
Don't think I'll ever forget you
No, no, no, but

Those moments spent with you
'Til the sky's turnin' blue
I'll see you on the other side

We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight
Can we keep this high alive tonight?
I'll see you in another life
Do it all again sometime
We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight

A bittersweet goodbye
Bittersweet goodbye
We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight
Can we keep this high alive tonight?
We'll say a bittersweet goodbye tonight
