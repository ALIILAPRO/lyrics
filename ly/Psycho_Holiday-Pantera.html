		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty and sweating 
Head lying in your hands 
Shaking in the corner 
Done too much alcohol 
Gotta get away from it all 
'Cause it feels my blood is freezing 
My self insanity has taken its toll 
Frustration has taken its control 

Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free, yeah
Been put to the test 
My mind needs to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday 

Shot down on sight 
You are the target of attention 
One woman here, another there 
You can't please all the people all the time 
Can't tell the strangers 
From the friends you know 
Frustration has taken its control 

Now you're far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set your demons free, yeah
Been put through the test 
Your mind needs to rest 
You're on a psycho holiday 

I'm strapped in for life 
Is this where I live 
Or where I die
You want my money 
You take my space 
My mind is telling me 
To leave this place 
My self insanity has taken its toll 
Frustration has taken its control 

Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free, yeah
Been put to the test 
My mind needs to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday 

Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free
Been put to the test 
My mind needs to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday 

Now I'm far from home 
Spending time alone 
It's time to set my demons free, free
Been put to the test 
My mind needs to rest 
I'm on a psycho holiday, oh
