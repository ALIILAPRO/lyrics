		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're coming slow
I hear you're so bad
I'm gonna love your fame
I'll love you slow
You're feeling so fast
You're gonna love this pace
Wanted a sight
Come into focus
Don't wanna lose your face
I hold your mouth
I'm feeling invaded
Feeding from your blood

Ooh, I feel your body falling
Ooh, might hold on when it's raining
Feel your weight

I'm breaking the waves
Ooh, ha ha
Like a prayer
We're breaking the waves
My body loves
Feeling invaded
By your gentle grace
You feel the stain
We both can't be safe as
I wanna love your face

Ooh, I feel your body falling
Ooh, might hold on when it's raining
Feel your weight (feel your weight)
Ooh, I feel your body falling
Huh, huh, wait
Ooh, might hold on when it's raining
Feel your weight, feel your

Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your knees
Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your
Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your knees
Don't worry, baby
Surrender to your knees

I feel your weight
I feel your weight
I feel your weight
I feel your
