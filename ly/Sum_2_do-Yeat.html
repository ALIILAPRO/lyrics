		  (woo, woo)

Yeah, I'm shakin' that bitch
I don't got no fuckin' limit, lil' bitch, I been runnin' that motherfuckin' blitz (ha)
We don't be needin' security, bitch, I'm gon' ride around, give us them sticks (I'm working on dying)
'Cause if you gon' fuck around, if you gon' fuck around with us, yo' ass just gon' get blitzed (BNYX)
I'm at the back and still don't give no shits
Fuck that bitch, they fuck with the kid, they pricks, ha
Sittin' pretty, my money so damn tall, yeah
Move so much, I got feelin' withdrawal
I don't fuck with none of these rappers, yeah, they suck my dick
I was just here selling glass, but I been sellin' loud (loud)
Send yo' ass a fuckin' picture of your fuckin' crib
I don't even give no fuck you said, I don't even wanna hear it
Revin' this bitch, I been slangin' this bitch, I been swervin' this bitch out the Urus
Take me the plane, then I hop on the Perc', but these bitches be pull up embarrassed (err, burp)
In they real life, they work their whole life, but we don't talk these motherfuckin' parents (hello)
We don't be givin' no fucks what they sayin', they motherfuckers really embarrassed (It's said)

Yeah (I-I'm), swervin' them bitches, swervin' down 92 (two)
Yeah, pull off on the cops, it's fun, just somethin' to do (I-I'm, swerve)
Yeah, I made me some millions, bitch, I done lost my cool (I-I'm working on dying)
Yeah, new chain from Moss, this bitch is swimmin' a pool (BNYX), ha, ha
Yeah, lil' bitch, I live on the uh, I live on the moon, yeah (live on the moon)
Yeah, got a big ol' stick and a AR in my room (Stick in my room)
Yeah, pull off in the Lamb' and the bitches just say, "Zoom" (just say "Zoom")
And fuck what you said, we don't even gotta assume (Gotta assume, I-I'm, woo-woo-woo)

Yeah, I'm shakin' that bitch
I don't got no fuckin' limit, lil' bitch, I been runnin' that motherfuckin' blitz (ha)
We don't be needin' security, bitch, I'm gon' ride around, give us them sticks (I'm working on dying)
'Cause if you gon' fuck around, if you gon' fuck around with us, yo' ass just gon' get blitzed (BNYX)
I'm at the back and still don't give no shits
Fuck that bitch, they fuck with the kid, they pricks, ha
