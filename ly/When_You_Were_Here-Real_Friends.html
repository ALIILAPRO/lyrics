		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still avoiding the exit that goes to your old house
Listening to konstantine like we did at seventeen
But I know it's not helping me out
I wish I could let go and blame someone else
I wish I could tell you

That I don't really wanna die
But I don't wanna be alive
Like I did when you were here
I think I'm just scared to death
But you always mess with my head
Like you did, like you did
Like you did when you were here

You said I'm being destructive
I guess I'm just stuck in my old ways
The self-pity I've got is like a broken cassette wrinkled tape of regret
Yeah, we were both too selfish to change
I can't over this, 'cause you're already over this

I don't really wanna die
But I don't wanna be alive
Like I did when you were here
I think I'm just scared to death
But you always mess with my head
Like you did, like you did
Like you did when you were here

I wish I could let go and blame someone else
I wish I could tell you (I can't get over this)
I wish I could let go and blame someone else ('cause you're already over this)
I wish I could tell you

I don't really wanna die
But I don't wanna be alive
Like I did when you were here
I think I'm just scared to death
But you always mess with my head
Like you did, like you did
Like you did when you were here

When you were here
(I wish I could let go and blame someone else)
