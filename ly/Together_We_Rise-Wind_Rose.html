		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rise, dwarves in a line! (Rise!)
The horns resound off the mountains
Up from the fields of the battle
We raise our shields in a row

Down where the flame is awakened
For the war the ground is shaking
Beneath the soles of the warriors
They're rushing fast to the call

Full force warriors! (HU!)
The axes now are aiming
Straight at the heart of the battle
We praise the crown with their blood

Here all my brothers are standing
To face the ranks of the enemy
Shines on the stone of the mountain
The dwarves of iron and gold

In the fray, in the fire, we are marching on
Till the end, through the dark
We are holding on
Far from our home we're standing as one
When the battlefield calls
Together we're marching on

In the fray, in the fire, we are marching on
Till the end, we're still holding on
Together we fall, together we fight
And once together we rise

We are the fire for the smithery
We are ready to burn
We are the cold of the winter night
We are blinded by the blood of our enemies
And once together we rise

Strong is the blow of the hammers
Smashing their lines overwhelmed
By steel ranks of dwarves in the frontline
To fight until they will fall

We don't look back or surrender
Cursed is the fate of contenders
The wrath of dwarves is upon them
Coming from the depths of the mountain halls
Rise with force
Through the fire you'll stand with us
Tales of war burn like flame on winter nights

Rise with force
Through this night you'll stand with us
Side by side till the end we'll stand as one

We walk into the twilight
And once together we rise
We walk into the twilight
The dwarves together will rise!
