		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinking outrageously I write in cursive
I hide in my bed with the lights on the floor
Wearing three layers of coats and leg warmers
I see my own breath on the face of the door

Oh I am not quite sleeping
Oh I am fast in bed
There on the wall in the bedroom creeping
I see a wasp with her wings outstretched

North of Sylvanna we swim in the Palisades
I come out wearing my brothers red hat
There on his shoulder my best friend is bit seven times
He runs washing his face in his hands

Oh how I meant to tease him
Oh how I meant no harm
Touching his back with my hand I kiss him
I see the wasp on the length of my arm

Oh great sights upon this state, hallelu
Wonders bright, and rivers, lake, hallelu
Trail of tears and Horseshoe Lake, hallelu
Trusting things beyond mistake, hallelu

We were in love, we were in love
Palisades, Palisades
I can wait I can wait

We were in love, we were in love
Palisades, Palisades
I can wait I can wait

We were in love, we were in love
Palisades, Palisades
I can wait I can wait

I can't explain the state that I'm in 
The state of my heart, he was my best friend 
Into the car, from the back seat 
Oh admiration in falling asleep 
All of my powers, day after day 
I can tell you, we swaggered and swayed 
Deep in the tower, the prairies below 
I can tell you, the telling gets old 
Terrible sting and terrible storm 
I can tell you the day we were born 
My friend is gone, he ran away 
I can tell you, I love him each day 
Though we have sparred, wrestled and raged 
I can tell you I love him each day 
Terrible sting, terrible storm 
I can tell you
