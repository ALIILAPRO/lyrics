		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How you gon' tell me that it's real when it's fake?
Don't you tell me what it is if it ain't, nigga
Look, 'cause I've been in and out the bank
Nowadays I don't even wanna talk if it ain't money conversations

'Cause I been countin' up, don't ask me how I been
Makin' plays like I'm Jason, but I don't kid
I could never tell you what I did
'Cause it is what it is if it is what it is and it is

Twitter fingers, yeah, I never was the type
Back then all a nigga knew was swipe
Little nigga, like a fox with the swipers
Gotta stay away, stay away from the mice, yeah
Flyest in the room, that's a fact
Keep a stick like a witch, but it's not a damn broom, huh?
I know everybody's not a goon
All she needed was a hookah and some 1942, huh?
I swear 'cause I never was the type (yeah)
If it's in the dark, I'm never turnin' on the light, uh
Rest in peace, you ain't wanna lose (yeah)
Word to mother, if I see his killer, I'ma boom him
I'm goin' in with my gang, yeah, my bros
We go way in like Shawn, Marlon, and Damon
Montana and I hold like I came in
Talk lingo, not a dirty conversation
It's different nowadays, I'm not a gangster, I changed
V12, and a ho like a slave
Word to mother, niggas better not play with him, he dangerous
Word to Beasty, believe me, he anxious
Look, lately I've been hearin' all these motherfuckin' rumors
Niggas out here steady switchin' sides, it's confusin'
Laces hangin' off the floor, I never tie my shoes
Every day I'm puttin' on a different outfit with a new gun
Like which one should I wear with these, the nine or the Ruger?
Bro-bro told me niggas gon' be jealous when you're too lit
That's why every single club I had to sneak the tool in
Always hangin' around a bunch of fuckin' criminals
They don't wanna see me win, they wanna see me lose
Couldn't even fit 'em, used to wear my brother's shoes, damn
She forgot how to walk, she ran through the crew, yeah
I already know her name, don't gotta introduce her

How you gon' tell me that it's real when it's fake?
Don't you tell me what it is if it ain't, nigga
Look, 'cause I've been in and out the bank
Nowadays I don't even wanna talk if it ain't money conversations

I been countin' up, don't ask me how I been
Sendin' plays like I'm Jason , but I never kid
I could never tell you what I did
If we slid, then we slid

God forbid, hide the kids
Huh? It's just another pill ('nother pill)
I been goin' through it, I been goin' through these phases (phases)
Huh? They ain't never real
Nigga, if it's really litty, just send me your location
But you ain't really real, right? (Real right)
Huh? Niggas ain't in the field, right?
Huh? If you see that nigga in real life, nigga, boom him
Flyest in the room, that's a fact, ain't no assumin'
Higher than a bitch, I be walkin' on the moon, yeah
You don't want no smoke, don't get popped, shake the room up
You know all my lil' niggas pulled up with the Ruger
Too much VVS' catch the flu, catch pneumonia
I ain't never got my chain snatched, stop the rumors
Everywhere I go, my hoodie up like I'm Ku Klux
Flyest in the room, that's a fact, ain't no assumin'

How you gon' tell me that it's real when it's fake?
Don't you tell me what it is if it ain't, nigga
Look, 'cause I've been in and out the bank
Nowadays I don't even wanna talk if it ain't money conversations
