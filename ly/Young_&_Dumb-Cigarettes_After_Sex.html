		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wearing black lipstick, bleaching your hair blonde
Put on your socks
Cut-offs or jean shorts, vampire fangs
And your "I Love New York" shirt

Well, I know full well that you are
Patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

You wanna go where the girls are young and dumb and hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets with nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat you showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby

My heart is racing watching you kiss him
On my guitar
Faking a teardrop by spraying my eye with
That water gun

Well, I know full well that you are
Patron saint of sucking cock
Señorita, you're a cheater
Well, so am I

We wanna go where the girls are young and dumb and hot as fuck
Where they're dancing in the streets with nothing on
We'll drive your car to the beach with the song on repeat you showed me
We'll drive your car to the beach with this song on repeat
Oh, baby
