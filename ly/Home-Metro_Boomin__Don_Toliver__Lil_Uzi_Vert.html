(See you back home, Spider-Man)

I let it go on and on and on
Oh, yes, I am (yes, I am)
I wanna go home, home, home
Oh, yes, I am (yes, I am)
Don't take it personal
You know who I am (know who I am, I am)
Ain't nothin' reversible, so I stay as I am (as I am, as I am)

I guess I'm off, and I'm leavin'
Guess I'm alone in this evening
Fight all my battles all alone
Tryna make it home
Tryna make it home

I let it go on and on and on
Oh, yes, I am (yes, I am)
I wanna go home, home, home
Oh, yes, I am (yes, I am)
Don't take it personal
You know who I am (know who I am, I am)
Ain't nothin' reversible, so I stay as I am (as I am, as I am)

Nothing's reversible, so I just stay how I am (I am)
They do this to hurt my soul but I am stronger than them (stronger)
I have different technicalities
Shoot my web, swing from these buildings and I'm finally free
And I can't help that everyone looks like I'm some kind of freak
My shadow's the only one that follows me
I've been fightin' crime, hidin' my identity
I wish that I would wake up without an enemy
I wish that I would wake up and this all is a dream
I've been tryin' to find true love mixed with peace, yeah

I let it go on and on and on
Oh, yes, I am (yes, I am)
I wanna go home, home, home
Oh, yes, I am (yes, I am)
Don't take it personal (woah)
You know who I am (know who I am, I am)
Ain't nothin' reversible, so I stay as I am (as I am, as I am)

I guess I'm off, and I'm leavin'
Guess I'm alone in this evening
Fight all my battles all alone
Tryna make it home
Tryna make it home
Tryna make it home

(Initializing go-home machine)
(Dimension signature identified)
Sorry, man, I'm goin' home
I made it, I'm home
