		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, okay
Yeah

We woke up
Intoxicated off of all type of drugs
I'm never sober each time I'm in love
I need some type of drugs
I need some type of substance
She keep sendin' me subs
I need some type of substance
She keep sendin' me subs
So I need some type of drugs

So I hit up my plug
Wanna spend some time with a thug?
Caught her suckin' dick in the club
Type of bitch who don't give a fuck
Fallin' in love
I'm off all type of drugs, oh
She keep sendin' me subs
I need bread and the cheese
I'ma send her in the streets
I need plenty of fees
That's the buzzy in me
Come and fly with a P
Woah, I'm putting drugs in my drink
Bitch, you know I'm a fiend
Give you all to me
Take a dose, maybe three
It's only one 03

We woke up
Intoxicated off of all type of drugs
I'm never sober when I'm in love
I need some type of drugs
I told that bitch I need substance
She keep sendin' me subs
I told that bitch I need substance
And she keep sendin' me subs
So that means I need some type of drugs

Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
I take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Told her take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy
Baby, take some, shake some
Pop it like some ecstasy

We woke up
Somewhere by the sea
That's the buzzy in me
Come and fly with a P
Ooh, I'm a wolf you lookin' at, ayy
Lookin' like somethin' to eat
You know I'ma creep
Iceman in my Jeep
In the snow with some freaks
Snortin' blow with some geeks, yeah
