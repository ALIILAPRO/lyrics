		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was told that love is a drug
I just wanna know how it feels like
You could be the drug of my life
'Cause I find it so damn hard to leave you

Afraid to close my eyes 'cause then I realize
Maybe you and I won't make it out alive
Tell me how can I pretend that I am fine
All I want is you
Afraid to close my eyes 'cause then I realize
Maybe you and I won't make it out alive
Tell me how can I pretend that I am fine
All I want is you

Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug

I think you can be my remedy
Save me so I don't feel this broken
All I want is your magic bullet
Baby, you just shot me down

Afraid to close my eyes 'cause then I realize
Maybe you and I won't make it out alive
Tell me how can I pretend that I am fine
All I want is you

Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
Your love is a drug
