		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember father holding my hand
I remember when he said, "be a man"
It's time run, it's time to chase
What you were always meant to be
I remember screaming out, "I'm so scared"
Afraid to fall, feeling so unprepared
What if I don't leave the ground
'Cause I've been chained by gravity

He said, "it's true
That you might just fail
You won't regret it
And I know that if you stay true to yourself
You just might win it"

Oh, he said
Don't wait, my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Don't wait, my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
(Whoa, whoa)
Go live your life because the sky's the limit (whoa, whoa)

I remember waking up out of breath
I remember mother's tears when I left
Another love, another life where I was always meant to be
I remember telling her my big dream
Asking her if it was hard to believe
What if I don't leave the ground
'Cause I've been chained by gravity

She said it's true that you might just fail
You won't regret it
And I know that if you stay true to yourself
You just might win it

Oh, she said
Don't wait, my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Don't wait, my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
(Whoa, whoa)
Go live your life because the sky's the limit (whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa)
Go live your life because the sky's the limit (whoa, whoa)

(Catch me now, catch me 'cause I'm flyin', flyin')
(Catch me now, catch me 'cause I'm flyin', flyin')

Try to catch me now, try to catch me now
Try to catch me now, try to catch me 'cause I'm flyin'
Oh, I'm flyin'

Try to catch me now, try to catch me now
Try to catch me now, try to catch me 'cause I'm flyin'
Oh, I'm flyin'

Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
Don't wait my child
Go live your life because the sky's the limit
(Whoa, whoa)
Go live your life because the sky's the limit (whoa, whoa)
(Whoa, whoa)
Go live your life because the sky's the limit (whoa, whoa)

Try to catch me now, try to catch me now
Try to catch me
