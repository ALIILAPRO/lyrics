		  Hand on my heart
Hand on my
Time never mattered
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Ha-hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Ha-hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Ha-hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Hand on my

Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones

Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the, still here with the
Still here with the, still here with the
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with

Uh-huh and I, I wish time never mattered
Ha-hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Ha-hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Ha-hand on my heart
(Still here with the, still here with the)
(Still here with the, still here with the)
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with

Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the, still here with the
Still here with the, still here with the
Still, still, still, still
Still here with the ones that I came with

(Oh, oh, oh)

Is anybody here with your family, like your sister or your brother?
Is anybody here with your best friend?
Is anybody here with your team, more than like twenty?
Make some noise right now

Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones, ones
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with
(Came with, came with, came with)

Still here with the, still here with the
Still here with the, still here with the
Still, still, still, still
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the (hand on my)

And I, I wish time never mattered (still here with the ones, ones)
Ha-hand on my heart (still here with the ones, ones)
And I, I wish time never mattered (still here with the ones, ones)
Ha-hand on my heart (still here with the ones, ones)
And I, I wish time never mattered (still here with the, still here with the)
Ha-hand on my heart (still here with the, still here with the)
And I, I wish time never mattered (still here with the, still here with the)
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the ones that I came with

Still here with the ones that I came with
(Still here with the ones)
Still here with the ones that I came with
Still here with the, still here with the
Still here with the, still here with the
Still, still, still, still
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
Hand on my heart
