		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that I
I can't believe
Just what the path has brought me
To the man I want to be
And I know that we
Have had some times
That we can't forget the struggle
Cause we have so far to go

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

I remember when
Mom used to say
That things are getting better
And you'll soon be on your way
Remember those days
That we would sing at the drop of a dime
Way back when nothing else mattered

I know we have changed
But change can be so good
So lets not forget why it's understood
That

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

So here we are (here we are)
And we'll always stick together
And through it all you know we owe it all
To you (time goes on, it never stops, it keeps on)

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

Time (time)
Look where we are and what we've been through
Time (time)
Sharing our dreams (share a little bit of light with you)
Time
(goes on and on) Goes on and on everyday
Baby time is what is, come what may

Time goes on and on everyday
Time is what it is
Come what may
Come what may
