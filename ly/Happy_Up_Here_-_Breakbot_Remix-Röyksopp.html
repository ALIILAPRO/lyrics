		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
You know I'm happy up here

World,
What you got for me?
Just bring it on!
What's it gonna be?
I'm ready for it
People
What you got for me?
Just bring it on!
What's it gonna be?
I'm ready for it!

You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here

Whatever you do,
Whatever you say,
Nothing can push
The feeling away.

It's here in my heart and
It's here in my head
I feel like I'm part
Of a book I read

And every page,
And every paper
Seem to be part of
Human nature

Sending me back down memory lane
My favored record is playing again

You know I really like it
I know I'll always be here
You know it makes my heart beat
