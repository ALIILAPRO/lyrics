		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't act so innocent, this was no accident
You planned this in the end and now it's over
Say what you wanna say
You lied and I got played
You threw it all away and now it's over

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you can chew
Can you taste it?

Eh oh you shoulda known better
Better to mess with someone like me eh oh
Forever and ever
You're gonna wish I was your wifey
Shoulda held on, shoulda treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Eh oh you shoulda known better
Better to mess with someone like me

Don't hold your breath
You're still chokin' on your words
Those things you said might be the
Last ones that I heard
Come pick up your clothes from the front yard
Sprinklers on, the rest in the backyard
Shoulda had the guts to say goodbye
Now you're gonna have regrets the
Rest of your life

Just face it, we didn't make it
You bit off more than you can chew
Can you taste it?

Eh oh you shoulda known better
Better to mess with someone like me eh oh
Forever and ever
You're gonna wish I was your wifey
Shoulda held on, shoulda treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Eh oh we'll be together never, so baby
You can bite me see Avril Lavigne Live
Get tickets as low as $85

Bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
Fell fast, I know I shoulda run
I know I shoulda run, I know I shoulda run
I bet you taste me on the tip of your tongue
Tip of your tongue, tip of your tongue
I fell fast when I know I shoulda run
Know I shoulda run, I know I shoulda run

You shoulda known better
Better to mess with someone like me eh oh
Forever and ever
You're gonna wish I was your wifey
Shoulda held on, shoulda treated me right
I gave you one chance, you don't get it twice
Eh oh and we'll be together never, so baby
You can bite me
