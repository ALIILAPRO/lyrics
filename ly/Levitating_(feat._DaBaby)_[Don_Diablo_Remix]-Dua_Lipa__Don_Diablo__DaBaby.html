		  Let's go

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
(I'm levitating)
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm levitating

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm levitating

You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
