		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One look was enough, enough for me
The whole room stops
And it's not me to be one, to be one
One of many

'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

I'll be the first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman (woman)
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

I'll pick you from the crowd
Don't come to me
I want you to myself
No I won't be, won't be one
Won't be one, one of many

'Cause it's a hundred others speaking
I've been tryna make a stand
A hundred others speaking
I can't make you understand
There's only one out here for ya, one out here for ya

I'll be the first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
That kind of woman
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still
Let me show ya
That kind of woman (woman)
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman

(Gonna)
Keep you close, next to me
I won't let you go
(You're gonna)
Reminisce
That you once met a girl like this
(The first to say)
(Baby, what's your name?)
('Cause I want ya)
That kind of woman

I'll be the first to say
"Baby, what's your name?"
'Cause I want ya
That kind of woman (woman)
(That kind of woman, woman)
(That kind of woman)
Hard to pretend
Now I can't sit still any longer
That kind of woman
