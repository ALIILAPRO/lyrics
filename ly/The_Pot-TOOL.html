		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who are you to wave your finger?
You must have been out your head
Eye hole deep in muddy waters
You practically raised the dead

Rob the grave to snow the cradle
Then burn the evidence down
Soapbox house of cards and glass
So don't go tossin' your stones around

You must have been high
You must have been high
You must have been

Foot in mouth and head up ass
So what you talkin' 'bout?
Difficult to dance 'round this one
Till you pull it out, boy

You must have been so high
You must have been so high

Steal, borrow, refer
Save your shady inference
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must have been high, high
You must have been high, high

Who are you to wave your finger?
So full of it
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters
Fucking hypocrite

Liar, lawyer, mirror show me
What's the difference?
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle
You must have been

So who are you to wave your finger?
Who are you to wave your fatty fingers at me?
You must have been out your mind

Weeping shades of indigo
Trapped without a reason
Weeping shades of indigo

Liar, lawyer, mirror for you
What's the difference?
Kangaroo be stoned
He's guilty as the government

Now you're weeping shades of cozened indigo
Got lemon juice up in your eye, eye
When you pissed all over my black kettle

You must have been high, high, high, high

Eyeballs deep in bloody waters
You're balls deep in muddy waters
Ganja? Please
You must have been out your mind
