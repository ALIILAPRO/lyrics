		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could it be me
How could it be me
How could it be me
How could she be a highschool prom queen
That should've been me
It's what my girl said in front of me
How could she be a high school prom queen
That should've been me
It's what my girl said in front of me
Everyday
I had to face
Another mean girl
Slipping in my face
Trying tell me
What I'm gonna be
But everything will follow into place
I prayed about it
I dreamed
Another life
That was made for me
Tried to wipe my tears away
Gotta do my pagent wave
Ignore the girls that laugh away
They never cared about you anyways
Don't ever let them see you freeze
About a crown that belong to me
How could she be a highschool prom queen
That should've been me
It's what my girl said in front of me
How could she be a high school prom queen
That should've been me
It's what my girl said in front of me
How could she be a highschool prom queen
That should've been me
It's what my girl said in front of me
How could she be a highschool prom queen
That should've been me
It's what my girl said in front of me
