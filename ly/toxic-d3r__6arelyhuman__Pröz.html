		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's blood on their lips, and they wanna die
You're so toxic, in reality
Why do I like it?
When you want to make me cry
Cause I'm addicted to you
Don't you know I like it toxic
Why do I like it?
When you want to control me
At least they care, huh
Maybe they're thinking about me
I be tuning my vocals
While you use me as a seat
So romantic baby
Why don't you kiss me to the beat
Do I sound crazy?
I would let you ruin me, it's true
I like that love
Gonna posses you, cause I want you
I'm very toxic, but you still want it
I'll be like your ghost
Gonna haunt you
I'm never gonna stop it
Blood on my wrist, and I want to die
I'ma make sure that you never leave
It's You and I
You're so toxic
You always gonna make me cry
Always try to control me, but never tell me why
So baby can you come with me
I'll show you all the pretty things
I saw potential in you baby
I can make you spread your wings
They just wanna change you
I just wanna let you be
There's a whole world out there baby
And it's all for you and me
Run up on the bitch
And I called it sassy scene
Yes my lyrics are explicit
But I stay hella clean
I be with the girls
Cause we play for the same team
And we snatching the men, and the visas
You know what I mean
Toxic, I'm righteous
Add it up, no minus
And I spit on the beat
Cause I'm clearing my sinus
And I don't think I'm the nicest
But I'm dressing no stylist
And these bitches need a Tic Tac
They got gingivitis
There's blood on their lips, and they wanna die
You're so toxic, in reality
Why do I like it?
When you want to make me cry
Cause I'm addicted to you
Don't you know I like it toxic
There's blood on their lips, and they wanna die
You're so toxic, in reality
Why do I like it?
When you want to make me cry
Cause I'm addicted to you
Don't you know I like it toxic
