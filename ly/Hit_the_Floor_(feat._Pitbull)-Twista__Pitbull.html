		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea we gon' take it from the bottom to the windy city
Miami's finest, Chi Town's finest
Pitbull, Twista
And we want all the women to...
Boogie boogie boogie (go ahead baby)
Boogie boogie boogie

[Chorus:]
Get down hit the flo [x4]
Dile ponme la hay que te la voy a partir [x4]

Shake it shake it fo me
Come and work it for me
Shawty but dont break it for me
Wiggle wiggle want you
Come on and get naked fo me
Say you like the dick
Wont you come and take it from me
Gon twirk it fo me while I let the dick slide
Pop it fo me mama show me you know how to ride
Now stop runnin from me
Go and hold that fatty up
Now let me beat up untill you say you've had enough
Pitbull and twista shawty
Show me how you work that work that
Got to the flo but dont hurt that hurt that
Take you with me if you can show me how you do that
Looking so hot and got the hood hollin ("who dat")
Hit it so hard mamacita
Come and let me inspect yo thigh
Open up because I got a new excercise
I can drop it down pick up the flow
Hit that bitch up with the rythm and go
Get down hit the flo'

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]

When Pits in the area area
Better check his bank fo direst deposits
Check under yo bed bed
Check yo closet
She dont like bacon?
Cool I'll give her sausage
If it doesnt make sense sense
Don't make dollars dollars
Dont make money money
Dont make profits
Boogie boogie
I just want to give you nook
Noogie noggie
Turn around let me see how you would
Do me Do me
Put it all together that would be a
Boogie Boogie noogie noogie noogie Do Me Do Me
Damn it woman
I'm on the track with twista
So its only right
That I take my words and twist em
Watch how I get up and go
Watch how I switch up the flo
Watch how I do it like
No ones done it befo'
Yes uuhhh Pits a pro
Mami what you fronin fo
Girl do what you do best
Hit the flo!

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]

All the chicks be lovin Twista when he spittin 'em rhymes
And I be lovin all the ladies that got dick on they mind
From the windy city down to the dirty south
Like Luda you know I beat that shit by the (word of mouf)
I sold 350 the first week
The day after I'm coming at you on a smurf beat
Becuase he got the base to hit you on the head like a 4 by 4
Now back it up for me I'm beggin shawty Por favor
Go and get teh other lane
Let me show you how to jack it
Ain't no like nothin a brother
You gon like it when I smack it
Got you in the fantasy
I hope no shit pop off
While we grindin and I'm trying
To get my rocks off
Hope them haters dont coma at me thinking my blocks off
'Cause we known to get the heaters burnin like hot sauce
It's all because I gave them baby mamas dick on the low
I tell em
Get down hit da flo

[Chorus:]
