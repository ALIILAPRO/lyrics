		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma do my dance in a bit (I'ma do my dance)
She front on me, I throw bands at the bih
All up in my pants and I'm rich (yeah)
All up on the couch standing on shit, yeah
Pay me in advance, off rip (off rip)
Tell lil' mama do the dance on this dick (dick)
Shooter with me, got his hands on the (skrr)

Brrt brrt, we ain't throwin' hands in this bitch, no (throwin' hands)
We ain't throwin' hands in this bitch
Throw a couple bands in this bitch (throw a couple bands)
Tell the bitch to do the dance on the dick
Handstand off the bando, and she lit, lit

I ain't playing with no wannabe tough nigga
I ain't playing with no wannabe thug nigga
In the hood you a rat, you a dub nigga (fuck nigga)
I stay with the blicky, glttt-pow, are you dumb nigga?
If a nigga feelin' forggy, let him through let him through
Standing right in your face, nigga do what you do
Big homie look at me, like shoot, I'm like "who?"
I got the Big-Mac, kick-back, blow your whole shit back
Bitch move
When I walk up in the room, bitch move
Who was talkin' shit, I'm killin' shit, like boom
Bet he want static 'til they see me, like move
But there he go right there bo-bo-boom

We ain't throwin' hands in this bitch (throwin' hands)
Throw a couple bands in this bitch (throw a couple bands)
Tell the bitch to do the dance on the dick
Handstand off the bando, this shit lit, lit
We ain't throwin' hands in this bitch (throwin' hands)
Throw a couple bands in this bitch (throw a couple bands)
Tell the bitch to do the dance on the dick
Handstand off the bando, and she lit, lit

I got my money in my
Bitch, I said I got my money in my Bentley (yeah)
I got Rolls Royce's, I got coupes, I paid tuition (skrr)
My diamonds 12 different colors like a sissy (ergh)
Yeah, Patek Philippe's, I forgot to mention (Philippe's)
I got suspended, I didn't have to do the dishes (yeah, yeah)
I did it up and I didn't never ever listen
20 cars deep, we ain't worried about winnin' (nah)
6ix9ine (yeah), bang red like Heinz
All my snake niggas 6 shots in ya spine
Money call me, I'ma pick up every time (brrt, brrt)
And I got a bands in this bitch, yeah

We ain't throwin' hands in this bitch (throwin' hands)
Throw a couple bands in this bitch (throw a couple bands)
Tell the bitch to do the dance on the dick
Handstand off the bando, this shit lit, lit
We ain't throwin' hands in this bitch (throwin' hands)
Throw a couple bands in this bitch (throw a couple bands)
Tell the bitch to do the dance on the dick
Handstand off the bando, and she lit, lit
