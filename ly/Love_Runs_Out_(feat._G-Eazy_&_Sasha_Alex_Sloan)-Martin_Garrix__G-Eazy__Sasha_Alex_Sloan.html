		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What if our love runs out, out, out
Don't wanna let you down
You know, uh
What if our love runs out (yeah)

Can't help but think, what if
Fast forward five or six
Years and some change
We end up Mr. and Mrs. Smith
My baby with the shizz
Right now it's perfect bliss
But what if one day I wake up and I don't feel like this?
If I can't trust you, feel disconnected and front you
I just realized, been a couple days since I fucked you
Something's feelin' strange, I don't feel the same when I touch you
And I could feel the distance, I wonder if I still love you
For real, yeah

'Cause babe, I've learned my lessons
Sorry for second guessing
But I've just got a question (what's that?)

What if our love runs out?
What if our love runs out?
What if one day we wake up
And don't feel like we do now? (You know)
And what if our love runs out? (Yeah)
What if our love runs out? (Oh)
What if one day we wake up
And we both want something else?

But what if our love runs out? (Yeah)
Yeah, what if our love runs out?
What if our love runs out, out, out?
Don't wanna let you down
What if our love runs out?

Uh, can't help but think what if this love's the perfect gift?
'Cause when I'm down on my lowest you come give me a lift
Let's face our direction before we go adrift
'Cause if it's worth it, let's work it, I'm down to run a risk
It's feeling perfect for certain right now, but then again
If I lost you I never could be your friend again
Doubts creep up inside us if we both let 'em in
Unless we both never lettin' that question enterin'

In first place, you know
'Cause babe, I've learned my lessons
Sorry for second guessing (first time really get there)
But I've just got a question (what's that?)

What if our love runs out?
What if our love runs out?
What if one day we wake up
And don't feel like we do now? (You know)
And what if our love runs out? (Yeah)
What if our love runs out? (Oh)
What if one day we wake up
And we both want something else?

But what if our love runs out? (Yeah)
Yeah, what if our love runs out?
What if our love runs out, out, out?
Don't wanna let you down
What if our love runs out?
