		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

A hopeless romantic all my life
Surrounded by couples all the time
I guess I should take it as a sign 
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)

I'm feeling lonely (lonely)
Oh, I wish I'd find a lover that could hold me (hold me)
Now I'm crying in my room
So skeptical of love (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I wish that I wasn't so naive
And he didn't turn me on so well
My heartache's a real good melody
(Oh, why? Oh, why?), (Oh, why? Oh, why?)

And what else is there for me to do
I gave him one chance I gave him two
But third time's the charm ain't always true

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now I'm left here feeling stupid (oh)
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

(Cupid is so dumb)

Cupid is a boy
He won't leave me alone
Every time he set me up
My baby doesn't show
It's making me feel crazy
Like my life's invisible
Good thing when I cry
I look so cute and beautiful

I gave a second chance to Cupid (Cupid)
But now I'm left here feelin' stupid (so stupid)
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb

I gave a second chance to Cupid
But now I'm left here feeling stupid
Oh, the way he makes me feel that love isn't real
Cupid is so dumb
