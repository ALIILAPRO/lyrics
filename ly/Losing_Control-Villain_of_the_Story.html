		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The walls are closing in again
So claustrophobic as I'm trapped in my head
It's like I don't belong in my own skin
It's sinking in, I'm lower than I've ever been

Oh god, oh god, why do I feel so wrong?
I hold on, hold on, before I'm too far gone
I can't let it consume me
I'm losing my grip whoa, whoa, whoa

Sometimes my mind takes me for a ride
Feels like I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die
'Cause I've got thoughts so dark, they tear me apart
And I know that I'm losing control

I've been running from the one in the mirror
Now it's been forever since I've been seeing clear
And nobody can help
I'm the only one who can save myself

I hear voices that fill me with doubt
I try so hard to block them out
I sit around and wonder why
I'm alive but I don't feel much life?

Oh god, oh god, why do I feel so wrong?
I hold on, hold on, to all the hope not lost
I won't let it consume me
I need to get out of this nightmare

Sometimes my mind takes me for a ride
Feels like I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die
'Cause I've got thoughts so dark, they tear me apart
And I know that I'm losing control

I've been running from the one in the mirror
Now it's been forever since I could see clear
Nobody can help
I'm the only one who can save myself
Save myself

Sometimes my mind takes me for a ride
Feels like I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die

Sometimes my mind takes me for a ride
Feels like I'm ready to die, I'm ready to die
'Cause I've got thoughts so dark, they tear me apart
And I know that I'm losing control (control)

I've been running from the one in the mirror
Now it's been forever since I could see clear
Nobody can help
I'm the only one who can save myself
I'm the only one who can save myself
