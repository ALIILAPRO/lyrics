		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lights off, but you're in the driveway
Haven't seen your face in five days
I'll pretend I'm happy that you're home

Cleaned up and I hid the ashtrays
You get mad when I smoke at your place
You won't kiss me, so I guess you'll never know

I thought that I could save it
But we're beyond repair
I could be on fire, you wouldn't care

Welcome to the end
Guess you'll get your way again
Never held my hand, so you don't have to let it go
Welcome to the mess
Slippin' on my mini dress
I don't wanna party, but don't wanna be alone
I hate the way that I love you
I don't want to
How can you hurt me when you're not around?
Welcome to the end
Guess you'll get your way again
Never held my hand, so you don't have to let it go

Last night I was out with your friends
Got drunk and forgot what I said
Don't like this version of myself

Not fine, but it's easy to fake it
Good advice, but it's harder to take it
When my mind sees you with someone else

I thought that I could save it
But we're beyond repair
I could be on fire, you wouldn't care

Welcome to the end
Guess you'll get your way again
Never held my hand, so you don't have to let it go
Welcome to the mess
Slippin' on my mini dress
I don't wanna party, but don't wanna be alone
I hate the way that I love you
I don't want to
How can you hurt me when you're not around?
Welcome to the end
Guess you'll get your way again
Never held my hand, so you don't have to let it go

I hate the way that I love you
I don't want to
How can you hurt me when you're not around?

Welcome to the end
Guess you'll get your way again
Never held my hand, so you don't have to let it go
