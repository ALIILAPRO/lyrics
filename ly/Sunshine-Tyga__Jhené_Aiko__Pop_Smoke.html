		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Baby girl
Come on

Sunshine, I could call you my baby boy (uh-huh)
You could call me your baby girl (yeah)
Hit me up, we can spend time (let's spend)
Lately, you've been on my mind

I know you wanna chill with a player (chill)
But all you gotta do is keep it real with a player (keep it real)
Just answer your phone whenever I call (call)
Calm me down, pick me up whenever I fall
I like 'em short and tall, slim and thick
I like 'em cute and sweet, ghetto and fit
Hop your ass in that Benz 'cause you like my style
You know me, I'd do anything to make you smile
I need a lady in the streets, sneaky link
Gotta watch how you move, what you get is what you see
Out of sight, out of mind, but I still adore you
Just hit me on the FaceTime, I never ignore you
You know pain is love, but my love is loyal (loyal)
I know you heard stories, but that was before you (before you)
Can I CC and Christian Dior you? (Can I?)
You ain't worried about girls 'cause you know this all you (wait)

Sunshine (yeah), I could call you my baby boy (baby, yeah)
You could call me your baby girl (baby, come on)
Maybe we could link tonight (tonight, just me)
I could be your sunshine
I could call you my baby boy (my baby, uh-huh)
You could call me your baby girl (yeah, oh)
Hit me up, we can spend time (spend time)
Lately, you've been on my mind

I know you wanna chill with a player
But all you gotta do is keep it real with a player
Lately, you've been on my mind
Keep it real and maybe
Maybe we can spend some time (uh)

Look
I need that real love, talkin' Bobby, Whitney (Whitney), and I keep it with me
I don't got no girl, I'm picky (nah) 'cause I gotta know you with me (woo, woo)
'Cause shit could get sticky (yeah), that's why I keep a Glizzy (Glizzy)
Ridin' 'round through my city (city), just in case I see a Dizzy (Dizzy)
That bitch my everything (thing), dripped in Alexander Wang (Wang)
She come from a broken home (home), now she got the finer things
Small peanut butter ring, eleven karats on the ring
I spoil my bitch, who said, "Love don't cost a thing?" (Thing, thing)
I saw you front of the Louis store (store) with your Louis fur (fur)
Coolin' with your girls (girls)
Honey blonde hair, thick thighs (thighs), nice hazel eyes (eyes)
Bag got Italian stitches (stitches), you know how to pick it
So I hopped out the coupe (coupe), and I hopped in pursuit ('suit)
Like, it's Big Papi Locsta, Mr. Spin-in-Rovers (Rovers)
Look up, my face is on a poster (poster)
You don't got no ring, that's a sign (sign), baby, swing your nine

Sunshine (yeah), I could call you my baby boy (ah)
You could call me your baby girl (woo, woo)
Maybe we could link tonight (tonight)
I could be your sunshine (sunshine)
I could call you my baby boy (baby, uh-huh)
You could call me your baby girl (baby, yeah)
Hit me up, we can spend some time (spend time)
Lately, you've been on my mind (lately, I'm just so tired)
(Lately, you've been on my mind)

I know you wanna chill with a player
But all you gotta do is keep it real with a player
Lately, you've been on my mind
Keep it real and maybe
Maybe we can spend some time (uh)

I could be your sunshine
Let me light the way
I could be a brighter day
You'll be my sunshine
