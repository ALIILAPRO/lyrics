		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Must one person's triumph
Be another's humiliation?" "Of course!"

Call me call me
Oh, my God! (Oh, my god)

Ayy, another day waiting for death
Every day that I waste on my list of regrets
So I tell myself "It's okay, day after next
We'll make all these arrangements to
Change you can better yourself" (Uh oh)
I know I'm wasting my breath as I inhale
I know I'm escaping my death as I inhale
I, I can't recall why I'm suffocating
My lungs are failing

How can I forgive you?
Oh my God! (Oh, my god)

Step into the mind of a Cut Throat
Empty streets, cold weather, all alone
Blackness, grey air, just snow
Feelings low, being followed by crows
Call list overflowed with hotlines
Drug help, mental, $uicide
Feel tired, feel dried, and you wanna die
Pride fried, closed eyes
And you start to cry
Swear I spent a lifetime tryna get it right
Still isolated, still outta sight
Keep my dreads swingin' like they in a fight
I just wanna kill everyone in sight
Take the money, take the
Bitches, take the drugs, take the gold
Baby, let me decompose
Never names said, more shade spit
I'ma see you one day, that's a promise

How can I forgive you?
Oh my God! (Oh, my god) call me
Call me
