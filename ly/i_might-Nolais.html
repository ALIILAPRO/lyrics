		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miseducated on your ways
You got me drowning in your feelings don't know what to say
Struggling beneath your waves
I been trying but I need a break

I admit that I was broken
Takes one just to know one
You and I we were chosen
Only you could make me open up

Need to decide if I still like you
This ain't a game don't need to remind you
Don't wanna leave but baby I might do
I might

Need to decide if I still like you
This ain't a game don't need to remind you
Don't wanna leave but baby I might do
I might

I don't know what to tell you
I don't make promises that I don't mean
Wouldn't tell you imma stay with you if imma leave
Wouldn't tell you I'm in love with you if I don't mean it
Cus I mean it

Need to decide if I still like you
This ain't a game don't need to remind you
Don't wanna leave but baby I might do
I might

Need to decide if I still like you
This ain't a game don't need to remind you
Don't wanna leave but baby I might do
I might
