		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For the love, I'd fallen on
In the swampy August dawn
What a mischief you would bring, young darling
When the onus is not all your own
When you're up for it before you've grown
Whoa-whoa

From the faun forever gone
In the towers of your honeycomb
I'd have tore your hair out just to climb back, darling
When you're filling out your only form
Can you tell that it's just ceremon'?
Now you've added up to what you're from
Whoa-whoa

Build your tether rain-out from your fragments
Break the sailor's table on your sacrum
Fuck the fiercest fables, I'm with Hagen

For the love, comes the burning young
From the liver, sweating through your tongue
Well, you're standing on my sternum
Don't you climb down, darling
Oh, the sermons are the first to rest
Smoke on Sundays when you're drunk and dressed
Out the hollows where the swallow nests
Whoa-whoa
