		  (Bongo by the way)

Pray for my enemies
Lord, I need clarity (uh)
They ain't got empathy for me
They stare at me (what?)
They use my couch when they needed the therapy (shh)
Took what they needed but never took care of me (yeah)
They saw a dollar sign
Treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me (yeah, yeah)
Sunshine on me (uh)

Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me (yeah, yeah)
Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me
Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me, yeah, yeah (oh)

Yeah, pray if they run up, I'ma cut up
Bring out these VVs, like the sun up
These niggas Stevie, 'til the come up
Went got my bread up, let 'em wonder
If I ain't do nothin' I kept it one hunnid (ayy)
Big Latto for real I ain't never done frontin'
They do what they can, bitch, I do what I wanna (bitch)
Trimmin' they pockets, I told 'em to run it (run it)
Sunshine on me
Every time I leave the crib I got it on me (brrt)
Got it out the mud, I did it by my lonely (yeah)
Pop my shit, done bein' lowkey
Sunshine on me (ayy)
I ain't givin' none these hatin' bitches no peace (uh-uh)
Fuck a two-cent, you could get the two-piece
If I step back, hit you with the .223

Pray for my enemies
Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me
They stare at me
They use my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign
Treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me
Sunshine on me

Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me
Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me
Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me, yeah, yeah

Uh, pray that they pull up, wish they woulda
If he ain't my slime, he a booger
I ain't gon' jook 'em, I'ma cook 'em
Sunshine on me, Devin Booker
Them niggas with you, they just lookers
They ain't finna shoot, I'ma swish 'em
Your bitch think I'm cute, I'm a jugg her
She try give me sugar, I'ma mush her
Big B, lil' nigga, Bill Bixby, lil' nigga
Smoke big tree, lil' nigga, we too large to igg me, lil' nigga
This ciggy get jiggy with niggas
Don't make me Will Smith me a nigga
I just told a model, "You only my side ho
I will put you out, ho, you must think you Latto
I'm all you got, ho, you know I'm the God, ho
The God of the sun and the light, like Apollo"
Tunechi

Pray for my enemies
Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me
They stare at me
They use my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign
Treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me
Sunshine on me

I love when it's sunny, that boy ain't no dummy
I slide off a gummy, y'all heard I got money
But still dressin' bummy, I'm sweeter than honey
I'm sweeter at rapping, like what the fuck happened?
Came back and he snappin', came back with a passion
These niggas was cappin', they talkin' on me (hmm)
I bought a .9 when that Covid hit
She said my Gucci don't go with it
Just tryna be happy, get money the motto
My girl hit the lotto, my sons all mulatto
My sons are all healthy, ain't shit you can tell me
I'm hotter than Nelly, they say that I'm smelly
Ain't never smelled wealthy, I think
Yeah, I got mass drip like a sink
Skated, you not in the rink

Pray for my enemies
Lord, I need clarity
They ain't got empathy for me
They stare at me
They use my couch when they needed the therapy
Took what they needed but never took care of me
They saw a dollar sign
Treat me like currency
Kill all they hopes and dreams if they wan' murder me
Sunshine on me

Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me
Sunshine on me
I just let the sun shine on me
(I get my shine on) sunshine on me
(I get my shine on) I just let the sun shine on me, yeah yeah
(I get my shine on, bitch I'm the golden child) (on me)
