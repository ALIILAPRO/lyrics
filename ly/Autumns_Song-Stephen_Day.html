		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you been outside lately
Those leaves sure are changin’
Reminds me of that time we spent hours carving faces
Making jack-o-lanterns light up in the night
Its an image that’s ingrained inside my mind
Well that years spent waitin’
Walk in empty pavement
I got by just fine 
Didn’t notice what was vacant
Now the fallen leaves that echo out your name
Fill the space of you the same

I’m still fallin’ out of love with you
And I’m headin’ for the door
Not sure if I’ll go through
Memories they take 
So long to erase
Will they ever even start to fade

When the nights get cold
Sometimes when I look over
I see you by a fire with your hands out in the open
And I wonder if you’re singin’ autumn’s song
Or if I’m singin’ all alone
I must be singin’ on my own


I’m still fallin’ out of love with you
And I’m headin’ for the door
Not sure if I’ll go through
Memories they take 
So long to erase
Will they ever even start to fade

I’m on my way
Just not today
