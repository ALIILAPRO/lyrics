		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Danger them is, while some call them "Major Lazer"

Stand up like a solider, baby
Yeah, I know you're built like that
Gun it like a holster, baby
Show dem say you're wicked like that

We live where the war is raging
Chasing our crazy dreams
Hoping that the bridge won't cave in
Tonight we let it all go free

Gimme the ting and make me rock inna di dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock inna di dance
Mash it up, hot step inna di dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock, rock, rock, rock
Gimme the ting and make me rock inna di dance
Gimme the ting and make me rock inna di dance
Mash it up, hot step inna di dance
Gimme the ting and make me

Light it up
Light it up
Light it up
(Li-li, light it up)

Show them you're flames to the fire
It's written like your name on a flyer
They wanna tame your desire
But you light it up, now your aim getting higher
I dey wait for messiah
But until that day I'ma rise up high
I put my light in the air
I wanna see everywhere

One by one, let me see you
Two by two for the sequel
Three by three for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbor, ye
One by one, let me see you (put your lighters up)
Two by two for the sequel (lighters up)
Three by three for my people
One, two, three, everybody go

Light it up
Light it up, light it up
Light it up
(Light it up)

One by one, let me see you
Two by two for the sequel
Three by three for my people
I know say I'm bound to be next like my neighbor, ye
One by one, let me see you (eh)
Two by two for the sequel (put your lighters up)
Three by three for my people (lighters up)
Set it ablaze

(Light it up)

Set it ablaze like a candle wick
Hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter
Yeah, light it up
