		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the saints go
marching through
Flowers bloom in their
footprints and
We find a way
However, we are the fools,
Repeat the same mistakes
And always regret over it
Looking up to the sky,
All of us are whining about
ourselves having nothing at all
In a set of values
someone has defined,
We cannot be nothing
And we are struggling
We are the fools and
Always make mistakes
We are the weaks and
Having nothing
Don't wanna be a freak
Don't wanna be alone
We didn't mean to
Be like that

The wise are laughing and
The weaks are grieving
What the hell is right
in this world?
Enough of that
Don't fear anything anymore
I can make my own values
We can be anything we want
We are the fools and
Always make mistakes
We are the weaks and
Having nothing
But, I'm still me
I can be anything I want to be
You've got to be confident
We are the Saints
We are the Saints
We are the Sun
We are the Sun
We are the fools
We are the fools
Always make mistakes
Always make mistakes
When the saints
go running through
go running through
Yes, I am sure that
something will change
