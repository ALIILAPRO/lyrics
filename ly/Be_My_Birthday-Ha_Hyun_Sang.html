		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For the first time I met you, remember?
There was the sun and moon where we have stayed
It was still in silence
But I've got the feeling on my own
And though it's just a line to you

For the first time I missed you, remember?
Waiting until the stars found you with me
Here and now, just stay close to my side
Then let us settle down
While making a wish

Be my birthday (be my birthday)
Be my birthday (be my birthday)
Be my birthday and we sing

Dear my birthday (dear my birthday)
Dear my birthday (dear my birthday)
Dear my birthday, can't you see?
All my days are shining like you

Like a leaf go down to the sea
Slowly from the hearts
While making a wish

Be my birthday (be my birthday)
Be my birthday (be my birthday)
Be my birthday and we sing

Dear my birthday (dear my birthday)
Dear my birthday (dear my birthday)
Dear my birthday, can't you see?
All my days are shining like you
