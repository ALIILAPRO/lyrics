		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I'll just be fucked up forever
Should have figured myself out by now
And I don't want to tear myself open, no
But it's hard to care when you bleed out

So won't you break me down, break me down
Make me get better
I confess I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear

We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room full of strangers (strangers, strangers, strangers)

Well, I guess my guardian angel missed the memo
'Cause we're walking on razors again
And we swore to God we'd never let this happen, no
We've dragged ourselves through hell and we'll be damned if we go back

Break me down, break me down, make me get better
I confess that I'm a mess, some kind of error
Well, maybe I was destined to disappear

We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, it don't

Where did we go?
We're all alone, all alone
No place like home
Take us back to yesterday
SOS
Save us from ourselves

We're just a room full of strangers
Looking for something to save us
Alone together, we're dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
It never stops, can't erase this
So cross out my eyes, tear the pages
'Cause you and I we're just dying to live and we're living to die
Dying to live, living to die
We're just a room
We're just a room
We're just a room full of strangers

Strangers
(Just wonders)
