We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (run shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (get right)
I got too many diamonds on, I look awesome (ice, get right)
Yeah, after I hit that hoe, she need a walker (smash, get right, uh)

Yeah, stack the money tall, back to ballin' (get right)

Big boy Rolls, swerve the lane, I be hoggin' (big boy Rolls)
Lit four blunts of Cookie, musty, yeah, it's foggy (cookie, whoa)
I can park it, stick be sparkin', do no talkin' (brr)
Watch me hit the target, mark the carpet, then depart it (Offset)

We don't give two fucks
Choppas hangin' out the Rolls Royce truck (pop it)
Go play with your kid, 'cause I up (up)
She broke so why would I cuff? (Hey)
We rich, lit, we 'bout to go up to space (lit)
Gold toilet, I took me a rich shit (woo)
'Cause I have racks on my plate (racks)

I make you go get the bag, baby, we livin' the dream (livin' the dream)
Gang not comin' in last, top ranked in loyalty (top ranked)
It's a millionaire campaign, that's what it's supposed to be (campaign)
Pray my soul to keep when I go to sleep (uh, Huncho)

We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (run shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (get right)
I got too many diamonds on, I look awesome (ice, get right)
Yeah, after I hit that hoe, she need a walker (smash, get right, uh)

Bitch too petty (woo, bitch)
Big machete (petty, petty)

We don't give no fucks (uh), We don't give no fucks (no)
Give her a couple bucks (bucks), get her a tummy tuck (whoa)
Harriet Tubman-ed up (yeah), twenty bills in my clothes (ayy)
I got a bulletproof truck, I got the backwards doors on the Royce
Give no fucks

We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (run shit)

Yeah, after I hit that hoe, she need a walker (smash, get right)
I done shook them problems off, now I'm bossin' (woo, get right)
Yeah, stack the money tall, back to ballin' (get right)
Yeah

I done been 'round the whole globe and did a few laps
And brought back a whole tide
She done spent time in the hood and found nothin' else is better than that side
I done went set up the Jack and made sure the pack ain't gotta push packs quiet
Stuck at the top of the chain, in top of her brain, can't fall off at one time (yeah)
All my colleagues say how we live outrageous (alright)
We don't count the days, we just count the payments 
Just let that Juvie play, she start rejuvenating (Juvie)
Alive at night, we take everything, we face it, yeah

We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
We don't give no fuck (no)
We don't give no fuck (fuck shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (run shit)
Out in public (public), and we run shit (get right)
I got too many diamonds on, I look awesome (ice, get right)
Yeah, after I hit that hoe, she need a walker (smash, get right)
I done shook them problems off, now I'm bossin' (woo, get right)
Yeah, stack the money tall, back to ballin' (get right)
