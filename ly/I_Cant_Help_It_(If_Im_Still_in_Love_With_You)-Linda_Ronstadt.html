		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Today I passed you on the street
And my heart fell at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And she looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A picture from the past came slowly stealing
As I brushed your arm and stood so close to you
Suddenly I got that old time feeling
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

It's hard to know another's lips have kissed you
And held you just the way I used to do
Heaven only knows how much I've missed you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
Oh, I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
