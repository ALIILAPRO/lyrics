		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will make my way
I'm trying to survive another day, day, day, day, day, day

Waking up, up, up
Making love, love, love
Put it all on paper and
Play it on and on
Just start with dreaming
You'll end up winning
Waking up, up, up
Every day, day, day

I will make my way
I'm trying to survive another day
In this big crazy world
Let my music show you what I'm really worth
Waking up, up, up
Every day, day, day

I will make my way
I'm trying to survive another day
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive

Turn it up, up, up
Every night night night
Guided by this pure love
I'm light, light, light
I'll start with dreaming
And end up winning
Waking up, up, up
Every day, day, day

Turn it up, up, up
Every night, night, night
Guided by this pure love
I'm light, light, light
I'll start with dreaming
And end up winning
Waking up, up, up
Every day, day, day

I will make my way
I'm trying to survive another day
In this big crazy world
Let my music show you what I'm really worth
Waking up, up, up
Every day, day, day

I will make my way
I'm trying to survive another day (another day)
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive

La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive

I will make my way
I'm trying to survive another day (another day)
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give
I will survive, I will survive

I will survive
