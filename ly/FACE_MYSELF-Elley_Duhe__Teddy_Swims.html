		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one, no one, no one else but me

It's a slow burn down to the truth
If I have a drink, I know I gotta see the bottle through
It's a hard-earned lesson or two
There's a laundry list of all the shit that I'm addicted to

I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
I'm runnin' again, runnin' again
Run out of my skin
I'm going through something
I'm runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
I'm runnin' again, runnin' again
You know how I get
The war inside my head

When the lights go down
And no one's around
Only one way out
Gotta face myself
When I'm in the clouds
And it all goes south
When I hit the ground
Gotta face myself

Every lie I told myself
I'm flawed in every way
Is there something they could love in me
Enough to make 'em stay?
I'm so misunderstood these days
I think I lost my way
No getting back the love I gave
It's the price I had to pay (ohh)

I'm runnin' runnin', runnin' runnin'
I'm runnin' again, runnin' again
Run out of my skin
I'm going through something
Runnin' runnin', runnin' runnin'
I'm runnin' again, runnin' again
You know how I get
The war inside my head

When the lights go down
And no one's around
Only one way out
Gotta face myself
When I'm in the clouds
And it all goes south
When I hit the ground
Gotta face myself
Gotta face myself

No one, no one, no one else but me
I gotta face myself
I gotta face myself

No one, no one, no one else but me
I gotta face myself
I gotta face myself (when the lights go)

When the lights go down
And no one's around
Only one way out
Gotta face myself
When I'm in the clouds
And it all goes south
When I hit the ground
Gotta face myself
Gotta face myself

When the lights go down
And no one's around
Only one way out
Gotta face myself
