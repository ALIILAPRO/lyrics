		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was thinking about us yesterday
Imagining your warm embrace
I can smell the salt on our skin
I can taste you both on me

So when my life began to break
And I needed escape
To the city by the sea
You were where I need to be
Let me breath let me rest
Let me lay out on your chest
Inhale for me

Thessaloniki
You put your arms round me
Oh Thessaloniki
Went deep inside of me
You saved me
(Deeper than before)

I was thinking about us yesterday
The memories won't ever fade
Three lovers on a balcony
Hoping that nobody can see

When my life began to break
And I needed escape
To the city by the sea
You were where I need to be
Let me breath let me rest
Let me lay out on your chest
Exhale for me

Thessaloniki
You put your arms round me
Oh Thessaloniki
Went deep inside of me
You saved me
(Oh your love it went deeper than before)

I'd give up my life for you
Ready, I'm willing to
But there's no life to give
One day I'll return to you
My body yearns for you both
Til then, there's only this

(Deeper than before)
Σ'αγαπώ πολύ
(Oh your love it went deeper than before)

Thessaloniki
You put your arms round me
Oh Thessaloniki
Went deep inside of me
You saved me
(Heavy breathing)
