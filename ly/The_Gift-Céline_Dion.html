		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, oh
Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, oh

Only love can illuminate
Ignite the midnight dark
Only love can captivate
Break down the coldest heart, heart

It's a cure, a light, an answer and a healing
There's an anthem we have in our blood we're needing

Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, oh
Only love, only love, only love's all that we need to live, oh
It's the energy, the air we breathe
Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift

It's wrapped around the world
We feel its gravity
I wanna lose myself
And feel it empower me

A cure, a light, an answer and a healing
There's an anthem we have in our blood we're needing

Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, oh
Only love, only love, only love's all that we need to live, oh
It's the energy, the air we breathe
Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift

Only love, only love, only love is the gift
Only love, only love's all we need to live, oh (only love is the gift)
Only love, only love, only love is the gift, ooh, yeah
Only love, only love's all we need to live

Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, oh
Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, the gift

Only love, only love, only love, only love is the gift, oh (love is the gift)
Only love, only love, only love's all that we need to live, oh (only love)
It's the energy, the air we breathe (it's the energy, air we breathe)
Only love, only love, only love, inly love is the gift (only love is the gift, oh love)

Only love, only love, only love is the gift
Only love, only love's all that we need to live, oh (only love is the gift)
Only love, only love, only love is the gift, ooh, yeah
Only love, only love's all that we need to live, only love

Only love, only love, only love
Only love, only love, only love
Only love, only love, only love
