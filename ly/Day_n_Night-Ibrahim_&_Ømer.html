		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day and night (what, what)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (what, what)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (what, what)
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this (what, what)
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what)
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast (what, what)
I think I'm first but surely finish last (what, what)

Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

Hold the phone (what, what)
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo (what, what)
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade (what, what)
Within his dreams he see's the life he made, made
The pain is deep (what, what)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too (what, what)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night (day and night)
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night (night)
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
