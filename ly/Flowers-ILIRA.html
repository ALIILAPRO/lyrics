		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been two years now, and life goes on
But I didn't learn how to love again
You were there when my heart was heavy
And I loved the way you sang along to my songs

Will I go to heaven or join Club 27?
Never mind, want you to know
You are my favourite human

Would you hold me if I only had one day?
Could you stay for one last dance?
And when the night has come and angels call my name
How many times would you leave flowers at my grave?

I'm not a believer, but I still pray
For you to find another love
And it hurt a little when she came into your life
And I'm jealous of all the mornings that you share

Will I go to heaven or join Club 27?
Never mind, want you to know
You are my favourite human

Would you hold me if I only had one day?
Could you stay for one last dance?
And when the night has come and angels call my name
How many times would you leave flowers at my grave?

How many times would you leave flowers at my grave?
How many times would you leave flowers at my grave?

Would you hold me if I only had one day?
Could you stay for one dance?
And when the night has come and angels call my name
How many times would you leave flowers at my grave?

How many times would you leave flowers at my grave?
