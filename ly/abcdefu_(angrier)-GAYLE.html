		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start shit
Now you're textin' all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you'd do anything for my affection
You're goin' all about it in the worst ways

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Na-na, na-na, na, na, na-na
A-B-C-D-E, fuck you

You said you just needed space and so I gave it
When I had nothin' to say you couldn't take it
Told everyone I'm a bitch, so I became it
Always had to put yourself above me

I was into you, but I'm over it now
And I was tryin' to be nice
But nothing's getting through, so let me spell it out

A-B-C-D-E, fuck you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your craigslist couch and the way your voice sounds
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

Na-na, na-na, na, na, na-na
A-B-C-D-E, fuck off
Na-na, na-na, na, na, na-na
A-B-C-D-E, fuck you

And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off
