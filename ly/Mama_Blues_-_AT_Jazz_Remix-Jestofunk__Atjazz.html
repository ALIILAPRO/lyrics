		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo

I'd like to dedicate this one to all my people of color
To all my brothers and sisters out there
To you and your culture
Be proud of what you are
But most of all, I want you to respect others

Ah, ah
Oh, oh
Ah

Can we live? Can we live? Oh
Can we live, can we live together?

Oh

Can we? Can we live? Can we live? Oh
Can we live? Can we live? Can we live?
Ah

There is a dream flowin' in my mind
A dream of love, just close your eyes
Nobody can stop my love
No one can stop the buzzing up above

Can we live?
Can we live?

We must learn, we must learn
We must learn to live, we must learn to live
We must learn to live, we must learn to live
Can we live?
Can we live together?

It seems so hard to realize
But if you can't just close your eyes
Nobody can stop our love
No one can stop the buzzing up above

Can we live?
Can we live?

There is a dream in my mind
A dream of love, cares behind
Humanity, equality, we can live in harmony
There is a dream forming in my mind
A dream of love, leave our cares behind

Can we live?
Can we live?
Oh, can we live? Can we live? Can we live?
Ah

(Brothers) we must learn (brothers), (brothers) we must learn (brothers)
(Brothers) we must learn (brothers), (brothers) we must learn (brothers)
We must learn to live, we must learn to live
We must learn to live, we must learn to live
We must learn to live, we must learn to live
We must learn to live, we must learn to live

People, let me tell you we can love one another, together (no, no, no, no, no)
People, let me tell you we can love one another, together
