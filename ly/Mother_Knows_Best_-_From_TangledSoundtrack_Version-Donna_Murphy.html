		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel!
Look at you, as fragile as a flower
Still a little sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower

I know but

That's right, to keep you safe and sound, dear
Guess, I always knew this day was coming
Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet

But 

Shh! Trust me, pet
Mother knows best
Mother knows best
Listen to your mother
It's a scary world out there
Mother knows best
One way or another
Something will go wrong, I swear
Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand
Cannibals and snakes, the plague

No! Yes! But

Also large bugs
Men with pointy teeth, and
Stop, no more, you'll just upset me
Mother's right here
Mother will protect you
Darling, here's what I suggest
Skip the drama
Stay with mama
Mother knows best

Got ahead, get trampled by a rhino
Go ahead, get mugged and left for dead!
Me, I'm just your mother, what do I know?
I only bathed, and changed, and nursed you
Go ahead and leave me, I deserve it
Let me die alone here, be my guest!
When it's too late, you'll see, just wait
Mother knows best

Mother knows best
Take it from your mumsy
On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, underdressed, immature, clumsy
Please, they'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naive, positively grubby
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm, vague
Plus, I believe gettin' kinda chubby
I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you
Mother understands
Mother's here to help you
All I have is one request

Rapunzel?
Yes?
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again
Yes, mother
I love you very much, dear
I love you more
I love you most

Don't forget it
You'll regret it
Mother knows best
