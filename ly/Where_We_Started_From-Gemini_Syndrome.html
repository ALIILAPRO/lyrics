		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paradise in a fashion
A perception of the mind
Like a gift from the ether
I never thought I’d find

Here we are back where we started from
It was always now or never
And now everything’s forever so it seems 
What’s done cannot be undone
The song is just beginning
And the melody plays on and on and on

Paranoid as a passion
Keeping everything at bay
I keep thinking, maybe hoping
Praying there’s another way
There’s another way

Here we are back where we started from
It was always now or never
And now everything’s forever so it seems 
What’s done cannot be undone
The song is just beginning
And the melody plays on and on and on

The song is just beginning
The melody plays on and on and on
The song is just beginning
The melody plays on and on and on

It’s always been now or never
Now everything is forever
So it seems
So it seems
What’s done cannot be undone
The melody’s just begun
So it seems
So it seems

Here we are back where we started from
It was always now or never
And now everything’s forever so it seems 
What’s done cannot be undone
The song is just beginning
And the melody plays on and on and on

The song is just beginning
The melody plays on and on and on
The song is just beginning
The melody plays on and on and on
