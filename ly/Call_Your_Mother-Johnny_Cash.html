		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

I always liked your family
We got along just splendidly
Though your brother
Kind of rubbed me the wrong way
I remember that your eyes turned green
When they crowned your sister County Queen
Though she couldn't hold a candle
To your beauty any day

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
Gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

Back when we could laugh and play
On family reunion day
Didn't we all look funny
In our 1950s clothes?
Your daddy wore that greasy stuff
Your brother drank more than enough
Your mom wore penny loafers
With runners in her hose

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And thank her for the good years that we had?
O gently break the news that you don't love me
And give my best regards to your good old dad

When you get a chance
Would you please call your mother
And give my best regards to your good old dad
