		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  New made grave and hide me like a dead man
I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference
From sleep and awake
I'm losing my patience, I can't feel my face

Find me a new made grave
And hide me like a dead man
I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference
From sleep and awake
I'm losing my patience, I can't feel my face
(I can't feel my)

Another lonely day
Reminiscing memories that you erased
I'd rather go insane than hear you
Telling me I'm gonna be okay
Another lonely day
Reminiscing memories that you erased
I'd rather go insane than hear you
Telling me I'm gonna be okay

Find me a new made grave
And hide me like a dead man
I've been up for days
I can't tell the difference
From sleep and awake
I'm losing my patience, I can't feel my face
(I can't feel my)

Way before you came along I was doing alright
Days I'd hold you in my arms
I would give you my life
Heartbreak, open me up
Take my blood from my eyes
California, something 'bout you is
Haunting my mind
