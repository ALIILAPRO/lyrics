		  Fuck the girls
They ain't wit' me then they wit' me, so 
Fuck the girls
I don't need 'em, I'm too pretty, so 
Fuck the girls
Every region, every city
The whole damn world stay sayin', "Fuck the girls"

Fuck the girls
They ain't wit' me then they wit' me, so 
Fuck the girls
I don't need 'em, I'm too pretty, so 
Fuck the girls
Every region, every city
The whole damn world stay sayin', "Fuck the girls"

Who dare ride my new Versace coattails?
You can't buy none that if it was wholesale
They wan' pull out cameras at hotels
Sell that shit for a dime, I pay they whole bills
You sold ten autographs for the utilities
Y'all take credit bypassing my abilities
You just here by proxy, you ain't feelin' me (yeah)
Girls don't let girls live, but that ain't killing me
Now, fuck you, ho
You need a cookie 'cause you hatin', I could stuff you, ho
I'm just so grateful you a patron, I don't love you hoes
You worship everything you couldn't be, smokin' that Regina
Becoming all that you shouldn't be

Fuck the girls
They ain't wit' me then they wit' me, so 
Fuck the girls
I don't need 'em, I'm too pretty, so 
Fuck the girls
Every region, every city
The whole damn world stay sayin', "Fuck the girls"

Fuck the girls
They ain't wit' me then they wit' me, so 
Fuck the girls
I don't need 'em, I'm too pretty, so 
Fuck the girls
Every region, every city
The whole damn world stay sayin', "Fuck the girls"

Said suck my dick, clit, tits, I'm yellin', "Six, six, six"
I can't believe how bold, you think the line's that thin
I'm gettin' rich, rich, rich
How many lick, lick, licks
Is it gon' take to feel the barrel of my-?
Now what the heck, darn, frick? Y'all want attention
Since when was y'all my bastard children? Go 'head and raise y'all self
Come get ya bad-ass kids, no need to mention
I been sittin' on that thought for a minute, now I got time for a minute
I'm never poppin' no shit
I focus most on my craft, I stay on top of my shit
But y'all done got me convinced that I'm the popularist
That's why you watchin' my moves
So check the time on ya wrist, that's why my mama said

Fuck the girls
They ain't wit' me then they wit' me, so 
Fuck the girls
I don't need 'em, I'm too pretty, so 
Fuck the girls
Every region, every city
The whole damn world stay sayin', "Fuck the girls"

Fuck the girls
They ain't wit' me then they wit' me, so 
Fuck the girls
I don't need 'em, I'm too pretty, so 
Fuck the girls
Every region, every city
The whole damn world stay sayin', "Fuck the girls"
