		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been around the world
Seven wonders, seven seas
But when all is said and done you're the only thing I see, my love
So tell me what you're looking for
You're written in the stories, a living masterpiece
So when all is said and done, why you standing next to me, my love
So tell me what you're looking for
And you said

I don't need a symphony
I just want your voice and a melody
I don't need your diamond rings
I just want your love, stop selling me
I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings
I just wanna know when you're landing
You don't need to be the king 'cause I just want the last man standing

I've been around the world, lived a hundred fantasies
But when all is said and done, you're the only one I need, my love
Just tell me what you're looking for

'Cause you don't gotta fight so hard
Darlin' this is love not war
All I want is who you are
That's what I've been looking for

I don't need a symphony
I just want your voice and a melody
I don't need your diamond rings
I just want your love, stop selling me
I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings
I just wanna know when you're landing
You don't need to be the king 'cause I just want the last man standing

And you said, "I just want the last man standing, now"
And you said, "I just want the last man standing"

I don't need a symphony
I just want your voice and a melody
I don't need your diamond rings
I just want your love, stop selling me
I don't need the wind that's underneath your wings
I just wanna know when you're landing
You don't need to be the king 'cause I just want the last man standing
