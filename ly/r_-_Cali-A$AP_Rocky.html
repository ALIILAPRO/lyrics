		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Niggas pistol popping like it's nineteen ninety nine
I was nine maybe ten, then again never mind
Press rewind, back in time before rappers dropping dimes
Trap or die, choppin' pies with cliche's all in they rhymes
That was Gucci, Prada and anything designer
Money, power, the whole enchilada
Commas, dollas, the greens and the guava
They serve you to your flocka if you disrespect that blocka, blocka
Choppas on eaves droppers, fuck these choppas I'm about it
Grindin' like 2Pac or Biggie Poppa, yeah you outer but I'm hotter (right)
Car jacking, pistol packing, mothafuckin' choppers clapping
Metal jacket automatic magazines head on traffic
Fenders smashing, windows crashing, pants sagging, fuck your fashion
Yeah a nigga run Manhattan, back in Cali's where it happen
It's Gucci, Escada, and anything designer
Groupies, poppers they all gonna swallow
It was probably the robbers, the goons and the goblins
They hating a lot, medulla oblongata

From New York to San Andreas
All around the world
Going back to Cali, I'm going back to Cali

Niggas was whack
I'm really out here boomin' on the west side
You know what I'm sayin' weeest
Me and live ninjas seen death right here lookin' out for the enemies
'Cause you all know how we down
'Cause fuck killin' these clowns, you said it hah
We getting everything, anything moving, nigga that's it nigga
Chyeah I'm shootin I'm shootin' at niggas on the side 'cause you already know
Yall folks be yappin this back nigga
Fuck that black nigga slippin' on the cash
I'll make that happen with the sawed off

Maserati like Atari with no car keys push to start it
New Bugatti, two Bugatti's, Testarossa blue Ferrari
Lamborghini, system bumping, me no warried, Rastafari
This the hardest supersonic, systematic, too retarded
New Versace, new apartment, bigger closet, newer carpet
Hit Departments, cooler garments, set my goals up to accomplish
Shoot a target 'cause you the target, moving targets, new accomplish
Kill the game but still regardless, beat the charges, do the honors
