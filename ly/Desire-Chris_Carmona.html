		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get what I want
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
Everything cloudy I cannot see shit I needa get recollected
But I got my attitude back I finally feel resurrected
Who's that? I need a piece of her and her and her best friend
So imma keep shooting and shooting and shooting till I get arrested
I'm feeling provocative, so I just say what I want
You being too talkative, please lemme just do what I want
And she got some scholarships, but she still act like a thot
I'm tired I'm tired I'm tired these bitches these bitches they act what they not
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
Ripped jeans
Hunnids stream
Diamonds beam
I get what I want
