Konvict Music
And you know we up front

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know, girl

Money in the air as mo' fell
Grab you by your coattail
Take you to the motel, ho sale
Don't tell, won't tell
Baby say, "I don't talk Dogg"
Then she told on me, oh well
Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby, stick to me and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me, then I'ma pick on you
D-O-double G and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
Rip ridin' the poles and them doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot 'fo the end of the night
'Cause pussy is pussy, and baby your pussy for life

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know, girl

Shorty, I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
See you looking at me, now what it's gon' be?
Just another tease far as I can see
Tryna get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' 'bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that 'cause I'm far from a scrub
You know my pedigree, ex-dealer used to move 'phetamines
Girl, I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you (for you)

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know, girl

Mobbin' through the club and then low pressin'
I'm sitting in the back in the smoker's section (just smokin', just smokin')
Bird's eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you, mmm (baby, I see you)
It's cool, we jet, the mood is set
Your pussy is wet, you're rubbing your back and touching your neck
Your body is movin', you humpin' and jumpin'
Your titties is bouncin', you smilin' and grinnin' and looking at me

Girl, and while you're looking at me, I'm ready to hit the Caddy
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the Caddy
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything and that's kinda scary
'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin', got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know

I see you windin' and grindin' up on that pole
I know you see me lookin' at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know
I wanna fuck you (fuck you), you already know, girl
