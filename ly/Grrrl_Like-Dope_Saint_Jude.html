		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m like my mama
Sometimes it’s drama
Forget the karma
Might hear me holla
Reverse Madonna (That's me)
My bike’s a Honda (That me)
Michelle Obama (That me)
You feel me holla (CCO)

I’m a girl just like like like like like like like
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like

Skip train, don’t got a ride
All I got is my heart and my pride
Cash money for the game on the streets
The only way to hustle is to spit on the beats
When I come through with the verse and the sound
And the hacks in the biz wanna box up my flow

Then I know (Get up mama)
Drama
Karma
Might hear me holla
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (Like what?)
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (Like what?)
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (I don't give a fuck)

Skip train, girl by my side
Red lights flash so we run and we hide
Homegirl got her head in the books
And I translate words with my bars and my hooks (Cape Town ey)

When I come through with the verse and the sound
And the hacks in the biz wanna box up my flow
Then I know

Don’t give a
Don’t give a
Don’t give a
Don’t give a

I’m like my mama
Sometimes it’s drama
Forget the karma
Might hear me holla
Reverse Madonna (That's me)
My bike’s a Honda (That me)
Michelle Obama (That me)
You feel me holla (CCO)

I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (Like what?)
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (I don't give a)
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (Like what?)
I’m a girl just like like like like like like like (I don’t give a)

I don’t give a
I don’t give a
