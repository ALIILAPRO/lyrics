		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw her eyes
The way they twinkle in delight
When she’s with him
She doesn’t know I'm here
But I can tell that she’s alright
When she’s with him

I can’t decide
On whether I should stay
Or go back home
I’m through with this
I’m convinced
That I deserve to be alone

It’s a lot for me
To be there and see
The smile that gave me
Hope I agree
But for now it seems
You’re not here for me
It's ok
I'm ok

But one day
You’ll know
That I have always
Loved you
Loved you

It’s a lot for me
To reach out and say
That I still wish
We’d be back someday
And it hurts to see
You’re not here for me
It’s ok
I'm ok hm

One day
You’ll know
That I have always
Loved you
Loved you

I was scared of waking up
Cuz I know we'll end up feeling numb
Gotta keep on moving on
Till it’s gone

I was afraid of breaking up
Cause I don’t wanna be alone
I never knew on what I did
Til you’re gone

One day
You’ll know
That I have always
Loved you
Loved you

Hold me
Love me
Cuz I’ll still
Keep on loving you
You

One day
You’ll know
That I have always
Loved you
Loved you
