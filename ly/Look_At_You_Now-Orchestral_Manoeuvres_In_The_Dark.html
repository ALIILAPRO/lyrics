		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at you now
You're shining and how
The dreams that you dream you live
All the love you give
Look at you now

When desire won't let you 
Frustration starts to grow
When your head is in the sand 
And nothing goes as planned 
Salvation is at hand

Look at you now
You're shining and how
The dreams that you dream you live
All the love your give
Look at you now

When the energy is gone 
And the feeling is just wrong
The power in your hand
Is pouring out like sand
Get up again and stand

Look at you now
You're shining and how
The dreams that you dream you live
All the love your give
Look at you now

Look at you now
When the energy is gone 
You're shining and how
And the feeling is just wrong
The dreams that you dream you live
All the love your give
Look at you now
