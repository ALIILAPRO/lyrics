(Run that back, Turbo)
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Oops, I made a mess, G5 for the jets
I'm 'bout to cash, I doubled the bet (yeah)
My money stretch from south to the west (stretch)
Lawyer's the best, get home with a check (yeah)
He done fucked up, put some dough on his head
Can't be knocked up, left the nut on her legs (uh)
Run this cash up like a motherfuckin' tread (a motherfuckin' tread)
Yeah, yeah

Nigga fucked up tryna hide the bitch (hide the bitch)
Drum on the stick, on the side, a switch (switch)
Call up a lil' pretty vibe 
Pull up and let her massage the dick (alright)
Oh, that's your new ride? 
We whippin' and swervin' all kind of shit (skrrt)
Whippin' and runnin', my little niggas pullin' up gunnin'
They hit what they tryna hit (tryna hit)
Mouse started runnin'
We shootin' rats right in they stomachs
And leave 'em inside a ditch (inside a ditch)
Ain't nothin' funny when you gotta break down an onion 
It look like you fryin' a brick (fry)
Hit her on Sunday, she still wanna ask me for money 
She gon' end up dyin' a bitch (dyin')
Got me some hundreds and still gotta keep it one hundred 
'Cause these niggas counterfeit (yeah, yeah)
We had the longest sex
Good pussy bitch off of Bouldercrest (Bouldercrest, yeah, yeah)
They thought Rolls was wrecked
Just like a real nigga, bouncin' it back (I'm bouncin' back, yeah, yeah)
Make sure your nose ain't wet
He fell a victim, addicted to crack (addicted to crack, yeah, yeah)
I'm 'bout my Benjamins, check out my neck
All in my business, lil' bitch, just relax (relax, yeah, yeah)
She done got way too attached
Notice they mine 'cause they waists is snatched (yeah, yeah)
Heard your lil' homie got whacked
We take a life, you ain't takin' one back (yeah, yeah)
You goin' under attack
Let the whole world know the babies is back (yeah, yeah)
Smith & Wess' hid in the dash
Crib in the backyard, a hundred-yard dash

Oops, I made a mess, G5 for the jets
I'm 'bout to cash, I doubled the bet (yeah)
My money stretch from south to the west (stretch)
Lawyer's the best, get home with a check (yeah)
He done fucked up, put some dough on his head
Can't be knocked up, left the nut on her legs (ugh)
Run this cash up like a motherfuckin' tread (a motherfuckin' tread)
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
