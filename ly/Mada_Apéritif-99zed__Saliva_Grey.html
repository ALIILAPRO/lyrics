		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  G R E to the Y yeah
S A L and to the I
Got that V wit the A
804 til the grave
Got them fingers all on my plate
Lickin it yum lovin the taste
Imma pack up the extremities
I never let ya Rest In Peace
Never see, anyone
Make it out from under me
I bury thee, underneath
All the Belladonna leaves
Celery wit the wing
You were just aperitif
Sprinkle little flesh inside a bag of my Doritos
Bottom of the bottle find the worm inside my ego
Facing Dutches on the busses stepping thru all of the fecal
Look inside ya fuckin eyes and I don't see nothing but fetal
You baby ass bitch steadily wollow in all of yo caca
Su casa mi casa soy tu padre Grey is yo papa
Yo father I spank yo lil mama
Then put you in collar, the trunk of my Honda
I'm rippin through this pack
187 in the back
Steady rollin the potent
And flicking the ashes on my lap
Only smokin if it gas
If it's reggie imma pass
We got the pounds by the plenty
I'm feeling deady where I'm at?
Where tha bread?
Gimme dat
Got 2 shawtys in my lap
She asked if she could hit my blunt I turned and I said fuck that
Step back
99 about to snap
Wrapping my fingers around the katana
I don't need no fucking skrap
Ticky tocky on the clock
Bitch u better kick rocks
Sick of the phony mothafuckas
Tell em hop off my cock
Finna makin the bodies drops
Like 1920 stocks
Keep the switch blade
Folded and tucked away up in my sock
Bitch it's been two years and u still in the same place
How you make the same mistakes and expect it to go away
Coming and spitting some game for these motherfuckin lames
I'm fucked in the brain bitch we ain't the same
