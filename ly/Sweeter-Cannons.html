		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In your head
Getting rowdy again
Way off track
Here we are again
It ain't quite the end
It's just farewell 'til we meet again
It ain't over yet
It's just farewell 'til we meet again

On another road
Maybe I can make your heart beat again
And in another life
Maybe it would be much sweeter then

I was wrong
Let you down again
But if you let me 'round again
I'll be your oxygen
I'll be the cure, be the medicine
You're my battlefield
You're sunbeams in a velvet dream

On another road
Maybe I can make your heart beat again
And in another life
Maybe it would be much sweeter then

On another road
Maybe I can make your heart beat again
And in another life
Maybe it would be much sweeter then

On another road
Maybe I can make your heart beat again
And in another life
Maybe it would be much sweeter then
