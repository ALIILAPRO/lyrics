		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Fore you go, yeah
I wanna talk to you

Thinking 'bout the time we shared
And how I wasn't there
It hurt me
These people overwork me
Then I heard maybe soon you'll leave
Excuse me, Lord, if you have tricks up your sleeve
I'm not ready to be bereaved
I know I'm always asking for something
Or another
But this time, it's just time
'Cause I love her (I just love her)
Well baby, if he don't change his mind
Or fate, or time
Yo, I wanna leave you with this line

It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah

Yesterday I tied two rocks together
To symbolize our lives
And threw them in the ocean
Now they're on the ocean floor coastin'
'Til they stop rollin' so far
That no sonar would list them (they won't see 'em)
To the point that no one would even believe that we existed
Uh, I know that may sound twisted
But my neglect is killin' me
I feel so guilty
Please have faith in if you feel me

It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah

Though you're probably feelin' blue
And you'll do what you must do
I hope you know
I'd hand the skies to you
I'm so embarrassed for mankind
They have the nerve to let their weapon shine
They're so stupid
Do they not know you're about to fly high?
Away
The wings that God will give you someday
I'm not jealous (no)
I just can't take it (so hard on me)
S.O.S. to your ears, the only thing I ever feared was this day
And having to say

It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run to the sun
And never come back
Yeah
It goes while you're here
I wanna tell you something
Is that I love you, girl
And, and I wish we could run
