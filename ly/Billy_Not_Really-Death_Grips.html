		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, why me why me, oh, I mean oh my me
Don't see why I need all these hairs can't stand by these
Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean oh my me
Don't see why I need all these hairs can't stand by thee

All my palm lines running, stretching
'Cross my palm like blind cross etching
Palm mummified, cotton era filming
Bronze my palm now, all brown palmed now
Visits some medium
Won't come near me
Treats me like a meteor
She scares me
My bony
Now, now, Billy, not really
My bony
Now, now, Billy, not really

Yo, oi, yo
Ooh, ahh
Billy, Billy, not really
Yo
Raw
Yo, oi, yo
Ahh
Billy, Billy, not really
Yo, oi, yo
Amnesia
Yo, oi, yo
Ooh, ahh
Billy, Billy, not really
Yo
Raw
Yo, oi, yo
Ahh
Billy, Billy, not really
Yo, oi, yo
Amnesia

Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean oh my me
Don't see why I need all these hairs can't stand by these
Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean oh my me
Don't see why I need all these hairs can't stand by thee

Every movement after sudden movement
Déjà-vu abducting
Sucky-sucky
Sticky psyche touching
So many sensory
Dripping dripping dripping splashing splashing happening
Already
Now, now, Billy, not really

Oh, why me, why me, oh, I mean oh my me
Don't see why I need all these hairs can't stand by thee
My bony
Now, now, Billy, not really
My bony
Now, now, Billy, not really

Amnesia

Yo, oi, yo
Ooh, ahh
Billy, Billy, not really
Yo
Raw
Yo, oi, yo
Ahh
Billy, Billy, not really
Yo, oi, yo
Amnesia

Odd man
Tsunami feral
Get barreled in other worlds
No hand in sea of pearls
Buried in frozen Jheri curls
Odd man
Herzog
Shootin' solitaire
No hands
Have one over
Shocker glares
Zulu somnambulic stare
Flick up my wrist
Ooh, shit
Ooh, ah-ooh shit
Phantom lips
Crude lips
I'm in eyelid exclusive
Flick up my wrist
Oooh, shit
Ooh, ah-ooh shit
Flick up my wrist
Aw, shit
Ahh
I'm not shit

She turnin' telly
Through the shriveled button quest jaundiced yellow
She's your experience with your experiment
No false symbol flied glit in oh please shock me so sorry falsetto
You're her experiment
She's your experience
