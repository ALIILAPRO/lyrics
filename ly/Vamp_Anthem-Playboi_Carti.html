		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When them vamps outside, lil' bitch, you better be ready
When the guns outside, lil' bitch, you better be ready
When the stars align, lil' bitch, you better be ready
I won't take my time, lil' bitch, you know I'm ready
I want it right now, lil' bitch, you know I'm ready (go! Yeah)
My flag the same color as cranberry (cranberry)
You come 'round by my gang, it's Hail Mary
Them niggas not no thugs, they some fairies (yeah, yeah)
I'm playing with them birds like I'm Larry (yeah, yeah)
We pop right by the curb, they can't tell it (yeah)
I'm smoking on them herbs you can smell it (yeah)
This bag I got all orange like a felon (yeah)
My bitch, she say she want me, niggas tellin'
We caught him on the block, we topped his melon (yeah)
We push up to your spot like it's nothin' (yeah)
Free all them young niggas, free Young Melvin (yeah)
Free all them young niggas, free my cousin (okay, yeah)
Pussy-ass niggas always bluffin'
Pump fake, nigga, you ain't tough (yeah)
I swear to God if I tote that bitch I'ma hit that boy (baow, baow)
I swear to God, I just play with pussy, I don't play with boys (baow, baow)
You come 'round by my gang, we gon' let them bullets fly (yeah)
I been sippin' on codeine, I got pink eyes (yeah)
.223 gon' hit him up, he done got hypnotized (baow)
I done made a mil' in a white tee but I ain't Franchize (baow)
These niggas be the new bitches, they just dick ride (slatt)
I done called her to the hotel, she left me paralyzed (uh)

Vamp anthem, vamp anthem
Vamp anthem, vamp anthem (yeah)
Vamp anthem, vamp anthem (yeah)
Vamp anthem, vamp anthem (yeah)
Vamp, uh, vamp, uh
Vamp, yeah, vamp, uh
Vamp, uh, vamp, yeah
Vamp, vamp
Vamp, uh, vamp, uh
Vamp, uh, vamp, uh
Vamp, vamp, uh
Vamp
