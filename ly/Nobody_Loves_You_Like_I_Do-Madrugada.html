		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How you holding up?
Your hands are so cold
I study your circles and your serpents
Maybe it's not enough
Nothing ever is
It always starts and ends with a kiss

You give yourself away, you give yourself away
You give yourself away, you give yourself away

Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do

If the world is on fire tonight
You know that it's your own fault
If the world is on fire tonight
You know that it's your own fault

Do you really wanna break the spell?
The downward spiral
All this give and take
In the wee small hours

You give yourself away, you give yourself away
You give yourself away, you give yourself away

Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do
Nobody loves you like I do

Nobody loves you like I do, but my hands are tied up
But my hands are tied up
But my hands are tied, nobody loves you like I do
(But my hands are tied)
No, nobody loves you like I do (but my hands are tied)
Nobody loves you like I do (but my hands are tied)
Nobody loves you like I do
