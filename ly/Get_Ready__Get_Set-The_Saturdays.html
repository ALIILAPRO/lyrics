		  Oh oh oh the more I want
Oh oh oh the more I want
Oh oh oh the more I want

I've been watching you
Watching you all got them night
I've tried my best, tried my best
To get you from my side
But it's so right
I know I got you under control

I can do it with my hands tied behind my back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you gonna like it like that
I can give you the keys to my world, yeah
Feel the music in my head
Yeah, this night I won't forget, eh eh eh eh

I said get ready, get set
'Cause the more that I get
The more more more I want
I'm not done yet
'Cause the more I sweat
The more more more I want
Get ready, get set
'Cause the more that I get
The more more more I want
I'm not done yet
'Cause the more I sweat
The more more more
I want want want

The more I want
I want, oh oh oh
The more

You and me don't need an icebreaker
You and me just need a long night
I'm not lookin' for a kind lover
To hold me tonight, tonight

I can do it with my hands tied behind my back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you gonna like it like that
I can give you the keys to my world, yeah
Feel the music in my head
Yeah, this night I won't forget, eh eh eh eh

I said get ready, get set
'Cause the more that I get
The more more more I want
I'm not done yet
'Cause the more I sweat
The more more more I want
Get ready, get set
'Cause the more that I get
The more more more I want
I'm not done yet
'Cause the more I sweat
The more more more
I want want want

We taking it up, I'm not gonna stop
Want taste it enough, oh oh oh
Oh I wanna to much and let's you give up
Want taste it enough, oh oh oh

Tell me what I want
It's the feeling I needed
There is no right or wrong
No gimmics, no limit
Come on, let it on
Can feel it, I need it
Heal my body, cry with desire

I can do it with my hands tied behind my back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you gonna like it like that
I can give you the keys to my world, yeah
Feel the music in my head
Yeah, this night I won't forget, eh eh eh eh

I said get ready, get set
'Cause the more that I get
The more more more I want
I'm not done yet
'Cause the more I sweat
The more more more I want
Get ready, get set
'Cause the more that I get
The more more more I want
I'm not done yet
'Cause the more I sweat
The more more more

The more I want
