		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's stranger than fiction
How you've decayed
It must be so lonely
Lost within your ways

You're born alone, you die alone
The rest is yours to fill the gap
The world goes on without you here
Adjust or just collapse

Is this what you wanted to be
Alone standing by yourself
Is this all you wanted to be
Or was that a cry for help
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

Verbal grenades
You throw in vain
I can't believe you'd stoop so low
Of all the things you took away
I miss my mind the most

Is this what you wanted to be
Alone standing by yourself
Is this all you wanted to be
Or was that a cry for help
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

Is this what you wanted to be
Alone standing by yourself
Is this all you wanted to be
Or was that a cry for help

Is this what you wanted to be
Alone standing by yourself
Is this all you wanted to be
Or was that a cry for help

It's stranger than fiction
How you've decayed
It must be so lonely
Lost within your ways
