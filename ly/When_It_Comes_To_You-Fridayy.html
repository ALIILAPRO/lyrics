		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I done gave my all to you, fell in the deep end
You done came into my life while I was sinking
I been on that type of time with demons
All the times I was outside, I was creeping
It was love at first sight, girl, when you walked in
Couldn't look deep in your eyes 'cause I get locked in
You was hurtin' deep inside and you was broken
But I was on the other side and didn't notice

Oh-oh-oh, I won't waste no time
I won't waste my time when it come to you
Put my pride aside, give it all to you
Put my pride aside, no, oh
Girl, I won't waste no time
I won't waste my time when it comes to you
Put my pride aside, give it all to you
Put my pride aside, give it all to

Pullin' up fast for you 
223, bust rounds for you
All eyes on me, got me feelin' like Pac but I do it all for you
Don't get caught up in them lies before you know the truth
I'd be down to risk it all if you ask me to
Ain't playin' with your heart 'cause that's too much to lose
You puttin' up a wall but you ain't bulletproof
I done got it out the mud, ain't got nothing to prove
Tryna open up your mind and see a clearer view, ooh
All the times I made you wait for me, no more
But I was on the other side and didn't notice

Oh-oh-oh, I won't waste no time
I won't waste my time when it come to you
Put my pride aside, give it all to you
Put my pride aside, no, oh
Girl, I won't waste no time
I won't waste no time when it comes to you (no time)
Put my pride aside, give it all to you (to you)
Put my pride aside, give all to (woah, oh)

I won't waste no time
I won't waste no time when it come to you
Put my pride aside, give it all to you
Put my pride aside, give it all to you
I won't waste no time
I won't waste no time when it comes to (no time)
Put my pride aside, when it comes to you (oh, woah, oh)
When it comes to-
