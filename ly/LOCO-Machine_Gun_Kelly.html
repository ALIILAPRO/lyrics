		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hated the most, so I keep my haters close
Let 'em know I want the smoke, so much bread I gotta boast
This burner turn you into toast
I'm so G I don't keep that pistol on me
Ay I'll beat yo ass you try to press that issue on me
Ay I keep a stash under all these zippers on me
I got bitches blowin' like I got a whistle on me

Ay can't stop getting paper
Ay can't stop rollin' papers
Ay LSD and coca
Ay live la vida loca
Aye she gon' feed me grapes
Ay we don't go on dates
Ay got a man at home but she love the way I taste

Tatted on my choker
Shoppin' sprees at Dover
I ain't stopping shit 'til I'm 70 years older
Slap me if I'm sober
Yea yea yea come over
Fucked two girls that looked like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler
Back shot back shot back shot back shot right behind the backdrop
Can't stop can't stop can't stop can't stop turnin' up like mascots
Matlock Matlock Matlock Matlock want me in them padlocks
I hope you got a plan, catch me if you can hoe
Yea hoe, can't get jammed hoe, I'll be damned hoe
Yea hoe, I'm the man hoe, from the Land hoe
Yea hoe, out them bandos, to these bands hoe
Sandals for my fam though, 3, 2, 1, takeoff
Jets round the world with them
And you know we gotta fly with the herb with them
In the town I'm a chief like turbo and them
Shouts for the flow G Herbo and them
I just got the cell phone workin' again
I just got the Styrofoam purple again
Never make threats non-verbal again
You already know how I'm lurkin' again
Gunna

Back shot back shot back shot back shot right behind the backdrop
Can't stop can't stop can't stop can't stop turnin' up like mascots
Matlock Matlock Matlock Matlock want me in them padlocks
I hope you got a plan, catch me if you can hoe

Ay can't stop getting paper
Ay can't stop rollin' papers
Ay LSD and coca
Ay live la vida loca
Aye she gon' feed me grapes
Ay we don't go on dates
Ay got a man at home but she love the way I taste
Ay can't stop getting paper
Ay can't stop rollin' papers
Ay LSD and coca
Ay live la vida loca
Aye she gon' feed me grapes
Ay we don't go on dates
Ay got a man at home but she love the way I taste
