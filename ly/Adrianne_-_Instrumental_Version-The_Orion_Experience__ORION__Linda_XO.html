		  cdrianne

Well I don't know how you did it 
but you turned this boy into a man,
cdrianne.
Well I don't know how you do it
but you touch me like no one can,
cdrianne.
Well I don't know how you do it
But I turn to putty in your hands,
cdrianne.

Well the first time that I saw you
You were flirting with another man,
cdrianne.
But you gave me a wink
You made me think that I might stand a chance,
cdrianne.

Well I'm sorry if I seem to be a bit confused.
But I'm slightly undecided which side to choose.
Cause I've never had a lover 
make me question Mother Nature's plan.
I want to be your man.
cdrianne.

Well my friends are always sayin'
You're a player that's in demand.
cdrianne.
Yeah my friends are always sayin'
You'll be playin' that game again.
cdrianne.
Well I thought I could resist, 
But now your wish, it is my command.
cdrianne.

Cause it was absolute surrender 
from the moment that you held my hand.
cdrianne.
Yeah it was absolute surrender
Baby now I am your biggest fan.
cdrianne.

Well I'm sorry if I seem to be a bit confused.
But I'm slightly undecided which side to choose.
Cause I've never had a lover 
make me question Mother Nature's plan.
I want to be your man.
cdrianne.

Well I've had all kinds of lovers,
But you're different from the others,
cnd your secrets I've discovered.
cdrianne.

Well I don't care who knows it,
I'm in love and I don't give a damn.
cdrianne.
I don't care who knows it
we've got something they don't understand.
cdrianne.

I don't care who knows that I'm in love with you.
We don't need no ones permission to do what we do.
Cause your love is so delicious,
It's a sweet and vicious wonderland...
I want to be your man.
cdrianne.
