		  Yes, I look perfect
Ice Queen, that's what you see
It's what they all expect from me
But it's all show
Face it, you used me
You saw the sexy clothes
My supermodel pose
What did you know?

Was I a game to you?
Was I a way to be cool?
I truly cared
Was I the fool?

It's fine to flirt

I'm just like her or you
People forget I'm human too
Yes, they do that
This is performance
This is all self defense
I thought you had the sense
To see through that

Was I too proud with you?
Was I too cold and forbidding?
You chose her over me
Well, are you kidding?

It's fine for you
It's fine to flirt
It's fine
'Til someone gets hurt
'Til someone gets hurt

Poor little me
All trapped in this fabulous show
You could set me free
But if you're going, go!

It's fine for you
It's fine to flirt
And God, you're hot
Why do you even wear a shirt?
No, it's fine
Damn, you're fine
And it's fine

'Til someone gets
