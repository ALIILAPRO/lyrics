		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
(Ooh)

Got you cryin' on my shoulder, and I know better than to listen (oh-oh-oh)
Just because you're staying over, doesn't mean that you're forgiven (oh-oh-oh)
We both know what you done, what you done
Don't love anyone, anyone
Anyone but yourself, oh

Just when I think I've found the strength to go and push you away, away
Oh, I pull you in again, oh, I'm such a sucker for the pain, pain, pain

Baby
I'm helpless, baby
Porcelain in your hands
Bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart

Caption it passion, and then
Capture me, trap me instead
Happy to die in that web, wrapped in the sheets of your bed
Ooh, know the only way I'm leaving
Ooh, is in pieces

Just when I think I've found the strength to go and push you away, away
Oh, I pull you in again, oh, I'm such a sucker for the pain, pain, pain

Baby
I'm helpless, baby
Porcelain in your hands
Bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart

Why do you do this to me?
Leave and come back and repeat
Sound of the crash when you swing (oh-oh-oh)
Why do you do this to me?
Leave and come back and repeat
Sounds like it's just what I need (oh-oh-oh)

Baby
I'm helpless, baby
Porcelain in your hands
Bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart
Baby
I'm helpless, baby
Porcelain in your hands
Bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart

(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Porcelain in your hands
Bound to fall apart
You know how to break me
Hammer to the heart
