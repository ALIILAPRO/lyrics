		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never broke my heart before
But with you, I dropped it on a marble floor
Guess that means I've never been in love before
And so with you, I keep on comin' back for more

Sometimes I don't think I can get used to these changes, the changes
I guess we should face it, we're better off wherever we are

But, baby, I really loved the way you made me feel inside
Really'd love to feel that weight just one more night
I promise I'll leave, I promise I'll go
But if we're gonna say goodbye
Let's make it a good bye

You got my heart all bent out of shape (ooh-ooh)
So after you, I'll never really use it the same (ooh-ooh)
I know, I know, farewells ain't always fair
Let's take this last night as a souvenir
To commemorate our love

Sometimes I don't think I can get used to these changes, the changes
I guess we should face it, we're better off wherever we are

But, baby, I really loved the way you made me feel inside
Really'd love to feel that weight just one more night
I promise I'll leave, I promise I'll go
But if we're gonna say goodbye
Let's make it a good bye

Pa, pa-pa, pa, pa-la-da-da, goodbye, goodbye
If this is the last time, let's make this one a good bye, good bye, la-la-la
Pa, pa-pa, pa, pa-la-da-da, goodbye, goodbye
If this is the last time, let's make this one a good bye, good bye
Pa, pa-pa, pa, pa-la-da-da, goodbye, goodbye (let's say goodbye)
If this is the last time, let's make this one a good bye, good bye, la-la-la (let's say goodbye)
Pa, pa-pa, pa, pa-la-da-da, goodbye, goodbye
If this is the last time, let's make this one a good bye, good bye (let's make this one a good)
Pa, pa-pa, pa, pa-la-da-da, goodbye, goodbye
If this is the last time, let's make this one a good bye, good bye, la-la-la
Pa, pa-pa, pa, pa-la-da-da, goodbye, goodbye
If this is the last time, let's make this one a good bye, good bye
