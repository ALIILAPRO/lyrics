		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta go right now that's all
Nothing to it don't expect no call
Y'all been plotting on me, praying I fall
I been working, I been giving my all
I gotta go right now that's all
Nothing to it don't expect no call
Y'all been plotting on me, praying I fall
I been working, I been giving my all

She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

One more chance to give and that's all I have
All I have left in my heart
I've been through enough to know
When you're sad and we're far apart

Give me some time and I will make you mine again, yeah
Give me a line so I can write you a line again, yeah
Give me some time and I will make you mine again, yeah
Give me a line so I can write you a line again, yeah

She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong

One more chance to give and that's all I have
All I have 

She was the one with the broken smile
She was the one that was worth my time
