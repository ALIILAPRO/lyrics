		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you wearing now
This feels like a new facade
Thought i seen it all with you
I been falling way too hard, wait wait
Got me waiting, and waiting
I'm waiting on your call tonight now
Waiting, and waiting
I'm waiting on you all tonight now

Said you ain't got nothing I need yeah
I been fucking with somebody can't believe
Said you ain't got nothing I need yeah
I been fucking with somebody can't believe
What you wearing now
This feels like a new facade
Thought I seen it all with you
I been falling way too hard, wait wait
What you want let me know
Holding out but baby you know I can't
Let me know what she done

Tell me what you wearing now
This feels like a new facade
Thought I seen it all with you
I been falling way too hard, wait wait
