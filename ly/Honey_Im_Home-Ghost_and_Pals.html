		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father said that this world isn't for me
I tried to pray for a new reality
So, come to me, we can change night into day
A tied-up moth seemed to know a different way

(Don't remember it, don't return to it)

Oh, Father tore out the umbilical cord
There's nothing left in the bottle keeping me scored
We'll abandon the scenery in the
(Don't remember it, don't return to it)
Rear-view mirror

A petty line of white noise
Pack up your bags and throw out the toys
Three strikes, and: Honey, I'm home!
Three voices come from the gramophone

A vivisection of me
Yielded the start of a mystery
Say: Hello! Honey, I'm home!
Three voices come from the gramophone

God returned with the moth chained to his hand
There's so many things that you'll never understand
So, come to me, we can change night into day
You'll hold my hand, so you never go astray

(God devoured that of Father)

A spider preaching, with poison on its lips
To get out of here is to promise me a kiss
The abandonment of scenery in the
Mind of Mother

(Don't remember it, don't return to it)

So, with advice of the dead
And a halo over my head

At last: Honey, I'm home!
Three voices come all alone
A vivisection of me
Done by God, for all to see
Say: Hello! Honey, I'm home!
Three voices come all alone

(Da-da-lo, da-da-la, da-da-lo, da-da-la)
A vivisection of me
Done by God, for all to see
(Da-da-lo, da-da-la, da-da-lo, da-da-la)
A vivisection of me
Done by God, for all to see
