		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'll pull you down eventually
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want not what you need
You don't wanna lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things

I give it all up to ease your pain
Yeah, I would do that all day
I step back from the game to keep you out of harm's way
Would risk it all for the game, but it take more than one person
Two people, one 'til I feel the same way you hurtin'
I was still in middle school when Givens had flipped the whip
Bodies were droppin' before we ever knew 'bout the drip
We gon' be family no matter what way this go, brother
From the ugly corner where everybody betray each other

I let you hang in them jets
I let you bang with my set
Put you before my own flesh
Like why'd I help and do that?
Me and the streets got soul ties
The devil on my shoulder, he whisper but I told him

Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'll pull you down eventually
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things

Generation curses of disloyalty
We breaking that
Lost my dog, got him back
Took him in, we shakin' back
Struggle never broke us
It just made us who we is
Losses taught a lot of lessons
Made the wins feel like blessings

Family all that you got at the end
Hope you get the message
I ain't trying to make it without you
But if I got to then I got you
This ain't about me, this 'bout the whole cake
We can take a slice on a different day, just keep your plate
God, family, hustle, goals
Heart, mind, body, soul
Watching out for street signs on a narrow road
Heaven at the end
Praying for the lost souls with my angels

Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I don't wanna let you down
No, I'll never be perfect
Never want to see you hurting

You should go
You should go
Get away fast
A hundred on the dash now
Wish it didn't have to be this way

My angel, don't fly so close to me 
I pull you down eventually (eventually)
You don't want to lose those wings
People like me break beautiful things
Angel, don't fly so close to me (fly so close)
I'm what you want, not what you need
You don't want to lose those wings (lose those wings)
People like me break beautiful things
