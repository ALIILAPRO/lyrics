		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's three in the morning
Where did the time go?
I wanna know, I wanna know
If you wanna go to bed now or if you don't
I wanna know, I wanna know

If you've been hating, hesitating
This is something different

But baby, it isn't rocket science
Why are we complicating it?
We got a chemistry I'm liking
And I'm feeling good about giving in
'Cause baby, it isn't rocket science
Even when it feels like it is
I know your heart's beating like mine is
We don't gotta hide it
Baby, it's not rocket science

You're telling me secrets nobody else knows
'Cause I wanna know, I wanna know
Where you might see yourself
Way down the road
I wanna know, 'cause I wanna go

Have you been hating, hesitating?
This is something different

But baby, it isn't rocket science
Why are we complicating it?
We got a chemistry I'm liking
And I'm feeling good about giving in
'Cause baby, it isn't rocket science
Even when it feels like it is
I know your heart's beating like mine is
We don't gotta hide it
Baby, it's not rocket science

Even when it feels like it is
(rocket science) we don't gotta hide it
Baby, it's not rocket science

Baby, it's not rocket science
