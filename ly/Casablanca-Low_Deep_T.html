		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She had a beautiful smile
And an incredible style
No matter how long it has been
I can't get her out of my mind, no!
So tell me what do you say
Giving myself the blues
I might as well admit to it
I need her back, in my life
I think I left the love of my life behind
In Casablanca ha!
I've got to buy myself a ticket tonight
Casablanca ha! Ow!
Got to go there, where?
Casa, hey!
You're holding my love, ow!
Casa, hey!
You're holding my love
You've got to let her go now
I've got to let her know
I've come to let my feelings show
It's time to come on home yeah
Hey baby if it's the last flight
I've gotta been leave away tonight too long, baby
I've got no choice
I need to hear your voice
Once again
I think I left the love of my life behind
In Casablanca ha!
I've got to buy myself a ticket tonight
Got to go there, where?
Casablanca ha! Ow!
Casa, hey!
You're holding my love, ow
You've got to let her go now
Casa, hey!
You're holding my love, ow
You've got to let her go now
Hey! She's the love of my life
Ow! She's the love of my life, my life
I need her back
She's the love of my life
I need her back
I need her back
I need her back in my life
