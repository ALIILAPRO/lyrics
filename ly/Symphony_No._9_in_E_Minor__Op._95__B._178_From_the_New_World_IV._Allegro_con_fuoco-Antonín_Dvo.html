		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stop this feeling 
Deep inside of me 
Girl, you just don't realize what you do to me 

When you hold me 
In your arms so tight 
You let me know 
Everything's all right 

I, I'm hooked on a feeling 
High on believing 
That you're in love with me

Your lips are sweet as candy 
The taste stays on my mind 
Girl, you keep me thirsty for
Another cup of wine 

I got it bad for you, girl
But I don't need a cure 
I'll just stay addicted and hope I can endure 

All the good love 
When we're all alone 
Keep it up, girl
Yeah, you turn me on 

I, I'm hooked on a feeling 
High on believing 
That you're in love with me

All the good love 
When we're all alone 
Keep it up, girl
Yeah, you turn me on 

I, I'm hooked on a feeling 
I'm high on believing 
That you're in love with me
