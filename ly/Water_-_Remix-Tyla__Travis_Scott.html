		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Make me sweat (sweat, s-sweat)
Make me lose my breath (breath, my breath)
Make me sweat (sweat, sweat, sweat)
Make me lose my breath (breath, my breath)

Normally
I can keep my cool, but tonight I'm wildin'
I'ma be (yeaah)
In a dangerous mood, can you match my timing? Mm
Telling me (yeah)
That you really 'bout it, why try hide it? Ooh
Talk is cheap, so show me
That you understand how I like it

Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
If I give you my time
Can you snatch my soul from me?
I don't wanna wait, come take it
Take me where I ain't been before
Can you blow my mind?
Set off my whole body
Whole body

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

When you're low, keep you high like Flame (Flame)
Can make your whole life change (change)
She's a bomb body, yeah, but the wrist plain (plain)
Eliantte with a bustdown chain
The way that thing move, girl, that waist chain
I'm lovin' how it bounce like it got sprangs
I know a couple thangs we can exchange
Created the AP, I'm on time, yeah (on time)
And you the only one that outshine it (outshine it)
Don't matter if you dress for the fine dining (fine dining)
Or you inside with your bonnet
I know, yeah, iconic (iconic)
You deserve some princess diamonds (wrist)
You deserve a trip to the islands (yeah)
If we post up, baby, don't comment
You keep it wet, that's a real-life challenge (life challenge)
All that ass gotta pour out of gallon (yeah)
Beauty, get on top, keep balance (balance)
Ooh, she in her bag, ooh, she wildin' (yeah)
You ain't gotta hide your talent (talent)
Even if you did, I bet I'll find it (yeah)
You know I'm come from the H
But it's plus two-seven when I dial in

Make me sweat (sweat, s-sweat)
Make me lose my breath (breath, my breath)
Make me sweat (sweat, sweat, sweat)
Make me lose my breath (breath, it's lit)
(Make me sweat)

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat (sweat)
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water

Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
Make me sweat
Make me hotter
Make me lose my breath
Make me water
