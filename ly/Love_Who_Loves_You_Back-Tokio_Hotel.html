		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's underneath the moon and stars
What's underneath our closed sweet heart
Hidin' what we wanna share
Take my hand, I'll take you there

There's a call on you while
There's a snake in your bed
And it's telling you something (it says)
Yeah I like it like that
When you're feeling lonely
Go help yourself
Do whatever you desire

Go throw your arrows
Hit her heart
If they don't feel right
Love who loves you back
The perfect storm
What turns you on?
You can have all that
Love who loves you back

Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back

What's real we have to scream to see
Leaning closer next to me
Count to three and lose control
If you like it let me know

There's a call on you while
There's a snake in your bed
And it's telling you something (it says)
Yeah I like it like that
When you're feeling lonely
Go help yourself
Do whatever you desire

Go throw your arrows
Hit her heart
If they don't feel right
Love who loves you back
The perfect storm
What turns you on?
You can have all that
Love who loves you back

Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
Turn me on, turn me on

Some are small, some are tall
Some are born with it all
Some are in it for the kill
Some just do it for the thrill
Archers aim your perfect mark and throw

Throw your arrows
Hit her heart
If they don't feel right
Love who loves you back
The perfect storm
What turns you on?
You can have all that
Love who loves you back

Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
Turn me on, turn me on
Love who loves you back
