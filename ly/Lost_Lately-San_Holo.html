		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tried, but it don't feel right
Can't erase you from my mind
I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling lost lately
Wake up in the bright sunlight
Why do I feel numb inside
I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling lost lately, yeah

I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling, I've been feeling lost lately

I've been feeling lost lately

I tried, but it don't feel right (don't feel right)
Can't erase you from my mind (from my mind)
I've been feeling lost lately (lost)
I've been feeling lost lately (lost)
Wake up in the bright sunlight (bright sunlight)
Why do I feel numb inside (so numb)
I've been feeling lost lately (lost)
I've been feeling lost lately, yeah

I tried, but it don't feel right
Can't erase you from my mind
I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling lost lately
Wake up in the bright sunlight
Why do I feel numb inside
I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling lost lately, yeah

I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling, I've been feeling lost lately

I've been feeling lost lately
I've been feeling lost lately

I can't erase you from my mind
Lost lately, yeah
I can't erase you from my mind
I've been feeling lost lately
