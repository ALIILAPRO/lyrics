		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the darkest hour
Right where you told me to be
You call me out on the waters
You say walk with me

This storm is clouding my vision
I hear the rage of the sea
I see you out in the distanceÂ 
Your eyes fixed on me

I'll keep my eyes fixed on you
Because I know what you say is always true
Your word is my vision when I cannot see
Your voice is the Compass that's guiding me

My fear is all but forgotten
I'm walking forward in faith
Nothing is holding me back now
I'm running your way

I'll keep my eyes fixed on you
Because I know what you say is always true
Your word is my vision when I cannot see
Your voice is the Compass that's guiding me

And if you said it, I believe it
And if you said it, it is done
Your promise will never fail me
To your promise, I'm holding on

I'll keep my eyes fixed on you
Because I know what you say is always true
Your word is my vision when I cannot see
Your voice is the Compass that's guiding me

And if you said it, I believe it
And if you said it, it is done
Your promise will never fail me
To your promise, I'm holding on
To your promise, I'm holding on

I'll keep my eyes fixed on you
Because I know what you say is always true
Your word is my vision when I cannot see
Your voice is the Compass that's guiding me
