		  I Love the Stars

I love the night, I love the mystery,
I love to gaze into infinity.
Little lights that lead as far as I can see.
I love the way they seem to wink at me
I love to think about a possibility 
Of a world where you care for me.

I love the stars
Jâ€™adore les etoiles
I love to make believe the universe is ours
I love the stars
Jâ€™adore les etoiles
I believe that somewhere out there,
You and I make love together
On and on and on 
I love the stars.
I love the way they shine, I love the fantasy,
I love to stare into eternity.
Let my mind become a wave upon the sea.
And then I race across the galaxy,
Far away beyond reality,
To a world where you care for me.

I love the stars
Jâ€™adore les etoiles
I love to make believe the universe is ours
I love the stars
Jâ€™adore les etoiles
I believe that somewhere out there,
You and I make love together
On and on and on 
I love the stars.

Someday weâ€™ll be together baby,
The Sun and the Moon, and the stars will align.
Somebody up there loves us baby,
Cause itâ€™s written in the stars that shine.

I love the stars
Jâ€™adore les etoiles
I love to make believe the universe is ours
I love the stars
Jâ€™adore les etoiles
Long ago, you will be mine.
Iâ€™ve loved you since the end of time.
Yeah on and on and on
I love the stars.
Yeah on and on and on
I love the stars.
