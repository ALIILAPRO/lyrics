		  (Rain)
(Rain)
(Rain on me Lord, rain)
(Rain on me Lord, rain)
Holy Spirit, I need you to rain (rain)
Wash away them dirty ways and make them fade away (rain)
I need you to (rain on me Lord, rain) I need you to (rain on me Lord, rain)
Yeah
I need your love, need your ways, need your spirit
Make me change all them ways that I'm living
Lord knows I wanna change for the better
Lord knows I'm far away, I'm getting dizzy
Lord knows I'm far away, I'm tired of sinning
Lies, fornication, porn, lustful thinking
I need you to (rain on me Lord, rain)
Holy Spirit, I need you to rain, (rain)
Wash away them dirty stains and make them fade away, (rain)
I need you to (rain on me Lord, rain)
I need you to rain on me Lord, (rain)
Holy Spirit, I need you to rain, (rain)
Wash away them dirty ways and make them fade away, (rain)
I need you to rain on me yeah, (rain)
Yeah I need you to rain on me Lord, (rain)
Yeah
Don't even let me promise that I'll never fall again
Activate my power over all these demons
That got me slaved to the things I desire
It only move me even closer to the fire
Auction up for all my wrongs, you're the buyer
And paid the price for all my sin and I admire
One day I wanna sing in your holy choir
Holy Spirit, I need you to rain
Wash away them dirty stains and make them fade away
Wash away them dirty ways and make them fade away
Wash away my tears and tell me it's gon' be okay
Wash away my past oh Lord and make me new today
I need you to rain on me Lord
Yeah, we need your rain, (rain)
Wash away our dirty stains and make them fade away, (rain)
Yeah, (rain on me Lord, rain)
We need you (rain on me Lord rain) yeah
Holy Spirit, we need you to rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, rain
I need you to rain on me Lord, (rain)
I need you to (rain on me Lord, rain)
