		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold my breath
Say a little prayer
As he strokes my hair
I get scared
When he's always there
To pull out my chair
It's not hard to see
That he's into me
But he's onto me
'Cus I'll get a fright
When he says goodnight
And turns off the light

I think he's trying to kill me
There's always something in his eyes
I caught him playing with matches
I see him sharpening his knives
So if I'm missing tomorrow
If you hear my mother cry
Don't say I didn't warn you
'Cus there's something inside that guy
That keeps me up at night

Come in carefully
When he's fast asleep
So he won't hear me
Laying in the dark
Does he bite or bark
Would he leave a mark
But I feel complete
When he's near to me
'Cus he keeps me sweet
So I don't know why
Even though I try
I don't trust this guy

I think he's trying to kill me
There's always something in his eyes
I caught him playing with matches
I see him sharpening his knives
So if I'm missing tomorrow
If you hear my daddy cry
Don't say I didn't warn you
'Cus there's something inside that guy
That keeps me up at night

He wakes up in the night
And walks outside without his shoes
I watch him from the window
As he looks up at the moon
A stranger in the grounds tonight
So beautiful and blue
And then he'll come back to me
And whisper 'Baby
I love you'

I think he's trying to kill me
There's always something in his eyes
I caught him playing with matches
I see him sharpening his knives
So if I'm missing tomorrow
If you hear my daddy cry
Don't say I didn't warn you
'Cus there's something inside that guy
That keeps me up at night
