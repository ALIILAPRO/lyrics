		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With every breath (every breath)
When the compass is not aligned (when the compass is not aligned)
With every step (every step, with every step)
In the darkest hours when hope is drifting away (hope is drifting away)
(When hope is drifting away)

Reach for the sky (reach for the sky, reach for the sky)
And leave nothing as it seems
Close your eyes
And follow your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams

Close your eyes (close your eyes, close your eyes)
And follow your dreams (follow your dreams, follow your dreams)

With every breath (with every breath, every breath)
When the compass is not aligned (when the compass is not aligned)
With every step (every step, with every step)
In the darkest hours when hope is drifting away (hope is drifting away)
(When hope is drifting away)

Reach for the sky
And leave nothing as it seems
Close your eyes
And follow your dreams
Your dreams, your dreams

Reach for the sky
And leave nothing as it seems
Close your eyes
And follow your dreams
