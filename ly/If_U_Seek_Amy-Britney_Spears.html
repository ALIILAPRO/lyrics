		  La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la

Oh, baby, baby, have you seen Amy tonight?
Is she in the bathroom, is she smokin' up outside? (Oh)
Oh baby, baby, does she take a piece of lime
For the drink that I'ma buy her? 
Do you know just what she likes? (Oh)

Oh, oh
Tell me have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so (oh)
I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can't somebody take me home?
Haha, hehe, haha, ho

Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me
But can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

(Love me, hate me) la, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la

Amy told me that she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when and now they're closin' up the club (oh)
I've seen her once or twice before, she knows my face
But it's hard to see with all the people standin' in the way (oh)

Oh, oh
Tell me have you seen her? 'Cause I'm so (oh)
I can't get her off of my brain
I just wanna go to the party she gon' go
Can't somebody take me home?
Haha, hehe, haha, ho

Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me
But can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

(Love me, hate me) oh, say what you want about me
Oh, but can't you see what I see?
(Love me, hate me) yeah, say what you want about me
(La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la)

So tell me if you see her
(Let me know what she was wearing and what she was like)
'Cause I've been waiting here forever
(Let me know where she was going, I don't mind)
Oh, baby, baby, if you seek Amy tonight (oh)
Oh, baby, baby, we'll do whatever you'll like
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby

La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la

Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me
But can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

Love me, hate me
Say what you want about me (yeah)
(La, la, la, la-la, la, la, la) yeah

Love me, hate me
But can't you see what I see?
All of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy

(Love me, hate me) oh, say what you want about me
Oh, but can't you see what I see?
(Love me, hate me) yeah, say what you want about me

All of the boys and all of the girls
Are begging to if you seek Amy
