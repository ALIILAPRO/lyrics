		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what your spirit says 
Show me what you pray 
Teach me every single thing 
I'll be your guide 
You are a prisoner 
Looking for to be
You can change your face 
But can't change your mind 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 

Tell me what your spirit says 
Show me what you pray 
Teach me every single thing 
I'll be your guide 
You are a prisoner 
Looking for to be
You can change your face 
But can't change your mind 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
Tell me what your spirit says 
Show me what you pray 
Teach me every single thing 
I'll be your guide 
You are a prisoner 
Looking for to be 
You can change your face 
But can't change your mind 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 

Tell me what your spirit says 
Show me what you pray 
Teach me every single thing 
I'll be your guide 
You are a prisoner 
Looking for to be
You can change your face 
But can't change your mind 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 

Tell me what your spirit says 
Show me what you pray 
Teach me every single thing 
I'll be your guide 
You are a prisoner 
Looking for to be
You can change your face 
But can't change your mind 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do 
No matter what you do
