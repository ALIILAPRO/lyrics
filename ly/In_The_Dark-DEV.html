		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On my waist, through my hair.
Think about it when you touch me there
Close my eyes, here you are all alone dancing in the dark.

Tell me baby if it's wrong
To let my hands do what they want?
Late at night I pretend we are
Dance dance dancing in the dark

Dancing in the dark
Oh la la oh la la oh la la
Dancing in the dark

When you work on me,
Open my body up and do some surgery,
Now that you got me up I wanna taste it taste it
And see those pocket aces.
I wanna see who you are.

I got a sex drive to push the start
I got a sex drive to push the start
I got a sex drive to push the start

On my waist, through my hair.
Think about it when you touch me there.
Close my eyes, here you are
Dance dance dancing in the dark!

Oh la la oh la la oh la la
Dancing in the dark
Oh la la oh la la oh la la
Dancing in the dark

I love to flirt to see.
I'm only talking to you if you wanna surf my seas.
Now that you got me boy
You know you better spice it flavor it get it right; savor it

Wanna see who you are,
Got a sex drive to push the start
I got a sex drive to push the start
I got a sex drive to push the start

On my waist, through my hair.
Think about it when you touch me there.
Close my eyes, here you are (here you are)
All alone dancing in the dark.

Tell me baby if its wrong?
To let my hands do what they want.
Late at night I pretend we are

Dance dance dancing in the dark
(oh la la)

Tell me baby if its wrong
Dancing in the dark
To let my hands do what they want.
Dancing in the dark! (it's the Cataracs)
Oh la la oh la la oh la la
Dancing in the dark
Oh la la oh la la oh la la
Dancing in the dark
