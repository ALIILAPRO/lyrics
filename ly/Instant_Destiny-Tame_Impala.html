		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami
Go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm

This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright, quite alright, sittin' here
Yes, reminiscent, I think this is different
I know this is different
Let's cause somethin' permanent
Just so we know we can

I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say, "And here comes forever"
Oh, here forever
Let go of me with open arms

We'll be lovers
Until the end of time
I see it now
I see just how you're so right
It's so clear now

I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami
Go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm

Let's drink this magic potion
Of love and devotion
And then let's see how it goes
