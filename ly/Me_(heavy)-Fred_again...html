		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you feel like talking?
I feel like being open
I feel my thoughts running 'round each evening
But I'm glad I'm feeling
I wanna run in there and steal you out
Unplug the wires and kiss your mouth
You don't need another whiteboard evening
But I need you breathing

Before my needs, oh
She's all I need
It won't be long
And I know you're holding on
I'm so tired of being strong

But I don't want you to see this face
It's time to be brave
So I pray for the same thing each evening
My baby's healing

Before my needs, oh
She's all I need
I know you're holding on
And it won't be long
I'm so tired of being strong

I found you exploding
I found you beautiful
I don't know a thing that could feel more heavy
Babe, I'm ready
