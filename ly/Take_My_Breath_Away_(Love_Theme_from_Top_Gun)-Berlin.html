		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching every motion
In my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn around and say

"Take my breath away
Take my breath away"

Watching, I keep waiting
Still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones
Turning and returning
To some secret place to hide
Watching in slow motion
As you turn to me and say

"My love, take my breath away"

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
"If only for today
I am unafraid"

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watching every motion
In this foolish lover's game
Haunted by the notion
Somewhere there's a love in flames
Turning and returning
To some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion
As you turn my way and say

"Take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love, take my breath away
My love
My love, take my breath away
My love"
