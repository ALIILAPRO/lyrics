		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you fall quiet 'cause I'm in the mud?
Is your heart violent 'cause it got a cut?

I've been carving your name on the walls of my brain
You say it's my fault 'cause I call you late

Is it reciprocated?
I can never get you out my head
Is it okay that you're fucking with me once again?
Is it reciprocated?
I can never get you out my head, hea-head, yeah (yeah)

Will you ever let me sleep all night?
Will you ever let me sleep?
Circling life like it's a fishbowl
Playing with fire
Feel like we're on a roll
I was running my hands through your hair yesterday
I know it's your fault 'cause you didn't stay

Is it reciprocated?
I can never get you out my head
Is it okay that you're fucking with me once again?
Is it reciprocated?
I can never get you out my head, hea-head (yeah)

Is it reciprocated?
I can never get you out my head
Is it okay that you're fucking with me once again?
Is it reciprocated?
I can never get you out my head, hea-head, yeah
