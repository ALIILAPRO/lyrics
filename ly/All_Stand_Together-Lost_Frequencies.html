		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And if we all stand together, we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
And if we all stand together, we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam

(Oh-oh, oh-ooh) One by one
(Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh) One by one
All together, all together
(Oh-oh, oh-ooh) One by one
(Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh) One by one
All together, all together

What if all this world is in a dream
And real is just behind the door?
So if everything is energy
Then, baby, all I have is yours
Does not matter what you take from me
Well, I know you need it more

So I give it up (so I give it up)
And it raises up (and it raises up)
One by one (one by one)

And if we all stand together, we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
And if we all stand together, we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam

(Oh-oh, oh-ooh) One by one
(Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh) One by one
All together (all together), all together
(Oh-oh, oh-ooh) One by one
(Oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh-ooh) One by one
All together (all together), all together

What if all this is a memory?
What if we've been here before?
Understanding gives us empathy
Like a voyage to the shore
And after everything you've given me
I'm not hurting anymore

So I give it up (so I give it up)
And it raises up (and it raises up)
One by one

And if we all stand together, we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
And if we all stand together, we can't fall
Not if we all hold each other as we roam
