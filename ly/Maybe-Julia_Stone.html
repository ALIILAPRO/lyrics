		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's got this kind of love
Why don't we let her know
She's got this kind of hope
Why don't we let her know

Maybe she got what she came for
Laying naked on the pine floor
Lonely we dance around the dying
Maybe she got what she came for
Lying naked on the pine floor 
Lonely we dance around the dying
Maybe she got what she came for

Don't be scared I'm not here 
For your heart
Don't be scared I'm not here 
For your reasons
Don't be scared I'm just here for
The radio that plays in the background
While you're asking me to go
