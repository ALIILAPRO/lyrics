		<p>
		  Yeah, what up, nigga?
I don't think so
I don't really think so, nigga
I don't think so 'bout that shit

You gon' fuck my bitch? 
I don't think so, nigga, huh (I don't think so, nigga)
I don't think so, I don't think so 
I don't think so, I don't think so (yeah), no, no

Ride with my shawty, she blowing my high (shut up, bitch)
I don't give a fuck about you, nigga, die (shh)
Show no fear, lil' nigga, I don't cry (don't cry)
Weak ass boy, they gon' die every time (fuck you, nigga)
I don't wanna talk to no therapist, boy (what?)
Take it on the chin, I'm a real-ass man (haha)
I don't give a fuck about you, nigga, damn
You a bitch-ass nigga, I'm a bully (bitch)

Ride around with my TEC and a skully
I'ma do it like I'm Nike (do it, let's do it, man)
Come and fight me (huh), you a pussy (pussy)
They gon' take it, they gon' bite me
And I do what I do 'cause I know 
That these niggas not gon' do nothing for me, bro (they ain't gon' do nothing for me)
And this life that I live and the way that I move, gotta get out my way 'cause it's cold
Gotta keep that shit on me, it's a pole (keep that shit, nigga)
Shh, I can hear the cops comin' (where?)
Don't you know that they comin' (they comin')
Don't you know that these niggas, they runnin'? (Let's go)
Slide around in my G-Wag', lil' nigga
S550, all black, lil' nigga
Bulletproof window can't crack, lil' nigga
Jansport bag on my back, lil' bitch (bitch)
So many racks, I don't know what to do
Buy me a Porsche and my brother one, too
How can I lose when I'm already winnin'? (yeah)
How can I lose when I'm already winnin'? 

You gon' fuck my bitch? 
I don't think so, nigga, huh (I don't think so, nigga)
I don't think so, I don't think so 
I don't think so, I don't think so (yeah), no, no
You gon' fuck my bitch? 
I don't think so, nigga, huh (I don't think so, nigga)
I don't think so, I don't think so 
I don't think so, I don't think so (yeah), no, no

Ride with my shawty, she blowing my high (shut up, bitch)
I don't give a fuck about you, nigga, die (shh)
Show no fear, lil' nigga, I don't cry (don't cry)
Weak ass boy, they gon' die every time (fuck you, nigga)
I don't wanna talk to no therapist, boy (what?)
Take it on the chin, I'm a real ass man (haha)
I don't give a fuck about you, nigga, damn
You a bitch-ass nigga, I'm a bully (bitch)
