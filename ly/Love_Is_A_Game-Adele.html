		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely you know, that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

How unbelievable (unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell? (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell? (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (and unbearable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love, can keep me satisfied (satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise

Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

I can love, I can love again
I love me now, like I love him
I'm a fool for that
You know I, you know I'm gonna do it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'd do it all again like I did it
