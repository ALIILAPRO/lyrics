		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch 
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (bust)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (pop)
Where you dey go, go? We dey go up
Catch my vibe (vibe), let me go off (off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Aight yo, put the Belaire on her batty, make it kotch
Seen the watch, now she wanna give crotch
Boy got Ps, now she hopping in the pod
Man in real life sugar, gyaldem haffi get wopped (yeah)
Know she want dark, told her, "Meet me at the top"
Switching lanes the other day, I seen her waiting for a bus
Baby, this a Moncler sweater, Diesel denim
Buy another when my pockets fat like Heather
Neck froze like I don't know no better
Benzo truck, white seats and they leather
Go broke never, on my grind
She make it clap like I'm Busta Rhymes
I got the juice, the sauce and all them things
I blammed her twice tonight with all my bling
Big Benz, I drive, I brought that ting
Any girl you want, they want my ting

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch (hey)
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (bust)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust (lose trust)
White rum, fizzy pop (pop)
Where you dey go, go? We dey go up
Catch my vibe (vibe), let me go off (off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Flood my ice, make a ho blush
Back at the tour bus, gettin' caught up
DSquared, got 'em distressed, got a hand wash
New racks with the old Nikes in the shoe box
Keep my stripes, no cuffs
Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupe, that's her head loss
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mom, while you twiddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get bun, where I'm from, it's on
Yes, man don't take no dumb, threats
They see funds, they hop, fence
We been up, not up next

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch (hey)
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (bust)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust (lose trust)
White rum, fizzy pop (pop)
Where you dey go, go? We dey go up
Catch my vibe (vibe), let me go off (off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

And introducing
The one and only

Big truck, no clutch (clutch)
Wrist froze, don't touch
French Ciri, I'm so drunk (turnt)
Course I can't drink and drive, where's my chauffeur?
Bando upsuh, whip that coca
I really hope this time my worker don't floss
See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you're down, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback, when you blow up?
I forgot my jacket, but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up
It's ironic, 'cause they sold out my show in Scotland
Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map
But one day I'ma change the map in Tottenham

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch (hey)
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (bust)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust (lose trust)
White rum, fizzy pop (pop)
Where you dey go, go? We dey go up
Catch my vibe (vibe), let me go off (off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough
