		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something that I'm searching
Been searching for
I'm searching
Something that I'm searching

Been searching for the one, I don't know if it's real
They tell me when I stop, is when it starts to appear
How long do I wait, is it a day or a year
And when I know you out there, how could I wait right here
Aye, hurry girl, I'm already waiting
Streets is cold, I'm staying in today
Destiny is already written
Chance with you is all that I pray

I'm running out of patience
Bouta search through the nations
Cause these shorties in the club
Who be looking for a dub, they're nothing but temptations
You the one, you the one, you the one
Look up at the sky, you the moon to my sun
And when we locked in, I would never run
Sticking by your side, til my O2 is done
I just haven't met you yet
I don't care if you're rich or been in debt
I won't let them get between us two
Like Bruno said, they got nothing on you
Aye, nothing on you
Nothing on you

Been searching for the one, I don't know if it's real
They tell me when I stop, is when it starts to appear
How long do I wait, is it a day or a year
And when I know you out there, how could I wait right here
Aye, hurry girl, I'm already waiting
Streets is cold, I'm staying in today
Destiny is already written
Chance with you is all that I pray

Searching for someone to call my own
Searching for the one to come on home
The balance in my life, the yin to my yang
Two hopeless romantics, we one in the same
Been searching for the one
Getting tired, think I'm done
Is there really anyone out there for me
Who's meant for me
Oh oh
In the club, feel like I don't belong
Just took a shot, I'm leaving after this song
Tell someone that you're looking for commitment now
They look at you like you said something wrong
Yeah, but still I'm
Searching for the one, even when it gets tough
Hoping one day I would be enough
Someone who won't leave me high and dry
And just see you later, never goodbye

I'm searching
Been searching for
I'm searching
Been searching for
I'm searching, I'm searching for
Been searching for, searching for
I'm searching, searching for
Searching for

So where you at and where you wanna be
Quit wasting time and come on down to me
Girl, you know that you belong to me
