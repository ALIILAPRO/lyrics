		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So close your eyes
It's only a dream
When you wake up
Rinse off all this pain
And your makeup
Stare into the mirror
Apples are always something to fear

Are you alright?
'Cause I'm not okay
All of these lies
Are not worth fighting for
Are you alright?
'Cause I'm not okay
All of these lies
Are not worth fighting for

I am a needle
Dig in your grooves
Scratch you up
Then I'll put you away
I am a needle
Dig in your grooves
Scratch you up
Then I'll put you away

It won't be death
But a deep sleep
A curse of a hundred years
The princess will fall (the princess will fall)
The princess will fall
The princess will fall into a slumber for a century

Are you alright?
'Cause I'm not okay
All of these lies
Are not worth fighting for
Are you alright?
'Cause I'm not okay
All of these lies
Are not worth fighting for
(Not worth fighting for)
(Fighting for)
(Fighting for)

I am a needle
Dig in your grooves
Scratch you up
Then I'll put you away
I am a needle
Dig in your grooves
Scratch you up
Then I'll put you away

I'll never ever play you again
I'll never ever play you again
I'll never ever play you again
Then I'll put you away
I'll never ever play you again
Then I'll put you away
I'll never ever play you again
Then I'll put you away
I'll never ever play you again
Then I'll put you away
I'll never ever play you again
Then I'll put you away
I'll never ever play you again
Then I'll put you away
Then I'll put you away
Then I'll put you away
I'll never ever play you again
