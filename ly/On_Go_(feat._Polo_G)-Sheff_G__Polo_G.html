		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Glocks and the beams with me (Great John beats, baby)
Look, look
(Great John on the beat by the way)

Tell 'em, "Bust a move," got them things with a nigga
Glocks and the beams with me
I get bready now she wanna hang with a nigga
Tryna bring all her friends with me, like, huh
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go

Shawty a baddie (shawty a baddie)
So tell her, "Come dance on me like that"
I'm tryna take her home and break her back
I'm in the spot, I'm throwin' all the racks
But you know I spend it, get it right, hold on
You know I spend it, get it right back
Call up Great John, get a nigga boomed
And it's R.I.P. Pop, we gon' shake the room
I catch a hater, heater to his face
I bet you it'll be another cold case
Bottles and models, we gon' get it litty
They love when it's Winner's Circle in the city
I got the coupe for the AMG
Don't tell me slow down, knowin' I'ma speed
Don't tell me slow down, knowin' this a race
We ballin', these hoes always just a waste
Tell 'em, "Fuck the opps," done hit a few
Stackin' money like a Jew
And I'm who these niggas wanna be
And I'm a gangsta, you a wannabe
Ayy, Glock chillin' in my draws
I up it and bust it, we don't fear the law
Steady screamin', "Free my dawgs," like a leash missin', man
Look, niggas know we cause damage
(Bring them chops out, bring them chops out)
.40 Glock curse, no manners (clear the block out, clear the block out)
Louis with me, no designer
Got the ladder with 'em, ain't no climber (climber, ayy)
Bitches lovin' my persona
Know I make it hot just like a sauna

Tell 'em, "Bust a move," got them things with a nigga
Glocks and the beams with me
I get bready and now she wanna hang with a nigga
Tryna bring all her friends with me, like, huh
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
Tell 'em, "Bust a move," got them things with a nigga
Glocks and the beams with me
I get bready and now she wanna hang with a nigga
Tryna bring all her friends with me, like, huh
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go

They know the gang always on go
Fuck it, let's turn up some more
Uh, only close range shots when I blow
Fuck it, we uppin' the score
I told my shorty make brains drop on the floor
Lil' nigga shoot like a pro
Hit up my jeweler, new chain, cop, I'm on froze
Clutch if he gettin' too close
With some hitters from Chiraq to Brooklyn
He run up, .30 clap, leave him cookin'
Hit his top 'til his linin' look crooked
On my body, designer, she lookin'
Uh, she know that I'm different
And it ain't hard to notice we winnin'
Feel like I ain't been broke in a minute
All my demons just wanna keep spinnin' 

Tell 'em, "Bust a move," got them things with a nigga
Glocks and the beams with me
I get bready and now she wanna hang with a nigga
Tryna bring all her friends with me, like, huh
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
Tell 'em, "Bust a move," got them things with a nigga
Glocks and the beams with me
I get bready and now she wanna hang with a nigga
Tryna bring all her friends with me, like, huh
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
They know the gang always on, huh
They know the gang always on go
