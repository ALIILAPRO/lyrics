		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got what you need
Baby, just come see me
I got the remedy, take the pain away
Easy as one, two, three
You know I got what you need
I got the recipe, take the pain away

If you're ever feelin' low
You could come and say hello
I got what you need
Baby, just come see me
I got the remedy, take the pain away

If you're ever feelin' low
You can come and say hello
We all just want some better days and tomorrows
Better days and tomorrows
We all just want some purple greens and blue yellows
Fireworks will make it come
We all just want some better days and tomorrows
Better days and tomorrows
We all just want some

Got a place to go
You could just call me home
No need to be alone today
Easy as do, re, mi
You know you can count on me
Give all your cares to me, take the pain away

If you're ever feelin' low
You could come and say hello
I got what you need
Baby, just come see me
I got the remedy, take the pain away

If you're ever feelin' low (if you're ever feelin' low)
You can come and say hello
We all just want some better days and tomorrows (better days and tomorrows)
Better days and tomorrows
We all just want some purple greens and blue yellows
Fireworks will make it come
We all just want some better days and tomorrows (better days and tomorrows)
Better days and tomorrows
We all just want some

Let me be your medicine tonight, tonight
So I can make your body feel alright
I got what you need, yeah

If you're ever feelin' low (if you're ever feelin' low)
You can come and say hello
We all just want some better days and tomorrows (better days and tomorrows)
Better days and tomorrows
We all just want some purple greens and blue yellows (ah, ah)
Fireworks will make it come
We all just want some better days and tomorrows (better days and tomorrows)
Better days and tomorrows
We all just want some
