		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Like a flower waiting to bloom
Like a light bulb in a dark room
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

Like the desert waiting for the rain
Like a school kid waiting for the spring
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on

And my poor heart, it's been so dark
Since you've been gone
After all, you're the one who turns me off
But you're the only one who can turn me back on

My hi-fi is waiting for a new tune
My glass is waiting for some fresh ice cubes
I'm just sittin' here waiting for you
To come on home and turn me on, turn me on
