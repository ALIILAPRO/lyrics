		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, oh
Yeah! 14, 14, baby, yeah
Every time I bring them racks, baby
While we eatin', spend that bag, the whole bag, baby, I

Ooh, ayy I just got a new Porsche (I just got a new Porsche)
Rocket got a 'Rari, that's a new horse (that's a mothafuckin' new horse)
Smoke a pussy nigga like a Newport (smoke a nigga like a Newport)
Ayy, yeah, what's your net worth? (yeah, what's your net worth?)
Yeah, pussy boy, what's your net worth? (what's your mothafuckin' net worth?)
Diamonds 'round my neck like what my neck worth (what's your mothafuckin' net worth?)
Yeah, bitch it's bust down (bust down, bust down, ayy)

My wrist is bust down, it's bust down (bust down)
'Bout to get my Apple Watch bust down, it's bust down, yeah (bust down)
Lil' bitch come through bust down, she bust down (bust down)
I don't give two fucks now, no fucks now, no (bust down)

Rollin' 'round with a bad bitch (with a bad bitch)
Yeah, Trippie Redd, I went and copped a bag, bitch
Yeah, spend that money, make it right back, bitch (make it right back, bitch)
Big ballin', yeah, that's a habit (that's a mothafuckin' habit)
Ooh, in expensive fuckin' fabric
Stay saucin' on you, that's a habit
If I like it, cop it, I'ma have it (I'ma mothafuckin' have it)
Yeah, steady causin' havoc
Ooh, makin' money, boy, you's a savage
Mama raised a mothafuckin' savage (that's a mothafuckin' savage)
Ooh the streets raised a mothafuckin' savage
And the industry made me a brand new savage, yeah

Ooh, ayy I just got a new Porsche (I just got a new Porsche)
Rocket got a 'Rari, that's a new horse (that's a mothafuckin' new horse)
Smoke a pussy nigga like a Newport (smoke a nigga like a Newport)
Ayy, yeah, what's your net worth? (yeah, what's your net worth?)
Yeah, pussy boy, what's your net worth? (what's your mothafuckin' net worth?)
Diamonds 'round my neck like what my neck worth (what's your mothafuckin' net worth?)
Yeah, bitch it's bust down (bust down, bust down, ayy)

My wrist is bust down, it's bust down (bust down)
'Bout to get my Apple Watch bust down, it's bust down, yeah (bust down)
Lil' bitch come through bust down, she bust down (bust down)
I don't give two fucks now, no fucks now, no (bust down)

Bitch, this how you live when you popin'
Ballin' on you suckers, had no option
Fuckin' on a mothafuckin' thottie
That's a mothafuckin' new body
It ain't nobody, ain't nobody
Swear it ain't no ho up in my body
Tatted up, 14 all on my body
Yeah, boolin' with a bitch named Armani
Yeah, ayy, just saucin' and boolin'
I'm just foolin', I'm all in
I got big racks, a lot to spend, yeah

Ooh, ayy I just got a new Porsche (I just got a new Porsche)
Rocket got a 'Rari, that's a new horse (that's a mothafuckin' new horse)
Smoke a pussy nigga like a Newport (smoke a nigga like a Newport)
Ayy, yeah, what's your net worth? (yeah, what's your net worth?)
Yeah, pussy boy, what's your net worth? (what's your mothafuckin' net worth?)
Diamonds 'round my neck like what my neck worth (what's your mothafuckin' net worth?)
Yeah, bitch it's bust down (bust down, bust down, ayy)

My wrist is bust down, it's bust down (bust down)
'Bout to get my Apple Watch bust down, it's bust down, yeah (bust down)
Lil' bitch come through bust down, she bust down (bust down)
I don't give two fucks now, no fucks now, no (bust down)

Give a love letter to you, baby
Had to give you two, baby
If you ain't heard then you're too late
Yeah, fresh and clean like toothpaste
Yeah, love letter to you is too great
