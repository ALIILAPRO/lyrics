		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My mom says trust your gut but I think mine's broken
'Cause I could swear that we were meant to be
Standing on your doorstep, now I'm frozen
How are these the words you're telling me?

Now I'm all alone, I know it too well
And I know it won't help, but I'm telling myself

Maybe next time I'll be enough
You'll give me everything instead of giving up
Maybe next time won't be a waste
You'll be the one and not the one that got away
So, I count down the days 'til I won't have to say

Maybe next time
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Maybe next time
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Don't know why I watch when I know the ending
Wanna skip right to the part, it doesn't hurt
Thinking that night, boarding that flight
With a bruised up heart and a carry on bag
A long lost love that I'll never get back, wanna get it back

Maybe next time I'll be enough
You'll give me everything instead of giving up
Maybe next time won't be a waste
You'll be the one and not the one that got away
So, I count down the days 'til I won't have to say

Maybe next time
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Maybe next time
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Maybe next time I'll be enough
You'll give me everything instead of giving up
And maybe next time won't be a waste
You'll be the one and not the one that got away
So, I count down the days 'til I won't have to say
Oh, I'm counting the days till I won't have to say
"Maybe next time"
