		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side

Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wanna know am I still a slut?
I've got to take it on the other side

A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for the soulmate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever

Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it's born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever had
(How long) I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat, it's all I ever
