		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We watch the city from mine
And you like it that way
Romanticize sayin' bye
You said the timing was right
And I want it that way
I watch you go, it's alright

Four in the morning
Pick a fight just for me
Let's not be lonely, you're on my mind
Four in the morning, sitting on your floor
We hate being lonely and I can see why

I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to
I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to

Told me I had to come by
To see you again
We watch the years take a ride
Forget another goodbye
Now you're goin' again
You like when I roll my eyes

Four in the morning
Pick a fight just for me
Let's not be lonely, you're on my mind
Four in the morning, sitting on your floor
We hate being lonely and I can see why

I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to
I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to

My skin on you and it's sweet
You are the one thing that I need, I need
And I can see why

I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to
I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to

I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to
I think I could use some more of you
I don't know you but I really need to
