		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hate to say "I love you"
That's so cliché
But I'm gonna say it 
Anyway
You push and you pull like (you push and you pull like)
The ocean does (the ocean does)
Cut me with the pieces 
Of your broken love

I try so hard but you put me down
I'm calling out from the underground
You think I give up but I'm not that way
I'm here to stay

I keep falling like the rain
Every time you say my name
When it's driving us insane
Our love is deeper than the pain

Our love is deeper than the
(Our love is deeper than the)
(Our love is deeper than the)

You're so unpredictable, that's what I like
You get in my head so you can fuck with my mind
And nobody else can make me feel so alive
We threw words at each other, they cut like a knife

I hate to say I love you
That's so cliché (that's so cliché)
But I'm gonna say it (but I'm gonna say it)
Anyway

I try so hard but you put me down
I'm calling out from the underground
You think I give up but I'm not that way
I'm here to stay

I keep falling like the rain
Every time you say my name (every time you say my name)
When it's driving us insane
Our love is deeper than the pain

Our love is deeper than the
(Our love is deeper than the)
(Our love is deeper than the)
(Our love is deeper than the)
(Our love is deeper than the)
(Our love is deeper than the pain)
