		  Dance, boogie wonderland
Ha, ha, dance
Boogie wonderland

Midnight creeps so slowly into hearts of men who need more than they get
Daylight deals a bad hand to a woman who has laid too many bets
The mirror stares you in the face and says
"Baby, uh, uh, it don't work"
You say your prayers though you don't care, you dance and shake the hurt

Dance, boogie wonderland
Ha, ha, dance (ooh-hoo, dance)
Boogie wonderland (yeah)

Sound fly through the night
I chase my vinyl dreams to Boogie Wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance (ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance) 
In Boogie Wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, dance)
I find romance when I start to dance (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance) 
In Boogie Wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)

All the love in the world can't be gone
All the need to be loved can't be wrong
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying (oh, ah)
"Boogie wonderland, wonderland" (ha, ah-ah)

Dance, boogie wonderland
Ha, ha, dance (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
Boogie wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
Ha, ha

I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland
I find romance when I start to dance in boogie wonderland

Dance, boogie wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
Ha, ha, dance (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
Boogie wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance)
Ha, ha

Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Wonderland

Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Wonderland

Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm-hmm-hmm

All the love in the world can't be gone (love in the world can't be gone)
All the need to be loved can't be wrong (need to be loved can't be wrong)
All the records are playing and my heart keeps saying (oh-ah)
"Boogie wonderland, wonderland" (oh, whoa, oh, whoa, wonderland, ah)

Dance, boogie wonderland
Ha, ha, dance 
Boogie wonderland 
Ha, ha

I find romance when I start to dance (dance, dance, dance, dance)
In boogie wonderland (dance, dance, dance, ah)
I find romance when I start to dance (dance, dance, dance, dance)
In boogie wonderland (dance, dance, dance, ah)
Dance (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance) (dance, dance, dance)
Boogie wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance) (dance, dance) 
Ha, ha
Dance (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance) (dance, dance, dance)
Boogie wonderland (ooh, ooh, ooh, dance, ooh, ooh, ooh, dance) (dance, dance, dance)
