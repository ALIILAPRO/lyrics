		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for

Oh oh oh oh and she's
Buying a stairway to heaven

There's a sign on the wall
But she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words
Have two meanings in a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misleading
Ooh, makes me wonder ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get
When I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen
Rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who standing looking

And ooh, makes me wonder
And oh ooh, makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon
If we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn
For those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Yes it makes me wonder and oh

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change
The road you're on, on and on
Said ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind

Mother Mary 'n Jozef!

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to know
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The news will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying the stairway to heaven

Ike Willis, Mike Keneally, Walt Fowler
Bruce Fowler, Paul Carmen, albert
Wing, Kurt McGettrick, Chad Wackerman
Ed Mann, Bobby Martin
Scott Thunes good night!
