		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never wanna be old
And I don't want dependence
It's no fun to be told
That you can't blame your parents anymore

I'm finding it hard 
To hang from a star
I don't wanna be
Never wanna be old

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way, I wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way, I wish away each day

I don't really know
If I care what is normal
And I'm not really sure
If the pills I've been taking are helping

I'm wasting my life
Hurting inside
I don't really know
And I'm not really sure

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way, I wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way, I wish away each day

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way, I wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way, I wish away each day

Sullen and bored the kids stay
And in this way, I wish away each day
Stoned in the mall the kids play
And in this way, I wish away each day
