		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's dangerous
To fall in love, but I
Wanna burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us
We're certain with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire
Burn me

So come on, I'll take you on, take you on, I
Ache for love, ache for us, why
Don't you come, don't you come a little closer
So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow
We were meant for one another, come a little closer

Flame you came to me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline

I got all I need
When you came after me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight

And we will fly
Like smoke darkenin' the sky
I'm Eve, I wanna try
Take a bite

So come on now, take the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect somehow
We were meant for one another, come a little closer

Flame you came for me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline

I got all I need
When you came after me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight

But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I gotta get it
When the fire dies, darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left

It's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I gotta get it
When the fire dies, darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left

Flame you came from me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline

I got all I need
When you came after me
Fire meet gasoline
I'm burning alive
And I can barely breathe
When you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline
Burn with me tonight yeah

Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight, eh eh
