		  Mmh, mmh-mhm

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm finding it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognize myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel like that?
Do you like me?
You know mommy doesn't like 
Anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, hang on, um, my fingers are trapped
Like, um, I feel a bit confused 
Why?
I don't know and I feel 
Like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make you go, "Ay, yi, yi"

My little love
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mmh, mmh-mhm

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and, and stuff like that to keep my mind off of it
And I feel like today, I'm home, and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and 
Be in my sweats and stuff like that
But I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot
