		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm walking on the sidewalk
To the rhythm of the drum
Volume is high
Our song is playing on and on

We've called each other lately
Flirted for a while
On my way to a party
And I know you'll be there tonight

I've had a drink too much
But no one here can really jugde
You dancing next to me is all I need
(Is all I need, yeah)

We don't know the words
We're in another universe
But we both know how we feel

But when our song starts blasting the speakers
Bottoms up on all of my breezers
Then there is no one here that can keep us
Apart

We only kiss when we're drunk
And it's in front of everyone
The others are dancing all alone
But we don't care
We're having fun
Yeah we are drunk
Oh, oh

Thought of it for days now
There's some things you should've heard
I really wanna tell you
I wanna yell it to the world, but

I don't know the words
I'm in another universe
I know
How to show
What I feel

But when our song starts blasting the speakers
Bottom's up on all of my breezers
Then there is no one here that can keep us
Apart

(We only kiss when we're drunk)

We only kiss when we're drunk
And it's in front of everyone
The others are dancing all alone
But we don't care
We're having fun
Yeah we are drunk
Oh, oh

Yeah, we are dancing
Up on the table
Tonight
Yeah we are dancing

(I'm dancing with you, baby)

Yeah, we are dancing
Up on the table
Tonight
Yeah we are dancing

(Drunk)
(We only kiss when we're drunk)

We only kiss when we're drunk
We only kiss when we're drunk
We only kiss when we're drunk
We only kiss when we're drunk

(I'm dancing with you baby)

Yeah, we are dancing
Up on the table
Tonight
Yeah we are dancing

(I'm dancing with you, baby)

Yeah, we are dancing
Up on the table
Tonight
Yeah we are dancing

(Kissing when we're drunk, baby)
