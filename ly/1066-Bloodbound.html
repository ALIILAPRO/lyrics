		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, go

An army left the shallow waters
Fjords and mountain ridge
A massive fleet, three hundred ships
We're off to Stamford bridge
It's the last time we embark on a quest
And we'll never sail again

In the memory of our fathers
Who gave their lives away
In the favor of our brothers
I will pray

We were soldiers meant to be
We were rulers of the sea
Travelled east and west and south
We owned the north
Let the dragon steer our ships
We deny the crucifix
At the battle in 1066

King Harald led his waiting army
Took them by surprise
A single axeman held them off
Until they closed his eyes
It's the last time we embark on a quest
And we'll never sail again

In the memory of our fathers
Who gave their lives away
In the favor of our brothers
I will pray

We were soldiers meant to be
We were rulers of the sea
Travelled east and west and south
We owned the north
Let the dragon steer our ships
We deny the crucifix
At the battle in 1066

Yeah
It's the end of an age
And an end of an era
It's our time to go down in history

We were soldiers meant to be
We were rulers of the sea
Travelled east and west and south
We owned the north
Let the dragon steer our ships
We deny the crucifix
At the battle in 1066, yeah
