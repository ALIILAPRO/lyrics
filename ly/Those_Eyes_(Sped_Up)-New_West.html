		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When we're out in a crowd laughing loud 
And nobody knows why
When we're lost at a club getting drunk
And you give me that smile
Going home in the back of a car
And your hand touches mine

When we're done making love and you look up 
And give me those eyes

'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

When you call me at night 
While you're out getting high with your friends 
(High with your friends)
Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
(You've ever said)

'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

When we're done making love 
And you look up and give me those eyes

'Cause all of the small things that you do
Are what remind me why I fell for you
And when we're apart and I'm missing you
I close my eyes and all I see is you
And the small things you do

All the small things you do
