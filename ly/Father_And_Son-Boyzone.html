		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

I was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To become when you've found
Something going on
But take your time, think a lot
Think of everything you've got
For you will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may not

How can I try to explain?
When I do, it turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way, and I know
That I have to go away
I know, I have to go

It's not time to make a change
Just sit down
And take it slowly
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to go through
Find a girl, settle down
If you want, you can marry
Look at me, I am old
But I'm happy

All the times, that I've cried
Keeping all the things I knew inside
And it's hard
But it's harder to ignore it

If they were right, I'd agree
But its them they know, not me 
Now there's a way, and I know that I have to go away 
I know, I have to go
