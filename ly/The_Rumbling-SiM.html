		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rumbling, rumbling, it's coming
Rumbling, rumbling

Beware

Coming for you

All I ever wanted to do was do right things
I never wanted to be the king, I swear
All I ever wanted to do was save your life
I never wanted to grab a knife, I swear

Tearless, fearless 
Burning, burning

You tell me what have I missed
Still wandering in the deep mist

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to

Beware

All I ever wanted to do was know what's out there
I refused to lose without a fight (oh oh yeah, I, oh, oh)
We're just too young, ignorant and innocent
Like kids stay up all night in a tent (oh yeah, I)
How do you see me? (oh yeah, I)
Am I who I used to be?

Beware

Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me
Nobody knows what's inside of me, ah

If I lose it all, slip and fall 
Will you laugh at me?
If I lose it all, lose it all, ah

If I lose it all, slip and fall
I will never look away
If I lose it all, lose it all, lose it all
If I lose it all outside the wall
Live to die another day
I don't want anything
I'm just here to

Beware (rumbling, rumbling, it's coming)
Rumbling, rumbling
Coming for you (rumbling, rumbling, it's coming)
Rumbling, rumbling
