		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Unusual
They say strange fascination, infatuation
A lunatic
Call me what suits your taste, I just wanna taste
And I've always heard it's what's inside that counts

'Cause my insides are red
And yours are too
And the red on my face
Is matching you
And goodness you're bleeding
What a wonderful feeling
You're down and you're pleading
My head is just reeling

The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you

Unfortunate
They say such a shame, I turned out this way
A maniac
Well, yeah, I get manic when I cause a panic
And of course, I'm excited when I see you around

'Cause my insides are red
And yours are too
And the red on my face
Is matching you
And goodness you're bleeding
What a wonderful feeling
You're down and you're pleading
My head is just reeling

The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you

You leave me high and dry
A rush comes to my mind at the drops
Of blood you leave behind
Run as you might, my love will never, ever
Stop

And I've always heard it's what's inside

'Cause my insides are red
And yours are too
And the red on my face
Is matching you
And goodness you're bleeding
What a wonderful feeling
You're down and you're pleading
My head is just reeling

The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you

The red means I love you
Tasting your blood means I love you
The red means I love you
The red means I love you
