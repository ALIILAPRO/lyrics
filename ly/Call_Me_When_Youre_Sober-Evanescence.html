		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind

Should I let you fall, lose it all
So maybe you can remember yourself?
Can't keep believing
We're only deceiving ourselves
And I'm sick of the lie
And you're too late

Don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind

Couldn't take the blame, sick with shame
Must be exhausting to lose your own game, selfishly hated
No wonder you're jaded
You can't play the victim this time
And you're too late

So don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
You want me, come find me
Make up your mind

You never call me when you're sober
You only want it 'cause it's over, it's over

How could I have burned paradise?
How could I?
You were never mine

So don't cry to me, if you loved me
You would be here with me
Don't lie to me, just get your things
I've made up your mind
