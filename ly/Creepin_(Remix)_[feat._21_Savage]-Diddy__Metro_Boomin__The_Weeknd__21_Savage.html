		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Thought you'd never leave me
(Just can't believe this, man)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)
Bad Boy

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissin' wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know (ayo, come on)

They ain't real then they ain't Puff
Ain't a place in this world that my feet ain't touch
I got visions that cost millions and make billions
Baby girl, we can make love and make trillions, damn
Baby, you my curse and my crush
I walk to the ends of the Earth for your touch
Ride for you, cry for you, die for you
Never gon' say "Goodbye" to you
Never lie to you, life ain't perfect, we just live it
Fuck what they say we did, we just did it
I'm the DeLe√≥n sipper, bad bitch getter
With the top down screamin' out, "Fuck them niggas"

I don't wanna know
Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me? (Yeah)
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby, all that I can say (all that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing (hey)
And don't come back to me (come on)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Whoa, whoa, whoa
(Yeah, 21) 21
Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct (come on)
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link? (Come on)
Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers (yeah)
Girl, you used to ride in the rinky dink (come on)
I'm the one put you in Eliantte (on God)
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway (on God)
You was rockin' Coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'
Side bitch in Frisco, I call her my Bay-bae (21)
I got a girl but I still feel alone (on God)
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home (on God)
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone (21)
Can't even record, you got me out my zone

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low (Metro Boomin)
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore (21)
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show (The Weeknd)
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know (Bad Boy)

If you creepin', just don't let me find out (on God)
Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house (on God) (let's go)
If you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me
