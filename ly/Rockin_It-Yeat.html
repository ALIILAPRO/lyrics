		  Rockin it, rockin it rockin it

I’m in the hill with a fast car, a nascar
I need some pills, applying the pressure
Okay this shit got real, you not in the field
I got me a bag, some cash, some bills
I couldn’t answer the- yeah
They call me later
You find the answer, the questions
I don’t really know if I love her or hate her
I’m slow, 2 pills, oh gone
Who knows, love kills
I won’t love on this bitch
Yeah I’m bouta bone i’m never wrong
Rip off a throne
Stop calling my phone, calling my phone
I’m in my zone, smoking on weed, strong
I’m extravagant, what is happening?
Why I’m rapping this?
She a, I ain't rappin' it
We fuck off the molly
I got some more in supply
I’m not crashing yet
She sucking my blood, call her Count Dracula
I need me a home, not using
I thought we was boning, what got into ya?
Remember them days, early in the studio
Remember them days didn’t eat
Remember them days, balling like a kid again
I got many racks, are you kidding me?
See that they envy, they laugh, they pity me
Wonder why nobody makes it really
All of you broke, it’s sad that you me

Rock on it, roll rockin it, rockin it
Rockin it, rockin it her body I’m rockin it
Lean with a rock in it rockin it, rockin it
Started to poppin shit rock on it, roll
I got a 30, I’m poppin it, poppin it
Cut the edge off of it inside her esophagus
No I’m not stopping it
No I’m not stopping it imma keep rockin it
