		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear dream seeker.
What do you see from
your eyes?
When you hit a wall
and look at the sky.
You never catch up but you run.
Just don't forget then
that the sun looks at you,
If there is light then
there must be shadow too.
Cry a loud.
Don't you try
for the impossible.
Cause pain and fear are
always near us.
Keep marching forward as you
blaze a trail of tears.
You can do it.
you are infinity.

Cry a loud.
Don't you try
for the impossible.
Cause pain and fear are
always near us.
Keep marching forward as you
blaze a trail of tears.
You can do it.
you are infinity.
Light and shadow always are,
but don't give up your dream.
Back to back all the time.
Glory and the deepest shame
Life and death
and light and shadow.
See the other side.
Open your eyes.
Can you see the new world?
new world? new world?
