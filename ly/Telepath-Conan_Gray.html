		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't even finish that sentence, babe
Already know how this ends
You say, "We're breakin' up," what a shame
Don't even wanna stay friends, God

It's just so you, you're just so predictable
Won't you try somethin' original?
Old news, reused, that's why I don't cry

'Cause I got a feelin'
You're comin' back just like you have in the past
Yeah, I got a feelin'
You'll be sendin' me trash you should've left in the drafts
Yeah, I got a feelin'
You'll see me movin' on and hate that I'm gone
I can see it
You're comin' back, call me a telepath

Now's about the time the boredom hits (oh, look)
There you are at my door
Drunk and askin' me for a kiss
When yesterday you said that you hate my guts, now you're back in love?

It's so you, you're just so predictable
Won't you try somethin' original?
Old news, reused, that's why I don't cry

'Cause I got a feelin'
You're comin' back just like you have in the past
Yeah, I got a feelin'
You'll be sendin' me trash you should've left in the drafts
Yeah, I got a feelin'
You'll see me movin' on and hate that I'm gone
I can see it
You're comin' back, call me a telepath

But I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you
I'll call you when I'm cryin', yeah
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you'll
Return in perfect timing and I won't stop you from tryin'

'Cause I got a feelin'
You're comin' back just like you have in the past
Yeah, I got a feelin'
You'll be sendin' me trash you should've left in the drafts
Yeah, I got a feelin' (inside)
You'll see me movin' on and hate that I'm gone
I can see it
You're comin' back, call me a telepath (oh)

Call me a telepath, whoa
Call me a telepath
Call me a telepath, oh
Call me a telepath
