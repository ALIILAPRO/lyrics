		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Baby, are you up for this?)
(Ready for the bump and grind)
(Baby, are you up for this?)
Suh, suh, s-s-s-suh
(Baby, are you up for this?)

Ain't it different? (One) I link my ting in LA
Why I can't fly to the states? 'Cause I got too much convictions (ayy)
Apparently all I talk is prison but I don't know no different (no)
'Cause I was in jail up north, runnin' another coalition (turn)
Fresh home, I bought coke and whipped it, I put some roses where my wrist is
You ain't ever made a birthday cake from digestive biscuits (told me turn)
Will have to take lemon juice to my piss test (piss test) (s-s-s-suh)
Everyday I look up to the Lord, give thanks for all this litness (turn, turn, turn, turn)
Come home, fresh out the system, gymnast
Rollin' with smoke on my jones
Pigs want all the camera on me, not the one from dipset (one)
I still can't mix pleasure with business, sorry princess (princess)
I come a long way from broke days (turn, turn)
I got to work and fixed it

Baby, are you up for this?
I am feeling hot tonight
Ready for the bump and grind
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? (Ain't it different?)
I am feeling hot tonight (turn, turn, turn, turn)
Ready for the bump and grind
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
(Suh, suh, s-s-s-suh)

Ain't it different? (Yeah)
Spent like ten years grindin' (facts)
Covered in diamonds, never been mining
Came through, man's still shining (blaow)
'Cause I was in Homeford house with the pack (pack)
And now I'm in Dubai, lining (vroom)
Me and Headz landed abroad, two new kettles, perfect timin' (perfect)
The new whip's white on white, peanut butter, rose gold lining (skrr)
You can catch me in Central (let's go)
Car so dumb, when I press this button it's gone, I don't do rentals (I pay)
Air 1's fresher than menthol (they're fresh)
I don't wanna get shit lit, but the way that bro grip sticks ain't gentle (brrt)
Summer time shootouts, big big loot-outs
Get corn stuck in your dental

Baby, are you up for this? (Ooh, ooh)
I am feeling hot tonight (ooh, ooh)
Ready for the bump and grind (ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? (Ooh, ooh) (ain't it different?)
I am feeling hot tonight (ooh, ooh) (ayy, ayy)
Ready for the bump and grind (ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah (turn, turn, turn, turn)

Ain't it different? (Different)
When I first stepped in the game (game)
Man tried leech on my name now they wanna act all distant
Man love smile in my face and then they wanna chat like vixens (huh?)
It's good it's not back in the day, woulda got you so wrapped on Clifton
I don't really take no checks, I'll warn you
And I don't do threats, I'm cordial
I don't even snap on the jet, it's normal
Black tie but I'm dressed informal (boy)
Like the boys from east, I'm nasty
Don't do drip but I still stay classy
You wanna know, then ask me, easy

Baby, are you up for this? (Ooh, ooh) (One)
I am feeling hot tonight (ooh, ooh)
Ready for the bump and grind (ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah
Baby, are you up for this? (Ain't it different, one) (ooh, ooh)
I am feeling hot tonight (ooh, ooh)
Ready for the bump and grind (ooh, ooh)
Wheel it back and run it one more time, yeah, yeah (turn, turn, turn, turn)

(Baby, are you?)
(Baby, are you?)
(Baby, are you?)
(Baby, are you?)
