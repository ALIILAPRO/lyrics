		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stuck in the dark
They only show me what they
Want me to see, yeah, yeah
Backed against the wall
The anger slowly builds in me, yeah
It builds to a point where
It starts to suffocate me
And just like a match
All I need is a little spark to set me off

I can be louder
Louder than you want me to be, yeah
This could be louder
Louder than you want it to be, yeah

Most of the time, I am the quiet guy
Calm and reserved but I stand
For what I deserve, yeah
And I'm just a man who has
Limit's when dealing with you
You were the spark that ignited
All the flames inside me and set me off

I can be louder
Louder than you want me to be, yeah
This could be louder
Louder than you want it to be, yeah

You're the curse
You're the worst, you're in my head
I'm the banshee hear me, I know you can
But now you're complaining I went too far
But you're the one that set me off

I can be louder
Louder than you want me to be, yeah
This could be louder
Louder than you want it to be, yeah
