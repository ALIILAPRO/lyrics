		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought we'd make it this far 
Now they're trying to break us apart 
Never let them change who we are 
Baby we got lightning in our hearts 
Never thought we'd make it this far 
Now they're trying to break us apart 
We won't let them change who we are 
Baby we got lightning in our hearts 

Love 
cre you strong enough 
Come on shake it up 
Show them what you're made of 
It don't matter where you're from 
You are one of us 
Baby we're the same blood 
Love 
cre you strong enough 
Come on shake it up 
Show them what you're made of 
It don't matter where you're from 
You are one of us 
Baby we're the same blood 

Forever in a world that's torn apart 
Only one that keeps me hanging on
Heaven is a place where we belong 
Colors that we make will carry on 
Feeling just like strangers in the dark 
Together we are brighter than the stars 
Chemical attraction from the start 
Baby we got lightning in our hearts 

Love 
cre you strong enough 
Come on shake it up 
Show them what you're made of 
It don't matter where you're from 
You are one of us 
Baby we're the same blood
Same blood, same blood 

Love 
cre you strong enough 
Come on shake it up 
Show them what you're made of 
It don't matter where you're from 
You are one of us 
Baby we're the same blood
Same blood 

Love 
cre you strong enough 
Come on shake it up 
Show them what you're made of 
It don't matter where you're from 
You are one of us 
Baby we're the same blood
Same blood 

Love 
cre you strong enough 
Come on shake it up 
Show them what you're made of 
Don't matter where you're from 
You are one of us 
Baby we're the same blood
