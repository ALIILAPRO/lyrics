		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn 
Damn
Uh

Damn, Cole World
I never thought I'd see the day that you my old girl
Now I'm stuck here hollerin' at ol' girl
Got one, got two, three, four girls
Shotgun in the drop made a right
Hut-one, hut-two, told them, take a hike
Then it's on to the next, on, on to the next one
Hard to move on when you always regret one

I wonder sometimes
I wonder if I was wrong
Tryna do right by you got me here
Now all I am is alone

'Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that, don't compare at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

All I want is you
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

'Cause being your friend is killin' me softly
Hear voices, wonder where I went wrong
It was my fault and the wrong time
I wonder so often, regret gets exhaustin'

'Cause her eyes, and those hips
And that, don't compare at all, no
And at best, all they do is distract me but now
Deep down, when I face it

All I want is you, mm
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you're gone, gone, gone

All I want is you, ooh
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, baby
Now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

'Cause they don't smile, huh, or smell like you
And they don't make me laugh, or even cook like you
And they don't photograph, nah, they don't sex like you
Let's face it, I can't replace it
That's why all I want is you now

I hit the club when you left me thinking that could heal
Tryna celebrate my Independence Day, Will Smith
Baby girl, who I'm kiddin'? Still sick, real
All my new, seem to get old real quick
And could it be
You everything that these plain, couldn't be
Is it a sign from the Lord that I shouldn't be?
Lost in the player way, so they get old to me
Got me on layaway, girl, you got a hold on me
I say, "I'm wrong", you say, "Come again?"
Damn, said I was wrong, look don't rub it in
I got a lot on my mind, got a flock full of dimes
Like a line full of, how they comin' in
Just sayin', don't wanna have me then somebody will
I'm playin', weight on my chest like I body build
I'm prayin', you ain't content with tryna do your thing
And come back, baby, boomerang, 'rang, huh

That's why all I want is you now, mm
All I want is you, now
All I want is you now, sugar
Now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Ooh, ooh
Yeah, now that you're gone, gone, gone
I want you back
