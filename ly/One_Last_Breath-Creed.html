		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
It seems I found the road to nowhere
And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder (thunder)
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say, let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

I'm looking down now that it's over
Reflecting on all of my mistakes
I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, "Heaven, save me" (save me)
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it, let me say, let me say

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
I'm so far down

Sad eyes follow me
But I still believe there's something left for me
So please come stay with me
'Cause I still believe there's something left for you and me
For you and me, for you and me

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking (thinking)

Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down
Hold me now
I'm six feet from the edge and I'm thinking
Maybe six feet ain't so far down

Please come now, I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe
