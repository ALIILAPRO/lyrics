		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it his eyes
Is it his smile
Or is it his talk
Tell me is it his style
Is it the way he comes to me
And you’re so lonely
You can‘t see

He wants my heart
And he wants my nights
He’s not for you
And no he’s not your type
He’s not the kind to play the field
Why don‘t you leave him to me

Charlene
I’ve gotta write a letter to Charlene
And you should know the words he said to me
(You're so sweet)
The words he said to me
(You're the girl I need)
A letter to Charlene
I've gotta get a message to Charlene
You've got to read the words he said to me
(And I really love)
And he's the one to me
(Girl I can’t let go)
Oh oh
A letter to Charlene

He’s all I know
He made my life
And as he should leave
I wouldn't survive
Now don't you go to foul with him
Don't push your luck you'll never win

Take all your love
And take all your charms
To someone else but not to his arms
Now can't you read between the lines
Don't wait for him ‘cause he is mine

Charlene
I’ve gotta write a letter to Charlene
And you should know the words he said to me
(You're so sweet)
The words he said to me
(You're the girl I need)
A letter to Charlene
I've gotta get a message to Charlene
You've got to read the words he said to me
(And I really love)
And he's the one to me
(Girl I can’t let go)
Oh oh
A letter to Charlene

Charlene
I've gotta get a message to Charlene
You've got to read the words he said to me
(And I really love)
And he's the one to me
(Girl I can’t let go)
Oh oh
