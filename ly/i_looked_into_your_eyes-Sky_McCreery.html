		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl
Being by your side through everything's been hurting
And the scars you left on me, love, they're no burden
I never wanna lose you from my heart
Are you still in my heart?

Wait
Where did you go?
When you said it was over
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine

I'm lost in this world, I hate to say it
You're gone, but you're still my favorite
I hate when I let these feelings out
I wish you would want me
I wish you would love me
(I wish you would)

Wait
Where did you go?
When you said it was over
Did that mean that you'd forget about the time
When we found our shooting star?
And I looked into your eyes
And you looked back at mine

Oh, you save me
Oh, you save me
Oh, you save me
It's like, oh, you save me
