		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissin' wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Oh, oh, oh

I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
But, baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better than me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way (better off that way)
Baby, all that I can say (all that I can say)
If you gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me

Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link?
Got you ridin' 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers
Girl, you used to ride in the rinky dink
I'm the one put you in Eliantte
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway
You was rockin' Coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'
Side bitch in Frisco, I call her my Bay-bae
I got a girl, but I still feel alone
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone
Can't even record, you got me out my zone

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please, don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know

If you creepin', just don't let me find out
Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house
If you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Then don't come back to me
