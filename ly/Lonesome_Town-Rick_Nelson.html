		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place where lovers go
To cry their troubles away
And they call it lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay (lonesome town)
You can buy a dream or two
To last you all through the years
And the only price you pay
Is a heartful of tears (full of tears)

Goin' down to lonesome town
Where the broken hearts stay
Goin' down to lonesome town
To cry my troubles away
In the town of broken dreams
The streets are filled with regret
Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forget (to forget)

Maybe down in lonesome town
I can learn to forget

(Lonesome town)
