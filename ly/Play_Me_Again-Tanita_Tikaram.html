		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got me going, for all your lies
You've got me going, the hoop is wide
I keep believing, and what have I gained?
So play me again

You've got me running, all over town
You've got me running, so deep am I bound
To talk of love is only to flatter
Play me again
Please play me again
In the night time's wandering, that's where I hide
For in its blush I am alive
Searching for your light
Searching for you light

In the beginning, the word is hot
Now I see the ruin, but I can't stop
For I'm so sentimental
Play me again
Play me again
Play me again

Play me again, let me fall through your hands
