		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see? I'm no good without you

Take my lips, I wanna lose them
Take my arms, I'll never use them

Your goodbyes, they left me with eyes that cry
How can I
Get along without you?

You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me

Let's go, boys, let's go

Your goodbye, left me with eyes that cry
Now I'm lost without you
And now that you took that part
That used to be my heart

All of me, why not take all of me
Can't you see, I'm a mess without you

You took the part that used to be my heart
So why not take all of me?
