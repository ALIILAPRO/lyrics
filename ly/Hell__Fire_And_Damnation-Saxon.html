		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Child of Satan or lamb of God
The choice is yours to make
Rule the heavens high or reign in hell
Satanic rites and holy prayers
Bring supremacy
Fighting for our souls until the end

The battle rages on
Through eternity
In the fight for good and evil
Which one will succeed?

Hell, fire and damnation
Written in the prophecy
Holy fire and salvation
Will our souls ever be free?
Ever be free

The Antichrist and Nazarene
Fight the endless war
Angels, demons raging back and forth
Demonic verses holy script
The never ending fight
Will the darkness conquer 'gainst the light?

Armies of the evil
Warriors of the good
Battle on forever
To find the chosen one

Hell, fire and damnation
Written in the prophecy
Holy fire and salvation
Will our souls ever be free?

Satan's fire, heaven's light
The conflict never ends
Back and forth they battle for our souls
The prophecy written out
There for all to read
Some believe but others cannot see

The battle rages on
Into eternity
The fight for good and evil
Which one will it be?

Hell, fire and damnation
Written in the prophecy
Holy fire and salvation
Will our souls ever be free?
Ever be free
Ever be free
Never
