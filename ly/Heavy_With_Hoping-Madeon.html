		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How can I explain?
Can you imagine it?
Trying my best
Trying to find happiness
If I belong
If I had a home anywhere
It's in your heartbeat
Let me be there

Heavy with hoping
That you knew it
That you feel the way I do
Show me you're broken
'Cause I'm frozen
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Shut me up
Shoot me down before I 
Break and tell the truth
Heavy with hoping
Heavy with hoping you love me too

If I let you go
We end in tragedy
How would you know
How to get back to me?
If I had a clue
If I had a chance to be loved
This is my last one
I'm nothing without you now

Even though I broke your heart
And you're all those miles away
Won't you tell me you forgive me?
Won't you bring me home to stay?
Baby now we could be ready
Maybe this is just a test
Of faith
So I'm hoping

Heavy with hoping
That you knew it
That you feel the way I do
Show me you're broken
'Cause I'm frozen
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Shut me up
Shoot me down before I 
Break and tell the truth
Heavy with hoping
Heavy with hoping you love me too
