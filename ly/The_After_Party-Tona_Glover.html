		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just seen ya new picture
You got a new nigga
I aint mad
hope u having a blast
when the funs over shawty come to the after party

Just rolled up sum swishas
I got all the liquor
Good dick n a whole lotta cash
N its all here waiting for u at the after party

How many times u gon post that lil boy on ya instagram shawty?
U do it just cause I dont like it
I was up late at night almost sent u a text
Then deleted it baby
Just to wake up again n re type it

Lemme know when u trynna have fun
I'm just tryna have a lil fun
The bond that we had ye we lost it but
Our attraction forever lives on
I'm a hot nigga sum like the sun

U a city girl like JT
But You been acting up lately
Why u go MIA on me baby

Trynna make me jealous bitch just cut it off
Imma toxic nigga too I done it all
Chilling by my lonely iont got shit else to do
Open up instagram

Just seen ya new picture
You got a new nigga
I ain't mad
hope u having a blast
when the funs over shawty come
To the after party

Just rolled up sum swishas
I got all the liquor
Good dick n a whole lotta cash
N its all here waiting for u at the After party
