		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need no blind belief
I don't need no comic relief
I don't need to see the scars
I don't need Jesus Christ Superstar
Don't need Sunday television
Ya bet your life I don't need religion

Let me tell ya something else
I don't need no time for prayer
Don't save no knee-pads for me up there
If your head's alright
Ya don't need binoculars to see the light
Ya don't need no miracle vision
You bet your life you don't need religion

Lemmy-vision!

I don't need no Santy Claus
And I don't believe in fairies no more
I don't need to go to confession
I'm already trying to fight depression
I don't need no exorcism
Bet ya life I don't need religion
