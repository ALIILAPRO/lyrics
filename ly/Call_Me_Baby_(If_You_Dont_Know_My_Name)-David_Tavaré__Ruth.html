		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are we going out ? Of course no doubt, let's celebrate the disco night
And while my friends pick another dance, an angel flies down from the sky
Where I saw her face, never in this place, maybe it was a fashion magazine
She's a movie star or a beauty queen, sweet darling, tell me who you are

If you don't know my name, you can call me baby (my baby)
If you don't know my name, you can call me baby (you could be my baby)

I never thought someone like you could ever come into my life
You're my love supreme, an exciting dream, an angel standing by my side
I want you to stay, never go away, our love will stand the test of time
'Cause from now one, till my life is gone, you'll be the owner of my heart

If you don't know my name, you can call me baby (my baby)
If you don't know my name, you can call me baby (you could be my baby)
If you don't know my name, you can call me baby (my baby)
If you don't know my name, you can call me baby.
