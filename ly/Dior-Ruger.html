		  Bad man looking good in Dior
Bad man drip to the core
Sport car's parked on the right spot
Bad man sleek and you know

Bad man looking good in Dior
Bad man drip to the core
Sport car's parked on the right spot
Bad man sleek and you

Me get a girl inna me bed right now
She say she no wan leave
She tell me Ruger
Me I want to spend the rest of mi life with you
Me say no shit, oh Lord
Fly you to Maldives for a day
Then we fly back quick
Then we take a quick jet flight straight to Paris
You fucking with the crème de la crème

Say she never seen a guy like me eh
She confess
Say nobody hit it right like me eh
She confess
Bend down, get on your knees
Girl never digress (ooh ooh)
She really want ah flex with me
She wanna break bread with me

Bad man looking good in Dior
Bad man drip to the core
Sport car's parked on the right spot
Bad man sleek and you know

Say she never seen a guy like me eh
She confess
Say nobody hit it right like me, eh
She confess
Bend down, get on your knees
Girl never digress (ooh ooh)
She really want ah flex with me
She wanna break bread with me

Bad man looking good in Dior
