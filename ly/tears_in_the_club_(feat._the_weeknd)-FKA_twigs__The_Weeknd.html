		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tears in the club
'Cause your love's got me fucked up
Tears in the club (tears in the club)

I wanna get you out of my hips, my thighs
My hair, my eyes, my late-night cries
I wanna take my clothes off, wanna touch my hips
My thighs, my hair, not yours, all mine, yeah
Wanna dance you out of my, gotta dance you out of my
Hips, my thighs, my wrongs, my rights, yeah
Listen to the rhythm and make no compromise
'Cause you hurt me

I don't wanna believe that I belong to you
I move myself in ways that you could never do
I want you more, I want you more, I, I

Tears in the club (tears in the club)
'Cause your love's got me fucked up
Tears in the club (tears in the club)
I'ma drown in the beat now
Tears in the club (tears in the club)
'Cause your love's got me fucked up
Tears in the club (tears in the club)
I'ma drown in the beat now

(Tears in the, tears in the club) ayy
I love and want your body
I'll never leave you now
(Tears in the, tears in the club) ayy, ayy
I love and want your body
I'll never leave you now (I might die on the beat, love)

When my song come on, give you chills
Get you cryin' in the club, babe
So many tears 'cause you're tryna fight the love, babe
You move your body to the synths and the drums, babe
You move your body 'til the rise of the sun
Just go with the motions, baby
Girl, you should go with the motions, oh
Unload your emotions, baby
You've been suppressin' emotions, oh
There's no, no escapin' me, yeah
Let it out like therapy
There's no, no escapin' me
Around your girls, in the club, on the road, on the radio

Tears in the club (tears in the club)
'Cause your love's got me fucked up
Tears in the club (tears in the club)
I'ma drown in the beat now (oh)
Tears in the club (tears in the club)
'Cause your love's got me fucked up (hey)
Tears in the club, I, I (tears in the club)

(Tears in the, tears in the club) ayy
I love and want your body
I'll never leave you now (I'll never let you go)
I can never leave you now, baby
(Tears in the, tears in the club) ayy, ayy
I love and want your body
I'll never leave you now (I'll never let you go)
But I couldn't let you go

I wanna get you out of my hips, my thighs
My hair, my eyes, tonight's the night
I told the universe I'm gonna fuck your lies
Then cut all ties and get high as a satellite (higher)
I want you more, I want you more
I think about us together (yeah)

Tears in the club
'Cause your love's got me fucked up (oh)
Tears in the club, yeah
I'ma drown in the beat now
Tears in the, tears in the club (tears in the club)
Tear-tears in the club
'Cause your love's got me fucked up
Tears in the club (tears in the club)
