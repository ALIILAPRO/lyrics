		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hoes in the whip ten toes on the ship  
she wasting time on a nigga that ain't shit (uh) 
Hit it from the back (uh) I never left (uh) 
ice cream boogers on my wrist thats a fat (aye) 
fuck him up he was checking on my bitch 
I was having fun til my checking took a hit (aye) 
two phone Baby Keem i might take a nigga shit (aye) bitch I'm on the run i smash the gas then i split
 
You niggas not my bro you niggas not my homeboy 
You niggas rock the boat you niggas love to cap 
I might take a lost then I make it back
if i take a lost Imma make it back (yea) 

Shots at your kick back (uh) 
bitch get back I said bro get back (uh yea) 
you don't want no smoke you don't want no crack (aye) get back (huh), 
get back  
I said bro get back 
fuck did you think, 
punk fade you talking to me 
i'm with the flee and we role deep 
we not the same the squad is unique (aye) 
don't trust the sorry hoe my momma told me that
ice cream wrist pistachio big water hold the tap (yea) focus straight to the whip i floor it 
bust down a fit I wore it
texting your bitch ignore it 
dick print hope I'm her MCM she dig the source 
Cartier frames, this is my bitch phase I see that the vibes distorted 
hop in the photo 
I am the sensei 
hop in the range 
I am the sensei 
big protein take it to my brain 
I am the sensei 
how much you make you watching my pockets we not the same
I am the sensei 
kick that bitch if she switch up on the gang (woah) Shots at your kickback 
bitch get back 
I said bro get back (uh yea) 
you don't want no smoke you don't want no crack (aye) get back, get back (huh) I said bro get back
