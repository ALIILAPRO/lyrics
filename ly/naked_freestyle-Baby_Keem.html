		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He hasn't slept in probably, uh, seven days

Yeah, these hoes might get naked
Mad at myself, I ain't make it
Baby Keem way too impatient (yeah)
African-Americans, and Blasians
Maybe a little bit Haitian
Baby Keem way too impatient (woo)
(Wait a minute, run that shit back, that new Baby Keem, fool)
Yeah, these hoes might get naked
Mad at myself, I ain't make it
Baby Keem way too impatient (yeah)
African-Americans, and Blasians
Maybe a little bit Haitian
Baby Keem way too impatient

My bitch at the crib, she blowin' me up
I know she don't want me to be here
Had thoughts about havin' a civil relationship
But that can't happen if she here (she here)
Overseas, I need emergencies (emergencies)
Overseas, I need emergencies (emergencies)
I used to be at my mama house dreamin' the SVR racin' through quarantine
I'm fresh out the gut, you never believe it
I feel like the 'hood pre-Madonna
I slid on these opp in a Honda
Then jumped out the stage to find her (uh)
My manager yellin' at me, I called her, "Dramatic"
I think that I'll let her have it
I got my ear to the back of them, back of them streets
Unbearable habits
My name is Hykeem and I move through the building as if I was destined to grasp it
I'm dodgin' the drugs but havin' the women 'cause I am the son of a n-
I took all my hoes to Aspen
Fuckin' all night need an Asprin
Bitch, I am the one, who you askin'?

Yeah, these hoes might get naked
Mad at myself, I ain't make it
Baby Keem way too impatient (yeah)
African-Americans, and Blasians
Maybe a little bit Haitian
Baby Keem way too impatient
