		  Hey, let 'em do it again, yeah
Hey, you said you were my friend
Hey, turn me upside down, oh
Hey, feelin' so down
Hey 
Hey, aah

You made a fool of me again
And again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again
(And again, and again, and again, and again)
(And again, and again, and again, and again)

Hey, I know I made the same mistake, yeah
I, I won't do it again, no
Why, why you slap me in the face, ow
I, I didn't say it was ok, no
No
No, aah

You violated a part of me again
And again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again

Ah, ooh
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot

Hey, you had time to think it out, yeah
Hey, your weak will won't help her heal her heart
Hey, I'll bet it really eats you up, huh

Extending part of me again
And again, and again, and again, and again
 
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot

Doot doot, doot doot
Doot doot, doot doot
Doot doot, doot doot
Doot doot, doot doot
