		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It ain't the time, for you to walk
If I won't let go
I can tell, that ain't what you want
But it's like you can't let it show
Girl, I've tried again and again
To give you all of me, but you deny
(girl that ain't right)

And I chose you, 'cause you're all I need
And you chose your man
But your man ain't me
So don't call my phone, acting like you care
I done made my move, I know life ain't fair

What you want (got what you want)
What you need (got what you need)
Girl you don't know (you don't know)
Like you don't feel (like you don't feel)
