		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rollin'

Since I was born, they couldn't hold me down
Another misfit kid, another burned out town
I never played by the rules and I never really cared
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere

When I look and see it's not only me
So many others have stood where I stand
We are the young (hey), so raise your hands

They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild

Boss screaming in my ear about who I'm supposed to be
Get a three-piece Wall Street smile, and son, you'll look just like me"
I said, "Hey man, there's something you ought to know 
Well, I'll tell you Park Avenue leads to Skid Row"

Well, I look and see it's not only me
We're standin' tall, ain't never a doubt
We are the young (hey), so shout it out

They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild

Well, let me hear you get wild

They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, we are the youth gone wild
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, we are the youth gone wild
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, we are the youth gone wild
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, we are the youth gone wild
