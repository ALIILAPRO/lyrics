		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought it was dead and buried
Then it woke you up last night
You sounded so damn worried
You've been tossing, turning, both ends burning

I wanna put your mind at ease again
(Make everything alright)
I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you now

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason

Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me

You're looking at the ghost of me

With your imagination and emotions running wild
Fueling my frustrations like a fire burning, clock keeps turning
And I, I know it's getting underneath your skin
I've tried to tell you now

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seeing in your dreams
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason

Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
Whoa
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me

Don't look over your shoulder
'Cause that's just the ghost of me
You're seein'
Wait, there's no rhyme or reason

Sometimes there's no meaning
In the visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
Visions when you're sleepin'
Don't wake up and believe them
You're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
Yeah, you're looking at the ghost of me
