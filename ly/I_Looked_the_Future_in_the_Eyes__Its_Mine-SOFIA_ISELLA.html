		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I trained myself to breathe future air
cir that isn't yet born, that isn't yet there
Dunking my head in a tub of distraction
In a bobbing for apples-like fashion

Chugging the world like ice hot Gatorade 
The ocean leaking from my lips, a dripping display
The town gathers â€˜round asking what we see
I saw what's ensuing
It looked just like me

The impending days should be terrified
We'll eat them up like cream and pie
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

The impending days should be electrified
I forecasted a lighting ride
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

(mine, mine, mine)
(mine, mine, mine)

They ask us how's it feel to be god's favorite
I say we don't know, we've never known different 
I'm seeing red, I'm seeing blood, I'm seeing visions 
I'm seeing something not too far off in the distance 

cnd the babies are dressed up in a big big man suit
Happy happy people happy to ignore the issue
cnd I know you don't wanna hear it, I know you don't wanna know
So don't worry about it, all our names will be in the vote

The impending days should be terrified
We'll eat them up like cream and pie
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

The impending days should be electrified
I forecasted a lighting ride
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

The impending days should be terrified
We'll eat them up like cream and pie
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

The impending days should be electrified
I forecasted a lighting ride
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

The impending days should be terrified
We'll eat them up like cream and pie
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

The impending days should be electrified
I forecasted a lighting ride
I looked the future in the eyes it's mine (mine, mine, mine)

(mine, mine, mine)
(mine, mine, mine)
