		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could this be earth?
Could this be light?
Does this mean everything's going to be alright?
One look out my window, there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
And what is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget twenty-three like I forget seventeen
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon, on the tv station
