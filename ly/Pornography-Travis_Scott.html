		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourself consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of "fuck this shit"
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it through whatever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here
So fuck you and fuck this

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me, and come down with me
Yeah that's all I need in my fantasy

You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me, and come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy

The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say fuck you 
To the ones that say fuck you
'Til you doing yo' thing, Codeine and Cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La flame he is in his head, the world is yours

Wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms
Might gotta got to rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy, 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis, 'cause my mind's too outlandish

It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga, goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post 'em
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack, Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium

So wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm
Might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy, 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis, 'cause my mind's too outlandish
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world

La Flame says "let your ambition carry you"
