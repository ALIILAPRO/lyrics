		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever wondered why you met me
And fell in love over coffee
Well, you were looking so damn pretty
I forgot to breathe

Now I get choked up 'cuz I'm running on a high, high 
Every time I die, you save me
Yeah I get coughed up, but I'm going out tonight
You can't stop me from missing you

'Cuz baby you the bestest, baby know that you can do anything
Anything you want on your check list
Don't you know that I believe in you, I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you

I know you have baggage lingering
But I know how to forgive
What you did before, I can't change it
Just let me show you how to live

Now I get choked up 'cuz I'm running on a high, high
Every time I die, you save me
Yeah, I get fucked up, 'cuz I'm going out tonight, I, I
You can't stop me from missing you

'Cuz baby you the bestest, baby know that you can do anything
Anything you want on your check list
Don't you know that I believe in you, I believe in you
I believe in, I believe in you
You know that I believe in, I believe you

Yeah, I'll party with my friends tonight
I don't know what will happen, I
I'm so scared that the high could die
'Cuz we're living in a fantasy world

Yeah, I'll party with my friends tonight
I don't know what will happen, I
I'm so scared that the high could die

'Cuz baby you the bestest, baby know that you can do anything
Anything you want on your check list
Don't you know that I believe in you, I believe in you
Don't you know that I believe in, I believe in you
Don't you know htat I believe in you
