		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
And it's 'cause you're mine
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
(You're mine, you're mine, you're mine)
And it's 'cause you're mine

So lie
Someone is still a diamond
And it's 'cause you're mine
You want me
Drag me into the night
And it's 'cause you're mine
You're lonely
Sending a mayday
And it's 'cause you're mine
So rise it
I lost you'll be alright

'Cause you may blame, on me babe
I know that now you should better fall
You shoot me high, call me fly
Keep on pushing but you better don't

It's what I thought, call me babe
Hush it now cross my name and die
Honors in the flame burn me now
So decide whether you want more

And it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine
Oh it's 'cause you're mine
Oh it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine

And it's 'cause you're mine
Someone is still a diamond
You're lonely
Sending a mayday

'Cause you may blame, on me babe
I know that now you should better fall
You shoot me high, call me fly
Keep on pushing but you better don't

And it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine
Oh it's 'cause you're mine
Oh it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine
Oh it's 'cause you're mine
Oh it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine

And it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine
And it's 'cause you're mine
