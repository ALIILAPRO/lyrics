		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [First Verse:]
Sweet dreams are made of this.
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas.
Everybody's looking for something.

[Chorus:]
Some of them want to use you.
Some of them want to get used by you.
Some of them want to abuse you.
Some of them want to be abused.

[Repeat First Verse]
Sweet dreams are made of this.
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas.
Everybody's looking for something.

[Chorus]
Some of them want to use you.
Some of them want to get used by you.
Some of them want to abuse you.
Some of them want to be abused.

I wanna use you and abuse you.
I wanna know what's inside you.
(Whispering and Moaning:
Hold your head up, movin' on.
Keep your head up, movin' on.)

Movin' on! x3

[Repeat First Verse]
Sweet dreams are made of this.
Who am I to disagree?
Travel the world and the seven seas.
Everybody's looking for something.

[Chorus]
Some of them want to use you.
Some of them want to get used by you.
Some of them want to abuse you.
Some of them want to be abused.

I'm gonna use you and abuse you.
I'm gonna know what's inside.
Gonna use you and abuse you.
I'm gonna know what's inside you.
