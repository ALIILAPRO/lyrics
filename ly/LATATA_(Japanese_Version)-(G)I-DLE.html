		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yo, you know what? 
I'm waiting for ya, I only want you
They say I'm loca, but hey whatever, I only want ya

Running the red light, move it now, left-right
We going all night
I'll take you higher, set it on fire, you're my desire

Uh-oh, what do you got to lose? Keep it going, baby
Falling down, you and I
We can get caught up in the moment
You like that?
Go, go burn until there's nothing left
'Cause I don't care about tomorrow, no, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

I love ya
There ain't nothing I won't do for you, fall with me lata
I love ya
Dance the night away with me, let me sing for you lata
I love ya
Latata latata latata latata
Latata latata latata latata
Sing for me until you're burnt in my memory, lata
I love ya

I love ya
Every day, every night, latata
I love ya
Every day, every night latata

Don't be lazy, come over baby
I'm only getting started, time is of the essence (hey, hey)
I'll open up, you can go a little deeper, drink it up
And you can keep going 'til you're dizzy (dizzy)

Tear it up, tear it up, sing it latata (tata)
They don't know what to say, going dot dot dot (dot dot)
Ready or not, we're making it hot
The jealousy feels good to me, muah-muah-muah

Uh-oh, how far do you wanna go with me?
Keep on moving 'til the sunrise, yeah, we can get crazy
You like that?
Go, go burn until there's nothing left
'Cause I don't care about tomorrow, no, whoa-oh-oh-oh

I love ya
There ain't nothing I won't do for you, fall with me lata
I love ya
Dance the night away with me, let me sing for you, lata
I love ya
Latata latata latata latata
Latata latata latata latata
Sing for me until you're burnt in my memory, lata
I love ya

I love ya
Every day, every night, latata
I love ya
Every day, every night, latata

Ayy, yo, you know what? 
I'm waiting for ya, I only want you
They say I'm loca, but hey, whatever, I only want ya
Running the red light, move it now, left-right
We going all night
I'll take you higher, set it on fire, you're my desire

I love ya
Every day, every night, latata
I love ya
Every day, every night, latata
