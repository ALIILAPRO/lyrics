		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say music is the food of love
Let's see if you are hungry enough
Take a bite, take another, just like a good boy would
Get a sweet thing on the side
Home cooking, homicide
Side order, could be your daughter
Finger-licking good

Come on baby, eat the rich
Put the bite on the son of a bitch
Don't mess around, don't give me no switch
C'mon baby eat the rich
C'mon baby eat the rich

Sittin' here in a restaurant
Tell the waiter just what you want
Is that the meat, you wanted to eat
How would you ever know?
Hash browns an' bacon strips
I love the way that you lick your lips
No fooling, I can see you drooling
Feel the hunger grow

Come on baby, eat the rich
Put the bite on the son of a bitch
Don't mess around, don't give me no switch
C'mon baby eat the rich
C'mon baby eat the rich

Eat up, eat you, eat me
Eat two, get one free
Shetland pony, extra pepperoni
Just pick up the phone
Eat Greek, or eat Chinese
Eat salad, or scarf up grease
You're on the shelf, maybe eat yourself
Come on, bite my bone

Come on baby, eat the rich
Put the bite on the son of a bitch
Don't mess around, don't give me no switch
C'mon baby eat the rich
C'mon baby eat the rich
