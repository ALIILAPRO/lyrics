		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Almost thought we made it home,
But we don't know this place at all,
That's enough now dry your tears
It's been a long eleven years

Fire, fire fire!
Fire from the tongues of liars,
You're ashamed of where you're from,
Crying 'cause your father's drunk
We can't die because we're young
At least that's what we heard in a song

Fire, fire fire!
Fire from the tongues of liars,
Fire, fire fire!
Fire from the tongues of liars

You're ashamed of what you've done,
Crying 'cause your father's wrong
Trying to be something new,
You'll feel that you had something to prove

What you confuse for glorious fire
This fire from the tongues of liars,
What you confuse for glorious fire
Is fire from the tongues of liars

This fire from the tongues of liars
(Fire, fire)
Fire from the tongues of liars
(Fire, fire)
Fire from the tongues of liars

Fire, fire fire!
Fire from the tongues of liars,
Fire, fire fire!
Fire from the tongues of liars)

You're afraid of who you are
Crying 'cause your father's done
Clinging to your youthful truth
You'll find that you've nothing to lose

You'll find that you've nothing to prove
