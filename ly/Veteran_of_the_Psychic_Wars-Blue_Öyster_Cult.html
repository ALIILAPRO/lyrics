		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're seeing now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars,
I've been living on the edge so long, where the winds of Limbo roar.
And I'm young enough to look at,
And far old to see, all the stars are on the inside.
I'm not sure that's there's anything left to me

Don't let these shakes go on!
It's time we had a break from it,
It's time we had some leave.
We've been living in a place,
We've been eating up our brains.
Oh please don't let these shakes go on!

You ask me why I'm willing, why I can't speak to you,
You blame me for my silence, saying it's time I changed and grew.
But the wars still going on dear,
And there's no one that I know.
And I can't stand forever.

I can't say if were ever gonna be free,
Don't let these shakes go on!
It's time we had a break from it,
It's time we had some leave.
We've been living in a place,
We've been eating up our brains,
Oh please don't let these shakes go on!

You're seeing now a veteran of a thousand psychic wars,
My energy is spent at last, and my armor is destroyed,
I have used up all my weapons, and I'm helpless and bereaved.

Wounds are all I'm made of!
Did I hear you say that this is victory?
Don't let these shakes go on!
It's time we had a break from it,Send me to the rear!
Where the title madness swell,
And been sliding into Hell.

Oh please don't let these shakes go on!
Don't let these shakes go on
Don't let these shakes go on!
