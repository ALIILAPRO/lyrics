		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I get some fucking peace and quiet?
If I could get away from all of the noise
There's a fire in my head, been here chosen
Let's say this is my way of killing the perversion
Hear what I say

(Fuck)

Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
Hey, sorry I was late
Busy killing all your traits
Now I'm just a comeback stuck in a stutter
Knock, knock, open up mother fucker
Is resentment a clean slate for the discontent?
Is resentment the only thing helping me through the torment?

Take a look at me, look at what you've done and see
That all I hear are shrieks when the banshee speaks
You never even blinked, so don't even think I'm not paying attention
You fucked up the lesson

Take a look at me, look at what you've done and see
That all I hear are shrieks when I hear you speak
You never really cared don't act like it's fair

Say it, say it
I'm overreacting, maybe, maybe
But who taught me that?
Say it, say it, I'm overreacting
But maybe, maybe, I'm over your bullshit
I was late, busy killing everything
Now I'm just a comeback stuck in a stutter, fuck off

Think you fucking know me?
You know nothing
You think you fucking own me?
For all the times you ruined me, drop dead
