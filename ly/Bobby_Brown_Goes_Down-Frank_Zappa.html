		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey there, people, I'm Bobby Brown
They say I'm the cutest boy in town
My car is fast, my teeth are shiny
I tell all the girls they can kiss my heine
Here I am at a famous school
I dressin' sharp and I'm acting cool
I've got a cheerleader here
Wants to help with my paper
Let her do all the work 
And maybe later I'll rape her

Oh God, I am the American dream
I do not think I'm too extreme 
And I'm a handsome son of a bitch
I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich
(Get a good, get a good, get a good, get a good job)

Women's liberation
Came creepin' all across the nation
I tell you, people, I was not ready
When I fucked this dyke by the name of Freddie
She made a little speech then
Oh, she tried to make me say when
She had my balls in a vice but she left the dick
I guess it's still hooked on but now it shoots too quick

Oh God, I am the American dream
But now I smell like Vaseline 
And I'm a miserable son of a bitch
Am I a boy or a lady, I don't know which
(I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder)

So I went out and bought me a leisure suit
I jingle my change but I'm still kinda cute
Got a job doing radio promo
And none of the jocks can even tell I'm a homo
Eventually me and a friend
Sorta drifted along into S&M
I can take about an hour on the tower of power
As long as I get a little golden shower

Oh God, I am the American dream
With a spindle up my butt 'til it makes me scream
And I'll do anything to get ahead
I lay awake nights, sayin', "thank you, Fred"
Oh God, Oh God, I'm so fantastic
Thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm goin' down
And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm goin' down

And my name is Bobby Brown
Watch me now, I'm going down
Yeah, I knew you'd be surprised
