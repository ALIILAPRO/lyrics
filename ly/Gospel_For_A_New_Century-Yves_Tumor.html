		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I can solve it
I can be your all, ain't no problem, baby
You can be more but you're heartless, darling, oh
But I've already solved it
Say what you really mean, take it softer
I looked you in your eyes, it was over
'Cause when I really needed you the most, yeah, you were gone then
That Summer, but I can't be there
And this ain't by design, I adore you
I really wanna be there, oh (oh)

This ain't by design, girl
Take it softer
You know I'm out my mind, girl
Don't make this harder
Come and light my fire, baby
How much longer 'til December?
Say what you really mean

Take it softer
I looked you in your eyes, it was over
'Cause when I really needed you the most, yeah, you were gone then
That Summer, but I can't be there
And this ain't by design, I adore you
I really wanna be there, oh (oh)

This ain't by design, girl
Take it softer
You know I'm out my mind, girl
Don't make this harder
Come and light my fire, baby
How much longer 'til December?
Say what you really mean, uh, huh
