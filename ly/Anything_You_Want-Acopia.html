		  cnything you want, baby
I will come on through
I know I know you better than the rest of them do
cnything you want baby
I will come on through
I know I know you better than the rest of them do, yeah

But it never has to end like this
I'm probably gonna wake up next to you
But it doesn't have to end like this
I'm probably gonna wake up next to you
Though it doesn't have to end like this
I'm probably gonna wake up next to you
Though it doesn't have to end like this
I'm probably gonna wake up next to you

cnything you want baby
I will come on through
I know I know you better than the rest of them do, yeah

cnything you want baby
I will come on through
I know I know you better than the rest of them do
