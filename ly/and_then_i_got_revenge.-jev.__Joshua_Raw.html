		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitches ah, I don't keep the metal man
You can trust that my bitch got the melanin
You can bet that I be in my element, periodic
Y'all so irrelevant, I'll be honest
Discussing what's heaven sent, i'm the topic
These jeans was eleven cents, and I rock em
Like chairs you be chilling in
At the top, and don't know where the ceiling is
Who's gon stop me ? i'm eating the beat
Chopping and chewing, ain't leaving a piece
She went to Atlanta, i'm beating the peach
She throwing a tantrum, i'm leaving her weak
Still whippin a civic like it was a phantom
My speed be expanding, this shit Japanese
My necklace outstanding, it's need anti freeze
They keep taking shots and i'm telling them cheese
Came through the parliaments
With the taliban tanks from the parliaments
Fuck a lincoln, I'ma need a whole parliament
All my notes on c in this parliament
On my melancholy ass in this element
Hater niggas really red cones in this element
Jevy bout to release a whole wrath in his element
Shawty really wanna rock rock with my element
I'm breaking that lease in my element
Nigga I was counting that green like the heineken
Aim a red dot say cheese you a veteran
Nigga fuck you and the room and the elephant
Bet they never seen a king in his element, tell 'em jev
Bet they never seen better elegance
Middle finger in the room proper etiquette
How you niggas getting bodied bag
by the immigrant, bitches ah
