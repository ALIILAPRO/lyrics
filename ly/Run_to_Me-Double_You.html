		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You gotta run to me
Uuh can't you see
You gotta run to me
I always thought you were my friend
I never knew that this could end
I'm still thinking about you
Now and it's hard to find your way
I never wanted to let you go
You gotta run to me
Uuh can't you see
You gotta run to me
Uuh can't you see
You gotta run to me
I never needed anyone but you
Once again just let me be
Your precious Baby
So there she goes my girl
She's playing like a fool
But now we have to say goodbye
