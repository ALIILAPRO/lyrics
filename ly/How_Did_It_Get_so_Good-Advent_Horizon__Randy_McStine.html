		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the morning when I'm feeling lost
Unstable and unsure
cfraid that you could turn your back on me
â€˜Cause this is better than what I deserve
The bridges I have burned
Should leave me stranded far out on the sea

You rescued me 
Saved me
Set me free
The best in me
Is brought out by the best in you

For longer than I know 
I've yearned to waste away
I've wandered without aim
c well-worn name without a face 
So tell me why should I
Deserve your saving grace
Cause I'm a lost and hopeless cause
Singing broken worn-out battle songs

You rescued me
Saved me
Set me free
The best in me
Is brought out by the best in you

The best in me
Is brought out by the best in you

How did it get so good?
How did it get so
How did it get so good?
How did it get so

cngel 
Sacrificed
cngel
To keep me alive 
cngel 
Sacrificed
cngel
To keep me alive
Sacrificed
