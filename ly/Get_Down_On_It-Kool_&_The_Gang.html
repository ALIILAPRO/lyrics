		  What you gon' do? You wanna get down?
Tell me, what you gon' do? Do you wanna get down?
What you gon' do? You wanna get down?
What you gon' do? You wanna get down? Tell me

Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it

How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall?
(Get your back up off the wall) tell me
How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall?
(Get your back up off the wall) 
'Cause I heard all the people sayin'

Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, come on and 
Get down on it, baby, baby
Get down on it, get on it
Get down on it

I say people (what?) What you gonna do?
You gotta get on the groove
If you want your body to move, tell me, baby

How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall? 
(Get your back up off the wall) tell me
How you gonna do it if you really won't take a chance
By standing on the wall?
(Get your back up off the wall)
'Cause I heard all the people sayin'

Get down on it, get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, when you're dancin'
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it
Get down on it, sha-baba-daba-doo

What you gon' do? (Uh) do you wanna get down? (Ah)
What you gon' do? (Uh, ah)
Get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on, get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on

Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it (get down on it), come on and
Get down on it, baby, baby
Get down on it (get down it), get on it
Get down on it

How you gonna do it if you really don't wanna dance
By standing on the wall? 
(Get your back up off the wall) tell me, baby
How you gonna do it if you really won't take a chance
By standing on the wall?
(Get your back up off the wall)
Listen, baby

You know it, when you're dancin', yeah
You show it, when you move, move, move
You know it, when you're dancin', yeah
You show it, as you move across the floor

Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, baby, baby
Get down on it, get on it
Get down on it, sha-baba-daba-doo

What you gon' do? (Uh) do you wanna get down? (Ah)
What you gon' do? (Uh, ah)
Get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on, get your back up off the wall
Dance, come on

Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, if you really want it
Get down on it, you gotta feel it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, come on and
Get down on it, get down it on
Get down on it, while you're dancin'
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it (get down on it)
Get down on it (ooh-ooh ooh yeah)
Get down on it (get down on it)
Get down on it (you move me baby, when you move)
Get down on it (get down on it)
Get down on it, get down
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get your back up off the wall
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get down
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get your back up off the wall
Get down on it, get down
Get down on it
Get down on it, get down on it
Get down on it, get your back up off the wall
