		  (One, two, three)
(One, two)

Yesterday, it finally came, a sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you (ooh)
Thought that we could hide away in a corner of the heath
There's never been someone who's so perfect for me

But I got over it and I said
"Give me somethin' old and red"
I pay for it more than I did back then

There's just no gettin' through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you

Sittin' in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we've been
You're always there, so don't overthink
I'm so over whites and pinks

I pay for it more than I did back then

There's just no gettin' through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
1982
Just me and you
There's just no gettin' through
The grape juice blues

(One, two, three)
(One, two, three)
(One, two, three)
(One)
