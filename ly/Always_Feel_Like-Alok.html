		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, ooh oh oh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?
I always feel like, feel like
Feel like, feel like, feel like
Feel like, feel like, feel

I always feel like somebody's watching me

(Somebody's watching me)
(Somebody's)
(And I have no privacy, ooh oh oh)
(Somebody's watching me)

Somebody's watching me, ooh oh oh
Somebody's watching me

(Ooh oh oh)
(Somebody's watching me)

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, ooh oh oh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy, ooh oh oh
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?

I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, feel like

(Somebody's watching me)
