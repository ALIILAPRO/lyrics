		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you got it, it ain't a question
Ooh, it ain't no room for guessing
No more than emotionally invested (no, no)
Showing you all my imperfections, oh

If I let you, you'll take me for granted, yeah
If I'm worth more than you could manage, manage, yeah

Open with me, oh, we could be honest
Closer to me, oh, giving me solace
Promise that you won't let me fall

Holding me tight
Loving me right
Giving me life
All night
You could be
(You could be)
Telling me lies
Making me cry
Wasting my time
The whole time
So just be
Careful what you take for granted, yeah
'Cause with me, know you could do damage
You, you could do damage
You, you could do damage, yeah, uh

Worried 'bout it, I'm putting pressure (you know)
You'll only cut me if I let you
No, he ain't the one, it's just for pleasure
Either learn me or I'm a lesson gone, oh

If you want me, don't take me for granted, yeah, yeah
If I'm worth more than you could manage, baby

Oh, you're falling for me 
Oh, baby, I caught it
Ooh, we could be whatever you wanna call it
Promise that you won't let me fall, oh

Holding me tight
Loving me right
Giving me life
All night
You could be
Telling me lies
Making me cry
Wasting my time
The whole time
So just be
Careful what you take for granted, yeah, uh
'Cause with me, know you could do damage
You, uh, you could do damage
You, you could do damage
Oh, you could do damage
No, you could do damage, yeah
Oh, you could do damage, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, you could do damage on me
