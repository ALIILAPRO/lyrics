		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t want to lie
You such  a good guy
But know that I am
I’m healing my mind

I love when u kiss me
when u hold my hand
Don’t wanna pretend

Cause I won't take it slow
And let you know
That I ‘been hurt so bad before
We can try but I don’t want no

Expectations

Don’t you say, say goodbye
You are all in my mind
I wish I could make you mine
We’re riding through the sky.

Don’t you say, say goodbye
You are all in my mind
I wish I could make you mine
We’re riding through the sky

We’re riding through the sky
We’re riding through the sky

Let’s party tonight
Forget bout the time
Get a little closer
Let’s just have some fun
Don’t want you to hold back
Just be who you are

At least for the night

Cause I won't take it slow
And let you know
That I ‘been hurt so bad before
We can try but I don’t want no

Expectations

Don’t you say, say goodbye
You are all in my mind
I wish I could make you mine
We’re riding through the sky.

Don’t you say, say goodbye
You are all in my mind
I wish I could make you mine
We’re riding through the sky

We’re riding through the sky

We’re riding through the sky
