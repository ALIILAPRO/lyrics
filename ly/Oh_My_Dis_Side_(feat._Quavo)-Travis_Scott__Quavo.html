		  Yeah
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time
Oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
(Yeah)
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time
Oh my
Oh my, oh my

I've been up for a long time
Broad day
I've been popping pills
Pouring syrup, everyday
Cuzo hanging at my aunty house (bando!) selling ye
I got shooters dressed in camo (Grrrra!)
Oh my
I've been in and out the courthouse, jury tripping
I've been flipping, flipping syrup, sipping, water whipping
Mama kicked me out the house now, oh my
I might end up on the couch now, oh my
I'm on a flight now (yeah!), oh my
LA at another couch now, oh my
I'm counting up nothing but Benjamin's right now (money!)
Oh my
I'm on a flight now, we so high
About to get some cash now (cash!), oh my
Got my momma that new house now (momma!), oh my
Now she cannot kick me out now (no!), oh my
I've been up for a long time (La Flame!), oh my

Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time
Oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
Oh my, oh my
I've been up for a long time, oh my
Oh my, oh my

Wow
Let me tell you a little story about this side
You really can't make it on this side
Lot of lone stars on this side
I feel a lot at home on this side
Ball 'til we fall on this side
Lit late night on this side
You never come around past midnight
You miss everything on this side

This side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side, yeah

I made a lot of money on this side
Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Clearly I've been thinking about this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back what's been mine
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feeling of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs had to get right
If I could get my partner back it would be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side

This side, this side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side

Young rich nigga from the Northside
Paid my dues on this side
Flipping up bricks on this side
I made it out the hood I'm on the other side
All my niggas on this side
Keep it one hundred on this side
Love to get money on this side
No new niggas on this side
Look at my diamonds don't get blind (don't get blind)
You better handcuff you ho with a zip tie (cuff!)
Cuh, will I take a busta down on this side (woo!)
Broke niggas stand to the left side
Handsome and wealthy on this side
I came from the bottom and now I'm on top that's phenomenal (phenomenal)
This side, this side, this side, this side
If I did not make it, I wonder where I would go
This side, this side, this side
Graduated from the midget
This the life I was living
Graduated to a million
This the money that I'm getting
Graduated from a hotbox now I ride around in a Bentley
This how we do it on

This side, this side, this side
Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side
That's right, that's right
You never come around past midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know how I like my lean, poured right
Just right
On this side
(Find everything you need, everything you need on this side)
This side, this side, this side, this side
