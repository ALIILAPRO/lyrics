		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I found a rope then you would tie the noose
You wouldn't die for me but I would hang for you
Do you call that a friend?
You drop the door while you watch me dance with death

I called your name but you were never there
You only took from me, but did you ever care?
'Cause when your back's to the wall
You disappear just in time to let me fall

Should've known it all along

Take what you need, use me up and then leave
Hard to believe you were company I shouldn't keep
Take what you need, now I see underneath
Wounds cut so deep when you lie to me right through your teeth

It's not love, you wouldn't get it
Accepting apologies but knowing you'd never give it
I think I'm pushed to the edge
Take it or leave it, but I won't forget

Take what you need, use me up and then leave
Hard to believe you were company I shouldn't keep
Take what you need, now I see underneath
Wounds cut so deep when you lie to me right through your teeth

I'm so tired of knives in my back
You smile to my face, it's only a mask
I'm so tired of knives in my back
Now I trust no one, to hell with the rats, go

To hell with the rats

Take what you need, use me up and then leave
Hard to believe you were company I shouldn't keep
Take what you need, now I see underneath
Wounds cut so deep when you lie to me right through your teeth
(Lie to me)
Take what you need
Lie to me right through your teeth
(Lie to me)
Take what you need
Lie to me right through your teeth
