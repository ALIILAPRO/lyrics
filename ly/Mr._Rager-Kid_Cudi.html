		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I'm off on an adventure) yeah, we're good
This is dedicated to all the kids like me
(I'm on my way to Heaven) wherever you are, yeah, now we're good

Birds sing, flyin' around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You might hear the birds singin', flyin' around
You never see them too long on the ground
You wanna be one of them, yeah
You wanna be one of them, yeah
Whoa, now

Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going
Tell us where you're headed
I'm off on an adventure
Mr. Rager, tell me some of your stories
Tell us of your travels
Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going
Tell us where you're headed
I'm on my way to Heaven
Mr. Rager, can we tag along?
Can we take the journey?

Knocked down round for round
You're feelin' like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end?
When will the Heaven begin? Yeah
You might be knocked down round for round
You're feelin' like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? Yeah
When will the Heaven begin? Yeah
Whoa, now

Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going
Tell us where you're headed
I'm off on an adventure
Mr. Rager, tell me some of your stories
Tell us of your travels
Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going
Tell us where you're headed
I'm on my way to Heaven
Mr. Rager, can we tag along?
Can we take the journey?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Can we take the journey?)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Hey, Mr. Rager, Mr. Rager
Tell me where you're going
Tell me where you're headed
I'm off on an adventure
Mr. Rager, tell me some of your stories
Tell us of your travels
Mr. Rager-er-er-er-er
Tell me where you're going
Tell us where you're headed
I'm on my way to Heaven
Mr. Rager, can we tag along?
Can we take that journey?

Can we take that journey?
I'm off on an adventure
Hey, Mr. Rager
Hey, Mr. Rager
I'm on my way to Heaven (hey, Mr. Rager)
