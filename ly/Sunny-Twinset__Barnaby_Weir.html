		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain.
Sunny, you smiled at me and really eased my pain.
Now the dark days are gone, now the bright days are here,
My sunny one joys so sincere.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, I want to thank you for the sunshine you gave.
Sunny, I want to thank you for the love you brought my way.
You gave to me your all and all.
Now I feel ten feet tall.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, I want to thank you for the facts from a to c.
Sunny, I want to thank you for the truth you let me see.
My life was torn like a windblown sand,
And the rock was formed when you stepped.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

Sunny, I want to thank you for the smile upon your face.
Sunny, I want to thank you for the sweet and warm embrace.
You’re my spark of nature’s fire,
You’re my soul and my desire.
Sunny one so true, I love you.

I love you.
I love you.
I love you.
