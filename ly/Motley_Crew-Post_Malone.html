		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (D.A. got that dope)

Count up the bands, stickin' out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I see your whip, hilarious
Where is my roof? Mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior
I get the commas, period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the top of the pyramid
Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
We came to play, it's serious
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew

Sit-up, pour
I just forgot where I was
Pour it up, throw it up, uh
Sit up, what?
Get up, bitch, get up, bitch, get up
Came with a wig splitter
I got John Wick hitters (ooh)
I'ma go get, get up (wow), uh

Came with the army, army, army, yeah
The people 'round me still the same
We just wanna party, party, party, yeah
We rowdy and we'll never chill

Count up the bands, stickin' out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I see your whip, hilarious
Where is my roof? Mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior
I get the commas, period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the top of the pyramid
Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
We came to play, it's serious
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew

What you gon' do? 
I'ma pull up with the crew
When I'm off the juice 
I like to hang out the roof
I'm rockin' jewels 
I like when the diamonds, they move
I just go through 
I do not wait in the queue
Baby, baby
Pick it, Brady, Brady
AP navy, navy 
Chain like two Mercedes
I'll come when they pay me 
Come with Katie, Amy
Crew go crazy, crazy 
Kick it down daily, uh

Came with the army, army, army, yeah
The people 'round me still the same
We just wanna party, party, party, yeah
We rowdy and we'll never chill

Count up the bands, stickin' out
No rubber band is big enough
Chain is so heavy, can't pick it up
Came with the gang, a myriad
I see your whip, hilarious
Where is my roof? Mysterious
My whip from Fast & Furious
Curtains with yellow interior
I get the commas, period
Covered in ice, Siberia
I'm at the top of the pyramid
Bitch, I'm a star, I'm Sirius
We came to play, it's serious
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the gang, a myriad
Came with the motley crew
