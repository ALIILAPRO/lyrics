		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This world, it's full of beautiful places, beautiful places
With you, far and wide, I wanna go, I wanna go
We were lying on the floor and I was staring in your soul, you've been running through my dreams, and darling you know.
And before the sun had risen, yes, we headed for the hills, to watch the sunlight kiss the valley below
This world, it's full of beautiful places, beautiful places
With you, far and wide, I wanna go, I wanna go
Yes I remember the first time I saw you, you were standing by the door, yes, I knew right then and there dear, I wanted more. And before the sun had fallen behind the distant hills, yes, I couldn't feel my heartache anymore.
And this world, it's full of beautiful places, beautiful places
With you, far and wide, I wanna go, I wanna go
I want to travel far and wide, I want you by my side
I wanna sail the ocean blue, I wanna be there with you
I wanna leave it all behind, I want you by my side, oh oh, in this world
