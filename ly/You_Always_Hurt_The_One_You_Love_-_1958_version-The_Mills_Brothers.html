		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You always hurt the one you love 
The one you shouldn't hurt at all 
You always take the sweetest rose 
And crush it till the petals fall 

You always break the kindest heart 
With a hasty word you can't recall, so
If I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all

You always hurt the one you love 
The one you shouldn't hurt at all 
You always take the sweetest rose 
And crush it till the petals fall 

You always break the kindest heart 
With a hasty word you can't recall 
So, if I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all

You always hurt the one you love 
The one you shouldn't hurt at all 
You always take the sweetest rose 
Crush it, till the petals fall 

You always break the kindest heart 
With a hasty word you can't recall, so
If I broke your heart last night
It's because I love you most of all
