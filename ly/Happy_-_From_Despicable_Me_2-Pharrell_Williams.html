		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It might seem crazy what I'm 'bout to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way

Huh, because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Here come bad news, talking this and that
(Yeah) Well, give me all you got, and don't hold it back 
(Yeah) Well, I should probably warn you I'll be just fine 
(Yeah) No offense to you, don't waste your time
Here's why

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Hey, go, uh (happy)
Bring me down, can't nothin' (happy)
Bring me down
My level's too high (happy), to bring me down 
Can't nothin' (happy), bring me down
I said (let me tell you now) uh
Bring me down, can't nothin'
Bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down 
Can't nothin' bring me down
I said

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Hey, go, uh
Bring me down, can't nothin'
Bring me down
My level's too high to bring me down 
Can't nothin' bring me down
I said

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, eh eh eh 
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do

Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you, uh hey
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do, huh come on
