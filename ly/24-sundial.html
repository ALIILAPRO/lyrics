		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm twenty-four now
S'til at my parents house
Thought I would have it figured out
Friends getting married, one has a baby
I barely recognize this town

Mama asked me what my plan is for the future
But I don't even know what's going on for dinner
I'm twenty-four now, thought I could finally settle down

Party's end before I'm drunk
Friday night I'm tired as fuck
I don't know how I ended up like this
Can someone tell me what the hell I missed? (I miss ya)

Birthday's here, I'm s'til depressed
Got no friends, just lots of stress
It feels like yesterday when we were kids
Can someone tell me what the hell I missed?
'Cause I don't know

Sleep 'til the sun's down, another breakdown
Feels like all the days are the same
New type of anxious, school never taught this
And what the fuck are taxes anyway

I tell myself I won't be cynical and bitter
now I see it when I'm looking in the mirror
I'm twenty-four now, wonder when I will be okay

Party's end before I'm drunk
Friday night I'm tired as fuck
I don't know how I ended up like this
Can someone tell me what the hell I missed?

Birthday's here, I'm still depressed
Got no friends, just lots of stress
It feels like yesterday when we were kids
Can someone tell me what the hell I missed?
'Cause I don't know

Oh, 'cause I don't know
Oh, 'cause I don't know
Oh

Can someone tell me what the hell I missed?
'Cause I don't know
