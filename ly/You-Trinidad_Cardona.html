		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everyday I go to sleep i dream of you girl
Hold your hands out and pray for me
Thank god that you're in my world
I only need you in my life I swear
Promise girl I'll always be here
(cause I'm here)
When you addicted, girl I'm right here
Girl I promise I don't really
Care for nobody but you

You you you you you you
I only want you you you you you you you
When you down I'll pick you up
Girl I swear you're my good luck
Together they can't stop us
I only want you you you you you you you
I only want you

Girl you always on my mind
I wake up every night you always on my mind
I never knew that I could be such a lucky guy
Everyday I try to find
A girl as good as mine
But she finer than wine
I don't wanna waste no time
Imma really make you mine
My lover and my wife eternity and life
I will always give a fight
I don't want nobody else
I'll leave them on the shelf
Fuck 'em, wish 'em well
Making wishes in a well
We are never gonna fail

I'm feeling up like brail
My lover kill make them frail
And my relevance makes thee real
The ends of the good but you off your rail
You roll with the boy like wheels
I know that you don't want gang
Cause I seen that post and I know it's real
Real

Everyday I go to sleep i dream of you girl
Hold your hands out and pray for me
Thank god that you're in my world
I only need you in my life I swear
Promise girl I'll always be here
(cause I'm here)
When you addicted, girl I'm right here
Girl I promise I don't really
Care for nobody but you

You you you you you you
I only want you you you you you you you
When you down I'll pick you up
Girl I swear you're my good luck
Together they can't stop us
I only want you you you you you you you
I only want you

Girl you always on my mind
Promise that I really don't care
For nobody but you you you you you you you
I only want you you you you you you you
Girl you always on my mind i only want you
I only want you
