		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't tread on me
I said, don't tread on me
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail 
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail 
Never begins it, never, but once engaged
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rage 
I said don't tread on me 

So be it 
Threaten no more 
To secure peace is to prepare for war 
So be it 
Settle the score 
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore
Hey
Don't tread on me 

Love it or leave it, she with the deadly bite 
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as lighting strike 
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance 
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilance 
Ooh no, no, no don't tread on me 

So be it 
Threaten no more 
To secure peace is to prepare for war 
So be it 
Settle the score 
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore
Don't tread on me 

So be it 
Threaten no more 
To secure peace is to prepare for war 
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail 
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail 

So be it 
Threaten no more 
To secure peace is to prepare for war 
So be it 
Settle the score 
Touch me again for the words that you'll hear evermore
Don't tread on me
