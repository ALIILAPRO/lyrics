		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on the road-road-road
Always on go-go-go (grrah, everything for Notti)
I'm feelin' low-low-low (you know what the fuck goin' on)
Pour a four-four-four (grrah-grrah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)

They had a special place in my heart so I tried fixing them while they were breakin' me
I learned the hard way, but I don't do it no more thankfully
Turned to a beast when Notti died, I told 'em, "Wait and see"
I wasn't 'posed to make it this far 
I'm talkin' racially, so this shit feels make believe
I wish Lil' Notti woulda stuck with me in the streets
I ain't ever parked a V and I've been on the charts for weeks
I had a vision no one seen, not even my family (not even my family)
Music is savin' me, but I know it could end fatally (painfully)
So I keep that .40 on my side, ain't no one tamin' me (I'ma pray for me)
I wasn't perfect as a kid, but I still ate my greens
And I started workin' in the crib while my friends were smokin' weed
I started doin' good and got more enemies
I keep my face up off the 'Net when I be in the streets
I know my boys got my back, but when it comes to totin' straps 
Hope they don't run when the bullets gotta handle me

Ah, every opp shot
Grrah, Mabu (grrah)
Grrah, Mabu (like)
Grrah, grrah, every opp shot, like
Grrah, gang-gang-gang, gang
Gang-gang-gang, like

Ayy, yo, Mabu, throw (boom) 
When we bend through the opps, get low
I said, "DD, we clutchin' the cane or the pole?"
Red light, green beam, hang out, throw
For Lil' Notti, I'm flockin'
Catch a opp, put his life turn timeless
Totin' the .30, I ain't totin' a rocket (brrt)
Ddot with me for the niggas that's plottin', grrah
Dead opps all in my blunt
Bitch is a munch and she ate it for fun (on bro)
Bitch, I'm that nigga that do what I want
Bend that ass over and wine on my gun
Yeah, he died one time on the earth (grrah) 
Now he died two times (times)
Put the beam to the blunt
I don't even smoke but feel him in my lungs
DD got left, Mabu got right (right)
Just know I still smoke Rite (damn, damn)
Like, grrah, grrah, just know I smoke Rite (damn)
I ain't goin' out without a fight (facts)
I got diamonds on me, shed the light (the light)
Your bitch callin' DD to get piped, while I'm callin DD for the pipe
And if brodie get stuck in a slammer (the slammer)
Mabu gon' help beat the case (facts)
I'm a lawyer, I always got answers (answers) 
Fuckin' bitches on the first date (damn)
I got bitches on me, Alabama, I keep one in every other state (state)

Bitch, I feel I great
Damn, every opp shot, nigga
Suck my dick, like
Grrah-grrah, gang-gang-gang
