		  Trophy

I just wanna take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy
I won me a trophy (I won, I won, I won)
A trophy

I just wanna take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
A trophy
I won me a trophy
A trophy

I won me a trophy
Trophy
I won me a trophy
A trophy (ay)

Get to fuckin' on the dresser just to make that pussy wetter
Gotta put you in that vintage then you rockin' Perry Ellis
Then I leave with you
Only cause I believe in you
We get to bangin' on the walls just to piss the neighbors off
You and them twelve foot ceilings
I just painted through halls so I can be with you
I wanna live my dream with you
You say that money don't matter it's times and the memories
Now that ass gettin' fatter and I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
I know it's because of me
Got you in custody
Whoever knockin at the door, they gotta wait til we finished
I know I started at the bottom but that not ain't where endin'

I just wanna take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy
I won me a trophy (I won, I won, I won)
A trophy

I won me a trophy
Trophy
I won me a trophy
A trophy (you the, you the, you the)

You the number one trophy wife
So it's only right to live the trophy life
You grew up on J. Lo, Timberlands by Manolo now
Till one day I put an angel in your ultrasound
I wanna dip that ass in gold
I wanna dip that ass in gold
I made it over NBA, NFL players
So every time I score it's like the Super Bowl
Baby, we should hit the south of France
So you could run around without them pants
I put that glacier on your little hand
Now that's the only thing without a tan
My trophy on that Bound bike, I gave you only pipe
If people don't hate then it won't be right
You could look at Kylie, Kendall, Kourtney and Khloe
All your Mama ever made was trophies, right?

I just wanna take you out and show you off
You already know that you the perfect one
Girl when I'm with you, feel like a champion
Ever since I got with you I feel like I done won me a trophy
Trophy
I won me a trophy
A trophy

I won me a trophy
Trophy
I won me a trophy (I won, I won, I won)
A trophy
