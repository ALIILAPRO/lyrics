		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ey, ah, nothing
Pull the trigger
Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger

Maybe, you should pull the fucking trigger

Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

Yeah, why you believing the propaganda?
Why everybody sound like they want to be from Atlanta?
Are you the voice or the echo?
Are you the nail or the hammer?
I be talking while chewing my beats, I don't mind my manners
Choruses that fit the opera, that's why I need phantoms
I got my doubt at gun point, that's why I need ransoms
And I be handsome, that's why I got your girl before the money
Honestly, I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties
But I'm cool with how it's happening
Girl in San Fran who wants to cross routes with me
Like a young Colin Kaepernick
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passing it
'Cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
Trying to buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move
All the times my mom cried 'cause she ain't know what else to do
All the times she lost hope 'cause she ain't know what else to lose
All the times I shoot shots 'cause I don't know what else to shoot, man

Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot

I'ma stay winning, I don't believe in luck
I believe that life's a buffet, better eat it up
I've seen enough to know that I'm really 'bout to blow
Never felt like an employee, always felt like CEO
Even when I stacked shoes, I was never clocked in
Yeah, I always walked out, but I never walked in
That's a tribute to my head-space
And lately my Devils have been Spanish chicks in red lace
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days
More like ten months, but I got out of it
If I fall in love again, it's probably with a Saudi chick
But I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo

Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot
Pull the trigger, ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Pull the trigger, don't hesitate, just shoot
