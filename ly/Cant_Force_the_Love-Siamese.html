		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't tell you if it was for nothing
But I just wanna tell you one thing
I should have shown you all my scars 
Before they tore us apart
You could have known right from the start
I was so afraid of looking weak
Lost in my ways into deep.

And knowing that my soul was tearing me in two
Im sorry that I couldn't face the truth.
Cause I could feel it in my bones
before I knew we would never be enough
So I lied to myself. 
Even though I tried, I can't force the love
You burned yourself on something cold 
Because I could never give you what you want.
And I lied to myself, even though I try
I can not force the love.

I always give up, when things got difficult
Cause love never fit in with the cynical
And that's why I had to leave 
Before you'd see me bleed
I'll never be the person that you need 
I hope that you find someone that you deserve
Someone who's not afraid of getting hurt
Cause I only crawl so I don't have to fall
I'd rather have nothing than take it all

Cause I could feel it in my bones
Before I
knew we would never be enough
So I lied
To myself. Even though I tried,
I can not
Force the love
You Burned yourself on something cold 
Because I
Could never give you what you want.
And I lied

To Myself, even though I try
I can not Force the Love.
