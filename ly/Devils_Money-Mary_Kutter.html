		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Barchtown, Kentucky, in the middle of the 20s
Somewhere between heaven and hell
Great grand-daddy was a deacon but he struggled breaking even
'Til he started running bottles out the Bible Belt
Some called him a sinner, only knew him for his sins
Some called him a saint because they knew where that cash went

They say you can't buy salvation
That ain't how it works
But if you ask that congregation
Sunday morning in their brand new church
They'd say, bless the man with the still and the holler
Turning corn into shine, shine into dollars
And holy water flowing like milk and honey
Build that Lord's house with the devil's money (devil's money)

Throw whiskey in the cellar, set him up like Rockefeller
You can judge him but he did some good
Using outlaw cash for pews and stained glass
Like a righteous redneck Robin Hood

They say you can't buy salvation
That ain't how it works
But if you ask that congregation
Sunday morning in their brand new church
They'd say, bless the man with the still and the holler
Turning corn into shine, shine into dollars
And holy water flowing like milk and honey
Build that Lord's house with the devil's money

Did he let his little light shine
Or let a little shine light the way?
Is he walking on the streets of gold
Or was there hell to pay?

You can't buy salvation
That ain't how it works
But if you ask that congregation
Sunday morning in their brand new church
They'd say, bless the man with the still and the holler
Turning corn into shine, shine into dollars
And holy water flowing like milk and honey
Build that Lord's house with the devil's money
Build that Lord's house with the devil's money
