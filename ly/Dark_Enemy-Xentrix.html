		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blackness, fills the sight I see,
Destruction, malignancy.
Intense pain, ripping through my veins,
Try so hard but this enemy remains.
Demonic passion, you can't dismiss,
Bleak depression, you reminisce.
Enforce the grip, on your life,
Try to remove it, with a knife.

Face your dark enemy.
Face your dark enemy.
Infestation, you can;t see,
Realisation is yet to be.
Infection, pumping through,
They don't know, haven't got a clue.
Remember what it was like before.
It grabbed you, blacked out all you saw.
Conspiracy, inside your head,
Until you think you're already dead.
Face your...
The pressure's on, time ticks away,
Immobilized, you try to delay.
Memories gone, you're unaware.
Your will to live replaced by despair,
Screams of pain you emanate.
Have no faith you're full of hate.
Helpless now, so full of fear,
No point in this, your end is here.

Face your...
