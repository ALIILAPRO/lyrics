		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop.
Take a moment if the pressure's too much.
You've been racing, never patient, you're always in a rush.
We all know you're a savant.
Is this what you really want?
Stop.
When it's night and you're alone with your thoughts
Do you want some retribution for the life that you got?
Did you wanna be someone
When it's all been said and done?
I tried to fight and thank you for your time like you wanted.
Forget the pain and take it all away like you wanted.
Stop.
There's a reason you're never in one place.
You can't outrun the devil if it lives in your face.
You'll never get this right.
There's darkness and there's light.
I tried to fight and thank you for your time like you wanted.
Forget the pain and take it all away like you wanted.
There's a reason that you'll never stay.
Some people just aren't built that way.
You're running out of time. You got yourself in line
Like you wanted.
