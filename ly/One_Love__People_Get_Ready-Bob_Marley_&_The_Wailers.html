		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One love, one heart
Let's get together and feel all right
Hear the children crying (one love)
Hear the children crying (one heart)
Sayin', "Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right"
Sayin', "Let's get together and feel all right"
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Let them all pass all their dirty remarks (one love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (one heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinner
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own?
Believe me

One love (what about one heart?)
One heart (what about the love?)
Let's get together and feel all right
As it was in the beginning (one love)
So shall it be in the end (one heart)
Alright, give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Let's get together and feel all right
One more thing

Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (one love)
So when the Man comes there will be no, no doom (one song)
Have pity on those whose chances grow thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of Creation

Sayin', one love (what about the one heart?)
One heart (what about the?)
Let's get together and feel all right
I'm pleading to mankind (one love)
One heart (one heart) whoa
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Let's get together and feel all right

Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel all right
Said let's get together and feel all right
