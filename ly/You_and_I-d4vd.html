		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dream about you and I
But why do I even try?
'Cause you're running away, running away
And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay

But what I'm trying to say 
Is that I've been okay but without you
Feel like I'm trapped in a maze
We're going our separate ways and I'm without you

I dream about you and I
But why do I even try?
When you're running away, running away
And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay
I dream about you and I
But why do I even try?
When you're running away, running away
And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay

Different options and different paths
I hope that your happy, I hope it lasts
Let's hope we can leave everything in the past
Times are changing and my time your wasting while you're here
You're never near me you act like you fear me
Now it's clear

I dream about you and I
But why do I even try?
When you're running away, running away
And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay
I dream about you and I
But why do I even try?
When you're running away, running away
And I'm trying to stay, trying to stay
