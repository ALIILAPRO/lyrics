		  (Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)

Did you find? What did you find? (what did you find?)
Goin' through my phone, what did you find? (what did you find?)
Baby, give me dome, give me your mind (give me your mind)
All I see is those dollar signs (dollar signs)
I got trees to roll, I'm 'bout to climb ('Bout to climb)
'Member we was po', they wouldn't give me no time (Me no time)
Had to switch my phone, man, they leaked my line (They leaked my line)
Had to get this dough and stay on my grind

Had to cut that ho she was outta line (she was outta line)
Miss yo' waterfall, wet all the time (all the time)
And my chain fireworks, 4th of July (so fire)
I just got a new watch, Land Before Time (before time)
And she's givin' me top, losin' her mind (lose your mind)
And she love my hot dog, yeah, she's a swine (she a swine)
Yea', I'm stuck in a box, feel like a mime (I'm a mime)
Hey, I'ma wipe your tears while you cry (while you cry)

Did you find? What did you find? (what did you find?)
Goin' through my phone, what did you find? (what did you find?)
Baby, give me dome, give me your mind (give me your mind)
All I see is those dollar signs (dollar signs)
I got trees to roll, I'm 'bout to climb ('bout to climb)
'Member we was po', they wouldn't give me no time (me no time)
Had to switch my phone, man, they leaked my line (they leaked my line)
Had to get this dough and stay on my grind (on my grind)

We could never fold, yeah, we in a bind (in a bind)
I can't let you go (I can't let you go)
Yeah, Mufasa lied (I'mma lie)
I can't die alone, I need you by my side (by my side)
Contestant on a show, girl, you know I try (know I try)
Hey, racin' for your soul, what a stride (what a stride)
I can't love her, no, my heart slide (my heart slide)
Miss yo' waterfall, wet all the time (all the time)
Hey, I'ma wipe your tears while you cry (while you cry)

Did you find? (girl, don't cry)
What did you find? (girl, don't cry)
Goin' through my phone (girl, don't cry)
What did you find? (girl, don't cry)
Baby, give me dome (give me dome)
Give me your mind (give me your mind)
All I see is those dollar signs (dollar signs)
I got trees to roll (I got trees, woah)
I'm 'bout to climb ('bout to climb)
'Member we was po', ('member we was po')
They wouldn't give me no time (me no time)
Had to switch my phone (had to switch my phone)
Man, they leaked my line (they leaked my line)
Had to get this dough (had to get) and stay on my grind

Did you find? (girl, don't cry) 
What did you find? (girl, don't cry)
Goin' through my phone (girl, don't cry)
What did you find? (girl, don't cry)
Baby, give me dome (give me dome)
Give me your mind (give me your mind)
All I see is those dollar signs (dollar signs)
I got trees to roll (I got trees, whoa)
I'm 'bout to climb ('bout to climb)
'Member we was po', ('member we was po') 
They wouldn't give me no time (me no time)
Had to switch my phone (had to switch my phone)
man, they leaked my line (they leaked my line)
Had to get this dough (had to get this dough)
And stay on my grind
(Yo Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Damn Pi'erre, where'd you find this?
Aw
