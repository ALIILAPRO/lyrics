		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one will listen here
Too late now, so we dread it
Decrepit word and lies
Will we live to regret it?

Our castle's burning down
Not a soul left is sentient
Give us the eyes to make us wise
Your temple's crumbling down
No disguise for the revenant
Your death is spiritual
Read it on to you like you never had said it

A stone around your neck
And you're thrown to the weather
You should be burnt alive
Lacking dignity, together

Your castle's burning down
Not a soul left is sentient
Your temple's crumbling down
No disguise for the revenant
Justice is fear for you
Sentence on to you and a curse to remember

No one will listen here
Too late now, so we dread it
Decrepit word and lies
Will we live to regret it?

Our castle's crumbling down
Not a soul left is sentient
Your temple's crumbling down
No disguise for the revenant
Your death is spiritual
Sentence on to you and a curse to remember

No one will listen here
No one will listen here
No one will listen here
No one will listen here
