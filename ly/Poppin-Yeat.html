		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need my drugs, I need my love (we get high)
Bitches pullin' up and they suck us up (hey)
I'm in the Tonka, baby, yeah, come show me love (ooh)
Ion't fuck with nobody, lil' bitch, I show you nun' (show you nun')
I ain't trustin' nobody, lil' bitch, I keep a gun
If a problem come up (yeah), you know I'm not gon' run
Feel like Osama to us, 'cause we blow up like a bomb (boom)
Roll him like a filter, yeah, then smoke him like a bong (phew)

We been outside, man, all day
We just countin' racks, all day, don't play
Huh, huh-huh, we been outside, man (ooh)
We been outside, man (BenjiCold, why you icy?)
We got racks out, bitch, we goin' shoppin' (shoppin')
When you get like this, you rich, lil' bitch, you poppin'
It ain't been a day that I ain't been high, bitch, Percs', I pop 'em, yeah
They told me that they broke, that's not my problem, yeah (that's not my problem)
You know he test the gang, you know we pop him, yeah (boom, boom, boom)
We ain't got time to play, we outside, popped him, yeah (LA, LA, LA)
I told my bitch I need one, need a topper, a bopper
I pulled inside this Lamb', I chopped it up like helicopter
Slide in the coupes, we fucked the driveway up (skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
Hopped inside the mansion, fucked the drywall up
Kickin' holes in the wall, and fuckin' hoes in my draws
I don't feel the same at all, I'm havin' Percocet withdrawl
No, you don't know me like you say you did, you don't know me, not at all (not at all)
You might catch me in the Tesla, 'cause it's drivin', I'm noddin' off
Yeah, they tried to show me they music, told that bitch to turn it off
And we pulled up to the show, we turned they city up a notch (yeah)

I need my drugs, I need my love (we get high)
Bitches pullin' up and they suck us up (hey)
I'm in the Tonka, baby, yeah, come show me love (ooh)
Ion't fuck with nobody, lil' bitch, I show you nun' (show you nun')
I ain't trustin' nobody, lil' bitch, I keep a gun
If a problem come up (yeah), you know I'm not gon' run
Feel like Osama to us, 'cause we blow up like a bomb
Roll him like a filter, yeah, then smoke him like a bong (phew)

We been outside, man, all day
We just countin' racks, all day, don't play
Huh, huh-huh, we been outside, man (ooh)
We been outside, man (BenjiCold, why you icy?)
We got racks out, bitch, we goin' shoppin' (shoppin')
When you get like this, you rich, lil' bitch, you poppin'
It ain't been a day that I ain't been high, bitch, Percs', I pop 'em, yeah
