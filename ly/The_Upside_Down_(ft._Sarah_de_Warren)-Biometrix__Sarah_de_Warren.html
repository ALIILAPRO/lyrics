		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE

Wrong side of the bed im treading lightly 
The demons in my head are sleeping quietly 
Please don't wake em up
I'm just not strong enough

Signal getting low im disconnected
My head is trippin out like it’s electric
No use tryna pray they’ll catch you anyway

PRE

Same streets but i’m all alone
Same house but nobody’s home 
Stone cold, and i fade in the afterglow

CHORUS

Caught in the upside down 
Careful in the clouds 
Monsters all around
Can't find my way out 
Caught in the upside down 
Screaming with no sound 
Sinking underground 
Can't find my way out 
Caught in the upside down

VERSE

They said the laws of physics don’t apply here 
Eleven hours sets you back a light year
Thought i knew myself, til the walls started to melt

PRE

Same streets but i’m all alone
Same house but nobody’s home 
Stone cold, and i fade in the afterglow

CHORUS

Caught in the upside down 
Careful in the clouds 
Monsters all around
Can't find my way out
The Upside Down
Caught in the upside down 
Screaming with no sound 
Sinking underground 
Can't find my way out 
Caught in the upside down
Same streets but i’m all alone
Same house but nobody’s home 
Stone cold, and i fade in the afterglow
