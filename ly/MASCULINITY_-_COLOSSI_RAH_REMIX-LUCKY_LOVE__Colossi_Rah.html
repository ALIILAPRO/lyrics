		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s been in my head for so long after
They told me these words i can remember
It keeps coming on and on
They kept beating on and on my face
If they keep telling I’m a liar
Babe it’s not my fault I built these layers
I can’t meet myself

What about my masculinity
What the fuck Is wrong with my body
Am I not enough ?
Who gives you the right to run to rules ?
Who gives you the right to run to rules ?

What’s wrong with you ?

Tell me baby baby

Do I walk like a boy
Do I speak like a boy
Do I stand like a boy
Sorry babe
You keep asking
Do I kiss like a boy
Should I spit like a boy
May I fuck other boys
Tell me baby baby

Do I walk like a boy
Do I speak like a boy
Do I stand like a boy
Sorry babe
You keep asking
Do I kiss like a boy
Should I spit like a boy
May I fuck other boys
Tell me baby baby

My flesh to jail my soul
I just feel like I can fall my
Muscle’s not sharp enough
and my hair is way too long and
What about my voice ?
What about my voice ?
Do you think I sound
Like the other boys ?

Do I walk like a boy
Do I speak like a boy
Do I stand like a boy
Sorry babe
You keep asking
Do I kiss like a boy
Should I spit like a boy
May I fuck other boys
Tell me baby baby

Do I walk like a boy
Do I speak like a boy
Do I stand like a boy
Sorry babe
You keep asking
Do I kiss like a boy
Should I spit like a boy
May I fuck other boys
Tell me baby baby

What about my masculinity
What the fuck is wrong with my body ?
Am I not enough
Or even too much
It would be shortsighted to try
Is it coming threw you mind that
I don’t care to be a man
