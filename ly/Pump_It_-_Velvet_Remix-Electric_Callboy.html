		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna feel it day and night
You are the power of my life
I wanna pump it better

I wanna feel it day and night
My workout, my delight
You are the power of my life
I wanna pump it better

I wanna feel that burn
In my testo bod
The anabolic superman
You'll never gonna stop, yeah

You better suck it up
Before you suck it in
Activating motherfucking beast mode
Everybody down

Do you really wanna work it out?
'Cause I won't take it slow
This fucking life is what I'm all about
I wanna feel it day and night

I wanna feel it day and night
My workout, my delight
You are the power of my life
I wanna pump it better

I wanna feel it day and night
My workout, my delight
You are the power of my life
I wanna pump it better

Just look at my glutes
What a perfect butt
I'm pumping like a pro
And I never really stop

I push myself
And I push you too
My body is a board
Look at me! Fuck you!
Get down!

Do you really wanna work it out?
'Cause I won't take it slow!
This fucking life is what I'm all about
You see me going deeper!
With every rep, you can see me grow every day, deeper
Speed it up, let's do it again

I wanna feel it day and night
My workout, my delight
You are the power of my life
I wanna pump it better

I wanna feel it day and night
My workout, my delight
You are the power of my life
I wanna pump it better

Pump it

And if you feel like your body's given up
You gotta kill the pain and just pump it harder!
And if you feel like the pain is getting real
Then make it your life goal to fucking kill that bitch
To fucking kill that bitch

Wake up, beast mode
Every single day, I'm gonna push it fucking hard
And it goes
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, pow, I just wanna pump it
