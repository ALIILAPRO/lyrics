		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a week and I can't tell you a thing I did 
I can't sleep, All my friends they're worried again
It's a cycle I won't outgrow 
I'm the punchline of some sick joke
I can't bring myself to leave home 
But I'm terrified to be alone 

I say that I'm fine but it feels like I'm dying
Why do the words in my head get so violent
Half of the time I'm just barely surviving
But I'm trying, I'm trying

No surprise that I'm not one for resolutions 
Even in the best times, I'm too scared to smell the roses
It's a cycle I won't outgrow 
I'm the punchline of some sick joke
I can't bring myself to leave home 
But I'm terrified to be alone 

I say that I'm fine but it feels like I'm dying
Why do the words in my head get so violent
Half of the time I'm just barely surviving
But I'm trying, im trying

Tryna be everything to everybody
I feel so much that I almost feel nothing
Half of the time I'm just barely surviving
But 
I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying
Ohh Yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying
Yeah
I'm trying, I'm trying
