		  (You hear a boom in the party)
(In the party)
(In, in, in the party)
(You hear a boom in the party)
(In the party)
(In, in, in the party)

'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
I know how you feel me
'Cause I love that boom
I know you want me, you need me
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
I know how you feel me
'Cause I love that boom
I know you want me, you need me

You hear a boom in the party
You hear a boom in the party
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
You hear a boom in the party
You hear a boom
You hear a boom
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah

You hear a boom in the party
It's me when I'm arriving
Don't try to touch me, baby
Don't you see that I shine?
I know that you want a piece
Sorry, baby, I'm not a gift
Nobody can stop me
'Ca-'ca-'cause
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah

'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
I know how you feel me
'Cause I love that boom
I know you want me, you need me
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
I know how you feel me
'Cause I love that boom
I know you want me, you need me

You hear a boom in the party
You hear a boom in the party
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
You hear a boom in the party
You hear a boom
You hear a boom
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah

You hear a boom in the party
It's me when I'm arriving
Don't try to touch me, baby
Don't you see that I shine?
I know that you want a piece
Sorry, baby, I'm not a gift
Nobody can stop me
'Ca-'ca-'cause
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah

Yo tengo el tumbao
Que te gusta y que te mueve
Pero no te desesperes, mami
Yo tengo el tumbao
Que te gusta y que te mueve
Pero no te desesperes, mami

You hear a boom in the party
In, in, in the party
In, in, in the party
'Cause I'm crazy
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
You hear a boom in the party
It's me when I'm arriving
Don't try to touch me, baby
Don't you see?
'Cause I'm crazy, yeah
You hear a boom in the party
