		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  That's what you needed
People you love to be there to support and believe in 
See, the best part is when you realize you're not scared 
To find (to find) find the good (good) inside
Don't let you fears guide your feelings

We all got bad sides
But all that matters in front of your eyes
Love is not hard to find
If we believe in us

As hard as it can be
Remember by your side you got a family
No matter what
We're gonna love you for who you are there's no limit
Open your eyes, love is not hard to find

All around the world but home is where we are
Sabes que en tu casa puedes confiar
We always believed in magic
Juntos todo se puede
So we just smile, we'll be fine
It's always the hardest to say goodbye

We all got bad sides
But all that matters in front of your eyes
Love is not hard to find
If we believe in us

As hard as it can be
Remember by your side you got a family
No matter what
We're gonna love you for who you are there's no limit
Open your eyes, love is not hard to find
As hard as it can be
Remember by your side you've got a family
No matter what
We're gonna love you for who you are there's no limit
Open your eyes, love is not hard to find

Esta casa te espera
Para amarte sin fronteras
Esta casa te espera
Para amarte sin fronteras

As hard as it can be
Remember by your side you got a family
No matter what
We're gonna love you for who you are there's no limit
Open your eyes, love is not hard to find
As hard as it can be
Remember by your side you got a family
No matter what
We're gonna love you for who you are there's no limit
Open your eyes, love is not hard to find
