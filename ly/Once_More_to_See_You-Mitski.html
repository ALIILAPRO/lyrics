		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the rearview mirror
I saw the setting sun on your neck
And felt the taste of you bubble up inside me
But with everybody watching us
Our every move
We do have reputations
We keep it secret
Won't let them have it

So come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone

If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name 
Atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you

Come inside and be with me
Alone with me
Alone
With me alone

If you would let me give you pinky promise kisses
Then I wouldn't have to scream your name 
Atop of every roof in the city of my heart
If I could see you
Once more to see you
If I could see you
Once more to see you
