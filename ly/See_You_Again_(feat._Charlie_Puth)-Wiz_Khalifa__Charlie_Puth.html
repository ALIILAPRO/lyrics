		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew? 
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays 
Now I see you in a better place (see you in a better place)
Uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (yeah, we came a long way) from where we began
(You know where we started)
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)
When I see you again

Ah-oh, ah-oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond 
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost (the love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed 
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn 
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone (remember me when I'm gone)

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go 
And every road you take 
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Ah-oh, ah-oh-oh (uh)
(Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
When I see you again (yeah, uh)
When I see you again, yeah, yeah (ah-oh, ah-oh-oh) (yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh) (uh-huh)
When I see you again (yup)
