		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel you
I feel you
In every stone
In every leaf of every tree
If ever grown
I feel you
In everything
In every river that might flow
In every seed you might have sown
I feel you 

In every stone
In every leaf of every tree
That you ever might have grow
I feel you
In everything
And every river that might flow
In every seed you might have sown
I feel you

I feel you
In every vain
In every beating of my heart
Each breath I take
I feel you
Anyway
In every tear the time I shed
In every word I've never said
I feel you 
I feel you 
I feel you 
I feel you 
I feel you 
In every vain
In every beating of my hart
In in every breath I ever take
I feel you
Any way
In ever tear that I shed
In every word I've never said
I feel you
