		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Extreme ways are back again
Extreme places I didn't know
I broke everything new again
Everything that I'd owned
I threw it out the windows, came along
Extreme ways, I know, will part
The colors of my sea
All perfect coloring

Extreme ways that held me
That help me out late at night
Extreme places I had gone
But never seen any light
Dirty basements, dirty noise
Dirty places coming through
Extreme ways alone
Did you ever like it then?

I would stand in line for this
There's always room in life for this

Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart

Extreme sounds that told me
They helped me out every night
Well, I didn't have much to say
I didn't give up the light
I closed my eyes, I closed myself
I closed my world 
I'll never open up to anything
That could hurt me at all

I had to close down everything
I had to close down my mind
Too many things could cut me
Too much could make me blind
I've seen so much in so many places
So many heartaches, so many faces
So many dirty things
You couldn't even believe

I would stand in line for this
There's always room in life for this

Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart

What'd you say my name was?
Would you say it then?
What'd you say my name was?
Oh, say it then
Well, I know I can't
Well, I know I can't
Well, I know I can't find the

Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart

Oh babe, oh babe
Then it fell apart, it fell apart
Oh babe, oh babe
Like it always does, always does
Always does, always does
