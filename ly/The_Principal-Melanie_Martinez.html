		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sneaky, greedy, money seeking
Always peeping, fucking creeping
Got it on the down low
So you think you always squeaky
What if I had told your mother
Her son was a cruel motherfucker? Ah

It's not just me, it's everybody 
Who thinks that you're fucking ugly
When you come and hurt us 
Just so you can get your money
Forced to follow the leader 
Who's being possessed by demons

I've tried to make you listen
But you won't, it's your way, right?
Killing kids all day and night
Prescription pills and online fights
Shooting at the angels while 
Claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
Fuck our dreams and that's not right

The principal, oh, oh
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle? Oh, oh
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?

Complicated, overrated
You're fixated and elated
By the separation in this place that you've created
Fuck all of your rules and guidelines
You shouldn't even be on the sidelines

Can't you see that we're all hurtin'?
If you're not teaching, we're not learnin'
Excuse me, how much are you earnin'?

I've tried to make you listen
But you won't, it's your way, right?
Killing kids all day and night
Prescription pills and online fights
Shooting at the angels while 
Claiming you're the good guy
All you want is cash and hype
Fuck our dreams and that's not right

The principal, oh, oh
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle? Oh, oh
Oh, where's the principle?
Oh, where's the principle?

You don't know the pain that you are causing
Yeah, your actions hurt, so do your words
The more you try to fuck us over
We will be there yelling at your front door

I've tried to make you listen
But you won't, it's your way, right?
