		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world around me is lost in misery
The only good I've got in my life is you
No meaning, no other reason
When everything feels wrong I feel right with You

So madly, desperate deeply
Obsessed your love is better than mine to me
Can I have this moment forever?

Take me, to the beginning

You are what I believe
I'll live and die for You
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth

In the darkness You shine
Can You keep me safe tonight?

When I'm down on my knees
You are what I believe

When we started whole hearted
I never needed anything or anyone else
I was broken you made me whole again
The only one I trusted more than myself

So madly desperate deeply
I will live for you completely
Can I have this moment forever?

Take me, to the beginning

You are what I believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth

In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight?

When I'm down on my knees
You are what I believe

Believe in your love
Believe in your life
Believe that You can put me back
Together on the inside

Chase all the fear away
Every time I speak your name

Take me
You are what I believe

You are what I believe
I'll live and die for You
This is all that I need
When nothing is real you are my truth

In the darkness You shine
Can You keep me safe tonight?

When I'm down on my knees
You are what I believes
