		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do
I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months thinkin' all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months thinkin' all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches
Every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spendin' the last eight months thinkin' all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again, mm

On a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again
