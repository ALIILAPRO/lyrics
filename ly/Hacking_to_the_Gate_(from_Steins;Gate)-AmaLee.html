		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are billions of beating hearts, 
And their numbers you’d never count 
Cause to you they are insignificant little lights, 
Flickering, not worth your time 

Whether we are stuck in the past, 
Or lamenting what’s still ahead 
Can’t misculate 
There’s no room for any mistakes
With delicate fate 

Before our eyes are many futures and dreams 
Expanding infinitely 
But the vanity of our privileges 
Is it wasted on you and me? 

Hands of the clock, they point to answers in sight
The factor only finite 
Toward a brand new fate
Of a crueler make 
But now it’s too late 
We’re Hacking to the Gate 

In this moment I’m 
Flying and crossing between
A new world, each second I break the seam
And I’ll cross the line if it means, 
I’d protect that smile of yours
So now once again, 
If there’s a way we can meet 
In a loop devoid of misery 
I’m destined to only observe, 
Loneliness engulfing all of me 

Claims of life are all meaningless 
Nonsensical evidence 
Cause to you they’re worth little more than average delights 
To amuse and pass the time 

Ruling over a foolish realm, 
A leader crowning themselves, 
Your conceited ways
Make your theories crumble away, 
LIke they’re child-made 

We have been shown the freedom of many things,
Expanding infinitely 
But beyond the sky, there’s a flow of time
And it beckons to you and me 

So merciless the endless passage of time
The answer only finite 
Toward a brand new fate
It’s the choice you make
Tomorrow awaits
We’re hacking to the gate 

I cannot pretend 
There’s not a promise I made
To my friends back in those shining days
I’ll never let it fade away 
I will fight on for their sake

For that reason I’ll 
Use this device as I need
It’s the layers of time I will deceive
Once destined to only observe, 
But now fate ‘s no power over me 

In this moment I’m 
Flying and crossing between
A new world, each second I break the seam
And I’ll cross the line if it means, 
I’d protect that smile of yours
So now once again, 
If there’s a way we can meet 
In a loop devoid of misery 
I’m destined to only observe, 
Loneliness engulfing all of me
