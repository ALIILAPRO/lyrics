		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do you know which time might be the last?
What I would give just to see you again
I'd walk to the depths of a world down below
And demand to get back what some circumstance stole
I still remember the last look of hope in your eyes
Oh, I wish I had stayed just a little while
But I opened the door and I went down the stairs
I turned back one last time just to prove you were there
You said, if you can see me it's all in your head
But it feels real to me now, it felt real to me then
How do you know which memories to save?
Like the very last footprint that Orpheus made
Cause the last ray of sun made Eurydice cold
Did she know? Did she know?
Did she know? Did she know?
I still remember the last look of hope in your eyes
Oh, I wish I had stayed just a little while
But I opened the door and I went down the stairs
I turned back one last time just to prove you were there
You said, if you can see me it's all in your head
But it feels real to me now, it felt real to me then
If I knew how it'd feel back then
I wouldn't take another step
I'd hold the moment til the end
But everything ends
Everything ends
But I opened the door and I went down the stairs
I turned back one last time just to prove you were there
You said, if you can see me it's all in your head
But it feels real to me now, it felt real to me then
It feels real to me now, it felt real to me then
