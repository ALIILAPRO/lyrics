		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're in control
Pressing pause on my heartbeat
Someone stole all the air
So I can't speak now
I know the chase is on
I feel as though
My time has come

How many times do I fly
Through your headspace?
Now it's speeding away
From the safe place

Yeah, your skin
The touch, the kiss
The rush, too much
And here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like
Like it's our first time
Oh, oh 
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now

Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Just you and me and the coats in the backroom
Learning things they don't teach in the classroom
Now, you're here
I feel the fear
But everything
Is oh so clear

I've been addicted to you
Since the first hit
Out of control like a surge of electric

Yeah, your skin
The touch, the kiss
The rush, too much
And here it comes

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like
Like it's our first time
Oh, oh 
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Your skin, the touch
The kiss, too much
Your skin, the touch
The kiss, the rush
Your skin, the touch
The kiss, too much
The rush, the rush
The rush, the rush

When your lips touch mine
It's the kiss of life
I know
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning
We touch like
Like it's our first time
Oh, oh 
I know that it's a little bit frightening
We might as well be playing with lightning now
Oh, oh
