		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hours devour me
My life's wasted waiting here for you
There's nothing left of me
Lost in a void I don't see
There's nothing left to believe
The end is now
I surrender

The war is over
The rain is falling
And all that's left has blown away
Your eyes are haunted
By what you wanted
I surrender (I surrender)
The war is over

The anger I keep for you
The bitter lessons I will keep for me
There's nothing I can do
To save you from your own hell
There's nothing left for you
The end is now
I surrender

The war is over
The rain is falling
And all that's left has blown away
Your eyes are haunted 
By what you wanted
I surrender (I surrender)
The war is over (It's over now)

I can see it, I can see what you've become
I can feel it, as everything goes numb

The war is over
The rain is falling
And all that's left has blown away
Your eyes are haunted
By what you wanted
I surrender (I surrender)
The war is over
