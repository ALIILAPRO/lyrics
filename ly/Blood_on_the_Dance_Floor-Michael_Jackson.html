		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got your number, ah
She know your game, ah
She put you under, ah
It's so insane, ah
Since you seduced her, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know that woman, ah
Is out to kill

Every night stance is like taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I've got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number and Susie says it's right

She got your number, ah
How does it feel? Ah
To know this stranger, ah
Is about to kill, ah
She got yo' baby, ah
It happened fast, ah
If you could only, ah
Erase the past (ah)

Every night stance is like taking a chances
It's not about love and romance
And now you're going to get it
Ah, every hot man is out taking a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it

To escape the world, I got to enjoy this simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Blood on my side)
It seemed sincere like it was love and true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it

Susie got your number and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie got your number, you know Susie says it's right (hoo-hoo)

Susie's got your number
Susie ain't your friend (ah, it's goin' down, baby)
Look who took you under, she put seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife (it's goin' down, baby)
Susie's got your number (ah)
Susie says it's right

It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it
Hoo!
