		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can tell, seen before
Know the way, I know the law
I can't believe, can't obey
Can't agree with all the things that they say

Oh no, ask me why
I can't go on with all the filthy white lies
Stay clean, stay clean
Stay clean, stay clean

Don't you know, all the time
You got yours and you know that I have mine
Grab a hold, don't let go
Don't let them rob you of the only way you know

Oh no, no one else
Got the right to make you sorry for yourself
Stay clean, stay clean
Stay clean, stay clean, all right

So you see, the only proof
Of what you are is in the way you hear the truth
Don't be scared, live to win
Although they're always gonna tell you it's a sin

In the end, you're on your own
And there is no one that can stop you being alone
Stay clean, stay clean
Stay clean, stay clean, it's your only hope
