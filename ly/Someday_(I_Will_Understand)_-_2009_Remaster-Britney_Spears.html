		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nothing seems to be the way that it used to
Everything seems shallow, 
God give me truth
In me and tell me somebody's watching over me
And that is all I'm praying's that

Someday I will understand 
In God's own plan
And what he's done to me
Oh, but maybe someday I will breathe
And I'll finally see
I'll see it all in my baby

Don't you run too fast my dear
Why don't you stop?
Just stop and listen to your tears 
They're all you've got
It's in you
You see somebody's watching over you
And that is all I'm praying's that

Someday you will understand 
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see 
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby

No moment
Will be more true
Then the moment I look at you
It's in you
You see somebody's watching over you
And that is all I'm praying's that

Someday you will understand 
In God's whole plan
And what he does to you
Oh, but maybe someday you will breathe
And you'll finally see 
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
You'll see it all in your baby
