		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh

This for my niggas on the east side, yeah
This for my niggas on the west side, yeah
This for my niggas on the north side, yeah
This for my niggas on the south side, yeah

I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky

Oh, yeah, you and, you and I, you is superfly
Cutie pie, I knew you was high
I don't usually try, usually I
Kick it with my girls (girls)
Use your guide, mamase, mamamakusa
You should stay inside, lay the night
Admire how you're strict with the weed
And you mind, don't you go out tryin' to think
Out of all the trees smoked would get you higher than me
Took a token and you spoke, now you inspirin' me (you inspire)

I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky

Get me so high
I'm like, "Damn, you fine"
Ever say, "Let's go kiss the sky"
Would you come and shift all the tides?
it's a crazy world that's blazing outside
You're my haven, I'm your lady lover
Hit me when you turn on my street
Won't be shy now 'cause I know I got what you need
Out of all the trees smoked, won't get you high like I do
take a tokin', and I spoke, I lit the spark of the you

I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God (oh, I)
I get up, I get up, I get up so high (so high, so high, oh, I)
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky
I get up, I get up, I get up so high
This shit got me feelin' like I'm closer to God (I get up so high)
I get up, I get up, I get up so high (oh, I)
Baby, if you feel me, put your hands to the sky

Lift her up, I could lift her up, be my little boss
Sniff her up, we get high as fuck in my mama truck
Lift her up, I could lift her up, be my little boss
Sniff her up, we get high as fuck in my mama truck
Lift her up, lift her-, lift her up
Be my little-, lift her up
Lift her-, lift her up
Be my little-

Hoes in the pew
It was a long weekend, but we made it, amen, amen
To my bishops and my bishopnesses
To my deacons and my deaconnesses
And my trustees and my trustesses
The usher boy and them other boys, shout out Pharrell
The nurse ministry
To the children's choir
We love you with the love of the Lord
