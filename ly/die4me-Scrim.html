		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Yeah, tell me, would you die for me?
Yeah, tell me, would you die for me? For me, huh
Yeah, hold up, huh (what?)
Know you ain't talkin' to me (ha)
I been on way too much
Poppin' up, I'm too damn geeked (too geeked)
Thinkin' I sip too much, my cup way too deep (too deep)
Shawty, come hold me down 'til we R.I.P (until we die)
Is you really down for me?
Guess we about to see (see)
Guess we about to be (who?) Mickey and Mallory (yeah)
Is you really down for me? (What?)
Not what the world sees (not what the world sees)
Not what the girls dream (not what the girls dream)
Cut me for you, I bleed (you)
Got me up in my heart, fuck it, I need a cup (I need a cup)
Don't really know 'bout love, baby, I rather be numb
Don't really wanna feel none (none)
But for you I feel (for you)
Feel like back when, when I first took a pill (first took a pill)
Baby, for you, I'd be down to die
Baby, for you, I'd be down to ride

All your exes, fuck 'em (fuck 'em)
See 'em, I might kill 'em
Yeah, I know I'm toxic, and I'm unforgiving
What the fuck is limits? 'Cause for you, I'll spend it (I'll spend it)
Usually don't know my limits when it come to women
Might ice your wrist with tennis if you bring your friend (your friend)
I'm down to ride with you until we meet our end

Yeah, tell me, would you die for me? (Would you die?)
Yeah, tell me, would you die for me? (Would you die?)
For me, huh
Yeah, hold up, huh, what?
Know you ain't talkin' to me (ha)
I been on way too much
Poppin' up, I'm too damn geeked (too geeked)
Thinkin' I sip too much, my cup way too deep (too deep)
Shawty come hold me down 'til we R.I.P (until we die)
Is you really down for me?
Guess we about to see (see)
Guess we about to be (who?) Mickey and Mallory (yeah)
Is you really down for me? (What?)
Not what the world sees (not what the world sees)
Not what the girls dream (not what the girls dream)
Cut me for you, I bleed (you)
Got me up in my heart, fuck it, I need a cup (I need a cup)
Don't really know 'bout love, baby, I rather be numb (I rather be numb)
Don't really wanna feel none (none)
But for you I feel (for you)
Feel like back when, when I first took a pill
Baby, for you, I'd be down to die
Baby, for you, I'd be down to ride
