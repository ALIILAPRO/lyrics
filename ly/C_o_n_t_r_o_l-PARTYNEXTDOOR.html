		<p>
		  Yeah

Take off your clothes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
(You know I'm ready, girl)
Who is in control? (You and me, girl)
(You know I'm ready, girl)
Come on, lay down, down, down
Let's get to it, let's skip all the small talk
I really wanna sex you up (I really wanna get you (?))
I really wanna sex you up (I really wanna, really wanna)

Uh, tell me that you're mine right now and maybe (I'm yours, baby)
I'll work a little magic (woah, oh)
Work a little magic, uh
Tryna creep through your living room, but I'm deeper than I thought
'Cause my pockets full of knots, oh, oh

And I know that it turns you on to see that I'm on and I'm honest, yeah
Put some liquor in your tummy
Know you want it, know you want this
Girl, I wanna see ya

So take off your clothes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Who is in control? (Get it with me, girl)
Come on, lay down, down, down
Let's get to it, let's skip all the small talk (yeah, yeah)
I really wanna sex you up (sex you up)
I really wanna sex you up (I really wanna sex you up, oh, woah)
I wanna know
I wanna know

Giddy-giddy, my little pony, yeah
Ride me, ride me like a cowgirl
Giddy-giddy, yeah, woah
Tell me what it feels like, yeah (what it feels like)
Uh, tell me if you like it

You know that it turns you on to see that I'm on and I'm honest, yeah
Put some liquor in your tummy
Know you want it, know you want this
Girl, I wanna see ya

Take off your clothes, woah, oh-oh (yeah-yeah)
Who is in control?
(You know I'm ready, girl)
Come on, lay down, down, down
Let's get to it, let's skip all the small talk (yeah, I really wanna)
I really wanna sex you up (sex you up)
Really wanna sex you up (I really wanna, I really wanna)

Oh yeah, oh
Ooh-ooh
