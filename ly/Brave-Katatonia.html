		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world

I'm catching flies by now
Speaking to someone
Breaking the windows
This house is dead

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Between the memories

The sound of falling
When the pictures are moving
Dead in time

Brave, try the meaning of loss
I know your smile is deadly at this point
Wherever you are I am not

If you didn't know
All the moments
When I lose myself
I would tell the world

I guess I should know
The limits of the world
There are moments I find myself
Not breathing at all
