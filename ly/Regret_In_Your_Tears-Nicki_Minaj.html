		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanted memories with you

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase 'em with you
You

Look at you now, stuck in the background
Silence right now sounds so loud
Tried to let you go, you come back 'round
Look at you now, stuck in the background
Two seats in my two seater-er-er
Used to pull off on me, leave me hur-urt
Tryna front, but I know you do your dir-irt
Not nice, boy you know you do your dirt

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase 'em with you
You

Baby now you know you got nerve
I know you just wanna be heard
I'm a bad bitch, you ain't used to that
You gon' fuck around and make me do you bad
Used to creep, creep, with you through the back
I count up the cash and bring you the bag
I count up the racks like Serena
Plus I got that ass like Selena
And you know nah-nah-nah-nah-nah, not a bitch
That's gon' care, care, hold you down and love you like this
Drop down, turn around, baby show you like this
Won't find another one to ride it like a soldier like this

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase 'em with you
You

Yeah, and they say big girls don't cry
Baby I cried
The real ones don't lie
Baby you lied
I don't know what to do with you
Baby now I'm through with you

'Cause you don't even know what you just lost
You don't even know what you just had
You don't even know, and that's what's bad
Money bag long, that bitch bad
Used to lay up in them sheets, they were snow white
Now you spendin' cold nights
You've been in the wrong so long
You don't even know right
Call my line, call my line, I'm like, "Please, boy"
You just need to leave, boy
I ain't got time for you
Just once, do somethin' for me, boy

Regret in your tears, know you taste 'em
'Cause you know I don't chase, I replace 'em
Don't rush, take time, take some
I just wanted memories, tried to make some with you
You
Now I gotta erase 'em with you
You

Tried to make some with you, you
With you, you
I tried to make some with you
I tried to make some with you
I tried to make some with you
I tried to make some with you
I tried to make some with you, baby
Make some with you
Two pickney, mi woulda make some with you
You said you would save me
You said you would save me
Hahahaha, rrr
Ohhhh, woooh
