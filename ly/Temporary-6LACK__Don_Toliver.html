		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't take it personal
You know I know it hurts to go
Carry the weight, and I ignore the pain
This might cost a lot, time to gain
Won't miss the fightin', but I know you miss me
I just hope you get a feel to kiss me

We break then shake, no fake, you made me smile
Sun, rain, or snow, girl, I want you around

That's how I know, I can't give you up
Most times, it's temporary
Most girls are temporary
Most feels are temporary
This time it's not
This time, I can't give you-
That's how I know, I can't give you up
Most times, it's temporary
Most girls are temporary
Most feels are temporary
This time it's not
This time, I can't give you (up, yeah)

Got karma on my mind, so don't talk bad on us
Bad features, I can't tolerate them barkin' on us
We part ways and keep operatin', heartbreak for us
Got Patr√≥n for us, yeah, breathe in, then breathe out
New links and new rules for myself, reachin' to reach out
Soon as I hop out the whip

We break then shake, no fake, you made me smile
Sun, rain, or snow, girl, I want you around

That's how I know, I can't give you up
Most times, it's temporary
Most girls are temporary
Most feels are temporary
This time it's not
This time, I can't give you-
That's how I know, I can't give you up
Most times, it's temporary
Most girls are temporary
Most feels are temporary
This time it's not
This time, I can't give you-

(Temporary)

(Temporary, temporary)
