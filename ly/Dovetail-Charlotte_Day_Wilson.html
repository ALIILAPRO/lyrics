		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so good to see you again
I know there's been an emptiness
When you're apart from your lover
No room to recover
There's no better feelin'
Than just bein' together

We'll never stop, we'll always lock
You'll always fit right into me
Nothin' compares, nothin' can top
The love from your top down into me

It fits like a glove
We dovetail, love
It fits like a glove
When we dovetail, love

It's no good (no good) bein' apart
Every mile is just too far
But there's no better feelin'
Than just kissin' and squeezin' you
After a long summer drought

And we'll never stop, we'll always lock
You'll always fit right into me
Nothin' compares, nothin' can top
The love from your top down into me

It fits like a glove
We dovetail, love
It fits like a glove
When we dovetail, love
It fits like a glove
We dovetail, love
It fits like a glove
When we dovetail, love

You know I been missin' you
I think we should listen to
Our bodies and stay together
'Cause, baby, you make me better
There's no one for me but you
Ain't no way I'm leavin' you
Just stay with me through the night
I'll love you by candlelight
