		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I can be miserable
I thought that was part of the deal
You told me I'm not invincible
And that's not what a woman wants to hear and you
You ran into my bedroom calling her name
And you said you'll never breakthrough in pop music anyway
And that really got to me to be honest 'cause
I think that I love you and it's hurting my brain 'cause

Everything I do is starting to revolve around you
And I can't help it but
Even when you say you hate me, it just makes me want you

And I'm a sucker for love, the love that you barely give
You'll be cussing my name out, calling me a bitch
And then I'll say everything I do
Is starting to revolve around you

You said I should read this book called how to be happy and
I think that was a bit of a dig
And you said my sense of humour can be a bit overdramatic
What the hell does that even mean
I wish, I wish I was easy to love
You know the kind of girl that eats healthy
Washes the dishes up
I mean you fucked plenty of those
Why is it me that you've chose?
God, I wish that you loved me and

Everything I do is starting to revolve around you
And I can't help it but
Even when you say you hate me it just makes me want you

And I'm a sucker for love, the love that you barely give
You'll be cussing my name out, calling me a bitch
And then I'll say everything I do
Is starting to revolve around you

You know I'm a little miserable
I thought that was part of the deal
I know I'm not invincible
