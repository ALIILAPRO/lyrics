		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep me here
My heart is near
My love has gone away

Tell me true
My heart is new
My love has gone away

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you

Speak to me
My heart is free
My love has gone away

Tell me true
My heart is blue
My love has gone away

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you

It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
It's okay
I know someday I'm gonna be with you
