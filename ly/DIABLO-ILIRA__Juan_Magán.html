		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, ah, ah, ah
Juan Mágan, Juan Mágan

Mouthful of pretty lies
Handful of dynamite
Every time you let me burn
If I'm being honest I just never learn
Tell me what's happening
Walls here are closing in
Double lock the bedroom door
But every time you touch me
I feel someone else taking over

You turned into Diablo
Hiding under the halo 
Of sweet talk, I'm just good to get you off
But not good enough to be loved
You turned into Diablo
Hiding under the halo 
Of sweet talk, I'm just good to get you off
But not good enough to be loved

Yo no soy un diablo soy un hombre normal
Cuando te hago daño, ma', me siento fatal
No me justifico pero no está tan mal
Que pida perdón si yo te quiero tanto
Si al final hemos pasado tanto
Soy un cabrón que no se gana un canto
De tu cariño, tú eres un encanto
Si yo te falto te duele

You turned into Diablo
Hiding under the halo 
Of sweet talk, I'm just good to get you off
But not good enough to be loved
You turned into Diablo
Hiding under the halo 
Of sweet talk, I'm just good to get you off
But not good enough to be loved

Monsters under your bed
Crawled up into your head
Always finding some excuse
Blaming everything but never ever you
Careless, the way you act
Helpless, we made a pact
Feeding me recycled lines
Fingers crossed behind your back
When you say you're forever mine (Forever mine)

You turned into Diablo
Hiding under the halo 
Of sweet talk, I'm just good to get you off
But not good enough to be loved
You turned into Diablo
Hiding under the halo 
Of sweet talk, I'm just good to get you off
But not good enough to be loved

Turned into Diablo
Diablo, Diablo
