		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put my backpack on I’m gone
If I’m chatting to your girl swear it’s long 
I’m the definition of fun 
I’m high right now but I don’t even bun 
Tell them they can’t steal my shine 
She leng and she mine I’ll wine and dine 
Most of them man there eyeing right 
I just hop in my whip I’m flying right

She B A D call me D A D
Some of my girls come thick baby 
Sometimes I’m loving them slim baby 
One thing they all got they a freak for me 
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me yeah a symphony  
Hahaha it’s R E K K I when you're addressing me
She B A D call me D A D
Some of my girls come thick baby 
Sometimes I’m loving them slim baby 
One thing they all got they a freak for me 
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me yeah a symphony 
Ayo we need more beanies though
Throw it back
Throw it back

Back then it was bootcut
Hood like like the Ku Klux
Freaky girls tryna do us 
Took Ls had no tutors 
you wanted litness you had to get it right thru us 
Feds dem tryna move us stop and search we saying we just some students 
All my ex’s knew were the food was 
rubbing their bellies touching their FUPA
Now my hair grew longer the cargos flared
Push to start but wear khaki bares 
I rock pieces making them stare 
No we don’t dress like dem man dere
I just need was my cut my share 
I got connects like a Bluetooth pair 
No boundaries
I’m jumping 
Come like I’m bumping the fare 

She B A D call me D A D
Some of my girls come thick baby 
Sometimes I’m loving them slim baby 
One thing they all got they a freak for me 
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me yeah a symphony 
Hahaha it’s R E K K I when you're addressing me
She B A D call me D A D
Some of my girls come thick baby 
Sometimes I’m loving them slim baby 
One thing they all got they a freak for me 
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me yeah a symphony 
Ayo we need more beanies though
Throw it back
Throw it back

I’m skidding thru ends
I’m thinking bout times it’s penny up pounds from pences 
17 I had no sense Im young just tryna jump the fence 
Rolling with friends 
Still in the ends
Beanies bussin peng 
Recorded my first ever song with my webcam 
Used to play it back my reaction crazy coming like Danz and Renz 
Had a sock on the mic no stand just hands way before I made bands 
I knew I had suttin when I would show people their heads kept bopping  
feet just tapping
See the words can lie but the body don’t do cappin

She B A D call me D A D
Some of my girls come thick baby 
Sometimes I’m loving them slim baby 
One thing they all got they a freak for me 
I love when they all wanna sing for me
Sing for me yeah a symphony 
it’s R E K K I when you're addressing me
