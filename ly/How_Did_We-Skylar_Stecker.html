		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm standing barefoot right on the edge
Falling into something major
I don't know what it is
But my body is feeling much braver
And may, maybe it's you
Maybe it's me too
Maybe, I

I wish we could hold our breath
Until we know what's next
I wish I could open my chest
And show you everything

How did we become greater than we are
Greater than we are? (whoo)
How did we become stronger than we are
Stronger than we are? (whoo)
'Cause You open my eyes, oh yeah
You brought to life, oh yeah
You open my eyes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And how did we become
Greater than we are, greater than we are? (whoo)

I'm seeing colors vivid and bright
How did, how did you do this?
My feet are up in the sky
Heaven's so close, I could kiss it
And may-maybe it's you
And maybe it's me too
Maybe

I wish we could hold our breath
Until we know what's next
I wish I could open my chest
And show you everything

How did we become free-er than we are
Free-er than we are? (whoo)
How did we become stranger than we are
Stranger than we are? (whoo)
'Cause You open my eyes, oh yeah
You brought to life, oh yeah
You open my eyes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And how did we become
Greater than we are, greater than we are? (whoo)

'Cause you open my eyes, oh yeah
You brought me to life, oh yeah
You open my eyes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
'Cause you open my eyes, oh yeah
You brought me to life, oh yeah
You open my eyes, oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh, How did we become greater than we are
Greater than we are?
How did we become stronger than we are
Stronger than we are?
'Cause you open my eyes, oh yeah
You brought to life, oh yeah
You open my eyes, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And how did we become
Greater than we are, greater than we are? (whoo)
