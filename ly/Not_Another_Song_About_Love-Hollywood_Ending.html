		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let it out
Been building up you better let it out
Say everything that you've been meaning now
I want it to burn

When you tell me that I'm such a wreck
It isn't easy cleaning up your mess
It's like I've got a rope around my neck
She says it won't hurt

But everything you do makes my heart race
I can't even think straight
Is this just a game to you?
Reruns every night
It's always the same fight
I think you should know

I hate your touch, I hate your mouth
I can't stand every single word that falls out
But you're all that I've been dreaming of
This is not another song about love

I hate your voice, I hate your lips
I hate how bad I wanna steal your kiss
But you're all that I've been dreaming of
This is not another song about love

Asphyxiated just to say the least
And with your eyes you're suffocating me
Emptied my lungs, it's getting hard to breathe
You couldn't care less

But everything you do makes my heart race
I can't even think straight
Is this just a game to you?
Reruns every night
It's always the same fight
I think you should know

I hate your touch, I hate your mouth
I can't stand every single word that falls out
But you're all that I've been dreaming of
This is not another song about love

I hate your voice, I hate your lips
I hate how bad I wanna steal your kiss
But you're all that I've been dreaming of
This is not another song about love

The sky fades from blue to gray
Her touch is just like an ocean, still I'm drowning
How bad I wanna sink and let it take me away

I don't know why I come back
I do every time
We get close to the end
It's the finish line
Sing these words for the girl I've been dreaming of
Is this just another song about love?

Let it out
Been building up I better let it out
Say everything that I've been meaning now, dreaming 'bout
I mean it now, I need it now

I need your touch, I have no doubt
I want your love until it all runs out
'Cause you're all that I've been dreaming of
Is this just another song about love?

I need your voice, I need your lips
I need you bad, I wanna steal your kiss
'Cause you're all that I've been dreaming of
This is just another song about
Another song about love
