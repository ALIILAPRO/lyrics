		<p>
		  Pocket watchin'
Heard that boy, he pocket watchin' (Yo, Cochise, a weh dem a seh?)
I pull up with the pocket rocket
Heard that boy talkin' 'bout robbin', stop it
I be gettin' mil' like rocket, rocket
Fold that boy like a wallet, a wallet
I'm gettin' this money, I'm poppin', I'm poppin' (yeah)
Baby, I'm hotter than Taki's, Taki's
I run up again and they pocket watchin'
Heard that boy, he pocket watchin'
I pull up with the pocket rocket
Heard that boy talkin' 'bout robbin', stop it
I be gettin' mil' like rocket, rocket
Fold that boy like a wallet, a wallet
I'm getting this money, I'm poppin', I'm poppin' (yeah)
Baby, I'm hotter than Taki's, Taki's (yeah)

I don't pop no Perc (Perc)
Jojo on my shirt (shirt)
We gon' make it work (work)
Diamonds on me twerk (twerk)
Bet I got that work (work)
Slippin' like I'm Kurt (Kurt)
Come and get your girl (girl)
She be tryna flirt (flirt)
So I tell them wait (wait), woah (woah)
Wait (wait), woah (woah)
Wait (wait), woah (woah)
And she like, "You don't matter"
Ever since a nigga gettin' money, gettin' fatter
Call me Fat Joe, lean back with the pattern
I'm like hey, uh, I know it's okay ('kay)
Sweet like Baby Ray's (Ray's)
Put it to your face
Finna pull up to your place (place)
Fallin' for the race
Leavin' it open, like a case
Benz in the back and it look like, ayy
I'ma go run on that beat like, yeah
I got Pacific, it's all on my neck
Drip, yeah, it's on me, I'm comin' through wet
Racks on my body, it came with my pack
I'm gettin' money, I ran up a check
God on my side, I ain't doin' hacks
Shawty a letter, she touchin' the packs
I tear this shit up and get me a sack
I tear this shit up and get me these racks (yeah)
Yeah, hey, yeah, hey, hey, beep-beep
Baby, this a two-door, swervin' like I'm Meek, Meek
She know I love anime, she think I'm a geek, geek
Mama said she proud of me, she see me on TV (hit it)
Wait (wait), woah (woah)
Hey (hey), no (no)
Hey (hey), ho (ho)
Yeah, but do we even matter?
Ever since a nigga gettin' money, gettin' fatter
Call me Fat Joe, lean back with the pattern
When I pull up to the spot, everybody start to scatter
Heard that money automatic
Heard that nigga want the static
No, no, I don't do no average, uh, I don't do no average
No, no, I don't do no average, uh, I don't do no average

Pocket watchin'
Heard that boy, he pocket watchin'
I pull up with the pocket rocket
Heard that boy talkin' 'bout robbin', stop it
I be gettin' mil' like rocket, rocket
Fold that boy like a wallet, a wallet
I'm getting this money, I'm poppin', I'm poppin' (yeah)
Baby, I'm hotter than Taki's, Taki's

Wait, woah, wait, woah
Wait, woah, wait, woah
Wait, woah, wait, woah
Wait, woah
