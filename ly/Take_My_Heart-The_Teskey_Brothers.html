		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take the time to notice what you really need
You'll find it's a little more simple, than what you thought before
But I can say for certain that I've got more than I ever had before
By remembering the little things that make my heart warm

So take my heart and cut it into two
After all, the only thing missing from me was you
You're all I want, you're all I need, you're the air I breathe
'Cause, after all, the only thing missing from me was you

So take my eyes 'cause after all, they're useless
Oh, just one look at you, it's all they ever wanna do
And take my time, cause I no longer need it
After all the time I've had, all I got left is for you

And take my heart and cut it into two
After all, the only thing missing from me was you
Oh, you're all I want, you're all I need, you're the air I breathe, baby
'Cause after all the only thing missing from me was you

And I'll stay awake dreaming of the times with you
And I will always hold you, you know that's true
'Cause you're all I want, oh, you're all I need, you're the air I breathe
Oh, 'cause you're the only thing missing
And you're the only thing missing, it's you

Yeah, oh, it's you
It's you
You're all I want, baby
You're all I want, you're all I want
Oh, it's you, ohh
All I want is you, oh
