		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oooo, Oooo
Yeah yeah

Look when you love someone
This goes for everyone
You've got to treat 'em right
It can't be just sometimes

Look when you love someone (someone)
This goes for everyone
You've got to treat them right (right)
It can't be just sometimes (sometimes yeah)
Look when you love someone
This goes for everyone
You've got to treat them right (right)
It can't be just sometimes (ooh)

I know that it gets hard girl
When things are heavy on your heart girl
So I just want to thank you
'Cause you know how to remain cool
And Patience is a must girl
You keep them problems between us girl
And then will make a breakthrough
This love ain't meant to break you
Girl I put you above 'cause you ground me
You're my only one, don't you doubt me
I said that I was done till you found me
Before you I was down down down down

Look when you love someone (someone)
This goes for everyone (it goes for everyone)
You've got to treat them right (right)
It can't be just sometimes (no no)
Look when you love someone (when you love someone baby)
This goes for everyone (everyone)
You've got to treat them right (treat em right)
It can't be just sometimes (oooh)

Your heart's been broken
And now it's showing
But I need you to know
I won't let go
Tell me your secrets
Release those feelings
No, I won't tell a soul
It's between me and you
Girl I put you above 'cause you ground me
You're my only one, don't you doubt me
I said that I was done till you found me
Before you I was down down down down

Look when you love someone
This goes for everyone
You've got to treat 'em right
It can't be just sometimes
