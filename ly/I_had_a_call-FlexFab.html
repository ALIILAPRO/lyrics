		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There’s a fine line
In-between me
And what they see

When the lights dim
There comes silence
And it’s empty

And even if I had it all
Would I keep on wanting more?

No one told me how to make it stop
I had a call
And I made it work
Yeah

And its hollow
When they leave me
Going crazy

I need time
There’s plenty
But it’s heavy

And even if I had it all
Would I keep on wanting more?

No one told me how to make it stop
I had a call
And I made it work
Yeah
