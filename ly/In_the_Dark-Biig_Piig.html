		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I laughed it off
'Cause I had to, love
All jokes aside, I'm tired of feeling this way
Like my head won't stop
And this whole town's drunk
These dreams of mine
Have they come to die in this place?

Where I'm dancing to forget you
And the music loud, just tear me apart
No way I could rest since you left
Found my home here in the dark

No, I don't talk much
Like I used to once
No words I had were enough to get you to stay
So I guess I'm lost
Now it's dawn 'til dusk
This time I swear that I'll lose my mind in this maze

Where I'm dancing to forget you
And the music loud, just tear me apart
No way I could rest since you left
Found my home here in the dark

Found my home here in the dark
Found my home here in the dark

Where I'm dancing to forget you
And the music loud, just tear me apart
No way I could rest since you left
Found my home here in the dark

Where I'm dancing to forget you
And the music loud, just tear me apart
No way I could rest since you left
Found my home here in the dark

Found my home here in the dark
No way I could rest since you left
Found my home here in the dark
