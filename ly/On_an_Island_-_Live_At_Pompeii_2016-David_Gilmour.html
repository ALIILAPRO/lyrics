		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember that night
White steps in the moonlight
They walked here too
Through empty playground, this ghosts' town
Children again, on rusting swings getting higher
Sharing a dream, on an island, it felt right

We lay side by side
Between the moon and the tide
Mapping the stars for a while

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow 
Let it go
Feel her warmth beside you

Remember that night
The warmth and the laughter
Candles burned
Though the church was deserted
At dawn we went down through empty streets to the harbor
Dreamers may leave, but they're here ever after

Let the night surround you
We're halfway to the stars
Ebb and flow
Let it go
Feel her warmth beside you.
