		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now let's sing a song
For broken hearts
For the desolation world
For the tears
Don't know how far
this voice can go
But let's sing a song
For soldiers
For all the people in
fear of the war
For all the souls left away
For us lost the way
Miracle will happen
for the ones who believe
If you don't believe
The dream will never comes true
We can even change the world
Just by believing
So close your eyes and feel
Our voice reach to the sky
And it became a light covers
all around the world we live in
The stars will fall on
our hands tonight
To each everyone tonight
There is nothing we can't do
Even if everything's
just a dream
We don't need any reasons
We don't need a philosophy
We don't need qualification
Tonight we don't even need words

The stars will fall on lovers
The stars fall on hospital beds
The stars fall on you
We all came from the
same place in the sky
And we are the stars that
goes back to the same sky
Let's take each others
hand and sing
Our voice reach to the sky
And it became a light
all around the world we live in
The stars will fall on
our hands tonight
To each everyone tonight
There is nothing we can't do
Even if everything's
just a dream
We don't need any reasons
We don't need a philosophy
We don't need qualification
Tonight we don't even need words
The stars on our hands
The stars each everyone tonight
Let's keep believe
'til we sleep in grave
Until that day let's sing to
The stars on our hands
The stars each everyone tonight
Let's keep believe
'til we sleep in grave
until the end let's sing
