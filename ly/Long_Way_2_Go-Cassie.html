		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love it when they try to get intimate
Even though they know I really ain't into it
(You're not into it?) I'm not into it
I already know the game and I've been through it
See I buy my own bags, my boots, my jeans
Wear LaRok with my Rebel Yell underneath
You wanna step to me? (Said you got a long way to go)
Rock with me now

You claim that you're so hot
And you say you got skills in the bedroom
You try to front when you're so not
Had a chance you still never come through
You say you wanna come see me
'Cause you know your girlfriend wanna be me 
(Uh, I'ma tell you why you can't)
Said you got a long way to go
(Say you wanna love me?)

Wanna love me, wanna touch me
Think twice 'cause you got a long way to go (got a long way to go)
Don't know how to act, better fall back (uh, better fall back)
It's like that 'cause you got a long way to go (uh)
It's not that deep, take it easy
You wanna please me? You got a long way to go (got a long way to go)
I'ma bad girl, you wanna get close
Ease up 'cause you got a long way

I love it when they try to get scandalous
Even though they know they really can't handle it
(They can't handle it?) They can't handle it
Tryna take me out to dinner, I'll cancel it
If you really wanna know me first of all
You should never try to get too personal
'Cause I meant it when I said
(That you got a long way to go)
Yeah, uh

You claim that you're so hot
And you say you got skills in the bedroom
You try to front when you're so not
Had a chance you still never come through
You say you wanna come see me
'Cause you know your girlfriend wanna be me
(Uh, I'ma tell you why you can't)
Said you got a long way to go
(Say you wanna love me?)

Wanna love me, wanna touch me
Think twice 'cause you got a long way to go (got a long way to go)
Don't know how to act, better fall back (uh)
It's like that 'cause you got a long way to go (uh)
It's not that deep, take it easy
You wanna please me? You got a long way to go (got a long way to go)
I'ma bad girl, you wanna get close
Ease up 'cause you got a long way

You claim that you're so hot
And you say you got skills in the bedroom
You try to front when you're so not
Had a chance you still never come through
You say you wanna come see me
'Cause you know your girlfriend wanna be me (uh, yeah)
Said you got a long way to go
(Say you wanna love me?)

Wanna love me, wanna touch me
Think twice 'cause you got a long way to go (way to go)
Don't know how to act, better fall back 
It's like that 'cause you got a long way to go (ooh, you got a long way)
It's not that deep, take it easy
You wanna please me? You got a long way to go 
I'ma bad girl, you wanna get close (I'ma bad girl)
Ease up 'cause you got a long way to go

Wanna love me, wanna touch me 
Think twice 'cause you got a long way to go 
Don't know how to act, better fall back 
It's like that 'cause you got a long way to go 
It's not that deep, take it easy (ooh, you got a long way)
You wanna please me? You got a long way to go (yeah)
Said you got a long way to go

Rock with me now
Got a long way to go, uh
Yeah, uh
Better fall back
Said you got a long way to go
