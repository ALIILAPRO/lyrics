		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I an angel or a devil
I'm only human so I guess both
Am I an angel or a devil
I'm only human so I guess both

Godspeed for the last time
My rear view's like my past life
My demons mad that I'm too fast
Furious when I zoom past
Bite the dust while I dash
The villain gets the last laugh
Thought I had the white hat
But I did some dirt, now it's black
Who gon' smoke, I got gas
Who gon' choke, who gon' gag
Who gon' boast, who gon' brag
Who want most of this rap
When I goes in my pad

Am I an angel or a devil
I'm only human so I guess both
Am I an angel or a devil
I'm only human so I guess both

Inferno, serenade

Am I an angel or a devil
The question leaves them unsettled
Heaven's gates turn me, hell no
Mama said I ain't special
Antagonists watch me meddle
Tell the world make you tremble
The question leaves them unsettled
Am I an angel or devil

Guess what

The bond that we build cannot be broke
Kin these are family ties?
Let's ride till the wheels, fall off the road
And reconnect in the sky
The blood that we shed and that we cried
Keep 'em with us till we die
We had a hell of a ride
But now it's time for goodbye

Am I an angel or a devil
I'm only human so I guess both

Am I an angel or a devil
I'm only human so I guess both

The bond that we build cannot be broke
Kin these are family ties?
Let's ride till the wheels, fall off the road
And reconnect in the sky
The blood that we shed and that we cried
Keep 'em with us till we die
We had a hell of a ride
But now it's time for goodbye

Am I an angel or devil
The question leaves them unsettled
Heaven's gates told me hell no
Demons said I ain't special
Antagonists watch me meddle
Tell the world make it tremble
The question leaves them unsettled
Am I an angel or devil

Am I an angel or a devil
Am I an angel or a devil
