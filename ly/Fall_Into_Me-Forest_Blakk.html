		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The day that I met you
The world had just spit me out
On my way to the bottom
Sure I'd never be found
Then you saw me for me
Made me believe in myself
On the day that I met you
It all turned around

You said close your eyes
Don't look down

Fall into me and I'll catch you, darlin'
We'll dance in the street like nobody's watching
It's just you and me and the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice, high on the moment
I'd fall for you twice if that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life from now 'til forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again

Until I had met you
There was no sun in my sky
No mirrors for monsters
No love in sight
Then you walked down those stairs
And I knew my heart wasn't mine
On the day that I met you
My whole world came alive

You said close your eyes
I got you now

Fall into me and I'll catch you, darlin'
We'll dance in the street like nobody's watching
It's just you and me and the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over 
I'm drunk on your voice, high on the moment
I'd fall for you twice, if that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life from now 'til forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again

I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you
I'm falling in love with you over and over
I'm falling in love with you over and over

Fall into me and I'll catch you, darlin'
Let's dance in the streets like nobody's watching
It's just you and me and the song on repeat in my head
Playing over and over
I'm drunk on your voice, high on the moment
I'd fall for you twice, if that's what you wanted
I'd give you my life from now 'til forever
I'm falling in love with you
Over and over again

Fall into me and I'll catch you, darlin'
Let's dance in the streets like nobody's watching
It's just you and me and the song on repeat in our heads
