		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to love to look for a fight
I'd get drunk and shoot out the lights
I was known to get outta hand
A rough and rowdy honky tonk man

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin'
Ain't as easy as it used to be

I looked a lot, but I've never found
A woman that could settle me down
I been known to have a good time
No, I could never walk the line

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin'
Ain't as easy as it used to be

Never thought it would happen to me
But this hard livin'
Ain't as easy as it used to be

Woo!
