		  Mr. Boombastic
What you want is some boombastic romantic
Fantastic lover, Shaggy
Mr. Lover Lover, Mmm, Mr. Lover lover, heh girl
Mr. Lover lover, Mmm, Mr. Lover lover

She call me Mr. Boombastic
Say me fantastic touch me on the back
She says I'm Mr. Ro
Mantic, say me fantastic
Touch me on the back, she says I'm Mr. Ro

Smooth, just like the silk
Soft and cuddly hug me up like a quilt
I'm a lyrical lover
No take me for no filth
With my sexual physique, jah know me well-built
Oh me oh my, well well
Can't you tell
I'm just like a turtle crawling out of me shell
Gal you captivate my body put me under a spell
With your Khus Khus perfume
I love your sweet smell
You are the only young girl who can ring my bell
And I could take rejection, so you tell me go to hell

I'm Boombastic
Tell me fantastic, touch me on the back
She says I'm Mr. Ro-
Mantic, and me fantastic
She touch me on the back, she says I'm Mr. Boom, boom, boom

Gee wheeze, baby please
Let me take you to an island of
The sweet cool breeze
You don't feel like drive well baby hand me the keys
And I will take you to a place to set your mind at ease

Don't you tickle my foot bottom ha ha, baby please
Don't you play with my nose 'cause I might ha-choo sneeze
(Bless you)
Well, you are the bun and me a cheese
And if me a the rice well maybe you are the peas

She says I'm Mr. Ro-

She touch me on the back, she says I'm Mr. Boom, boom, boom

Would you like to kiss and caress
Rub down every strand of hair on my chest

Rated as the best, the best you should get
Nothing more, nothing less
Give me your digits, jot down your address

With some physical attraction, gal, you know
To feel the spark

Come lay down in my jacuzzi and get some bubble bath
Only sound you will hear is the beating of my heart
And we will hm hm, and have some sweet pillow talk
