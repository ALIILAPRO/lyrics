		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a sports car on my wrist and I'm very fly
You can hear the money machine beeping from outside
Nigga pillow-talking, talking, ain't got they money right
I don't even want to talk, nigga, unless I see the cash out
Zero to sixty, I get lost in a turbo
Medallions, pink diamonds, started from purple
Yeah, fully loaded, money machine, bitch, I'm splurgous
He stayed down, got the money up, and now they can't serve us

I'm going Jimmy Choo on my new-new shit on purpose
She can get it too, ain't no fool, I'll curve her
If I borrowed your car, I'm sure I filipped it up with chickens
Cappers stealing swag, they bitches popping on misses
Got more K in the phantom, you want to ride the Honda Civic
I'm okay with that hammer, I got to ride with the extended
Shit be cracking in the city every day (every day)
Dropped the eighth in a Phantom, I'm okay (okay)
Penthouse, three stories, got trees in it
Spilled the drip all over, a bitch eatin' it
I threw the money in the vault, ain't even seen it
Money bags everywhere, Lamborghinis

I got a sports car on my wrist and I'm very fly
You can hear the money machine beeping from outside
Nigga pillow-talking, talking, ain't got they money right
I don't even want to talk, nigga, unless I see the cash out
Zero to sixty, I get lost in a turbo
Medallions, pink diamonds, started from purple
Yeah, fully loaded, money machine, bitch, I'm splurgous (light it up, gang)
He stayed down, got the money up, and now they can't serve us (BMWG shit)

We make our own drugs so you niggas can't serve 'em (nah)
Remix everything, Sproot make it do hurdles (remix)
Jugg House jumping like a rabbit, yours turtle (turtle)
Everything I smoke exotic, nigga, all purple (yeah)
I just ran a whole M through the money counter (money counter)
Kept money from yesterday, I ain't even count it (count up)
Quarter million, tried to break Blacka out the counter (counter)
A thousand pounds on the road, all wrapped and downied (road)
Jugg, the truck was seven, let her off, Freebandz (yeah)
All my niggas bosses, working like some Mexicans (like some Mexicans)
Lamborghini 'round my neck, Eliantte (Eliantte)
Hunnid racks just to pull up in the driveway (streets)

I got a sports car on my wrist and I'm very fly
You can hear the money machine beeping from outside
Nigga pillow-talking, talking, ain't got they money right
I don't even want to talk, nigga, unless I see the cash out
Zero to sixty, I get lost in a turbo
Medallions, pink diamonds, started from purple
Yeah, fully loaded, money machine, bitch, I'm splurgous
He stayed down, got the money up, and now they can't serve us
