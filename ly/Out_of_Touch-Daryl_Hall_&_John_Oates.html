		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake it up is all that we know
Using the bodies up as we go
I'm waking up to fantasy
The shades all around aren't the colors we used to see
Broken ice still melts in the sun
And times that are broken can often be one again
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Take a look around

You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around

Oh, ohh
Ohh

Reaching out for something to hold
Looking for a love where the climate is cold
Manic moves and drowsy dreams
Or living in the middle between the two extremes
Smoking guns hot to the touch
Would cool down if we didn't
Use them so much, yeah
We're soul alone
And soul really matters to me
Too much

You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around

Oh, ohh
Ohh
Ooh
Oh, ohh
Ohh (ohh)

(Out of touch, out of touch)

(Wow!) You're out of touch
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
You're out of touch 
I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around

You're out of touch (we're soul alone, girl)
I'm out of time
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around (not around)
You're out of touch 
I'm out of time (out of touch, out of time)
But I'm out of my head (out of touch, out of time, girl)
When you're not around

You're out of touch 
Reach out for something to hold (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around (too cold, girl)
You're out of touch (too cold, girl)
I'm out of time (too cold, girl)
Yeah open eyes (not around)

You're out of touch (out of touch)
I'm out of time (out of time, out of touch)
But I'm out of my head (out of time)
When you're not around 
You're out of touch 
Yeah I'm out of time (time)
But I'm out of my head
When you're not around
