		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't need no walls around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all

All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall

All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall
