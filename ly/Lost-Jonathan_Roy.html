		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How the hell did we wind up here?
You're hittin rock bottom and I'm full of fear
The cold wind has frozen your heart
Let's re-write this story and make it a long one
It's broken and falling apart
I won't let you lose who you are

You're lost in this lonely light
Trying to kill the pain you're feeling
Lost but I'm here tonight
Trying to chase away your demons 
I'll scream it
I mean it
I'm a stand by you till you find what you've lost

So much darkness in this space 
You've come so far to have fallen from grace
The cold wind has frozen your heart
Let's re-write this story and make it a long one
It's broken and falling apart
I won't let you lose who you are

You're lost in this lonely light
Trying to kill the pain you're feeling
Lost but I'm here tonight
Trying to chase away your demons 
I'll scream it
I mean it
I'm a stand by you till you find what you've lost

The cold wind has frozen your heart
Let's re-write this story and make it a long one
It's broken and falling apart 
I won't let you loose who you are

You're lost in this lonely light
Trying to kill the pain you're feeling
Lost but I'm here tonight
Trying to chase away your demons 
I'll scream it
I mean it
I'm a stand by you till you find what you've lost
I'm a stand by you till you find what you've lost
I'm a stand by you till you find what you've lost
