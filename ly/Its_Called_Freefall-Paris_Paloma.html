		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Called to the Devil and the Devil did come
I said to the Devil, "Devil, do you like drums?
Do you like cigarettes, dominoes, rum?"
He said, "Only sundown, Sundays, Christmas"

Some day's end, when I need a few friends
Now and again, I could never hope to keep them
Thought to give friends what I thought that they wanted
Never had they needed a good friend as I've been

Don't get me venting on friends who resent you
'Cause all you've ever done is been a noose to hang on to
They thought was a necklace and reckless
They fell into Hell where you both hang with nothing to do, but

Scratch, kick, let gravity win, like
Fuck this, let gravity win, like
You could leave it all behind
Even the Devil needs time alone sometimes

You could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall

Called to the Devil 
And the Devil said, "Quit
Can't be bothered, better handle your shit
Keep about your wits, man, keep about your wits
Know yourself and who you came in with"

Can I sit down? I've been hustling all day
I can't even count how many souls I've made
Off the same deal you on
Remember, the Devil ain't a friend to no one
But fine, true

You could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall

Called to the Devil 
And the Devil said, "Hey
Why you've been calling this late?
It's like 2 a.m. and the bars all close at ten in Hell
That's a rule I made"

Anyway, you say you're too busy
Saving everybody else to save yourself
And you don't want no help, oh, well
That's the story to tell

You could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall

You could let it all go
You could let it all go
'Cause ain't shit free but falling out
That shit's easy, let me show you how, it's like

You could let it all go
You could let it all go
It's called freefall
It's called freefall
