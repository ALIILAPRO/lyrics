		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me be your hero

Would you dance, if I asked you to dance?
Or would you run, and never look back?
Would you cry, if you saw me crying?
And would you save my soul, tonight?

Would you tremble, if I touched your lips?
Or would you laugh? Oh, please tell me this
Now would you die, for the one you love?
Oh, hold me in your arms tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear, that you'll always be mine
Or would you lie? Would you run and hide?
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
I don't care, you're here tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Oh, I just wanna hold you
I just wanna hold you, oh yeah
Am I in too deep? Have I lost my mind?
Well, I don't care, you're here tonight

I can be your hero, baby
I can kiss away the pain (oh yeah)
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

And I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away

I can be your hero
