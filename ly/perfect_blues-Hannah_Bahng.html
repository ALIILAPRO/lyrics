		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Playing the perfect blues
Happy moments, take a breath
Singing a perfect tune
Feeling creatures in the depth
Perfect background, perfect light
Perfect scenery, perfect sight
Perfect sunshine, perfect night
Perfect everything, perfect life

Pulling out thoughts from an empty cry
Steel heart passion with no fine tie

I scream, pleading to take me (take me)
Take me far away
I feel guilty singing, "Take me" (take me)
I slumber today
Oh, I pray to make new waves
Feeling blue, a phase

Swimming metaphorically
Drowning in gravity
Diving for a piece of me
Calming serenity

Rocking back through the blues
Seeking refuge through the trench
Taken by ankle down ocean cruise
Lulled by sirens here to drench
Singing a gentle snooze
Pleading guilty, I repent
Deprived of oxygen, scared to lose
Candlelit fire burnt and spent

Pulling out thoughts from an empty cry
Steel heart passion with no fine tie
Stitching the thoughts from a desired lie
Forging fantasies that aren't mine

I scream, pleading to take me (take me)
Take me far away
I feel guilty singing, "Take me" (take me)
I slumber today
Oh, I pray to make new waves
Feeling blue, a phase

Swimming metaphorically
Drowning in gravity
Diving for a piece of me
Calming my serenity
