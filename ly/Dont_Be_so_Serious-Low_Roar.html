		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake
Heavy pulse
Bloody eyes
Sweaty clothes
A routine
That I've learned
To understand and know

Play my tricks
Fragile mind
Rest your head
On me
Shut my eyes
I'm not here
There must be some mistake

Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious

Watch your words
Turn to dust
As we forget
As we move on
Still
I refuse
To let you slip away

Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
