		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A shrine of serpents entangling sheep
Paving the way to this grim demise
Power has been given to the incorrect hosts
So pathetic
Yet damaging this earth the most

Weak world
Every offered torch gets turned to ice
You can't offer warmth
Where there is no light
There is no light

The path we are headed
Is bleak and desolate
Hopeless and malevolent
Yet you still can't wake up and admit it
This cold earth can only freeze so much
Until it shatters down the center
Turning all to dust

How did we let it come to this
So much fucking ignorance
I see the end making its way in the distance
My god we deserve it
The loudest of sheep are not to be trusted
Hypocritical contradictions festering within
As they collect in higher numbers
Lies ahead destruction
They have no remorse
Set on this violent war of chaos
Corrupting everything in their path
Peel back their cloaks and reveal their evil blackened eyes and serpent skin

Weak world
Every offered torch gets turned to ice
You can't offer warmth
Where there is no light
There is no light

How did we let it come to this
So much fucking blatant ignorance
I see the end making its way in the distance
My god we deserve this extinction
We deserve it
I'd rather suffocate in the ground
Buried in the dirt
Than share the same air as the roaches
That walk this earth

There is no fucking light
Weak world
Weak minds
Strike us down
There is nothing left
A failed breed of pestilence
Yet you still can't admit it

Weak world
Weak minds
There is no hope where there is no light
Weak world
Weak minds
There is no hope
There is no light
Strike us down
There's nothing left

A failed breed of pestilence
A shrine of serpents entangling sheep
Paving the way to this demise
This cold earth can only freeze so much
Until it shatters down the center
Turning us all to dust
Weak world

Every offered torch gets turned to ice
You can't offer warmth
Where there is no light
There is no light
Weak world
Weak minds
Strike us down
There is nothing left

A failed breed of pestilence
Pathetic Serpent sheep set on chaos
There is no hope and there is no fucking light
There is no fucking light
