		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey have we met? You look familiar
I know you from a different time, and a different place
Doesn’t matter now that we’re together
I feel like we know each other, let’s go our own pace
It takes time (Time) what does it mean? It’s not easy to count and it’s not easy to see
We got time (Time) up to our necks, I’ll love you in this lifetime oh, and in the next
We got time
We got time
They say that opposites attract, so let’s see we got
I’ll be the ying and you be the yang and we’ll both come out on top
And I know you’re parents don’t like me, and that’s all alright
Cause we’ll be together soon and everything will feel right
It takes time (Time) what does it mean? It’s not easy to count and it’s not easy to see
We got time (Time) up to our necks, I’ll love you in this lifetime oh, and in the next
We got time
We got time
And I swear I fell in love with you, from the moment that we met
And I vow to stay with you even after the end
It doesn’t matter where we’re going we’ll find each other soon
It's just time (Time) what does it mean? It’s not easy to count and it’s not easy to see
We got time (Time) up to our necks, I’ll love you in this lifetime oh, and in the next
It takes time (Time) what does it mean? It’s not easy to count and it’s not easy to see
We got time (Time) up to our necks, I’ll love you in this lifetime oh, and in the next
We got time
We got time
We got time
We got time
