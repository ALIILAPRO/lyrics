		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm kinda numb
It's so distorted
You left me here with this damage that you've caused
My tortured faces
I've fucked up places
In my memories none of them I've lost but

I haven't been here long enough to know
Every time I feel this I just lose control
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful
I wish that this would just go  go.

It's kinda sick
I feel so dirty
I'm kinda tragic kinda insecure
But I know that I'm the only
One that can fix whatever's wrong I'm sure, but

I haven't been here long enough to know
Every time I feel this I just lose control
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful
I wish that this would just go, go.

I feel so alone
From all I've become
I'll take you down
I'll feel so down
I'm water while you drown
You're lifted while I'm down
I'm cancer in your womb
I'm the needle in your spoon, but

I haven't been here long enough to know
Every time I feel this I just lose control
Such a cancer on the face of everything that's beautiful
I wish that this would just go, go.

Just [Repeat x2]
Just go
Go

All these fucking (lies)[Repeat x3]
All your fucking (lies) [Repeat x3]
