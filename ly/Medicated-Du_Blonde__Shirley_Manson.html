		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you've been going through babe
I know that you've been wishing you were dead
Just hang around a couple years babe
I promise everything is in your head
I'm a medicated brain child
And I'm praying for my own reform
But until I get my head screwed
I'll keep on swallowing this thunderstorm
I don't try to believe it anymore
Take my medication out the drawer
You tried to tell them you were hurting
You tried to tell them that you might not last
But words are cheap it seems and I know
You can't just put a brain into a cast
I know what you've been going through babe
I know that you've been wishing you were dead
Just hang around a couple years babe
I promise everything is in your head
I don't try to believe it anymore
Take my medication out the drawer
