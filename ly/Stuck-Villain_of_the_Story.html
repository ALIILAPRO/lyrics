		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could you let me fall?
You said that I was your everything
(But did you mean it at all?)
I'm left to pick up these pieces, what's left of my heart
You rip me apart, why is this so hard?
I know I deserve more than this
Yet I still crave your love
I'm your blood and you use me like a drug
Well, enough is enough

I've been waiting forever for you to change
I can't do this forever, not one more day
Never wanted to lose you this way
But you're stuck, stuck in your ways

Where will you go?
I was the one who held you up whenever you were alone
I was the only one who refused to see
That this is the real you

I've been waiting forever for you to change
I can't do this forever, not one more day
Never wanted to lose you this way
But you're stuck, stuck in your ways

Now I'm breaking down
At the thought of how we used to be
I'm falling to the ground
Thinking about how much you meant to me

I've been waiting forever
I can't do this forever

I've been waiting forever for you to change
I can't do this forever, not one more day
Never wanted to lose you this way
But you're stuck, stuck in your ways, your ways
You're stuck, stuck in your ways
