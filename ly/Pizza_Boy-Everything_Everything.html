		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You wanna hypnotize me, go ahead
You wanted mystery, well, there ain't no more left
I may be comatose, but, oh my god
We can have a good night

I'll have a Coke
I'll have a Pepsi now
You are afraid
That you're a pizza boy

Is it fun on your own?
Just you and your mobile phone?
Are you coming to life?
Do you want me to look inside?

And they buried you in heavy snow
And they beat you and they played you like a drum
But you just party like it's 1997 again (huh)
Let's get disfigured in the morning rain
If I could clone you I could take the Western world
But time is fun when you're just having flies
We can never go back
Ah, ah

I'll have a Coke
I'll have a Pepsi now
You are afraid
That you're a pizza boy

Is it fun on your own?
Just you and your mobile phone?
Are you coming to life?
Do you want me to look inside?
You need more time
You need more
Time

I'll have a Coke
I'll have a Pepsi now
You are afraid
That you're a pizza boy, boy
I'll have a Coke
I'll have a Pepsi now (now)
You are afraid
That you're a pizza boy (time)
You need more time
You need more time

Is it fun on your own?
Just you and your mobile phone? (Time)
Are you coming to life?
Do you want me to look inside?
