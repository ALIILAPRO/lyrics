		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did I wake you, we're you sleepin', were you still in my bed?
Or is a nightmare, keepin' you up instead?
Oh baby, are you feelin' guilty for what you did
If you think you're hurtin', you ain't seen nothin' yet

Was it really worth it?
Was she everything, that you were looking for?
Feel like a man
I hope you know that, you can't come back
Cause all we had, is broken like shattered glass

You're gonna see me, in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gonna want me back
When your world falls apart, like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass

Are you having trouble focusin' through the day?
Do you find yourself, still callin' my name?
Do you wish you could rewind time and take it back?
I bet you realize, she ain't half the woman I am

Was it really worth it?
Was she everything, that you were looking for?
Feel like a man
I hope you know that, you can't go back
Cause all we had, is broken like shattered glass

You're gonna see me, in your dreams tonight
My face is gonna haunt you all the time
I promise that you gonna want me back
When your world falls apart, like shattered glass
Glass, glass, glass

Glass,
Like like, glass
Glass, glass, glass
