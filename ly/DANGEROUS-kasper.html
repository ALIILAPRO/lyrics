		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't call me baby 'cause I'm not your man
You're driving me crazy so cancel your plans
You know that I'm not wrong
Do I gotta be strong?
Can you call me back, girl?
Can you clean your act, girl?
Why're you're trying to do that, girl?
Girl, you're insane
It's getting dangerous
Got me switching lanes
Girl, you got me faded
I've been trying to call you for the last week
But you ain't got no problem ignoring me
Girl, you're reckless
I know you can't change it
I'm just out here thinking what's the point of this?
If you're leaving me
Girl, then just say it
Cause I'm going to be the one to act like you ain't shit
I'm better off without you
'Cause you playing games, I was the fool
I should have saw the signs
No, you were never mine
Always trying to do us, right
Should have kicked you out of my life
Cause when it's all said and done
You was only trying to have some fun
I thought it was more than fun
Guess it was just really nothing
Girl, you're insane
It's getting dangerous
Got me switching lanes
Girl, you got me faded
I've been trying to call you for the last week
But you ain't got no problem ignoring me
Girl, you're reckless
I know you can't change it
I'm just out here thinking what's the point of this?
If you're leaving me
Girl, then just say it
Cause I'm going to be the one to act like you ain't shit
