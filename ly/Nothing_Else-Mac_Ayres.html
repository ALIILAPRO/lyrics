		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She got a way to make it go
Things that I heard but hadn't seen
Got to the point I didn't know
I saw your eyes turning green

If you wanted nothing else from me
I would pack my things and leave, honey
Just tell me what to do
Tell me what to do with your love
If there's nothing left to see, honey
We could turn around and let it be, honey
Just tell me what to do
Tell me what to do
She don't love the way
I just won't let things go once for a change
She don't love the way
Don't only say what I mean but I mean what I say
She don't love the way
I just won't let things go once for a change
She don't love the way
Don't only say what I mean but I mean what I say

Told you that I had to borrow time
Just didn't wanna make a scene
Never one to see it as a crime
Guess that I'm the one that does the deed

If you wanted nothing else from me
I would pack my things and leave, honey
Just tell me what to do
Tell me what to do with your love
If there's nothing left to see, honey
We could turn around and let it be, honey
Just tell me what to do
Tell me what to do
She don't love the way
I just won't let things go once for a change
She don't love the way
Don't only say what I mean but I mean what I say
She don't love the way
I just won't let things go once for a change
She don't love the way
Don't only say what I mean but I mean what I say
By the time that you hear this imma need two more shots and a witness, oh
She don't love the way
I just won't let things go once for a change
She don't love the way
Don't only say what I mean but I mean what I say
She don't love the way
I just won't let things go once for a change
She don't love the way
Don't only say what I mean but I mean what I say
