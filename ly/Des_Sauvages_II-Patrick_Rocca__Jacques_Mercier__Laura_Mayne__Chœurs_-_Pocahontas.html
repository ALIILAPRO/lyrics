		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This will be the day
(Let's go men!)
This will be the morning
(Bring out the prisoner)
We will see them dying in the dust

I don't know what I can do
Still, I know I've got to try

Now we make 'em pay

Eagle, help my feet to fly

Now without a warning

Mountain, help my heart be great

Now we leave 'em blood and bone and rust

Spirits of the earth and sky
It's them or us

Please don't let it be to late
They're just a bunch of
Filthy, stinking

Savages!
Savages!
Demons!
Devils!

Kill them!

Savages!
Savages!
What are we waiting for?
Destroy their evil race
Until there's not a trace left

How loud are the drums of war?

We will sound the drums of war

Is the death of all I love
Carried in the drumming of war
