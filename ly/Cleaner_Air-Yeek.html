		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born and raised
I don't know where
She's from Florida
Probably breathing cleaner air

You would think I
Move like such a scum
That's why you
Always fucking run

Went to London
Finally had the funds, felt like I
Was always on the run
I move fast anyway
But I love you any day

I lost my glasses at the pub
Went ape shit
You can ask Matt I went nuts
Three senses left when I stopped seeing
You already killed off my feelings

When I came home
Didn't want to socialize
I had things that I couldn't vocalize
Here's my two cents don't go baby
'Cause if you leave I'll go crazy
