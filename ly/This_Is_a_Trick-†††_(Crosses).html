		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something's changed in your face I notice
A different sparkle in those crazy eyes
Your unmistakable charade I know it
Always tricks me every time
A million tears, a trillion times
I've seen that glaze and glitch in your eyes

This is a trick
Hello, hello, I know
What this really is
I know hello, hello
This is a trick
Hello, hello, I know
What this really is
I know hello, hello, hello

I'm so excited I can hardly take it

This is a trick
Hello, hello, I know
What this really is
I know hello, hello
This is a trick
Hello, hello, I know
What this really is
I know hello, hello, hello

What's the matter with the transformation?
What you've been practicing for days and nights
While I'm watching the creation of this
Awful creature that no one likes
