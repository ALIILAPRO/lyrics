		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Catch my love, catch my love
Catch my love, catch my love

Heard you been looking for my love
Say I'm the one that you want
But are you good at keeping up
Show me you got stamina
Close your eyes and count to ten
My rhythm's picking up again
So come and let the games begin
Check the rules I try to win

Can you
Catch my love, catch my love
Catch my love, catch my love
You can run, you can hide
But can you
Catch my love, catch my love

Catch my love, love
Heard you been looking for my love
Say I'm the one that you want
But are you good at keeping up
Show me you got stamina
Close your eyes and count to 10
My rhythm's picking up again
So come and let the games begin
Check the rules I try to win

Can you
Catch my love, catch my love
Catch my love, catch my love
You can run, you can hide
But can you
Catch my love, catch my love

Catch my love, love
Baby can you catch my love
Baby can you catch my love
Catch my love, love
