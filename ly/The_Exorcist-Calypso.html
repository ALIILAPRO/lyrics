		  (5, 6, 7, 8)
Preacher preaching rubbish,
Rambling, condemning sodomy,
Vocal variation of an awfully botched lobotomy
Scream about the gays and how you wish you could exterminate ‘em,
Jesus would’ve hated the way you’ve portrayed him
Love they neighbor right? Or is that only if they’re rich, able-bodied, cis, hetero and white
I’m starting to think this lord of yours is overrated,
If he made you in his image, must’ve been real inebriated

You can’t live in peace,
Gotta “shove it down our throats”,
God forbid your kid is queer,
You have a damn stroke
“I can fix him”
For your daddy up above,
‘cuz there’s just no hate like Christian love
And when it comes to women’s bodies,
You’re crying and bitching,
Wrecking God’s green earth 
With all the cherry picking
“Don’t hate the sinner, hate the sin”
As if that’s any better.
By the way, nice denim jeans 
And polyester sweater. (HAHAHAHA)

Preacher preaching rubbish,
Rambling, condemning sodomy,
Vocal variation of an awfully botched lobotomy
Scream about the gays and how you wish you could exterminate ‘em,
Jesus would’ve hated the way you’ve portrayed him
Love they neighbor right? Or is that only if they’re rich, able-bodied, cis, hetero and white
I’m starting to think this lord of yours is overrated,
If he made you in his image, must’ve been real inebriated

“He’s coming back”
You say while trembling in fear
Same bullshit for 2000 years
“Jesus loves you!”
That’s manipulation.
Going door to door,
Neighborhood indoctrination
I don’t care what your little book says,
What part of that 
Isn’t getting through your head?
You go on to eternity in heaven,
I’ll be getting head in circle seven (HAHAHAHA)

Preacher preaching rubbish,
Rambling, condemning sodomy,
Vocal variation of an awfully botched lobotomy
Scream about the gays and how you wish you could exterminate ‘em,
Jesus would’ve hated the way you’ve portrayed him
Love they neighbor right? Or is that only if they’re rich, able-bodied, cis, hetero and white
I’m starting to think this lord of yours is overrated,
If he made you in his image, must’ve been real inebriated

(AMEN)
Oh, divine and holy gentleman
Who’d never be dishonest,
You’re allowed to touch young boys?
But women must stay modest?
How long do you think
You can keep up this facade
Soon everyone around you, boy,
Will know that you’re a fraud.
Hypocritical, delusional,
And for that, I applaud.
You’re closer to a jail cell
Than you’ll ever be to God.

Preacher preaching rubbish,
Rambling, condemning sodomy,
Vocal variation of an awfully botched lobotomy
Scream about the gays and how you wish you could exterminate ‘em,
Jesus would’ve hated the way you’ve portrayed him
Love they neighbor right? Or is that only if they’re rich, able-bodied, cis, hetero and white
I’m starting to think this lord of yours is overrated,
If he made you in his image, must’ve been real inebriated

Preacher preaching rubbish, (Ow, rubbish baby)
Rambling, condemning sodomy, 
Vocal variation of an awfully botched lobotomy (La la la la, lobotomy, Ah)
Scream about the gays and how you wish you could exterminate ‘em,
Jesus would’ve hated the way you’ve portrayed him
Love they neighbor right? (Or is that only, or is that only)
Or is that only if they’re rich, able-bodied, cis, hetero and white (Hey)
I’m starting to think this lord of yours is overrated,
If he made you in his image, must’ve been real inebriated (Ah-ah-ah-ah)

(Rubbish baby, ooh)
If he made you in his image,
Must’ve been real inebriated.
