		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hallelujah, I'm a freak
I'm a freak, hallelujah
Every day of the week I'ma do ya
Like I want to
I'm a Nile Crocodile, a Piranha

Oh my God, she got the power
Oh, look at her, she got the power

So-so, so don't fuck with my freedom
I came back to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came back to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

Hallelujah, I'm a witch
I'm a witch, hallelujah
Swish swish, I'm a three-point shooter
I blow through ya
Like a hot wind out in the bayou, ya

Oh my God, she got the power
Well, look at her, she got the power

Don't fuck with my freedom
I came back to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter
Don't fuck with my freedom
I came back to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

So, back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh
Back up, back up, back up, back up, boy, ooh

My mama always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into and my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it
My mamma always told me that I'd make it
That I'd make it, so I made it
I put my back into and my heart in it
So I did it, yeah, I did it

Don't fuck with my freedom
I came back to get me some
I'm nasty, I'm evil
Must be something in the water or that I'm my mother's daughter

Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Don't fuck with my freedom
Oh my God, oh my God
Swish swish, motherfucker
