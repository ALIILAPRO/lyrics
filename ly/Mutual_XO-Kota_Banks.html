		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Let go, let go of the feelin')
(Want your XO, XO, yes I need it)

Yeah, need that XO, come on over
Vroom, vroom, baby, skrrt your motor
Zoom, zoom, baby, whip the Rover
Then trips on me, boy, fuck a chauffeur, like
Wanna get you goin'
Wanna turn you on (wanna turn you on)
Like you're a radio, or my favorite song 
Ooh, come on

Wake up, wake up, don't sleep on me
Unless I'm starrin' in your every dream, boy
Make up, make up, make it up to me
It's not no secret that I want to keep

I can't let go, let go of the feelin'
Want your XO, XO yes, I need it (need it)
I can't let go, let go of the feelin'
Is it mutual? (mutual)
Am I delusional, baby?

Come and sip that Coca-Cola
That's Kota cola, when Kota's over
Pussy pink like a flip phone, Motorola
Like a kitchen sink that's flowin' over
I would think you would drink it up a little slower
Savor it 'cause baby, when you blink it's over
I'm thick like zinc, I'm sick like smokers 
Do you want me or are you just gonna fuck me over?
This is confusional, tell me
Love, is this mutual?
Do you, do you think I'm beautiful?
Or is it business as usual?
Like, are my texts mutable?
Got me smilin' like a fucker at funeral
This energy's not renewable
So fuckin' wake up, baby

I can't let go, let go of the feelin'
Want your XO, XO yes, I need it (oh yeah, I need it, baby)
I can't let go, let go of the feelin'
Is it mutual? (mutual)
Am I delusional, baby?

I want them kisses, baby, is that wrong?
I wanna miss you, but I must stay strong
'Cause, I've wanted this so long
Wake up, wake up, is this mutual?

I can't let go, let go of the feelin'
Want your XO, XO yes, I need it
I can't let go, let go of the feelin'
Is it mutual? (mutual)
Am I delusional, baby?

Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh ooh ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh-ooh
