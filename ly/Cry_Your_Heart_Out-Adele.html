		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I walk in a room I'm invisible
I feel like a ghost
All my friends keep on telling me that 
This feeling won't last, mm
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes
I have nothing to feel no more
I can't even cry

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I wake up, I'm afraid 
At the idea of facing the day
I would rather stay home on my own
Drink it all away
Please stop calling me, it's exhausting
There's really nothing left to say
I created this storm
It's only fair I have to sit in its rain

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

All love is devout
No feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now
Before it's too late
In the end, it's just you
Stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it

Cry your heart out (yeah)
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace
