		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can the dark side light my way out? Yeah
Lay your hand across my face, yeah
Time we lost, that's all my fault

Please don't be long
'Cause I want you now
I don't have love
Without you 'round
Life is too short
But I will live for you

How did this fit in your story? Yeah
Why'd you let them judge your body? Yeah
I'll be waitin' there outside, yeah

Please don't be long
'Cause I want your all
I don't have fun
Without your love
Life is too short
But I will live for you
You're muckin' off
But I will live for you, my selfless love

Bite my tongue, I wait my turn
I waited for a century
Waste my breath, no lessons learned
I turn and face the enemy
I'm not scared, just don't care
I'm not listenin', you hear?
He's never there, I don't care
I can't tell you what and where

Yeah
Yeah
