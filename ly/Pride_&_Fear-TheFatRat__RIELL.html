		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once a realm on the shoulders of giants
Forged with ember and gold
An empire stood through the clouds
It was endless stories of peace it foretold
Where sea meets sky
Emerald water in moonlight
Mountain tops kissed with snow
People held up the legends of bounty
Reaping the peace that they sowed

But one by one, in secret planted greed
And watered it with pridе and fear

Seasons changed, likе the turning of tides
The blossoms started to fade
The air grew heavy, electric in warning
The greedy knelt down and they prayed
They begged for peace
For the legends of bounty
No one planted or sowed
The secrets grew like the
Storm in the distance
Came to collect what they owed

But one by one, in secrets, planted greed
And watered it with pride and fear
The poisoned fruit fell not far from the tree
The fiend that nobody could see

Once a realm on the shoulders of giants
Forged with ember and gold
Now a lost land, it's fading in silence
Haunted by demons and ghosts
