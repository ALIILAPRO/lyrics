		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go

I was in your wet dream
Driving in my car
Saw you at the side of the road
There's no one else around
You're touching yourself
Touching yourself
Touching your
Touching yourself
Touching yourself

You said, "Baby, do you want to come home with me?
I've got Buffalo '66 on DVD"
You said, "Baby, do you want to come home with me?
I've got Buffalo '66 on DVD"

Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go

I was in your wet dream
Driving in my car
What makes you think you're good enough to think about me
When you're touching yourself
Touching yourself
Touching your
Touching yourself
Touching yourself

You climb onto the bonnet
And you're licking the windscreen
I've never seen anything so obscene
It's enough to make a girl blush
It's enough, it's enough to make a girl blush

It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
It's enough (to make a girl blush), it's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough, it's enough
It's enough, it's enough (to make a girl blush), it's enough, it's enough

Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go (here we go)
Here we go, here we go, here we go

Beam me up (beam me up)
Count me in (count me in)
Three, two, one (three, two, one)
Let's begin
