		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey
Yeah
We had everything vinyl and mono
And we looked the other way

Man we were so dumb
Is the the part in the book that you wrote
Where I gotta come and save the day
Did you miss me

Did you miss me
Yeah yeah yeah
Well they say that rock is dead
They're probably right

99 girls in the pit
Did it have to come to this
Oh god you owe me one more song
So I can prove to you that I am so much better than him

Oh god please listen fast
Here comes the crash
We're gonna rise above
We gotta smash it up

You won't abandon us again
Hey
Give us brilliant boys we want to fuck man
Full of ecstasy hard drugs and bad luck

Yeah yeah yeah
Turn the lights back on
It burns so hard
But you won't burn long

Three chords in your pocket tonight
Are you you the one 
With the spark to bring my punk rock back
I don't think so

Oh god I want to hear you say 
I want to hear you say your sorry again
Oh god you owe me one more song
So I can prove to you that I am so much better than him

Oh god I'd give you anything to hear you say that I was right and you were wrong
Oh god before I leave this life
No and eight-ball isn't love
A hookers never gonna come

Just give it back to me 
Blow out all of the lights to night
Yeah
2 million miles down the PCH

And now he's gone
I slashed his tires
I bled his brakes
It had to be done

Their hand job lives were just too cruel
Yeah mercy was done
We drown them all in their swimming pools
Run away run away run away yeah

Oh god I want to hear you say
I want to hear you say that you were wrong again
Oh god I want to hear you say
I want to hear you say that I am so much better than him

Oh god you owe us one more song
Just get out of my life 
And see the world as it really is
Is this just a sad slide show

Can't make a hooker come
An eight ball isn't love
I need one thing that's divine
Let me hear it tonight

Let me hear it tonight
I gotta hear it tonight
You gotta let me here the one lost chord tonight
