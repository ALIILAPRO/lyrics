		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm in a winter mood, dreaming of spring now
I'm burning myself down
Burning myself down, burning

I feel like something bad has stretched out over and over again
Until I'm creased and I'm about to break down the middle
Split me right down the middle, right, right down the middle, yeah

The stars are the same as ever
I don't have the guts to keep it together
Stuck in the permafrost
Stuck in the permafrost

Life is just a game, maybe
I'm stuck in a lonely loop, my baby

So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all
So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all

I need the sound of crowds or I can't fall asleep at night
I can't take my thoughts and I
Can't take my thoughts and I am awake
Another year of possibilities left unwrapped
Like it's the day right after Christmas past
And I'm pretty positive my pain isn't cool enough, pain isn't cool enough

Like a sledgehammer to a disco ball
Crushing all my low, low, low, low, ache it 'til you make it
Ache it 'til you make it

I think I've been going through it
And I've been putting your name to it

So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all
So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all

In another life you were my babe
In another life you were the sunshine of my lifetime
What would trade the pain for? I'm not sure

In another life you were my babe
In another life you were the sunshine of my lifetime
What would trade the pain for? I'm not sure

I used to be a real go-getter
I used to think it'd all get better

So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all
So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all

So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all
So much for stardust
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all

(So much for stardust)
We thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all, thought we had it all, thought we had it all
(So much for stardust)
So we thought we had it all, thought we had it all
Thought we had it all (thought we had it all, thought we had it all)

(So much for stardust)
(Thought we had it all, thought we had it all)
