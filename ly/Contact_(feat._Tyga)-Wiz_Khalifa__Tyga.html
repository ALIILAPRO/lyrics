		  (Oh my God, Ronny)

I'm a big dog, baby, I'ma bark back (bark back)
Got a bad-ass bitch with her own racks (own racks)
They don't like it, they don't like it, tell 'em, "Fuck that!" (Fuck that)
Whoa, kush strong, catch a contact (yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)
Bitches wanna talk to me, can't contact (contact)
Hit my nigga for the plug, he the contact (contact)
And we only do big contracts (contracts)
Whoa, kush strong, catch a contact (okay)

Knew she was the one soon as she opened her mouth
Heard you from the West, but built like you from the South
You nigga always trippin', don't let you leave the house
Remindin' me of my Impala when she makin' it bounce
You never smoke, you think of me, you think of a ounce
You heard about me, now you wanna see what it's 'bout
I be smokin' on some gas, yeah, give the cash, yeah
Hear they got you comin' fast, yeah, make it last, yeah
A hundred milli' in the bank, I just made it last year
Hit it, then I'm gone, don't let you get attached, yeah
Had a nigga who can't handle you so now he past tense
Tryna spend it on you, baby, that's what all that ass get
Face look bright, waist real tight
I'ma get up on it, in the mornin', got a flight

I'm a big dog, baby, I'ma bark back (bark back, okay)
Got a bad-ass bitch with her own racks (own racks)
They don't like it, they don't like it, tell 'emm "Fuck that!" (Fuck that)
Whoa, kush strong, catch a contact (yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)
Bitches wanna talk to me, can't contact (contact)
Hit my nigga for the plug, he the contact (contact)
And we only do big contracts (contracts)
Whoa, kush strong, catch a contact

I go leather like Mike with the top back (pew-pew, top back)
Niggas talkin' shit, I'ma dead that (dead that)
I live what I rap, you live internet (ha)
She threw me the pussy, you tried to intercept (nigga)
Checkmate like it's chess, diamond rook on my neck (yeah)
I deal with your body, open your legs, put the dick (yeah, yeah)
She ask for some Molly and then she pull me to the bed (ha)
I'm too busy to fuck her, I'ma settle for some head
My new bae (newbie), on the way (zoom, zoom)
She make that ass shake (yeah), bada-bing (ay)
Throwin' hunnids in the face, make it earthquake (ay)
Throwin' hunnids on that ass, it's your birthday (ay)
Bring it back, get a stack, make it earthquake (woo)
Throw the cake like a motherfuckin' birthday

I'm a big dog, baby, I'ma bark back (bark back)
Got a bad-ass bitch with her own racks (own racks)
They don't like it, they don't like it, tell 'em, "Fuck that!" (Fuck that)
Whoa, kush strong, catch a contact (yeah, yeah, yeah, woo)
Bitches wanna talk to me, can't contact (contact)
Hit my nigga for the plug, he the contact (contact)
And we only do big contracts (contracts)
Whoa, kush strong, catch a contact

(Oh my God, Ronny)
