		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shout out to the old me 
And everything he showed me 
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me 
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me 

Never a night alone 
Anywhere you wanna go 
Woke up in the morning wearing someone else's clothes
Pictures in my phone 
With people I don't know 
Woke up in the morning how the hell'd I make it home 
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough 
And I did some shit I never should have done
I would do it over now, I'd do it over 

Shout out to the old me 
And everything you showed me 
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me 
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me 
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me 
And everything he showed me 
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me 

Another round here we go
Going in blow for blow 
Look into the mirror take the punches that I throw 
I'm constantly reminded of all the compromises 
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go 
And they wondered how long I could keep it up
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough 
And I did some shit I never should have done
I would do it over now, I'd do it over 

Shout out to the old me 
And everything you showed me 
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me 
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me 
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me 
And everything he showed me 
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me 

Devil at my door 
Got me knockin' knockin' knockin' on the other side 
Ashes on the floor 
But I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' outta here alive 

Shout out to the old me 
And everything you showed me 
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me
No one could control me 
Left my lovers lonely
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me 
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid
Shout out to the old me 
And everything he showed me 
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me
