		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fah, fah
Fah, fah
Fah, fah
Fah, fah-fah, fah

Hit a nigga up, call it 2Pac
She tryna play my song on the boom box
I'm in the back and I'm chillin' with two thots
Look at that girl like, "Man, that bitch too hot"
Shout-out to Autumn, 'cause I got two Glocks (VDV got it)
Jumped off the porch, now I'm on the rooftop
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Bad lil' bitch, she givin' me knowledge
Shawty real fine and she go to college
Might give that girl all the money in my wallet
Me and my niggas, you know that we ballin'
I brought a 40 and bro brought the MAC in
Me and my niggas, yeah, we never lackin'
40 gon' make that boy dance, Michael Jackson
Niggas is mad cause the paper I'm stackin'
It's gettin' real messy, think I need a napkin
Told that boy Millie K, he gon' hand me the MAC-10
No, I'm not a Crip but I get it crackin'
If I see your ho, I'ma blow her back in
Look at your boy, you know that I'm paper chasin'
I'm soundin' like Dami, no reparations
Me and my bros goin' on vacation
Like Quavo, I can't wait to say that we made it

Call me Santana, 'cause I stay on go
I'm sorry, bro, I ain't try to steal your flow
I'm 4'2" in real life, I stand on my money, I'm 5'2"
Yo' ass been talkin', can't wait 'til we find you
I stick to yo' ho just like she some fine glue
No King Von, but nigga, she mine too
