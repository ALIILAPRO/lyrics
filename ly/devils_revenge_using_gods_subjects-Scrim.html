		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

I'm tryna blow these racks (these racks)
She's tryna blow my high
Big gun what I pack
You don't wan' blow my vibe (my vibe)
Yeah, wake up and get fly (get fly)
Make a grown bitch cry, yeah
Pills up in my system, tryna live my life (okay, okay)
I'm on a flight, countin' these mills gon' take all night (hey)
Been gettin' too high, I'm tryin' not to die, I can't open my eyes (hey)
Yeah, I will not comply, will never abide (hey)
Forever I'm reppin' the 9 (Grey)
I never will tell on my guys
Yeah, nonstop (nonstop)
I flirt with the pinebox (pinebox)
Half a mil' on my neck, yeah, it came with an ice box
I'm smokin' on ice tops
More purple than wine shops (go, go)
Virgil the Maybach, yeah
I blew it like K-Pop

Yeah, bitch, get the fuck up off my phone (yeah)
I'm tryna get to the cash
Don't worry, I will be home
I put MSG in my beats, sold out MSG last week (I'm up)
Still I'm up in the studio, like I'm tryin' to get on my feet (yeah)
Glock up on my side, Glock up in the ride, damn, I trust no one
Kyle said I need to take a break 'cause I don't have no fun
I been on the run, makin' hits without no pen
That boy he a bum, in this game he got no skin (let's go, let's go)
Fuck is they talkin' 'bout? (Fuck what they sayin'?)
I had to run them out (I've been away)
Yeah, fuck with me when I was broke
And I had to run a mile
Yeah, now I'm on the way, I done upped the pay, everybody got a say (what?)
But now I walk up in a place, yeah, and everybody gotta pay
Yeah, fuck it, I pull up in Cullinan
Make all these bitches wanna fuck again
Lean in my gut, ain't no suckin' in
Cali wit' guns yeah I snuck 'em in
Hit up my doc for the medicine
I got some coke from the Medell√≠n
I'm tryna count up the cash
Told my bitch that I ain't gon' fuck again

I'm tryna blow these racks (these racks)
She's tryna blow my high
Big gun what I pack
You don't wan' blow my vibe (my vibe)
Yeah, wake up and get fly (get fly)
Make a grown bitch cry, yeah
Pills up in my system, tryna live my life
I'm on a flight, countin' these mills gon' take all night (hey)
Been gettin' too high, I'm tryin' not to die, I can't open my eyes (hey)
Yeah, I will not comply, will never abide (hey)
Forever I'm reppin' the 9 (Grey)
I never will tell on my guys
Yeah, nonstop (nonstop)
I flirt with the pinebox (pinebox)
Half a mil' on my neck, yeah, it came with an ice box
I'm smokin' on ice tops
More purple than wine shops (go, go)
Virgil the Maybach, yeah
I blew it like K-Pop
