		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I met the princess from Thailand again
She had grown up
Into a queen
Down in the abyss where the night
Never turns to daylight
She kept me in a polaroid
That was pinned upon her wall
Under Garuda's mirror lights
She takes flight
Yeah, the kid's alright

You've grown up
(Oh, baby queen)
You've grown up
(Oh, baby queen)
(You've grown up)

She fell into the generals (oh, baby queen)
On the watch all around her
I fell into the vanity
The mirrored lights of our dreams

You've grown up
(Oh, baby queen)
In my dreams (dreams, dreams, dreams)
Where you've been (dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams)
You've grown up 
(Oh, baby queen)
In my dreams (dreams, dreams, dreams)
Where you've been (dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams)

(Oh, baby queen)
In my dreams (dreams, dreams, dreams)
Where you've been (dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams)
You've grown up 
(Oh, baby queen)
In my dreams (dreams, dreams, dreams)
Where you've been (dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams)

You've grown up
(Oh, baby queen)
In my dreams (dreams, dreams, dreams)
Where you've been (dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams)
You've grown up 
(Oh, baby queen)
In my dreams (dreams, dreams, dreams)
Where you've been (dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams) (baby)

Baby queen
You were in my dreams
