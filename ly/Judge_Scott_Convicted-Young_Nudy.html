		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Did what I did what I had to nigga
I done robbed a lot of niggas
'cause I had to nigga
I ain't have no food on the table nigga
I ain't have no motherfucking cable nigga
Mama didn’t have no job
We wasn’t stable nigga
Had to go and get that gun
So we were able nigga
Yeah, and I was runnin' them streets
Lowkey with the heat
I ain't have no fucking daddy
Yeah that gun was my pappy
Yeah that bitch made shit happen
Yeah that bitch started clapping
I was in the hood for real
Young nigga started trapping
Fell in love with that rock and
I swear it turned me up
Fell in love with them hundred dollars
I swear I ran it up
Fell in love with them bitches
Man I swear I love to fuck
Where them percs at dawg?
Shit, you can pass me a molly
I go brazy on your ho
You can pass me a perc
I go slow up on the stroke
You can pass me the lean
I be sippin until I'm gone god damn
Rollin' up the gas so
I can't think straight
So I can't think straight
Sippin' on the lean just to
Make the pain fade
I see a lot of niggas like
To hate on the slime
Hate shit turn to a motherfuckin' crime
God damn nigga always motherfuckin' cryin'
All the time, you bitchin' all the time
I'm in the street for real
I'm gettin' this money all the time
They should've made this money
Shit a motherfuckin' crime
'cause I be getting this shit
All the motherfuckin' time
Ain't flexing, but real convicted felon
I keep that felon on me and
My dogs they not telling
I don't fuck with pussy
If you lame I don't smell it
I know you wasn't with me
Same niggas from day one
They on the block still with me
