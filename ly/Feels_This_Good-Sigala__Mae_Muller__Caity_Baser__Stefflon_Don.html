		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you know, we rarely get nights like these
And we don't feel bad 'cause it's good for the soul
So forget all the responsibilities
'Cause I got you, you got me

Yeah, the promise we made way back in the days
To hold onto the night
I remember we said we would never regret
Stayin' up when we get high

When it feels this good, you gotta stay for a minute
Hold on and get lost in it
When it feels this good, you gotta stay for a minute
Hold on, hold on
When it feels this good

(When it feels this good)
When it feels this good, so good
When it feels this good (when it feels this good)
When it feels this good, so good
When it feels this good
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo), woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When it feels this good
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo), woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When it feels this good

It's been a long, long time since I saw your face
I forgot just how good it feel's when we're free
And you know they said we'd grow out this phase
But not you, not me

Yeah, the promise we made way back in the days
To hold onto the night
I remember we said we would never regret
Stayin' up when we get high

When it feels this good, you gotta stay for a minute
Hold on and get lost in it
When it feels this good, you gotta stay for a minute
Hold on, hold on
When it feels this good

You know that it feels this good (good)
Pull up on me anytime in the woods (in the woods)
Baby, got me feelin' like Suge
My baby got me falling in love (in love)
He gon' do whatever I want
Dressed like an icon, lookin' like I own a python
I'm not the one you can slide on
I'm gettin' money while you're tryna sign on
Ain't nothin' funny, but my lovin' ain't cheap
Hop out the Benz then I hop in the Jeep
Hundred degrees but my wrist still on freeze
I don't care what a hater gotta say about me (nah, nah)
Bad, you bad as fuck
G-L-A-M, you glamorous
Me, I'ma keep it G
Tell me why the hell would I ever wanna leave? ('Cause when it feels this good)

When it feels this good (when it feels this good)
When it feels this good, so good
When it feels this good (when it feels this good)
When it feels this good, so good
When it feels this good
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo), woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When it feels this good
Woo-hoo (woo-hoo), woo-hoo (woo-hoo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
When it feels this good
