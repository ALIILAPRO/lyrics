		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Right in the night 
Right in the night 
Right in the night you'll find 
That if you want to fall in love, you fall in love 

Right in the night 
Right in the night 
Right in the night, a sweet thing is what you get 
When you fall in love, fall in love 

Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance 
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance 
Make a little soft on the way that you go 
Just think that everything you touch can turn to gold 

Fall in love with everything that you'd love to love 
You know that laughter is a kind form to wake you up, 
So don't make me feel unpleasant like you do 
You know that everything will fall right back on you 

So fall in love with everything, fall in love with life 
Forget about your troubles and be a little nice 
You will not see me if you don't want to look 
Just come and get me in my big, big bed of love 
Big, big bed of love 

So fall in love with stories, fairy tales of truth 
Innocence is part of what you lose with you youth 
Show a little confidence, and show a little class 
Don't kiss the past, the past ain't gonna last 

Just fall in love with passion, fall in love with lust 
Fall in love with all the things you're dreaming of 
Fall in love with music 
And you will get back
