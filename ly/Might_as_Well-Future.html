		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
Racks bustin' out of niggas' jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs not record it
Conversate and I'll absorb it (I got it)
Be a door, no informant
Percocets got me goin'
OG, coughing up a lung

They got our streets, tried to tell ya (bitch)
It's already been done (I got it)
Ammunition over flowin
Tears fillin' up her pun
Now you sea blowin' like it's snowin (let's get it)
I know I'm bliss, I speak in tongues (you bet it)
My words touch a nigga soul
They get you through it, overcome
I ride the boats in the ocean
I whipped the car, it was stolen
I got the stars on the ceiling
I got my charge acquitted
I was the one got evicted
Living with the pink slip, riding 'round with the pink slip
I done swam with the sharks
Nigga came from the deep end
You will never know what I was in
Times are getting rough we still get in
I was selling crack when Snoop dropped "Juice and Gin" (yah yah)
Rent a one room shack with a million in the den (fact)

Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
Racks bustin' out of niggas' jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs not record it
Conversate and I'll absorb it (I got it)
Be a door, no informant
Percocets got me goin'
OG, coughing up a lung

We workaholic
A few supermodels callin'
Ain't gonna expose ya
Can't say I ain't think about it (fact)
(Can't say I ain't think about it)
Pink diamonds, no blinking
Snakes got no dripping
Started off on a mission
I got real niggas still Crippin'
Child support getting heavy
It's hard not to get offended
Oh, you maxing out your credit card?
Like it wasn't hard for me
I just bought a new Bugatti for you

So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on 'n pour it (pour)
Racks bustin' out of niggas' jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs not record it
Conversate and I'll absorb it (I got it)
Be a door, no informant
Percocets got me goin'
OG, coughing up a lung

Lived in it all
Gotta take a trip and go ball (I gotta take a trip)
Packin' no luggage, when I get there I'm buyin' the mall
Get there I'm buyin' the mall
Ain't packin' no luggage, when I get there I'm buyin' the mall

So I ain't have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team (bet)
Raw diamonds on lean (hey)
I took off just like a rocket (I'm gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin' out the stores (for real)
We ain't never runnin' out of lean, (never)
Might as well go and pour it (pour)
