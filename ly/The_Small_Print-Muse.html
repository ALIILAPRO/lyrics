		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take, take all you need
And I'll compensate your greed
With broken hearts
Sell I'll sell your memories
For fifteen pounds per year
But just the good days

Say, It'll make you insane
And it's bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose and
You watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm a priest God never paid

Hope, I hope you've seen the light
'Cause no one really cares
They're just pretending
Sell, I'll sell your memories, for fifteen pounds per year
But you can keep the bad days

Say, it'll make you insane
And I'm bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm a priest God never paid

Say, it'll make you insane
And I'm bending the truth
You're to blame
For all the life that you'll lose
And you watch this space
And I'm going all the way
And be my slave to the grave
I'm a priest God never paid
