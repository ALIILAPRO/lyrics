		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this world is wearing thin
And you're thinking of escape
I'll go anywhere with you
Just wrap me up in chains
But if you try to go alone
Don't think I'll understand

(Stay) stay with me
Stay with me

In the silence of your room
In the darkness of your dreams
You must only think of me
There can be no in between
When your pride is on the floor
I'll make you beg for more

(Stay) stay with me
Stay with me

You'd better hope and pray that you make it safe
Back to your own world
You'd better hope and pray that you'll wake one day
In your own world
'Cause when you sleep at night they don't hear your cries
In your own world
Only time will tell if you can break the spell
Back in your own world

(Stay) stay with me
(Stay) stay with me
(Stay, stay)
(Stay) stay with me
(Stay) stay with me
(Stay) stay with me
(Stay) stay with me
