		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
I don't think you realize 
Don't think that you recognize 
Just how much you mean to me 
And that you make me so happy 
I wish that you were happy too 
Because it means so much to me 

And oh! (Oh) I know (oh)
That we've got better days 
And oh! (Oh) I'm sure (oh)
That we will conquer the world 

I regret what I don't have said 
I screwed up things inside your head 
But all I want is for you to know is that 
When you grow old you won't remember it at all 

And oh! (Oh) I know (oh)
That we've got better days 
And oh! (Oh) I'm sure (oh)
That we will conquer the world 
And oh! I know I love you more than anything 
And oh! I'm sure that I will make you happy 

And we'll be together (together)
I know (I know), it shows in your eyes 
Your green eyes (your green eyes), your brown eyes (your brown eyes)
It doesn't really matter 

And oh! I know I love you more than anything 
And oh! I'm sure that I will make you happy 

And we'll be together (together)
I know (I know), it shows in your eyes 
Your green eyes (your green eyes), your brown eyes (your brown eyes)
It doesn't really matter anymore
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 

Oh, oh
Oh
Oh
It don't matter no more (oh)
It don't matter no more 
It don't matter no more (oh)
It don't matter no more
It don't matter no more (oh)
It don't matter no more
It don't matter no more (oh)
It don't matter no more
