		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knew a guy, let's call him Jeff
He had a wife that up and left
Last Thursday night, she saw his texts
And she was mortified
It wasn't right, though he confessed
That just one time, he called his ex
She didn't buy it or accept
When Jeff apologized

Now he's all alone

Something funny that I've learned
Is just how quickly fate can turn
How one simple mistake can take you out (out, out, out)
Something funny that I've found
Is just how quickly worlds burn down
Make one wrong turn and you can't turn around ('round, 'round, 'round)
One wrong turn can burn things to the ground

Mm-mm-mm
La-da-da-da-da

I knew a girl, let's call her Jess
She took a drive to buy a dress
But missed the light as it turned red
Ran into traffic
She took a right, if she'd turned left
She be alive, would not be dead
She'd have arrived, but now instead
The end is tragic

Something funny that I've learned
Is just how quickly fate can turn
How one simple mistake can take you out (out, out, out)
Something funny that I've found
Is just how quickly worlds burn down
Make one wrong turn and you can't turn around ('round, 'round, 'round)
One wrong turn can burn things to the ground

The thing you didn't see comin'
Is that Jeff was Jess's husband
And the ex he had to call's no longer into boys at all
It's all one big misunderstanding
Like dominos crash landing
Once the first one falls, they all come tumbling down

And now he's all alone

Something funny that I've learned
Is just how quickly fate can turn
How one simple mistake can take you out (out, out, out)
Something funny that I've found
Is just how quickly worlds burn down
Make one wrong turn and you can't turn around ('round, 'round, 'round)
One wrong turn can burn things to the ground

Mm-mm-mm
La-da-da-da-da
Mm-mm-mm-mm
