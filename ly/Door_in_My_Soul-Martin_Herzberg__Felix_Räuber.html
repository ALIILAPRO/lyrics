		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There’s a door in my soul
And I hold the key
There’s a light in the hall
A light it shines for me
I can’t get enough from
This gentle warmth it fills the cold in my heart
But I am one yeah
The one who holds the key

Say, am I wrong?
Do you really see me?
I feel alone in the darkness
Is there anyone around?
Come on tell me am I wrong
Oh is this real here
Who is the man
In the mirror, is it me or you?

There‘s voice in your head
It’s the guardian of a key
So keep holding your breath
We’re diving into spheres
Your strawling around, no roots and no ground
The streets are the home your unable to find
There’s a door in your soul
And I hold the key
Will you come with me?

Say, am I wrong?
Do you really see me?
I feel alone in the darkness
Is there anyone around?
Come on tell me am I wrong
Oh is this real
Who is the man
In the mirror, is it you or me or you?
