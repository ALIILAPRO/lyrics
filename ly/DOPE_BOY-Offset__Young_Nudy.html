		  Brrt

Dope boy fresh (dope boy)
Air Force Ones and a TEC (hey)
Dope boy, dope boy checks (checks)
Coke boy, whip it up and stretch it (coke boy)
Cash, won't do no credit (cash)
Bags of the gas like veggies (gas)
Shooters on the roof, be ready (grraow)
Dope boy walkin' with the lettuce (dope, dope)

Dope boy knots (dope boy), dope boy, dope boy knots (dope)
Dope boy block, nigga better not send shots (no, no)
Dope boy knots, dope boy, dope boy knots (dope)
Dope boy block (woo), nigga better not send shots (hey)

I'm lookin' for jays to serve (jays)
Need a split? Nigga, say the word (say it)
Trappin' nicks, I can make it work (make it work)
Four other plays on reserve (hey)
If he don't want it, somebody gon' grab it (who?)
How I know? 'Cause the dope automatic (how you know?)
Thirty more, 'outta score, he gon' catch it (thirty more)
Get another load in and I pass it (woo)
We get money, don't talk and don't brag it (shh)
Hide the money, it's moldin' with maggots (hide the money)
Get the TP, they never could track it (get the TP)
I call Freak and he pick up the package (I call Freak)
I'm goin' dumb in the trap, need a straightjacket (dumb)
'Bout that money, they ready to get active (bow)
He run with that work and they kidnapped him (go)
I really don't know what the hell happened (who)
Hundred racks on me now in the book baggy (racks)
Bought my mom a new house, she was too happy (momma)
Had to ball out in Louis, got new jackets (ball out)
Had to Forgi' my Demon, it flew past 'em (skkrt)

Dope boy fresh (dope boy)
Air Force Ones and a TEC (hey)
Dope boy, dope boy checks (checks)
Coke boy, whip it up and stretch it (coke boy)
Cash, won't do no credit (cash)
Bags of the gas like veggies (gas)
Shooters on the roof, be ready (grraow)
Dope boy walkin' with the lettuce (dope, dope)

Dope boy knots (dope boy), dope boy, dope boy knots (dope)
Dope boy block, nigga better not send shots (no, no)
Dope boy knots, dope boy, dope boy knots (dope)
Dope boy block (woo), nigga better not send shots (hey)

What you know about dope?
You can't tell me none' (you can't tell me none')
You can't front me none' (you can't front me none')
You can't sell me none' (you can't sell me none')
I come and take your gun (gun)
I put trappers on the run (on the run)
Niggas ain't havin' no tons (no tons)
Slime got tons of guns (slime got tons of guns)
And I got hella shooters rockin' with me
We rockin' out with the glizzies, is you with me?
We sparin' nobody, nigga, come to get it (fuck 'em)
And I ain't got no time for no friends in this bitch (nah, uh-uh)
Don't bring your people 'round me, know that Big Slime ain't cliquin' (nah)
Line niggas up in these streets, nigga be blind when they get it (bah)

Dope boy fresh (dope boy)
Air Force Ones and a TEC (hey)
Dope boy, dope boy checks (checks)
Coke boy, whip it up and stretch it (coke boy)
Cash, won't do no credit (cash)
Bags of the gas like veggies (gas)
Shooters on the roof, be ready (grraow)
Dope boy walkin' with the lettuce (dope, dope)

Dope boy knots (dope boy), dope boy, dope boy knots (dope)
Dope boy block, nigga better not send shots (no, no)
Dope boy knots, dope boy, dope boy knots (dope)
Dope boy block (woo), nigga better not send shots (hey)
