		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This will get bigger if you know what I mean
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I heard it's en vogue to be super thin
But your friends aren't thick, so they can't come in
I'm feeling apathetic after scrolling through hell
I think I've got a boner but I can't really tell and the fans are on

It's cynical
This Adderall
And vitriol
And young people drinking Aperol

And it's about time
This is what it looks like

I'm sorry about my twenties, I was learning the ropes
I had a tendency of thinking about it after I spoke
"We're experiencing life through the postmodern lens"
Oh, call it like it is
You're making an aesthetic out of not doing well
And mining all the bits of you you think you can sell while the fans are on

Whimsical
Political
Liberal
With young people as collateral

You see, I can't sleep 'cause the American Dream
Has been buying up all of my self esteem
While QAnon created a legitimate scene
But it was just some bloke in the Philippines

And it's about time
And it's about time
This is what it looks like
And it's about time
And it's about time
This is what it looks like
This is what it looks like

I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
I'm sorry if you're living and you're seventeen
