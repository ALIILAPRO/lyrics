		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Burn me out like cuts
Fade out when Centralia does
Nostrils off of dust
Or like veins too many needles touch
If pain is beauty, I'm a pretty bitch
Got too quiet, now they're whispering

If you blink then you might miss it
Every hour is a week
I don't need sympathetics
I just need some room to breathe
Do not fucking talk to me
My genetics got me tweaked
Running from myself
I can't blame 'em when they leave

Time slips away
Burn out, don't fade
Dance on my grave
I will never be them
I will never be them
I will never be them
I will never be them
I will never be them

My mind is a mosh pit
Think I might've lost it
Starting to believe there's only one way I can stop this
If pain is beauty, I'm a guillotine, yeah
You bring the match, I'll bring the kerosene

Let the gabapentin set in, suffocate me in my sleep
Adderall to wake up, Omeprazole's all they eat
Do not fucking look at me, paranoia got me peeved
They say they want to help, but they always fucking leave

Leave me by myself
Leave me DND
Leave me in the dark
Leave me with these things
Tell me that you love me, I know all your talk is cheap
Baby, I'm a code mistake, I was never meant to be (Corpse)

Time slips away
Burn out, don't fade
Dance on my grave (I'll never be them)
I will never be them (I will never be them)
I will never be them (no, I will never be them)
I will never be them (I will never be them)
I will never be them (I will never be them)
I will never be them

Yeah-haha, no
I will never be them
I will always be a code mis-ta-ake

I can't fuckin' believe you
