		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've had other guys
I've looked into their eyes
But I never knew love before
'Til you walked through my door
I've had other lips
I've sailed a thousand ships
But no matter where I go
You're the one for me baby
This I know 'cause it's

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

I've heard all the lines
I've cried oh so many times
Those tear drops they won't fall again
I'm so excited 'cause you're my best friend

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love was all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said

True love
You're the one I'm dreaming of
Your heart fits me like a glove
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

'Cause it's true love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

No more sadness, I kiss it good-bye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love, it's
(True love baby) True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love, it's true

So if you should ever doubt
Wonder what love is all about
Just think back and remember dear
Those words whispered in your ear
I said

No more sadness, I kiss it good-bye
The sun is bursting right out of the sky
I searched the whole world for someone like you
Don't you know, don't you know that it's

True love (This time I know it's true love)
You're the one I'm dreaming of (The one I'm dreaming of)
Your heart fits me like a glove (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you

I love you (This time I know it's true love)
La la la la la la la (The one I'm dreaming of)
La la la la la la la (Heart fits just like a glove)
And I'm gonna be true blue
Baby, I love you, 'cause it's

(True love baby) true love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love, it's
(True love baby) True love, oh baby, true love, oh baby
True love, oh baby, true love, it's true (True love baby)

La la la la la (True love baby)
