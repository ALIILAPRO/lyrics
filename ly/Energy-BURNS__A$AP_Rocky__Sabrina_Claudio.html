		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How do I know it's real?
Barely keep my composure
Love me with no disclosure
Tell 'em all how you feel (Uh)

Notice this
Electric charges flowin' through your fingertips
When your hands on my thighs

Do you feel this energy when 
I'm near you?
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?

Oh, it's not just me
Don't deny all this energy, oh
Oh, it's not just me
Undeniably, wait and see

Oh, the pressure
Between us is kinetic when you move closer
And I can't get enough

Do you feel this energy when I'm near you?
Do you?
Oh
Do you?

Oh, it's not just me
Don't deny all this energy, oh
Oh, it's not just me
Undeniably, wait and see

How do I know it's real?
Barely keep my composure
Tell me she comin' over
Now I know how it feels
How do I know it's real?
Barely keep my composure
Love me with no disclosure
Tell 'em all how you feel (uh)

Energy undeniable (energy, energy)
Chemistry so reliable (chemistry, chemistry)
Memories reifiable (memories, memories)
Match lit, don't forget the lighter fluid
I just pray my heart is fireproof
Got thick skin 'cause it's bulletproof
And you sendin' shots 'cause you vulnerable (vulnerable)
Like I'm tired of fightin', shit, let's call a truce (uh)
I'm just tryna get back on your good side (side)
Stay on the right path full time (time)
Watch for the camera now, big smiles (smiles)
Bad boys wanna have a good time (time)
Plans made in advance
Let's make some babies, that makes us parents
Nah, Im just playin', ain't it apparent?
Make no mistake, I'd impregnate 
If I had the chance

Oh, it's not just me
Don't deny all this energy, oh
Oh, it's not just me
Undeniably, wait and see

How do I know it's real?
Barely keep my composure
Tell me she comin' over
Now I know how it feels
How do I know it's real?
Barely keep my composure
Love me with no disclosure
Tell 'em all how you feel (uh)

Oh, it's not just me
Don't deny all this energy, oh
Oh, it's not just me
Undeniably, wait and see
