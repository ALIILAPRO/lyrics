		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like this right here, yeah 
Bad Boy, and we won't stop 
Faith, '99 

We can dance, dance, dance 
Clap your hands, hands, hands 
All night, if you're in the mood 
Do what you wanna do 
All night long 

Happy days are here 
So leave your cares behind 
Just relax your mind 
It's so easy to do it 
Just enjoy yourself (enjoy yourself)
If the feeling's right 
Get your groove on tonight 
Take your time tonight (take you time)
Everything's all right 
Ain't nothin' but a party 

We can dance, dance, dance 
Clap your hands, hands, hands 
All night (all night long), if you're in the mood 
Do what you wanna do (dance all night long)
All night long

Get up on the floor 
Don't worry 'bout a thing 
The rhythm's got you now 
So come on, get into it 

Just enjoy yourself 
If the feeling's right 
Get your groove on tonight 
Take your time tonight 
Everything's all right (uh uh)
Ain't nothin' but a party 

We can dance, dance, dance (all night long)
Clap your hands, hands, hands 
All night, if you're in the mood 
Do what you wanna do 
All night long

Have a (uh-huh) good time 
Lay back, relax 
Free (just free) your mind (your mind)
Let the music take control of you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

If it's hot then I must've did it 
If it's not then I wasn't with it 
Bad Boy stay committed 
Whether hip-hop or R&B 
Featurin' Faith Evans, co-starrin' me, P. Diddy 
You know I got the key to your city 
Unlock the door, rock some more 
Beats we lace 
Bad Boy heat the place 
We run R&B too 'cause we keep the faith 
Givin' the streets a taste 
Blaze the charts 
I remember 
In case you forgot 
First Lady be makin' it hot 
Ain't nobody takin' the spot 
Now it's Faith instead of pain 
Comin' through with a better grain 
In the dash, cell phone better range 
Get the cash, and stock paper for the whole four quarters 
Damn, some things never change 
Can ya feel me? Ya feel me? Let's make 'em dance 
Let's go 

We can dance, dance, dance (DJ, just play)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (the song)
All night, if you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night long)
All night long

Have a (have a) good time 
Lay back, relax 
Free (just free) your mind (your mind)
Let the music take control of you 

We can dance, dance, dance (all)
Clap your hands, hands, hands
All night (night long), if you're in the mood (all)
Do what you wanna do (night)(yeah yeah)
All night long

We can dance, dance, dance (don't stop the music)
Clap your hands, hands, hands (night)
All night long (we can party all night)
If you're in the mood (DJ)
Do what you wanna do (play my song)
All night long (we can party, all night, all night long)
