		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i’ve been, pondering the thought of you
maybe it’s the cheap perfume
oh pretty girl

You ask a million questions that I barely even got the answer to
So we sit across this able where you see the sweat fall off my face

Promise you’ll be careful with my heart
Cause there’s nobody else, nobody else
Promise you’ll be careful from the start
Oh pretty girl 

You could take my heart away
You could even steal a kiss
Just promise you’ll be careful with my heart oh pretty girl

You put on your makeup
Just to say that you look fine
Oh honey, I have to disagree (i think you look very beautiful)

You ask a million questions that I barely even got the answer to
So we sit across this able where you see the sweat fall off my face

Promise you’ll be careful with my heart
Cause there’s nobody else, nobody else
Promise you’ll be careful from the start
Oh pretty girl 

You could take my heart away
You could even steal a kiss
Just promise you’ll be careful with my heart oh pretty girl
