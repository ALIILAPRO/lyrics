		  Just A Lil' Bit (Too Phat with Warren G) 

Intro
[Warren G]
You know what?
Play it back a little
Lemme hear what it sound like real quick
[Malique]
That's how you do that
Back in Long Beach Warren?
Same ish?
[Warren G]
Same ish
[Malique]
Same ish 

Warren G
Too Phat baby
East meets West collabo
Qumran (haha)
Yea Joe
Lets bang the chorus real quick
Lets make em remember this 

Chorus
It's kinda easy
When you listen to the G`d up sound
A little bit of hip-hop
Will make the world go round
We got the sound for the rest
And it's easy to see
That this Too Phat and Warren G 

Verse 1 (Joe Flizzow)
Hip-hop be connecting
Kuala Lumpur with LB
Hip-hop be rocking up towns
Laced with LV
Ain't necessary to roll
In nice rimmed M3's
And be blinging
Hip-hop be bringing together emcees
Y'all asking who that kid
With a flow that's sick
It's Flizzow
And who's Malique
On this Qumran tip
Now follow
We Too Phat
Hip-hop be running thru our veins
It gets us up in the morning
Hip-hop keeps me sane
Wherever you rapping
It's embraced across the globe
It's truly amazing
How it gives people hope
That beat is dope
Y'all holla at the DJ
Hip-hop is staying up at night
To bid for kicks on e-bay
This should be off the hizee
Going make you move for shizze
Blow up spots
Getting crunk with Warren G'zee
Now best believe
KL got the world tuned in
Joe Flizzow with my elements
So let the party begin... 

Chorus (2x)
It's kinda easy
When you listen to the G`d up sound
A little bit of hip-hop
Will make the world go round
We got the sound for the rest
And it's easy to see
That this Too Phat and Warren G 

Verse 2 (Warren G)
Assalamualaikum
From the general
Warren G`zee for shizzo
And that's the way love go
It's been a long time
I shouldn't have left you
Without a west coast rhyme to step to
You know how it go
When it's real hip-hop
Kuala Lumpur don't stop
Long Beach won't stop on top
Keep them blocks so hot
From Malaysia
Back to my spot
Islamic in the form of Tupac
I ride so deep
With Joe and Malique
We go together
Like a flow and a beat
And don't try to compete
With the long beach original
Back on the gizzo 

(Just a little bit) 

Chorus (2x)
It's kinda easy
When you listen to the G`d up sound
A little bit of hip-hop
Will make the world go round
We got the sound for the rest
And it's easy to see
That this Too Phat and Warren G 

Verse 3 (Malique)
Wassalam Warren
We thank you for the bit
Now the three of us together
Regulating this hit
We banging this hit
And making lil ends on the side
Another classic joint now
It's time to ride
And spread love
Across this loony circle
Ride from boogie down to Bangalore
It's universal
Whether blue or purple
Black or white
Light brown
It's not about skin
But B-boy battles
Who outtwirls and outspins
Screaming (Go B-boy!)
While B-boys gets busy
In hip-hop “whuttup's” hello
And for sure is for shizee
Doo rags and corn rows
And kids with pants sagging
Shaking aerosol cans
While bombing and tagging
While DJ`s is crabbing
Scratching breaking styluses
Hooking beats and moving
More heads than hairstylists
Somebody better tell me
Where them bootleggers and pirates is
Should rush ‘em all wit viruses
Or put ‘em where osiris is
I hear no promises
So till then
Y'all see me bawling
I'll keep y'all head bopping
And stay yes yes y'all'in
God bless
The four elements story is told
And here's a little bit of hip-hop
For your soul 

Chorus(3x)
It's kinda easy
When you listen to the G`d up sound
A little bit of hip-hop
Will make the world go round
We got the sound for the rest
And it's easy to see
That this Too Phat and Warren G
