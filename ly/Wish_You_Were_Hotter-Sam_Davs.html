		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If a smile is all that mattered then you'd take the cake
If blue eyes won the gold there'd be no mistake
If all it took was a truck to be sexy
You'd be on the cover of a magazine easy
You got all the right moves
Know how to talk smooth
You got that going for you
But you woulda been hotter if it wasn't skin deep
If you didn't pretend that you cared about me
It woulda been hotter if you just opened up
You're so superficial and it just ain't enough
Yeah you're nice to look at but I ain't gonna bother
Yeah you had a queen and I'm sorry but ya lost her
This probably coulda gone much farther
But I wish you were, wish you were hotter
Well I guess all that flirting was filling empty space
Cause you wished I looked different, oh what a waste
Cause I'm fine with my thick thighs
I ain't your type and I don't mind
You got all the right moves
Know how to talk smooth
You got that going for you
But you woulda been hotter if it wasn't skin deep
If you didn't pretend that you cared about me
It woulda been hotter if you just opened up
You're so superficial and it just ain't enough
Yeah you're nice to look at but I ain't gonna bother
Yeah you had a queen and I'm sorry but ya lost her
This probably coulda gone much farther
But I wish you were, wish you were hotter
I wish you were, wish you were
Wish you were, wish you were
Wish you were hotter
I wish you were, wish you were
Wish you were, wish you were hotter
Oh what a bummer
You woulda been hotter if it wasn't skin deep
If you didn't pretend that you cared about me
It woulda been hotter if you just opened up
You're so superficial and it just ain't enough
Yeah you're nice to look at but I ain't gonna bother
Yeah you had a queen and I'm sorry but ya lost her
This probably coulda gone much farther
But I wish you were, wish you were hotter
Woah ouuu
Hotter
Woah ouuu
I wish you were, wish you were
Hotter
