		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things were happening
I felt the weight of the expectation on my chest
My mind was traveling
But I swear that I don't remember where it went

They said things were growing
So why do I feel like nothing at all is left?
So I'll keep on moving
If I'm standing still then I'll feel the emptiness

'Cause I get so lonely and you get so low
And I look so stupid when I lose control
I'm alone in my bedroom and the walls are caving in
And I thought I'd be happy, but I'm barely breathing
Ooh, I'm barely breathing

'Cause I'm feeling down, but I'm falling up
And I'm breaking out, but not out of luck
As I breathe the air into my lungs
I wanted everything but nothing's ever good enough (ooh)

I gotta change me
And If I wake up now there's a chance to start again (mm)
But if I wait
Could I get back to the place where it all began before?

I got so lonely and you got so low
And I looked so stupid when you came to my show
I'm alone in the spotlight and the walls are caving in
And I thought I'd be happy but I'm barely breathing
Ooh, I'm barely breathing

'Cause I'm feeling down but I'm falling up
And I'm breaking out but not out of luck
As I breathe the air into my lungs
I wanted everything but nothing's ever good enough

And I hate the man that I've turned into
And I've come so far, what did I lose?
And I swear to God I'll make it through
I'll make it through

'Cause I get so lonely and you get so low
And I looked so stupid when you came to my show
I'm alone in the spotlight and the walls are caving in
And I thought I'd be happy but I'm barely breathing
Ooh, I'm barely breathing

'Cause I'm feeling down but I'm falling up
And I'm breaking out but not out of luck
As I breathe the air into my lungs
I wanted everything but nothing's ever good enough
