		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not a fan of puppeteers
But I have a nagging fear
Someone else is pulling at the strings
Something terrible is going down
Through the entire town
Wreaking anarchy and all it brings

I can't sit idly
No, I can't move at all
I curse the name
The one behind it all

Discord, I'm howling at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do to make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore so take your tyranny away

(Discord)
(Discord)

I'm fine with changing status quo
But not in letting go
Now the world is being torn apart
A terrible catastrophe
Played by a symphony
What a terrifying work of art

I can't sit idly
No, I can't move at all
I curse the name
The one behind it all

Discord, I'm howling at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do to make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore so take your tyranny away

Discord, I'm howling at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do to make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore so take your tyranny away
