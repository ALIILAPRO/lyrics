		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Now you're gone) (oh) (ah-ah-ah) (yeah)(uh)
I know you see her in me
You're in my head girl just don't leave
I know I fucked up but baby please
Oh was I never enough?
I thought I'm all you wanted
Nothing I can do
All I want is you (girl something is wrong)
I've got a feeling
Babe I'm missing something
All I did for you
Everything I do (girl something is wrong)
I've got a feeling babe you're not worth loving
My obsession it just won't do
Because all the things you did to me
You know that I
Shouldn't even be here
I don't know what I see in you
But it ain't true
Nothing I can do
All I want is you (girl something is wrong)
I got a feeling babe I'm missing something
All I did for you
Everything I do
I got a feeling babe you're not worth loving
(Ah)
There's nothing I can do to change your mind
And everything we did is laid behind
And all the things I'd do to love you girl
But still you don't seem to make it work (room full of lust)
But I'm sick of us
Because our times not now
I think about the things we used to do (ah)
