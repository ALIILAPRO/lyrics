		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take me for a ride  
Well take it slow  
No, I will never leave your side  

Lavisher, she said  
I'll imitate your form with moves that you'll regret 

So take me away

I can be what you want  
When you want more  
I can make you mine  
I want more  
Primadonna I'm your evermore   

 

So gimme the cure  
From the poison that's your touch  
Your allure  

Makes me feel like I'm enough 
Will you woe? 
If I go? 
In the heat of passion I won't give you chance too 
You took to long 

Keep your eyes open baby 
Nobody move 

So touch my skin just right  
Do you romanticise the thought out of spite?  

Dare to fall in love with me 
Cause I've been in the fire  

Yeah I know  
Take me away  

I can feel you calling back my name 
I'm lost in tears of scarlet so help move 

I've got nothing to prove  
No, no, no 
Come and catch me baby come on  
My dote?  
I don't know 

Now there's nowhere to go so come on  
Come and catch me baby come on  
So gimme the cure  
From the poison that's your touch  

Your allure  
Makes me feel like I'm enough 
Will you woe? 
If I go? 
No, your eyes won't leave my heart
