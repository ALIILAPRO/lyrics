		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bring two home to their side piece
I get so high on a dime piece
I get so high on the highway
Pushin' that drank through the IV
When you look up its a star sea
When you look down you can find me
I'm on the floor with my ID
Recovering from pain that you caused me
Drive so fast in the fast life
Don't give a damn 'bout a gas light
All of my friends wanna have you
And they all ask what that ass like
And they'll never know what it feel like
Pill for the pain 'cause it feel right
Drive so slow in the fast life
I don't give a damn 'bout a gas light
My girl charge by the hour
And she pay me with that flour
She did some lines in the bathroom
We might as well take a shower
Said she broke up with her boyfriend
That means she need a better man
Baby, I could be that for you
Fuck with me so I can show you
Look, I wanna see you tonight
I'm fuckin' hoes, takin' flights
Different city every night
Three days since I've seen the light
And I've been looking out the door
Trying to find something to live for
But I can't ever seem to find it
Three days since I've been reminded
Time ran out on my timepiece
This is Hublot, not Chinese
I could fuck twins, no siamese
Ice out my girl make her neck freeze
She see it hittin' her belly
I got her bent in the Bentley
She make it jiggle for blue cheese
She make it pop for two keys
Take too long to recover
From all the shots off each other
I drank so much vodka
Now it just tastes like water
White girl white like Madonna
But she still smoke marijuana
Pussy still tastes so dolce
If she still rockin' Gabbana
Drive so fast in the fast life
Don't give a damn 'bout a gas light
All of my friends wanna have you
And they all ask what that ass like
And they'll never know what it feel like
Pill for the pain 'cause it feel right
Drive so slow in the fast life
I don't give a damn 'bout a gas light
I wanna see you tonight
I'm fuckin' hoes, takin' flights
Different city every night
Three days since I've seen the light
And I've been looking out the door
Trying to find something to live for
But I can't ever seem to find it
Two days since I've been reminded
