		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't tell ya baby, what went wrong
I can't make you feel what you felt so long ago
I'll let it show
I can't give you back what's been hurt
Heartaches come and go and all that's left are the words
I can't let go

If we take some time to think it over, baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go

Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I've got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long

I can't feel the things that cause you pain
I can't clear my heart of your love, it falls like rain
Ain't the same
I hear you calling far away
Tearing through my soul, I just can't take another day
Who's to blame?

If we take some time to think it over baby
Take some time, let me know
If you really want to go

Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I've got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long

Do you want to see me beggin', baby?
Can't you give me just one more day?
Can't you see my heart's been draggin' lately?
I've been lookin' for the words to say

Don't know what you got till it's gone
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I've got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long, yeah

Don't know what you got till it's gone, no
Don't know what it is I did so wrong
Now I know what I've got
It's just this song
And it ain't easy to get back
Takes so long
