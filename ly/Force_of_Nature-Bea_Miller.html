		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why but my hands are shaking
I can see you coming and I stand here waiting
Yeah I get tongue tied in the conversation
It's an F'd up, bad, sick situation

I tried to tie my heart down, board up all the windows
Oh but it's too late now
I let you get too close
I know I should take cover, hide inside these four walls
But baby I surrender, it all

'Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger but I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground and I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker, but baby you're a force of nature
Baby you're a force of nature

I feel your lips move in and they take me under
You know just what to do, how to make me want you
And I know I'll be broken when it's over
Oh but I can't help but pull you closer

I tried to tie my heart down, board up all the windows
Oh but it's too late now
I let you get too close

'Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger but I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground and I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker, but baby you're a force of nature

I'll be here 'till we collide
I don't care if I survive
So crash into me one more time
Yeah, yeah, oh

'Cause you're a force of nature
Look at what you've done
I can taste the danger but I don't wanna run
So pull me to the ground and I won't put up a fight
I'm a caution taker, but baby you're a force of nature
Baby you're a force of nature

Baby you're a force of nature
Baby you're a force of nature
