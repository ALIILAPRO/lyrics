		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
Let's go
(It's a smash) ayy, yeah
Let's go, ayy, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah (turn me up)
Ayy, yeah (turn me up)
Ayy, ayy, let's go
Yeah, what? Ayy (turn me up) 
Yeah (let's go)

Ridin' 'round town and I'm so fucked up
I can't even motherfuckin' see
Take a look at my life, got me wondering to myself
How the fuck could this shit ever be? (How the fuck?)
I just popped two bars, now I'm playin' with the stars
While the moon shine down on my face (face)
I been lookin' in the mirror, couldn't see it any clearer
I still can't slow my pace
Let's go, let's go (yeah)
So fucked up and I don't know why, yeah, ayy (don't know why)
So fucked up and I don't know why, don't know why, yeah (I don't)
So fucked up and I don't know why, yeah, ayy (don't know why)
So fucked up and I don't know why, don't know why (yeah, let's get it)

Feeling dope sick in the Rolls Royce (skrrt, skrrt)
From the detox when I got no choice (Young Wetto)
Bitch tell me somethin' I ain't ever heard before (shut up)
I got angels and they waitin' at the front door
Couple journals filled up with some paranoia
Couple checks writtin' to fuckin' I don't know
Swear this love in my heart don't switch sides
Blacked out where the real me resides
Let's go, let's go, let's get it (yeah)
Just want me back by midnight
But you know how it is when it hits right (yeah)
Comin' back for your love, won't lose sight
Somewhere where good men shouldn't be (shouldn't be)
But there's someone else that it do to me
Just another day I'm tryna stay even (yeah)
Dad stayin' up makin' sure that I'm breathin'
Fuck, how can you help me? How can you save me? Yeah (yeah)
When this cup doin' more than the love that you gave me
Father, I'm askin', why you've forsake me? (Yeah why you've forsaken me?)
If you see I'm at peace then, baby, don't wake me

Ayy, yeah (let's go)
Ayy, yeah, yeah
Ayy, yeah (turn me up)
Ayy, yeah (turn me up)
Ayy, ayy, let's go
Yeah, what? Ayy (turn me up) 
Yeah (let's go)

Ridin' 'round town and I'm so fucked up
I can't even motherfuckin' see
Take a look at my life, got me wondering to myself
How the fuck could this shit ever be? (How the fuck?)
I just popped two bars, now I'm playin' with the stars
While the moon shine down on my face (face)
I been lookin' in the mirror, couldn't see it any clearer
I still can't slow my pace
Let's go, let's go (yeah)
So fucked up and I don't know why, yeah, ayy (don't know why)
So fucked up and I don't know why, don't know why, yeah (I don't)
So fucked up and I don't know why, yeah, ayy (don't know why)
So fucked up and I don't know why, don't know why (yeah, let's get it)
