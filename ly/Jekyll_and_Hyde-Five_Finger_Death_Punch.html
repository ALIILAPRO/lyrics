		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's just so much goddamned weight on my shoulders
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only getting colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
There's just so much goddamned weight on my shoulders
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life
Supposed to be happy, but I'm only getting colder
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

Oh, yo, yo, there's a demon inside
Oh, yo, yo, just like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh, yo, yo, all this anger inside
Oh, yo, yo, I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

There's just so much goddamned weight on your shoulders
That you can't just live your motherfucking life
The story's getting old and my heart is getting colder
I just wanna be Jekyll, but I'm always fighting Hyde
You've got rocks in your head, I can hear them rolling 'round
You can say that you're above it, but you're always falling down
Is there a method to your madness, is it all about pride?
Everyone I know, they've got a demon inside

Oh, yo, yo, there's a demon inside
Oh, yo, yo, just like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh, yo, yo, all this anger inside
Oh, yo, yo, I feel like Jekyll and Hyde

If I wasn't so deranged, could I ever face the pain?
If I ever want to change, would this all remain the same?
Oh, yo, yo
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life
Oh, yo, yo
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside
Oh, yo, yo
All I'm trying to do is live my motherfucking life
Oh, yo, yo
Wear a smile on my face, but there's a demon inside

Oh, yo, yo, there's a demon inside
Oh, yo, yo, just like Jekyll and Hyde
Oh, yo, yo, all this anger inside
Oh, yo, yo, I feel like Jekyll and Hyde
