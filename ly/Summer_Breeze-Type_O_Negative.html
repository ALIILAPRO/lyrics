		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See the curtains hangin' in the window
Even on a Friday night
A little light-a-shinin' in the window
Lets me know everything's all right

Summer breeze 
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze 
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

See the paper layin' on the sidewalk
Music from the house next door
So I walk on up to the door step
Through the screen and across the floor

Summer breeze 
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze 
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Sweet days of summer
The jasmine's in bloom
July is dressed up and playing her tune
When I come home 
From a hard day's work
And you're waitin' there
Not a care
Not a care in the world

See the smile awaitin' in the kitchen
Food cookin' and the plates for two
Feel your arms reachin' out to hold me
In the evening when the day is through

Summer breeze 
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze, yeah
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind

Summer breeze 
Makes me feel fine
Blowin' through the jasmine in my mind
