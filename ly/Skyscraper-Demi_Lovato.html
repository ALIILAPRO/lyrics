		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skies are crying
I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence
Has an ending
Like we never had a chance

Do you have to
Make me feel like
There is nothing left of me

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

As the smoke clears
I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you
Feel better
To watch me while I bleed

All my windows
Still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

Go run run run
I'm gonna stay right here
Watch you disappear ya yaa
Go run run run
Ya it's a long way down
But I am closer to the clouds up here

You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

(Like a skyscraper)
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
