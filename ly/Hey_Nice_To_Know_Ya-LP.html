		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been long, long gone
Got my heart broke in the car
Parked outside the minibar
Oh, whoa, Lord
It took me months to lose the pain
Now I only take the train

Oh, yeah, yeah

It's been dark, so dark
I saw that dress you used to wear
In the picture on his chair
Oh, whoa, men
That one time I saw his face
I knew he'd try to take my place

Whoa, yeah, yeah

Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya

Should've been a model not a fire starter
Burnin' down the circus
Don't know how to work this out
(Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya)

Started out a novice
Finished like an artist
Crashin' like a party
Cryin' in the lobby, oh
(Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya)

It's been hard, so hard to know ya
Out there on the street
I could only hope we'd meet
Oh, oh, my
It's a bird's walk to be sure
We'll never find a cure

Whoa, yeah, yeah
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya

Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya

Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya

Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya
Hey nice to know ya

Should've been a model
Not a fire starter
Burnin' down the circus
Don't know how to work this out

Started out a novice
Finished like an artist
Crashing like a party
Cryin' in the lobby, oh
You know it's been hard
