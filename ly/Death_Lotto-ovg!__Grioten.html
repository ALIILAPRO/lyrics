		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't need no friends
I got bitches on my line
Imma write you on my Death Note
Don't waste my time
If you wanna fuck with me
I'll fucking light you up inside
And if you tryna have some fun
I'll fucking put you in a tie like
Bitch I'm on go go go go go
Like bitch I'm on a roll roll roll roll roll
Why you pull up with a stick?
I'm tryna pull up with fist and we fight
Like one two, Kung Fu
You finna see the light
Imma smoke you, cigarette
Blurry sight dripping blood, Bud Light
When I pull up to the scene
I wipe you out like Mister Clean
What the fuck you want from from me?
Boy you ain't shit, I pack a treat
Like I'm just tryna fuck, I don't want nothing in between
Ay, pull up with my Sharingan eye
And you know I don't play I take down five
Got these baddies on me and you know I don't lie
Put a blade through my chest and I'm going "bankai"
Putting on my mask and I finna turn hollow
Straw Hat Pirates, and you know my crew follows
Stacking these racks I don't need no lotto
Living large like a Titan I ain't talking Colossal
Like damn, Tanjiro I'm slaying demons
Slicing through him he ain't breathin
He want my blood but I ain't bleedin
I'm green and booming yeah I'm creepin
Running in these lanes and I'm finna drift through
Got no hands on the wheel and my whip is brand new
And you know we makin' waves and you know we makin' moves
Fill 'em with the smoke Shadow Clone Jutsu
There are many types of monsters in this world
Monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble
Monsters who abduct children
Monsters who devour dreams
Monsters who suck blood
And monsters who always tell lies…
Watch your back cause I might attack
Black belt bitch I'm fast
Can't see where I'm at
Drifting through the rain
Dark tint matte black
What the fuck do you want?
Bitch shut the fuck up, I'm relaxed
I ain't tryna fuck with you or your bros
Bitch you are a broke bitch
Put in the work bitch
You gon' stay homeless
Imma paint your walls red like I'm Janovic
Middle fingers to the haters that are all alone bitch
Now everything that was in my way is gone…
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
It's only a matter of time before I get rid of the police…
What do you think of that, L?
This is my perfect victory!
That's right!
I WIN!
Bitch I'm on go go go go go
Like bitch I'm on a roll roll roll roll roll
Why you pull up with a stick?
I'm tryna pull up with fist and we fight
Like one two, Kung Fu
You finna see the light
Imma smoke you, cigarette
Blurry sight dripping blood, Bud Light
When I pull up to the scene
I wipe you out like Mister Clean
What the fuck you want from from me?
Boy you ain't shit, I pack a treat
Like I'm just tryna fuck, I don't want nothing in between
