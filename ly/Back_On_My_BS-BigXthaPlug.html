		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Tony Coles)
See, I'm back on my
Yeah
See, I'm back on my bullshit

Ayy, see, I'm back on my bullshit
Came a long way from school, bitch
We them niggas been bangin' and walkin' with full clips
Pockets filled with them blue strips
Only hang with the solid, can't fuck with no loose lips
If he rat, cut him loose quick
If a fuck-nigga try, bet his ass make the news quick
Hit his ass with these blue tips
But these niggas won't shoot shit
'Cause these peons ain't steppin' how my niggas steppin'
Walk 'em down, bet that teach 'em a lesson
I been kickin' shit cool and got paper like Messi
Bitch, I'm Zion, your old nigga Reggie
She say that she love how my big ass be dressin'
How that Audemars go with that necklace
My features a dub and my shows is a blessin'
I got paper, ain't doin' no stressin'
The one who put all this together
They gave me somethin' good and I made that shit better
Turnt up the notch, my watch changed up the weather
I'm bigger and better, shit bigger than ever
Thought they was runnin', shit, I had to catch 'em
He try with some funny shit, shooter gon' stretch him
I ran up some money and never got selfish
I'm solid, I put my whole team on to blessings
