		  A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss (a real good puss)
A real good puss, a real good puss
A real good puss (yeah)
A real good puss
A real good puss

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

Yeah, nigga, don't be timid, come and lay up in it
Bring the racks, I'll play with balls like tennis
If you got the green, I cream in your spinach
They hit 'em with the, "What you 'bout to do when we finish?"
Real good puss, it's a hot commodity
On good terms when we fuck, it's apologies
Playing with the tip of his dick, my policy
Hand on the head like cosmetology
He try to walk up in the pussy, say that's while I float
I told him only Jesus gon' walk up on water
Face gettin' beat with the D, no tutorial
Creamed on my face like I'm shopping at Sephora
He like to buss a nut and keep fucking me still
The pussy popping like a balloon at a gender reveal
This ain't a non-profit pussy, bitch, you payin' my bills
It's like a new jar of jelly, hit the back 'til it spills

A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
A real good puss

Flow seas, take a dive
Squeeze watertight
Let it soak overnight
Drip inner thigh
Sweat power play
Good juice, my rain
Good puss, obey
Too hot, take a break

Too hard, get a nurse
See God, go to church
I spread, get dessert
Thirsty, I squirt
Lipstick, tight skirt
Dirty, thick girl
Dive in real thirst
Eat lunch, I serve

I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss
I just wanna feel good
Gotta lay down with some good kush
Got a good girl, a real good bush
Come and go get a real good puss

(A real good puss) a real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
(A real good puss) a real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
A real good puss
