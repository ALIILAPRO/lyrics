		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatcha gonna do when they come to you
And they say you have no one left to look up to
That can make you feel alone
Whatcha gonna do when they check you out and they
Say you have nothing left to show, you know?
It can bring you really low

You can try to find strength in my arms

Whatcha gonna do when they smile at you but you know
They're all faces out of truth you know
Don't trust those eyes at all
And whatcha gonna do when they kick your ass
There's a tiny chance it might break you in half you know
Then they leave you all alone

You can come to me and breathe out

I can give you this sweet symphony
And I hope it makes you feel fine
And it's all that you can get from me
It will always be by your side

Whatcha gonna do when the devil finds you alone
With the doubts about the ones you love
His heart is as cols as stone
Whatcha gonna do when the guy above says
You've been too bad and you need to cool down now
I think you should hear him out

You can try to find strength in my arms

You know sometimes I'm feeling lost just like you
Then I need my own sweet symphony

Whatcha gonna do when it rains on you when it's cold in the night 
And you don't seem to find a way out of the walls all around you
Whatcha gonna say when they ask you about your plans 
And about the dreams you have and whatcha gonna do now
