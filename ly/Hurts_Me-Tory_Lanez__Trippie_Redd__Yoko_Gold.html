		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh

Do you not realize that it hurts me?
When I see you go out, uh
'Cause you have the time of your life
Only when I'm not around
You know, you really don't deserve me
Lookin' for you in the crowd
To see you dancin' again
Out of mind, out of sight

But where you goin' home tonight?
Ooh, yeah
Where you goin' home tonight?
Night, night
But where you goin', goin'?
Yeah, you got what you need
And then you never came back around
But where you goin', goin'?
Now you got what you need
Now it's out of mind, out of sight

Do you not realize that it hurts me?
Just to see you have fun, uh
With those other guys
'Cause I feel like I'm your only one
And everybody in the party
Lookin' for you when it's done
'Cause you got the glow, the shine
And when they come around your arm

But where you goin' home tonight?
Ooh, yeah
Where you goin' home tonight?
Night, night
But where you goin', goin'?
Yeah, you got what you need
And then you never came back around
But where you goin', goin'?
Now you got what you need
Now it's out of mind, out of sight

I been trippin' over how you actin'
Actin' like I left you behind
I think you do it for my reaction

Do you not realize that it hurts me?
