		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna see all the ladies out there
Shaking that onion, yeah
Shake it baby

Gotta have House, music, all night long
With that House, music, you can't go wrong
Give me that House, music, to set me free
Lost in House, music, is where I wanna be
Move your body

Move your body
Move your body
Move your body
Move your body
Rock your body
Rock your body
Rock your body
Rock your body

Move your body
Move your body
Move your body
Move your body
Rock your body
Rock your body
Rock your body
Rock your body

Gotta have House, music, all night long
With that House, music, you can't go wrong
Give me that House, music, to set me free
Lost in House, music, is where I wanna be
Move your body

Gotta have House, music, all night long
With that House, music, you can't go wrong
Give me that House, music, to set me free
Lost in House, music, is where I wanna be
Move your body

Move your body
Move your body (it's gonna set you free)
Move your body
Move your body (it's gonna set you free)
Rock your body
Move your body (it's gonna set you free)
Rock your body
(Music's gonna set you free) Rock your body
