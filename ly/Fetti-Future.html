		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Freeband Sunny in this motherfucker
Original Black Migo Gang
(808 Mafia)
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm trynna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I keep the Styrofoams, I'm goin' crazy
I got my chains on, it's like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the Carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she's yellow on yellow
In the kitchen, remixin' this yellow
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti (DJ Esco)
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti (let's go)
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti

'fetti, 'fetti, 'fetti, 'fetti
Reincarnated Makiaveli
Audemars Piguet a presi'
Presidential with a bezzy
And I'm sharper than a machete
I done made it, now I'm greedy
Takin' the codeine, it's red
I shake it up in a Tahiti
200 somethin' sittin' on the dash
The Bentley Spur makin' 'em crash
Sippin' codeine, rollin' grass
I don't agree what you're doin'
I don't agree who you're screwin'
I fucked around, opened a traphouse in Europe
I fucked around, throwed away all of my money
They ran out of singles, I'm throwin' up hundreds

Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I hear the Styrofoam, I'm goin' crazy
I got my chains on, it's like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the carbon
And I was packin' back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she's yellow on yellow
In the kitchen remixin' this yellow
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti

Tell me you came with the wax
And I might flip me some stacks
And I might flip me some racks
I had to flip me some racks
You can treasure and honor this
I'm the one breakin' my promises
I started losin' my consciousness
We creepin' like Jeepers Creepers
That codeine is creepin', sleepin'
That codeine done got us so sleepy
I'm plannin' on savin' my soul
Ain't fuckin' 'round savin' no hoes
I burn up a zip, that's an O
We can smell all this weed on my clothes

Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm trynna dodge another case
Order Ace of Spades by the case
Tell 'em shoot the nigga in his face
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I keep the Styrofoams, I'm goin' crazy
I got my chains on, it's like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the Carbine
And I was tacky back when I was starvin'
And I ain't lookin' back with these fortunes
I'm pickin' up hella endorsements
My chain is yellow on yellow
My bitch, she's yellow on yellow
In the kitchen, remixin' this yellow
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with the 'fetti
Tell 'em you came with some 'fetti
