		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I listening when you tell me, baby
I hate to see you doin' like this
'Cause these things they take some time
To realize the other way still exists
But maybe it's the time
I said
You're doing just fine
Really
Maybe I'm
Making poor decisions

Is this really what you wanted for
A key to a perfect life of success
And my jacket and the stereo-oh
And my zipper's ridin' like this
To make a little chime
That rings
Maybe then you'll take a listen
In your mind
You can feel
The difference
