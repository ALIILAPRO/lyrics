		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How would you have me described 
With light 
With words you think that I’d like 
If I found out that I could fight 
Would I take you out tonight 

A little bit more 
A little bit less
A little bit harder than I thought they said 
A little bit fine 
A little bit stressed
A little bit older than I thought I’d get 
But I 
I think I like this little life 
I think I like this little life
This silly little life 

Eyes smiling over candles 
Mismatched chairs 
Arms crossing where those hands go 
It’s loud but those voices make my heart glow
And time isn’t real as the sun goes 

A little bit more 
A little bit less
A little bit harder than I thought they said 
A little bit fine 
A little bit stressed
A little bit older than I thought I’d get 
But I 
I think I like this little life 

Coming up short
Never quite knowing what for
Being a lost cause all the same 
You and I both 
I look in those eyes and I know 
That nothing is sure 
But I don’t know if that hurts me anymore 

A little bit more 
A little bit less
A little bit harder than I thought they said 
A little bit fine 
A little bit stressed
A little bit older than I thought I’d get 
But I 
Yeah I 
Yeah I
I think I like this little life 
This little life
I think I like this little life 
This silly little life
