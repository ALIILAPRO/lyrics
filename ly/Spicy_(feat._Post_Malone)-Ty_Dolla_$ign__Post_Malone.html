(Dolla $ign, Dolla $ign)

Who tryna, who tryna go? (Go)
Who gon' drop it down like it's money on the floor? (Ho)
Who tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars? (Go)
Who tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it? (Go)
She my spicy lil' mama (ooh, yeah), she let me bust her piñata (aw, yeah)
I buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow

Who tryna, who tryna go?
Who nigga hope that she don't?
Who tryna slide for the night?
Who tryna wife her? Not I
Know my name, say my name
Yellow diamonds on my chain, lemonade
I can never be your main, but tell your man
You gon' have to call him back another time
Girl, let's get out and vibe
Go up, get loud
Get right here and now
Yeah, tell me

Who tryna, who tryna go? (Go)
Who gon' drop it down like it's money on the floor? (Ho)
Who tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars? (Go)
Who tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it? (Go)
She my spicy lil' mama (ooh, yeah), she let me bust her piñata (aw, yeah)
I buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow

She tryna pull my pants down
I was lightin' up a stoge on my break time
Told her, "Babe, I got a meetin' over FaceTime"
She don't care, my lil' mama never waste time (ooh, wow)
Gotta catch a flight real quick
Sneak a Xanny on the plane in the fuckin' lipstick (the lipstick)
She look at me and laugh, give a fuck what I think (what I think)
And she bad, she a crazy, but I like her like this
Ayy, shawty so bad, man, shawty so cold
Wanna go out, twenty-five years old
Met her in the club, they were playin' "Psycho"
Now we match APs and they all rose-gold
And we both can agree
Ooh, she wilder than me

Yeah, tell me who tryna, who tryna go? (Go)
Who gon' drop it down like it's money on the floor? (Ho)
Who tryna, who tryna bust it for the dollars? (Go)
Who tryna freak, bring their homegirl and run it? (Go)
She my spicy lil' mama (ooh, yeah), she let me bust her piñata (aw, yeah)
I buy her all the designer, but she's still leavin' tomorrow
