		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I'm best, yes
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go (go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show (go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show

I'm a dragon, you're a whore
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me is a fucking bore to me
But babe
Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me songs at night about your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go (go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show (go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show

Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you baby, more, more, more, more
Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Fuckin' need you baby, more, more, more, more

Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, I'm your favorite girl

I fucked my way up to the top
This is my show
I fucked my way up to the top
Go, baby, go (go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show (go, go, go, go, go)
This is my show

Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
I need you baby, more, more, more, more
Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby, ah
