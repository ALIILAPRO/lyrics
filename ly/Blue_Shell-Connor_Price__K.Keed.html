Gotta stay fresh like a brand new whip, that, uh, new smell
Switchin' it up, too stale
They try to text, leave 'em on read
Switchin' the phone, new cell
Secrets I kept, do tell
We had to fight, tooth, nail
This is a race, I know my place
Coming for first, blue shell, woah

Just so you know, I'm the one who's disruptin' the industry
Baby, just throw up the stats
I used to lack in direction
Ironic, 'cos nowadays, I put the globe on the map
Don't need a publicist, I don't want none of this (Yeah, yeah)
I keep it simple, I show up and rap, woah
Feelin' like Cardi when she got thе bag
You know I'm closin' the gap
Autotune off, but the tunе's on auto
I set trends and then you all follow
C-notes stacked like I do staccato (Stacked)
DIY, that's the crew whole motto (Stacked, stacked)
Float on the beat like it's easy mode
I'm on a whole different level, don't even know
I could unload the whole clip and don't need to reload it
I'm golden, I got it unlimited
Listen, they know it, I'm 'bout it, my penmanship different
And missin' is not in my diction
And fiction is not in my writtens, I'm leavin' 'em spittin' (Yeah, ayy)

I'm keepin' it fresh like a brand new whip, that, uh, new smell
Switchin' it up, too stale
They try to text, leave 'em on read
Switchin' the phone, new cell
Secrets I kept, do tell
We had to fight, tooth, nail
This is a race, I know my place
Coming for first, blue shell (Yo)

I know some homies that lost my respect on the way
And that's a reality check
My problems are stackin' up problems
It's taller than me, for real, it's givin' me headaches
Please don't be puttin' no cameras in my face
That's tax, reality cheques
Protectin' the image and croppin' the Ls
That's life-editin', the vision is blessed
The money motion 360
Movin' in circles, lettin' shit twerk on me (Ooh-wee)
Yeah, I got it for free, don't shop at the mall
Nigga, what you even know about bricks? (Ah-ah-ah)
If you don't get it, that's cool, why you tryna tap in, dawg?
You ain't even know about leaks (If you do not get that, yeah)
I'm rockin' exclusives, drinkin' kombucha
While I'm still beatin' on beats (Beatin', on God)
They jackin' the sauce, they tryna duplicate flows
The bars is bootlegged
Making these flows gon' keep me afloat
The money my language, I'm fluent (Ee-yay)

Uh, new smell
Switchin' it up, too stale
They try to text, leave 'em on read
Switchin' the phone, new cell
Secrets I kept, do tell
We had to fight, tooth, nail
This is a race, I know my place
Coming for first, blue shell
