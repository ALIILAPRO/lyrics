		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It’s a long way down from up there
With a man made supernova
Fading in its flair
Tryna look but not stare
There’s a rusty old revolver
Smoking up the air

My mind leather, think I need reminding
‘Cos my memory’s punctured round its lining
It’s holds faces like sand in a palm until I don’t know who they are

Smile without showing your teeth
It’s too late
It’s too late
Had me without a repeat
A lightweight
A lightweight

I keep on lighting that wax
’Til it’s melted on the table
No way to relax
Lounging knees and head back
Softly whisper in my ear
It’s slipping through the cracks

There’s a pattern, I don’t need reminding
I’ve been reading through and through the lines when
They call close and then whip it away as I’m about to get a taste

Smile without showing your teeth
It’s too late
It’s too late
Had me without a repeat
A lightweight
A lightweight
