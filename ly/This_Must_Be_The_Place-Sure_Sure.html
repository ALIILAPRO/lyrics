		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb
Born with a weak heart
Guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
With my feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's okay, I know nothing's wrong
Nothing

Oh, I got plenty of time
Oh, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
Cover up and say goodnight
Say good night

Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home
She lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
And I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you or did you find me
There was a time
Before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be
Where I'll be

Oh, we drift in and out
Oh, sing into my mouth
And out of all these kinds of people
You got a face with a view
Oh I'm just an animal
Looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes that light up
Eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head
