		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You see me crying
Don't let it get you down
You see me crying
I'm back to the lost and found

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said

You see me crying
Say you're a ladies man
You see me crying
So hard to understand

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said

You see me crying
Please say you'll stick around
And I got to be your lover, honey
Let me take you to town
And I'll show you everything that I Know
And I'll never gotta let you down
'Cause my love is like a merry go round

Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
Honey, what you done to your head
Honey, what's the words that I said
