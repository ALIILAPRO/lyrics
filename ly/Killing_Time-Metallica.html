		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of the heavy attack
Message is seen, we're moving back

Preparations are made for the journey back
It's a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out

Killing time - you left from the line
Killing time - your turn to kill
Killing time - what do you say?
Killing time - aha, killing time

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

The silence is over, they attack again
Killing and hatred drive me insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message is seen, we're moving back

Killing time - you left from the line
Killing time - your turn to kill
Killing time - what do you say?
Killing time - aha, killing time

Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message is seen, we're moving back

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life

Killing time - you left from the line
Killing time - your turn to kill
Killing time - what do you say?
Killing time - aha, killing time
