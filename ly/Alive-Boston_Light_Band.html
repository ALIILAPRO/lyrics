		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're not getting out of this
Out of this alive
Filling in the spaces for you
For you and I

If only I could find a new place
A new sound
If only time could hold out
Could hold up

You'll never forget your first night
How it changed your mind
We're taking it in stages
Thinking that we'll make it

Dreaming of a new life
Dreaming of a new life

We're not getting out of this
Out of this alive
Filling in the spaces for you
For you and I

If only I could find a new place
A new sound
If only time could hold out
Could hold up

Dreaming of a new life
Dreaming of a new life
(Never, never)
I never thought I'd be running out of time
Making numbers, finding rhymes
The days are longer
The light
Is fading stronger
And I keep finding that I am wide awake and I (Thinking that we'll make it)
Thinking that we'll make it
And we're not getting out of this
Out of this alive
And we're not getting out of this
So just enjoy yourself

Dreaming of a new life
Dreaming of a new life

We're not getting out of this
Out of this alive
Filling in the spaces for you
For you and I

If only I could find a new place
A new sound
If only time could hold out
Could hold up

We're not getting out of this
Out of this alive
We're not getting out of this
Out of this alive
