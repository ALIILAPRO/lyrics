		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This breaking vow
Rest so near my tongue
Anchor on the cloud
Shade upon the sun
You took my word for it
The vanishing of doubt

Will unfold my empty space
Your time froze over

I must lead the way to this conclusion
I let you inherit these words I sing to you
See how death will bestow seclusion
The one you are looking for is hidden from view

In my absence now
Irrelevant time will pass
In nothingness abide
See the evening rise
And take my word for it
Focus is beyond your vision

Do you remember when
It didn't use to be so dark
And everything was possible
Still
