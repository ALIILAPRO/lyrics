		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I want to take you down
Sometimes I want to get you low
Brush your hair back from your eyes
Take you down let the river flow

Sometimes I go and walk the street
Behind the green sheet of glass
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned

A million poppies gonna make me sleep
Just one rose and knows your name
The fruit is rusting on the vine
The fruit is calling from the trees

Hey don't you want to go down
Like some junkie cosmonaut
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey, hey, hey like being stoned

Blue blue is the sun
Brown brown is the sky
Green green of her eyes
A million miles a million miles

Hey hey don't you want to go down
Like some disgraced cosmonaut
A million miles below their feet
A million miles, a million miles

I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned

I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned
I'll be with you girl
Like being low
Hey hey hey like being stoned
