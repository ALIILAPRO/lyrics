		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lookin' back on the track for a little green bag,
Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind
Out of sight in the night out of sight in the day,
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way.

Out of sight in the night out of sight in the day,
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way.
Lookin' back
Lookin' for some happiness

But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind, yeah!
Lookin' for some happiness

But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind.
Lookin' back on the track for a little green bag,

Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind
Out of sight in the night out of sight in the day,
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way.
Lookin' back on the track for a little little green bag,

Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind,
Alright.
Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find

Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind.
Pa pa pa pa pa pa...
