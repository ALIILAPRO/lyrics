		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The night is young at the Dazzler
I spiked my own drink, took myself to bed
Alone I pondered the cheap thrills of hotels
The miniatures, the endless throwaway towels
One for my hair, one for my foot
Another for my other foot
My face, my neck, my spilt beverages

Drunk in my hotel room, I look perfect
I look like I'm 24 before I caught your coldness
God, I'm gorgeous
I keep begging for late checkouts
Let me stay here, let me live here
In room 232 till I expire, I can shower for hours
Leave the lights on, I'm not paying those bills

The neighbours are quiet, no one is back yet
I think about the falsity of hotel sex
Expensive bed sheets and the orange glowing filaments
The way you used to say you love me
In the heat of it, holiday feeling
When it wasn't over too quick
Yeah, I'll throw the TV out the window
And I'll paint the whole room gold
I'll make potions with the minibar here
Yeah, I feel unbalanced, put my feet on the walls
Trying to meet you all night, I'm not paying for calls

Oh, this is heaven
Alone
Yeah, this is living
Alone
