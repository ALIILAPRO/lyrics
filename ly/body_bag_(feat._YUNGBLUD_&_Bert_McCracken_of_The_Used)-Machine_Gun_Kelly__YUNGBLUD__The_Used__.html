		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Her lips are soda, and I just miss the way they taste
Like Coca-Cola, spiked with aromas
I heard a rumor that she's been dancin' in the rain
I'm gonna lose it 'cause I can't swim, but

I'm not mad, I just want us to be better
It feels right when we're together, okay (okay)
I'm not mad, I just cover up my temper
You're supposed to love me better, baby
So put me in a body bag
So put me in a body bag

She's on my wish list, she knows my pressure points, it hurts
She gives me kisses, her glitter gets everywhere
I've got my issues, but I have the right to think you're wrong
You're just a witch and I tried your poison, baby, put me in a body bag

I'm not mad, I just want us to be better
It feels right when we're together, okay (oh)
I'm not mad, I just cover up my temper
You're supposed to love me better, baby
So put me in a body bag
I'm not mad, I just want us to be better
It feels right when we're together, okay (okay, baby)
I'm not mad, I just cover up my temper
You're supposed to love me better, baby
So put me in a body bag

I know that I'll dream about you always and forever
'Cause you break my heart in two
But then you piece it together, so

I'm not mad, I just want us to be better
Feels right when we're together, okay
I'm not mad, I just cover up my temper
You're supposed to love me better, baby

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa, whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa, whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa, whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
Whoa-hoa-hoa-hoa
So put me in a body bag
