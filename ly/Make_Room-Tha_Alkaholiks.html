		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I knock 'em, knock 'em out the park when other rappers are hitting bunts
I'm a togger not a fogger step on runts and don't do stunts
I got soul power, never took a cold shower
Never had a girlfriend the color of cooking flour
You can call me sleazy 'cause my rhymes are kinda greasy
Some brothers wear curls, 'cause it ain't easy being peasy
Like a kung-fu flick, I'll stick you in the dick with my toothpick
Tell 'em, Rick (you hit them harder than a fuckin' brick)
I like hoes in clothes but like 'em better in the sheets
I rock more beats than Jesse Owens ran track meets
Amazing feats move, they happen everyday
When the Ro to the J, bring his ass out to play
I weigh one-eighty, but I'm fat
I ki-, I kick up dust when I bust like a cap
Tha Alkaholik crew, and what we're here to do
Is rock a show, knock a hoe, and crack another brew

Make room for the crew with beats that thump 
Make room for the crew with beats that thump
Make room for the crew with beats that thump
Tunes hittin' hard enough to ditch your trunk
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks 
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks 
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks

The super, duper, gets it poppin' with the quickness
King Tee and the Alkies straight gettin' down to business
It's all about the Liks 'cause we're heavy on the kicks
But we're easy on the treble (adjust my mic level)
So fools can here me mic checkin' all the way in China
The skills you can't front on, Tha Alkaholik rhymer
Could rip a show up, to' up, so I always flex my talents
But my words don't be slurrin', I never lose my balance
But that's 'cause I'm slick, tossin' bottles like a discus
The Liks could rock a party from Halloween to Christmas
That's why I'm screamin' on MCs like I'm Onyx
I'm hooked on gin and tonic like your mama's hooked on phonics
So when we steppin' through, with the thirty-two of brew
Niggas better make way for the Alkaholik crew
When we're steppin' through, with the thirty-two of brew
Niggas better make way for the Alkaholik crew

Make room for the crew with beats that thump 
Make room for the crew with beats that thump
Make room for the crew with beats that thump
Tunes hittin' hard enough to ditch your trunk
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks 
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks 
It's the Liks, baby, it's the Liks

First you gotta have respect, money comes next
After you get those, come the hoes and the sex
Girl, you keep askin' 'bout the niggas in my crew
Yeah, I'm down with Pooh, but what's up with me and you
'Cause I don't give a fuck who your cousin used to fuck
'Cause I just wanna fuck, damn, I wanna fuck
So unlock the gate and make room for the heavyweight rapper
The slim light-skinned coochie slapper
Pull over to the side, so I can roll up the indo
Got the bitch head bumpin' on the front window
Wham, bam, I spanked you, ma'am
I wonder how they make these rubbers from the skin of a lamb
I blow into the mic when I check it
Had hoes gettin' naked way before I made a record
I smoked a gang of liquor, I drink a gang of boom
Like Ted, I gotta zoom, zoom, so make room

Make room for the crew with beats that thump 
Make room for the crew with beats that thump (ah yeah, ah yeah)
Make room for the crew with beats that thump (Tha Alkaholiks)
Tunes hittin' hard enough to ditch your trunk (yo)
Make room for the crew with beats that thump (before we bail)
Make room for the crew with beats that thump (we gotta give a shoutout to the crew)
Make room for the crew with beats that thump (that get's the party poppin')
Tunes hittin' hard enough to ditch your trunk (Tha Alkaholiks crew)

Olde English is in the house, and uh
What about mickey's? is in the house, and uh
St. Ide's is in the house, and uh
Crazy Horse is in the house, and uh
Genuine Draft is in the house, and uh
What about Red Bull is in the house, and uh
Colt .45 is in the house, and uh
King Cobra ain't in the house, and uh
