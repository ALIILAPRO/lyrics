		<p>
		  Hahaha (if Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
Yeah, yeah

Watch on my wrist is a car lot (let's go)
Lamb' truck talkin', it's a robot (skrrt)
Ar-15 and it fold out (grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
Patek or the Richard when I go out (hold on)
Stone cold killer rockin' Goyard (Goyard)
Stone cold killer rockin' Gucci
New Jack City servin' Pooky (what?)
Ridin' in a Vert' with a Uzi (skrrt)
Four, five, six, nigga, double up (hold on)
Took 'em on a movie, called it "Bubble Gut"
Big dawg, we'll hit your gunners up (slatt, dog)
Come in first place, not the runner up
Came from the bottom, but I made a lot of Ms
I'ma buy a couple of cars just to fuck it up (fuck it up)
I ain't never really been a fan of the games
If you spend the night with me, you gotta suck it up (hold on)
Mike Amiri jeans cost two thou' (two racks)
Saint Laurent sweater, that's a few thou' (no cap)
Savage got a lot of bad puta
So I keep liquor and hookah (who, who?)
I ain't givin' 12 no type of conversation
Better off tryin' to pull a tooth out (on God)
And I'm from the Eastside, better know as Afghan'
Nigga, we ain't really with the roo-rah (pop, pop)

Pop your shit (hold on)
Pop your shit (ayy)
Pop your shit (pop your shit, skrrt)
Pop your shit (shit)
Pop your shit (pop your shit)
Pop your shit (shit)
Pop your shit (pop your shit)
Pop your shit (shit)

Brand new coupe (skrrt, skrrt)
Ain't no roof (ain't no roof)
Sippin' Red, but my diamonds blue (but my diamonds blue)
What you smokin'? (What you smokin'?)
Uncle Snoop
It smell like gas, I think somebody pooped (slime, yeah)

The jewelry came in acquitted with a mop (slime)
The jury wasn't sure- (skrrt-skrrt, skrrt, Slime)
Nigga tried to run and got stopped (slime)
Who that trappin' on the block? (Slime)
Sent five thousand to a block (slime)
Beat 'em with a, beat 'em with a- (slime)
Comme des gar', socks and the drawers (slime)
Comme des gar' Nikes, and they shocks (slime, slime)
The bitch ran up and got- (slime)
He hatin' 'cause his album just flopped (that's slime)
Eight ounces my steak (slime), eight ounces of- (slime)
Thirty-cent ounces- (slime), is it pure-? (Not, not)
Twenty-eight ounces of, uh (slime), eight ounces of- (slime, ha)
Baby got manners (slime), she tie my shoes (slime)
Came-came equipped it with the loot (slatt-slatt)
21, that's who (slatt-slatt)
Your bitch'll probably slide by the two (slime)
You ran out of money, out the loot (red dot)
Kickin' a lot of shit, Jesus (bawk)
The bitch booty big like Bruce (slime)

Pop your shit
Pop your shit
Pop your shit
Pop your shit
Pop your shit
Pop your shit
Pop your shit
Pop your shit

Brand new coupe (brand new coupe)
Ain't no roof (it ain't no roof)
Sippin' Red, but my diamonds blue (my diamonds blue)
What you smokin'? (What you smokin'?)
Uncle Snoop (21, 21)
It smell like gas I think somebody pooped (21, 21)

We 'bout to take over, makin' 'em sour, yeah
I got a cougar, she givin' me power, yeah
I'm makin' it rain, she takin' a shower
Gucci collab with Disney, her shirt is Mickey Mouse, yeah
(Hahaha)
