		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find me in the corner
Take me by the waist
Drag me to the dance floor 
And kiss me

I could be the one
If you want me to
But I can't find the words
No more 

I saw you on the TV Show, alone
Oh, my little miracle
And though you've got no place to go, I know
You'll always be a miracle 

I can see your eyes 
Hotter than the sun
You'll believe it too
When we're done

This could be the night
You've been hoping for
Shadows on the wall
No more

I saw you on the TV Show, alone
Oh, my little miracle
And though you've got no place to go, I know
You'll always be a miracle 

I saw you on the TV Show, alone
Oh, my little miracle
And though you've got no place to go, I know
You'll always be a miracle 

It's the end of the summer
It's the time of our lives
It's the end of the summer
It's the time of our lives

I saw you on the TV Show, alone
Oh, my little miracle
And though you've got no place to go, I know
You'll always be a miracle 

I saw you on the TV Show, alone
Oh, my little miracle
And though you've got no place to go, I know
You'll always be a miracle 

It's the end of the summer
It's the time of our lives
It's the end of the summer
It's the time of our lives.
