		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought I could protect you
From paying for my sins
And I've been walking this Earth long enough
That death's a gift (oh, girl)

Been living this life so patient
Until I see you again, it's war we're facing
I know that if I die, my only choice is still defending
No matter what they say
My love for you is greater than their powers
And their armies from above

You give me strength
I'm with you either way
If I die, if I stay
Give me strength
I'm with you either way
Nothing's lost, no more pain
Just give me strength

The scars and the wounds
I wear them proud like tattoos
Reminds me that I lost you
Reminds me that I'll

Be living this life so patient
Until I see you again, it's war we're facing
I know that if I die, my only choice is still defending
No matter what they say
My love for you is greater than their powers
And their armies from above

You give me strength
I'm with you either way
If I die, if I stay
Give me strength
I'm with you either way
Nothing's lost, no more pain
Just give me strength
