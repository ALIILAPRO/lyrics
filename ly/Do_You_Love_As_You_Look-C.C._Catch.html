		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I'm dreaming like a taxi girl
Oh, surrender, love me tender, be my world
Lights are down, come play this song again
Oh forever, just together, be my man
You stole a little piece of my heart, baby
You stole my heart
One's a lonely number, be my lover
Oh, I can restart

Do you love as you look
Nobody does it like you do
All we have is tonight
There is a winner in you
Do you love as you look
You belong into strangers
Oh, I'm lost in your love
Step inside my heart

He-hey do you love
Do you love as good to look
Do you love as good to look tonight
He-hey do you love
My heart is an open book
Do you love as good to look tonight

Love is just a leave a breath away
Secret lover, be my lover, be my day
Do you feel, oh baby, what I feel
Oh, you're giving your desire, you're so real
You stole a little piece of my heart, baby
You stole my heart
Before the world was made he was a lover
Oh, don't break apart
