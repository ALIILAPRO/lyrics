		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a while to make this bed
Tired of livin' in my head
The ritual, things I ain't know
Never felt like this before

Oh, I think that I could love you
Through the darkness, through the cold

'Cause I'm feelin' somethin' when you're next to me
You fuel my fire like some kerosene
We're intertwined with nothin' in between
Cross your heart, promise you'll never leave
I'm feelin' somethin' when you're next to me
I have walls up that nobody sees
But you crash through me like an evergreen
Cross your heart, promise you'll never leave

Sorry that my heart's a mess
But you keep me from spirallin'
And I guess when it rains it pours
'Til the sun knocks at your door

Oh, I think that I could love you
Through the darkness, through the cold

'Cause I'm feelin' somethin' when you're next to me
You fuel my fire like some kerosene
We're intertwined with nothin' in between
Cross your heart, promise you'll never leave
I'm feelin' somethin' when you're next to me
I have walls up that nobody sees
But you crash through me like an evergreen
Cross your heart, promise you'll never leave
