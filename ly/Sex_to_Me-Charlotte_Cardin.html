		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You, you don't know me
You don't know nothin' 'bout the things I need, mm
And you, you don't own me
Babe, in the end, oh, we're just friends, and
Friends don't feel

Thought we had a deal
It's just sex to me

Du-du-dumb, I ain't dumb, I can see you
Come-come-come-come-coming up with ideas
Switchin' it up, oh what? Now I'm your diva
You're out of luck, baby, I might deceive ya
Thought we had a deal
It's just sex to me
I don't wanna meet your family
Unless your big brother is into me
Sex to me, sex to me
Say, "Hi" for me

You, are diggin' your own grave
You put me in a cheeky position
Now this conversation ruined all our fifty shades, mm
Dum-dee-dee-dum, I'm in need of
Time to breathe, 'cause I'm indeed a
Tad irritating
You see it's time to leave
Don't cry for me

I thought we had a deal
It's just sex to me

Du-du-dumb, I ain't dumb, I can see you (I can see you)
Come-come-come-come-coming up with ideas
Switchin' it up, oh what? Now I'm your diva
You're out of luck, baby, I might deceive ya
Thought we had a deal
It's just sex to me
Say, "Hi" for me

Sex to me
I don't wanna meet your family
Unless your big brother is into me
Sex to me, sex to me
Say, "Hi" for me
Sex to me
No, I don't wanna be your enemy
But one more talk 'bout you and me
Honestly, it's just sex to me

Du-du-dumb, I ain't dumb, I can see you
Come-come-come-come-coming up with ideas
Switchin' it up, oh what? Now I'm your diva (I'm your diva)
You're out of luck, baby, I might deceive ya
Thought we had a deal
It's just sex to me
