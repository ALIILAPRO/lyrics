		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can see you in the morning when you go to school
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule
Your teacher tells you stop your playing, get on with your work
And be like Johnnie-Too-good, don't you know he never shirks
He's coming along

After school is over, you're playing in the park
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them, won't you let it work it out
And you're full of doubt

Don't do this and don't do that
What are they trying to do?
(Make a good boy of you)
And do they know where it's at?
Don't criticize, they're old and wise
Do as they tell you to
Don't want the devil to
Come and put out your eyes

Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I'm still living, I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you want to be that
Want to see that, want to see that way
You're coming along
