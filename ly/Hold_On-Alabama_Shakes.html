		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bless my heart
Bless my soul
Didn't think I'd make it to twenty-two years old
There must be someone up above 
Saying, "Come on Brittany, you got to come on up"
You got to hold on
Yeah, you got to hold on

So, bless my heart and bless yours, too
I don't know where I'm gonna go
Don't know what what I'm gonna do
Well, must be somebody up above 
Saying, "Come on Brittany, you got to come on up"
You got to hold on
Yeah, you got to hold on

Yeah, you got to wait
Yeah, you got to wait
But I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna wait

So, bless my heart
Bless my mind
I got so much to do
I ain't got much time
So, must be someone up above
Saying, "Come on girl, yeah, you got to get back up"
You got to hold on
Yeah, you got to hold on

Yeah, you got to wait
I don't wanna wait
Well, I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait

You got to hold on
You got to hold on
You've gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
