		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need Zaza and some Runts to get me centered
Backwoods in my lungs like a splinter
Shorty think she gold because she glimmers
I know shawty thick but look my pockets ain't no thinner
Im not another nigga

I just woke up in the morning and the hills was kinda foggy
Come get these demons off me
I been around the world and back again
I ran from life came back again
Thank God we have a Walgreens
Cause these prescriptions got me making sense
I swear this air is not as dense
And I'm no longer groggy 
But if you take away my medicine the vibes no longer heaven sent
In fact I'm done through talking cause 

I need Zaza and some Runts to get me centered
Backwoods in my lungs like a splinter
Shorty think she gold because she glimmers
I know shawty thick but look my pockets ain't no thinner
Im not another nigga

I was looking for the tree man the other day
And he was kinda, kinda distant from me
He wasn't  acting the same, he was a little unusual 
He said the prices were a little higher today
He only had Zaza and some Runts, my favorite


All these ashes on my tongue cause i been tokin'
You left me heartbroken
All the times you did me wrong that was bogus
You wonder why im soulless 
It'd be hard to keep me calm if you aint notice
Cause i'm in deep emotions
I'm a walking ticking bomb
I'm quite explosive
It be really hard to focus
Thats why

I need Zaza and some Runts to get me centered
Backwoods in my lungs like a splinter
Shorty think she gold because she glimmers
I know shawty thick but look my pockets ain't no thinner
