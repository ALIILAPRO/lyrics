		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Going back in time
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Going back in time

Start a fire
Didn't need gasoline
Never took no time at all
To get me on my knees

The fruit just seem to fall
Never had to shave no tree
The door was always opening
Didn't need a key

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Take me back to the days of gold
We were young and we would never get old
No oh, no oh
Take me back to the speed of you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
No oh, no oh

Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Take my wear away
Everything's anything goes
Time and time we cross the line
And watch that bomb explode

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
There it goes, there it goes

Take me back to the days of gold
We were young and we would never get old
No oh, no oh
Take me back just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
No oh, no oh

Take me back in time
Take me back in time
Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Going back in time
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Going back in time

Take me back to the days of gold
We were young and we would never get old
Oh no, oh no 
Take me back just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do
No oh, no oh

Take me back in time
Take me back in time

Take me back to the days of gold
We were young and we would never get old
Take me back in time
Take me back just me and you
Doing things that Momma said don't do, oh

Oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Going back in time
