		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, there little honey won't you groove?
I've been trying all night to dance with you
Hey, there little lonely won't you stay?
I said, "I would rather die than feel this pain"

You said "I know I feel very much the same
But I'm afraid that I don't know, knowing is not my thing"
But I would like to dance with you
Awkwardly in haze
To this little tune

(It goes, ah)
(It goes, ah)

I said, "Hey there little honey, won't you groove?" (ooh)
I've been trying all night to dance with you (oh)
I said, "Hey there little lonely, won't you stay?" (ooh)
I said, "I would rather die than feel this pain" (ooh)

And you said, "I know I feel very much the same
But I'm afraid that I don't know, knowing's not my thing"
But I'm sure, I want to be with you
Awkwardly in haze
To our little tune

(It goes, ah)
(It goes, ah)
(It goes, ah)
(It goes, ah)

Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure

Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well if you are sure
Well if you are sure

Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well I know I'm sure
Well I know 
Well I know
