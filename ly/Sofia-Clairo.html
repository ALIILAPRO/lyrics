		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

You know I'll do anything you ask me to
But oh my God, I think I'm in love with you
Standin' here alone now, think that we can drive around
I just wanna say how I love you with your hair down
Baby, you don't gotta fight, I'll be here 'til the end of time
Wishin' that you were mine, pull you in, it's alright

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

Honey, I don't want it to fade
There's things that I know could get in the way
I don't want to say goodbye
And I think that we could do it if we tried

I think we could do it if we tried
If only to say you're mine
Sofia, know that you and I
Shouldn't feel like a crime

I think we could do it (I think we could, I think we could do it, if, if, if)
If we tried (we could, we could, you're mine)
I think we could do it (Sofia, know that you, you, you and I)
If we tried (shouldn't feel like a crime)
Sofia, know that you and I (I think we could, I think we could do it, we could, we could)
Shouldn't feel like a crime (do it, do it, you're mine) (get in the way)
Sofia, know that you and I (Sofia, know that you, you, you and I shouldn't feel)
Oh, oh (like a crime) (do it if we tried)
