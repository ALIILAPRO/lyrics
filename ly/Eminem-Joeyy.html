		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just want to touch a ticket like a carny
'Gielas look like they was issued by the ARMY
I fell asleep mid sip and my cup went soggy
Full nights rest I still woke up groggy

Italian feet, organ transplant recipient
Glock beam turn a white man to an Indian
Big buffs look like I'm
Sleep but I'm vigilant
Think you sipping Tris but that
Cup is a predicament

Cinnamon GATs never stepping on the cracks
Walk into the Saks, menswear ransacked
Off a pill that makes a stressed man relax
I'm Eminem if the drank around I'll relapse
Everything is facts like a document
I take a oxy at the same time I take collagеn
I make the soda pop have Parkinson's
I takе a biotin at the
Same time I take Klonopin

I walk into Margiela and the
Clerk look like a pharmacist
They want to buy my soul but I
Don't care what the offer is
God got me he would get you
Too if you confess your sins
I know this pill real 'cus
My God is sovereign

Cinnamon GATs never stepping on the cracks
Walk into the Saks, menswear ransacked
Off a pill that makes a stressed man relax
I'm Eminem if the drank around I'll relapse
