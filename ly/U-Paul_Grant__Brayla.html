		  Bettin it all on u
Bettin it all on u
Bettin it all on u
Bettin it all on u

Why am I to hide who I was
Deep inside, your heart still trusts me
Been growing in it
Still toying with it, the idea of
Never being good enough
But I gotta trust U
I gotta move
I can't get above it
I'm gonna get thru
Don't let go of your confidence
Don't forget the part you play in their consciousness

I'm bettin it all on u
Bettin it all on u
Bettin it all on u
Bettin it all on u

Girl you deserve to receive the love you birth
cll the work could never be enough to show your worth
It's easy being good enough
But can I be the reason for not giving up on love
So I gotta trust U
I gotta move
I can't get above it
I'm gonna get thru
Don't let go of your confidence
Don't forget the part you play in their consciousness
