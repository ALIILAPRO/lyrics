		<p>
		  Take it back from the top

Everybody look at me, me (oh)
I walk in the door you start screaming (oh)
Come on everybody, what you here for? (Oh)
Move your body around like a nympho (oh)

Everybody get your neck to crack around (oh)
All you crazy people come on jump around (oh)
I wanna see you all on your knees knees (oh)
You either wanna be with me or be me
Come on now

man-eater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a man-eater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love

She's a man-eater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a man-eater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all

And when she walks she walks with passion (oh)
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it (oh)
When she asks for something, boy, she means it (oh)
Even if you never ever see it (oh)

Everybody get your neck to crack around (oh)
All you crazy people come on jump around (oh)
You doing anything to keep her by your side (oh)
Because she says she love you, love you long time (oh)
Come on now

man-eater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a man-eater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love

She's a man-eater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a man-eater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all (oh)

Ahh (oh)
Ahh (oh)
Ahh (oh)
Ahh (yeah), come on now

man-eater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love
She's a man-eater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love

She's a man-eater, make you work hard, make you spend hard
Make you want all of her love (oh, oh, oh)
She's a man-eater, make you buy cars, make you cut cards (oh, oh, oh)
Wish you never ever met her at all

No, never ever met her at all
(What you sayin', girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin', girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin', girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(Come on)

You wish you'd never ever met her at all
(What you sayin', girl?)
You wish you'd never ever met her at all
