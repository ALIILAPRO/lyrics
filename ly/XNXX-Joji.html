		  Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is going slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around a bit and get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't really wanna run around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Saying all the rhymes that make your world go
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round

'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round

Cupid pass another my way (my way)
Another night, a lot more days (more days)
Hard to think about you anymore ('bout you anymore)
But I keep you in my mind always (always)
Called me on the phone last night (last night)
Couldn't hear your voice I fight (I fight)
I won't be around you anymore (around you anymore)
In a dream where you feel alone

I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is going slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around a bit and didn't get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't really wanna run around
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
Saying all the rhymes that make your world go
'Round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round

I fuck around and you won't stay
Tellin' me that you're okay
Just better if you stay away
Better if you stay away
Stay away
Stay away, stay away
Alright
