		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Built this house with love
Inside out, no more talking down
I'm on solid ground
I raise my glass and make a toast to
Everything I've ever lost to
All the lines that I've crossed to
All the people I once loved
To me and you not working out
To everything I cried about
To the things I can't control
To the past I let it go
Cause all my mistakes
They make me who I am
Built this house with love
Inside out, no more talking down
I'm on solid ground
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
In love
I wave goodbye and said so long
I'm finally done with holding on to
Bitter feelings I've outgrown
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't care who's right or wrong
Cause all my mistakes
They make me who I am
Built this house with love, inside out
No more talking down
I'm on solid ground
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
In love
With myself
With myself
I'm falling in love with myself
With myself
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
In love
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
Falling wildly, madly, deeply
