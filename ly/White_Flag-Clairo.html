		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Piece it all
Back together again
Didn't get along
Been four years since
We had it all
And you were my friend
Those days got away
Hope you find solace in this

I was fifteen when
I first felt loneliness
Cut my hair
Only listened to Elvis

Grown apart and we're so far gone
But I'm waving the white flag
Sending my love back, move on

Laughing at me
You kick me when I'm down
Oh, how can you pretend
You didn't say that now?
Wish you the best
I know that you're stressed out
But you know in small towns
What goes around comes back around
