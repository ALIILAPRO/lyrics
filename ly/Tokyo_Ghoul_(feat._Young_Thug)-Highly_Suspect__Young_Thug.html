		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you love me
But I don't wanna be your slave
So many people judge me
But would they follow me to my grave?
You say that you love me, ay
But only if I stay the same
Baby, I'm leaving, ay
"Cause I don't wanna play these games

I got a lot on my mind
I got a lot on my plate
I got these people around me
Say that they love me, most of them fake
It feels like they want me to fail
It feels like they want me to die
It feels like they want all my money
But fuck 'em, they wasting their time
Like walk around the Riverbend with me
Let me tell you all the things I've seen
Seen a boy that's dying in front of me
And I'm the reason that he had to bleed
For what? So you could get on my grim
So you could pick me apart
Tell me how I should make art?
Nah you don't get this heart

You say that you love me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But I don't wanna be your slave
So many people judge me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But would they follow me to my grave?
You say that you love me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But only if I stay the same
Baby, I'm leaving (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
'Cause I don't wanna play these games

Ay yo, Slime!
No, I don't wanna play these games
No, I don't wanna play these games, no
This Slime language she won't learn my slang, whoa
If this really wasn't love, what it was?
You had me tricking off
And throwing in the club, yeah
I bought you black diamonds, baby
Now you fucked, yeah
And I'd rather have lust than love
Blind to the fact you're with Thug
You won't judge

But you say that you love me
But I don't wanna be your slave
So many people judge me
But would they follow me to my grave?
You say that you need me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
Based on yesterday
Baby, I'm leaving, ay (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But never gonna be a slave

This dirt boy, this dirt life
These are black boots
It's a black knife
This is born woods
This is raised wolf
This has moved hoods
This a change life
Never talked to my mother
I wish I heard from my father
I used to try , but why bother
Yeah, they can talk to my lawyer
This loose change about loose pills
These loose girls, they got true skills
They say you changed with the new brain
Well, the truth hurts, man love kills
I've been around, don't fuck around
You fuck around and get real killed
Got real friends, got real guns
I'm not a bad guy but it's real deal, whip!

You say that you love me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But I don't wanna be your slave
So many people judge me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But would they follow me to my grave?
You say that you love me (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
But only if I stay the same
Baby, I'm leaving (dirt boy, dirt life, dirt bike, whip!)
'Cause I don't wanna play these games

But you say that you love me
Many-many- judge me
I don't- I don't, play these games
No, I don't wanna play these games
'Cause I don't wanna play these games
No, I don't wanna play these games
I don't- I don't, play these games
