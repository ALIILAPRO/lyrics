		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I broke my leg falling for you
I question everything I do
How did you fall right into my arms?
Cos I thought I was dumb thought I had no charm

But they won't believe that
You

Love me I love you it's crazy
You've been stuck in my mind lately
I've never had someone like you in my life
You like Dayglow
And love scary movies
I wanna know why did you choose me?'
I've never had someone like you in my life

How did I get so lucky?
How did I get it right?
Everyone else told me that I'm just not your type
And is it true?
Am I with you?

But I didn't know that
You

Love me I love you It's crazy
You've been stuck in my mind lately
I've never had someone like you in my life
You like Dayglow
And love scary movies
I wanna know why did you chose me?
I've never had someone like you in my life

Love me I love you it's crazy
You've been stuck in my mind lately
I've never had someone like you in my life
You like Dayglow
And love scary movies
I wanna know why did you chose me?
I've never had someone like you in my life

Love me I love you it's crazy
You've been stuck in my mind lately
I've never had someone like you in my life
