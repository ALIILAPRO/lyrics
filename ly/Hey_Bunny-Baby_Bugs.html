		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey bunny
Please grab that knife right there
Take it to the playground and the fair
Hey bunny
Don't you wanna rip off your fingernails?
Let the maggots feast while you rot in jail

Hey bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey bunny
What if I lose you, too?
If we become one monster
Together we can always be blue

Hey bunny
What's with those evil eyes?
Blood shot and crying from pesticides
Hey bunny
Sorry to bother you
But I think if you're bunny
Then I'm bunny, too

Hey bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey bunny
What if I lose you, too?
If I become the monster
Together we can always be blue

Hey bunny
Is that your name?
Again it's making me laugh 'cause we used to be friends
Hey bunny
Am I talking in the mirror?
I only see myself as what we were

Hey bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey bunny
What if I lose you, too?
If we become the monster
Together we can always be blue

Hey bunny
What the hell is wrong with us?
I wanna scratch myself with infected rust
Hey bunny
What if I lose you, too?
If we become the monster
Together we can always be blue
