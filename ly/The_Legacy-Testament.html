		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're gonna take you back
Through the pages of the past
Just another lonely boy

I could laugh and play
And live in any other way
Then the devil took my soul

The fortune and the fame
I knew I was not the same
And I know I'd never return

Looking at the sky
I knew I would never die
And forever shining through

Wish the sky would say
That blue would turn to grey
And I know I'd be there

Like was like a fantasy
Taken by reality
Does anyone remember me
You once knew me

Flashes of the day
I knew I was here to stay
But no one stays the same

Turn the pages back in time
Through the chapters in my mind
Life's too short to leave behind
It's too late

Like was like a fantasy
Taken by reality
Does anyone remember me
You once knew me

Flashes of the day
I knew I was here to stay
But no one
Knows my name
