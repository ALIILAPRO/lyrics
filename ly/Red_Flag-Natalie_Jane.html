		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't sleep you're in my head
I can't sleep after your DM
And it haunts me, drives me mad
White lies, they suit your tongue
Just like a perfect tux
And it wants me, taunts me bad
Bang bang
My heart goes down
Danger
Do you hear that sound
It's coming real close, feel in my bones
Wave wave the red flag now
I get a little rush
Just from your simple touch
And it's hardly irresistible
Green eyed addiction
Your my bowl of fun
That I can't leave, it's so criminal
Bang bang
My heart goes down
Danger
Do you hear that sound
It's coming real close, feel in my bones
Wave wave the red flag
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Danger
Gotta get out now
It's coming real close, feel it in my bones
Wave wave the red flag
Bang Bang, Danger
Bang Bang, Danger
Bang Bang, Danger
Bang Bang, Danger
It's coming real close, feel in my bones
Wave wave the red flag now
I can't sleep you're in my head
I can't sleep after your DM
And it haunts me, drives me mad
