		<p>
		  Yeah, uh huh
Nigga I got the Black Card finna swipe that shit

This that higher level stunting, make it rain a lot of hundreds
Gave that chick 30k to go get rid of her stomach
I'm a triple OG nigga 20 years and running
All my niggas down to ride like crash test dummies
And J don't stand in line, I ain't never never had to wait
I'm the realest in this game, I ain't never had to fake
Forgiatos on the classic like that bitch got on some skates
Having dinner with Obama smelling like a pound of hay
I might blow a pound a day, smoking KK like a hippie
In the 60's with this chick, tryna give my dick a hickey
Had to get it out the mud, no wonder why I'm filthy rich
And I'm running through this money like it don't mean nothing to me, I might

Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a bag for bad bitch like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes, mane it ain't nothing
When you getting money, and smashing, she just say nothing

Pull up in a lowrider two hoes behind us
Police say that they can smell it but I make sure they don't find it
Hit the corner, slide the ash, Young Khalifa 'bout his cash
Bout to build another whip and I ain't even got to brag
Three women got that bitch leanin'
Young Khalifa got the women screamin'
Done deal, done deal when I pull up
It's a done deal, lift the trunk, still rolling up
And I got one in the front, two in the back
Do what I want, don't need to relax
King of my city, I'm liftin' I'm showin', three wheelin' in traffic
This '61 I'm building 'bout to be a classic
I'm repping Taylor Gang, they asking, paper or plastic?

Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a bag for bad bitch like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes, mane it ain't nothing
When you getting money, and smashing, she just say nothing

Getting paid like ghost do
In the street, in the club too
Designer everything, Ric Flair
I can buy the rap game, brick fair
Buy the bar, smoke that caviar, I'm in the finest car
Push to start, I glow in the dark, I run up the charts
Redbone, vanilla, freaky broad, she gon' keep me hard
Black card, better play it smart, nigga we in charge
Get paid, young nigga get paid
And I run the game like a fucking arcade
If we talking money then I got a raise
Drink so strong, they think I got it laced

Buy the highest bottle like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll buy 20 bottles worth of clothes like it ain't nothing
Drop a hundred thou' like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a brand new car like it ain't nothing
Buy a new crib like it ain't nothing
Bitch I'll go and buy a bag for bad bitch like it ain't nothing
Pull a hundred hoes, mane it ain't nothing
When you getting money, and smashing, she just say nothing
