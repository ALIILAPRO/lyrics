		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was stood by the light as I looked through the window
With the greatest intention not meaning to see
I was there in the dark and I saw you together
You were up in his arms , I was down on my knees
Get the cards on the table
No need to pretend
You've got to be cruel to be kind
He can sell you his love and you know yo will pay 'cause

He's a liar
He's a liar and I should know liar
He's a liar and I should know - ahhh

Well, they told me I fell but I just don't remember
I was standing face down, they were there at my feet
There was smoke in the air and sweet smell of leather
I was through the window and down in the street
Well, I'm cold and I'm hungry but I'm still alive
And it's not how I want it to be
There's a hand on my shoulder
He said I'll survive ,but-

He's a liar
He's a liar, and I should know liar
He's a liar,and I should know-ahhh

Release
Was it not for the man that was blocking the drive
Was it not for the red limousine
I'd be millions of miles from th scene of the crime
And somehow in this madness believe she was mine -but

I'm a liar
He's a liar
And I should know liar
He's a liar
And I should know-ahhh
He's a (repeat and fade)
