		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day number one
Home star out of sight
Still haggard from the fight
With the galactic tides
Loved ones left behind
Vanished with the light

Day number five
I’m starting to get a grasp
Nothing in my way
Yet everything awaits
For me and billions of them on a quest

We’re all the same
Lost and alone
Here comes the night
Carry me home
And if it’s too late for saving our souls
Rather fail together
Than win on my own
Rather fail together
Than survive alone

Year number one
Now bound to their kind
So frail, just passing by
Oblivious to the signs
If I can change their mind
Then maybe hope still lies

Make them see new colors
Bathe in a new sunrise
Am I their new leader?
Am I just lost in time?
I’ve seen a billion suns collapse and die
And I can’t let it happen to this one

We’re all the same
Lost and alone
Here comes the night
Carry me home
And if it’s too late for saving our souls
Rather fail together
Than triumph alone

I won’t save myself unless I save them first
Rewind the fate, heal the burn
I’ll fold the plane, and erase the whole world
To start again
I’ll make them see some new colors

Rather fail together
Than triumph alone

We’re all the same
Lost and alone
Here comes the night
Carry me home
And if it’s too late for saving our souls
Rather fail together
Than triumph alone

Day number one
