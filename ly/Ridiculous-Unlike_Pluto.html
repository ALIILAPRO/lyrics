		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Torpedo me to the bottom
Everyone has their agenda
Life gets crazy when things get heated
But is it what I needed? Oh

I don't wanna talk about your past dim light
I don't wanna cut your ties like you're outta sight, oh no

My life is ridiculous
Oh, no no hatred
Oh, no no chasing you
Ridiculous
Oh, no no hatred
Oh, no no chasing you

I know I'm ridiculous
Tonight, tonight, tonight
I know I'm ridiculous
Tonight, tonight
I know I'm ridiculous

Slingshot lies so they shoot back
There's a thin line with no take-backs
Erase that, you remake that
Vengeance served cold with an appetite
Some things never change when they seem alright
Symbolism in the pain and starlight
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

With vengeance torpedo me down to the bottom
It's a cycle with a never-ending problem
Life gets crazy when things get heated
Everything changes when you need it

I don't wanna talk about your past dim light
I don't wanna cut ties like you're outta sight, oh no

My life is ridiculous
Oh, no no hatred
Oh, no no chasing you
Ridiculous
Oh, no no hatred
Oh, no no chasing you
Oh no, my life is

Ridiculous
Tonight, tonight
I know I'm ridiculous
Tonight, tonight
I know I'm ridiculous
