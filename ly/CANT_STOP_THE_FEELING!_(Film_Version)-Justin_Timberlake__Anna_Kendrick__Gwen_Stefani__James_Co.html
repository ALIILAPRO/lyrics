		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
And if you want it
Inside your soul
Just open up your heart, let music take control

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop (stop)

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close (can't stop, won't stop)
When we move, well, you already know (let's go, let's work)
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feel a good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on (rushing on)
I don't need no reason, don't need control (need control)
I fly so high, no ceiling when I'm in my zone

'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop

And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feel a good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
I can't stop the feeling (woo)
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling (yeah)
So keep dancing, come on

Oh
Yeah, yeah

I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance 
(I can't stop the feeling)
Feel the good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance (I can't stop the feeling) (oh)
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance (I can't stop the feeling) (dance, dance, dance)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing (I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body (I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body, come on (oh, no) (I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body (I can't stop the feeling) (no, no, no)
Got this feeling in my body, come on
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
Uh, can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come on (ooh)
