		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing

All the time
My baby, you're on my mind
And I don't know why
Yeah, but the feeling is fine
Can't you see
Yeah, honey you are for me, oh
We were meant to be
Dancing in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing

Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole

Every time when I look in your eyes
I smile with pride, happy that you're mine
Joy in love, your love is true I know
You are the best thing that has happened to me, oh

Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing

Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole

Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing (oh)

Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing (oh)

Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole

Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
