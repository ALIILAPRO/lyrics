		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Break a leg," what they told me
I'm just riding with my OG
Did a deal with Adobe
Gold ring around the rosey
Roll the window down slowly (Yeah)
Let 'em know that he owe me (Yes)
They call me the one and only (One)
Hard times just mold me
Comme des Gar√ßons cozy
North Philly with a hoagie
Treat the fans like homies
Give a tip, Ton Mozeby
Keep it clean like soapy
Turtleneck tried to choke me
Too sharp, can't poke me
I'm with Zack like Cody
Feet white like Jody
Teeth white like Joey
Ever since we lost Kobe
I been ballin' on my lonely
Horse power, that's a pony
Do it big, Mick Foley
Phone dead if you phoney
My phone dead, you can't phone me

They all upset (mmm)
'Cause I'm a threat (mmm)
You wanna bet? (mmm)
Coming up next (mmm)
I work so hard (mmm)
Blood, tear and sweat (mmm)
I work so hard (mmm)
Blood, tear and sweat (mmm)

Won't even play on the playground
So if you don't know me, don't play 'round
To me, you're like edges, so lay down
I made a move on the Greyhound
Back when Symere was with Steaktown
I gained some weight, it's like eight pounds
Big Whack, I'm gettin' the cake now
Big Whack, I like when my cake pound
Roadside assistance for breakdown
I can die on any day now
You can die on any day now
We can die on any day now
Don't take it for granted
My bucket has landed
I like when you panic
I'm not so romantic
My food is organic
I move just like Michael
I'm lookin' like Janet
You know I'm upset

They all upset (mmm)
'Cause I'm a threat (mmm)
You wanna bet? (mmm)
Coming up next (mmm)
I work so hard (mmm)
Blood, tear and sweat (mmm)
I work so hard (mmm)
Blood, tear and sweat (mmm)
They all upset (mmm)
'Cause I'm a threat (mmm)
You wanna bet? (mmm)
Coming up next (mmm)
I work so hard (mmm)
Blood, tear and sweat (mmm)
I work so hard (mmm)
Blood, tear and sweat (mmm)
