		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh your sweet little lies
Oh your sweet little lies
I can hear when I hold you close to me
When I look in your eyes
I see through your disguise
What I see is an only lonely void
And I can see hell in your eyes

'Cause you're drowning inside
Those fake tears that you cried
As I claw my way from your tragedy
Emptiness is your bride
Arrogance is your pride
I won't drown in another's misery
And you won't pull me down to die

No!
Stuck in this prison with a brother I loved
Stuck in this prison with the memories of...
Another time, when music's all that we had
Bonded by anger and addictions, so glad
Always together but no words are spoken
This is the sound of a friendship broken
Trapped and climbing up the walls
How the fuck do I get out of these pitfalls?

And you say that life is just a game and
Everyone who plays is just a pawn
And shame on me it went so long
How could I've been so wrong?
I've forever gone, colder
If life is just a game then
Game over

Dreaming of choking someone I used to know
Strangling the negativity that they sow
Resent has now become the face in the mask
That plays upon a bitter two-man cast
Go find somebody else to blame your problems
Trying to fuck me, because you can't solve them
Stop! You never gave a shit
We almost fucking quit, because how much you hated it

And you say that life is just a game and
Everyone who plays is just a pawn
And shame on me it went so long
How could I've been so wrong?
I've forever gone, colder
If life is just a game then
Game over

For as long as you're alive
I'll curse your worthless name

On the day
On the day of your demise
Unburied and left for the flies
Believe me that I will piss upon your grave
Forgiveness may greet me on someday
But I'll never forget all this pain
Let there be no mistake
This is not a game!

Oh your sweet little lies
Oh your sweet little lies
I can hear when I hold you close to me
When I look in your eyes
I see through your disguise
What I see is an only lonely void

'Cause you're drowning inside
Those fake tears that you cried
As I claw my way from your tragedy
Emptiness is your bride
Arrogance is your pride
I won't drown in another's misery
Forever this friendship has died

No!
And you say that life is just a game and
Everyone who plays is just a pawn
And shame on me it went so long
How could I've been so wrong?
I've forever gone, colder
If life is just a game then
Game over
Game over
(Game over)
