		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm for the law and order the way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws in some old magazine
New York sent a posse down like I ain't ever seen

Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man?
Maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand, out of hand

We were wrapped up in our music that's why we never saw
Cars pull up, the boys get out and the room fills up with law
They came boundin' through the backdoor in the middle of a song
They got me for possession of something that was gone, long gone

Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand?
What started out to be a joke the law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose that got me busted by the man? Oh Lord
Maybe this here outlaw bit's done got out of hand
Don't you think this outlaw bit's done got out of hand, out of hand?
