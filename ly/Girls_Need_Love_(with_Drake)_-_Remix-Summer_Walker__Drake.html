		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Honestly

Honestly, I'm tryna stay focused
You must think I've got to be joking when I say
I don't think I can wait
I just need it now, better swing my way
I just need some dick
I just need some love
Tired of fucking with these lame niggas
Baby, I just need a thug
Won't you be my plug? Ayy
You could be the one, ayy
We could start with a handshake, baby
I'ma need more than a hug

Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now
Girls can't never say they want it
Girls can't never say how
Girls can't never say they need it
Girls can't never say now, oh now

Give it to me like you need it, baby
Want you to hear me screaming, heavy breathing
I don't need a reason, baby
I want it 'til you can't fight
I can give it to you right, babe, oh
I wanna be your healing
I can be real good
Please don't get in your feelings
Ayy, I need some love
Ayy, I need some love
Ayy, I need some love
Ayy, and you can't judge (I won't)

You don't really call on me like you should
Link up, I'll roll through the hood
Problems, but everything's all good, my love
Your nigga doesn't want smoke with me, nah, no way
Trust me, it's all okay, trust me, it's all
You just need some, someone that's calm and patient
Submission, domination
Arched back, deep stroke, white wine, weed smoke
That's my best combination
You just need some dick with no complications
You just need some, you just need some
Late night attention, uncondition
All that you're missing, my babe
Fucked up, shouldn't even have to justify
I get it, I'm on your side
Guys get their way all the time
Besides, pleasure not meant for one side
You should just do what's best for your mind
How 'bout I just take my time?
You call up my line
I fall up inside you
Girls need love, too, I know

Girls need love, too (yeah)
Girls, girls need love, too 
Girls need love (let me tell you something)
Girls need love (girls need loving, too)
Girls need love, too (yeah, yeah)
Girls need love, too
(So what's a girl to do when she needs loving, too?)
Girls, girls need love, too
