		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear you
I didn't know what I would do
When it came down to tears
I swallowed my fears it's what gentleman do
Dear you
Remember when you said you loved me
I believed you and that was the worst part, who knew you were bluffing

You left cause you know that I'd never let you
The only thing you left behind was your perfume
I kept all the letters you wrote in my bedroom
And I still hold on cause I know I'd forget you
You loved me too hard and that made me nervous
I pushed you away cause I thought it would hurt less
I kept all the letters you wrote in my bedroom
And I still hold on cause I know I'd forget you

Dear me
I've been crying myself to sleep
I try to forget how this feels
But I keep playing us on repeat
Dear me
Remember when I thought I was lucky
Cause I found a guy he's a tall Gemini just trust me

I left cause I felt like we were in danger
You made me feel like I was loving a stranger
I left a few letters I wrote in your bedroom
And I'll be okay cause I know I'll forget you
I never expected you to be perfect
But you wanted space and it just wasn't worth it
I left a few letters I wrote in your bedroom
And I'll be okay cause I know I'll forget you

So I'll swallow my pride and
Let it all go cause
You weren't there when I
Needed you most I
Know this won't hurt
Like this, forever

I left cause I thought that you didn't want me
Two years and eight months, I guess they meant nothing
I copied the letters I wrote in your bedroom
And I still hold on cause I know I'd forget you

It's easy to give into all of your vices
It's harder to admit when you're in a crisis
I kept all the letters you wrote in my bedroom
But I still hold on cause I know I'd forget you

I kept a few letters you wrote in my bedroom
And I still hold on cause I know I'd forget you
