		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		   Twenty-five years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
For a destination

And I realized quickly when I knew I should
That the world was made up of
This brotherhood of man
For whatever that means

** And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head
And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath and I get real high
And I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on?
And I say, hey hey hey hey
I said hey, what's going on?

Ooh, ooh ooh
And I try, oh my god do I try
I try all the time, in this institution
And I pray, oh my god do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution.

** repeat
*repeat
