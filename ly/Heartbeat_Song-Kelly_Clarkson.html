		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long 
All night long

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I'da known where I'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
Oh I could do this for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long

Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time, one more time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turn it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on
But I know you can take it up, up, up, up all night long
Oh up, up all night long
