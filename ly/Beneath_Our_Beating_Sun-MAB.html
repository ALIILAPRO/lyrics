		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something about the waves that crash inside your eyes
Like sunny days not far away
I'll try and change the way the past looks on my mind
Ya know these tears won't go to waste

And what do you do
With all this love
And how can I prove
You're all I want
I'll take it from you
And come undone
And we'll break this band beneath our beating sun

The sun in your face like gold
With the shades of all your truth
I love you more each time I try
(Yeah)
I'm not gonna waste this hope
And the pain that I've been through
With all of these questions of my life

And what do ya do
With all this love
And how can I prove
You're all I want
I'll take it from you
And come undone
And we'll break this band beneath our beating sun

I'll take it from you
And come undone
And we'll break this band beneath our beating sun
