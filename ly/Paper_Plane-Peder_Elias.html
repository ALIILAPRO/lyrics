		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you

Don't know how but feels like the dream
(Am I delusional?)
Lost the ability to speak
(It's so unusual)
Ever since the day in the park when we talked
I've kept on thinking about what we could be

Dream about a late night, red sky
Your hand in mine, oh-oh
Don't know if you think about me
Think, think about

I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you
Right now I'm too shy to say
What I have felt for days
It's easier this way
I hope it gets to you

Damn it feels like I'm back in school
(A million butterflies)
Why can't I just walk up to you?
(It's like I'm paralyzed)
'Cause I've been staying up late every night, thinking 'bout it
Is it just me or do you feel it, too?

Dream about a late night, red sky
Your hand in mine, oh-oh
Don't know if you think about me
Think, think about

I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you
Right now, I'm too shy to say
What I have felt for days
It's easier this way

You got me stuck in a day dream
I don't wanna wake up
'Cause it feels amazing and I can't get enough
Yeah, sometimes I wonder, am I stupid or not?
But I hope, I hope it gets to you

I'ma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
That it don't crash and break
Before it gets to you
