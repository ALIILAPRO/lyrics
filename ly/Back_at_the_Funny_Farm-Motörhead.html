		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hammer pounding in my heart, I think it's gonna burst
Spring unwinding in my head, I don't know which is worse
I hear you talking but the words are kinda strange
One of us is crazy and the other one's insane

Stay calm, don't be alarmed, it's just a holiday
Back at the funny farm

Nothing in this cold white room to help me recognize
I don't understand why everyone is in disguise
I gotta leave right now, I can't stay here no more
But I'm afraid to try in case they lock the door

Can't find no windows but I gotta get outside
Can you help me stand it feels like both my legs have died
What was that injection 'cos I think it's going wrong
I really like this jacket but the sleeves are much too long
