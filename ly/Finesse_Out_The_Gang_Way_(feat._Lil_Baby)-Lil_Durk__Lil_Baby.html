		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Dj on the beat so it's a banger)

I came from nothin', I had to go get it
I had to finesse out the gang way (gang way)
I done did everything for the niggas that I love
Who stuck in the chain gang (chain gang)
Shit be so weird
I'm steady watchin' all the niggas who yellin' out, "Gang, gang" (gang, gang)
Shit be so different
I'm watchin' the niggas who bitches but yellin' out, "Bang, bang" (bang, bang)
Roll up a blunt of that Pluto
Used to be deep now I'm riding 'round uno
I know some niggas who hustlin' but quit 'cause they was doin' this shit for too long
I remember niggas feelin' like brothers but now this shit feel like a group home
And I had told 'em I love 'em so much, to me it felt you can't do wrong
I was trappin' out inside of my granny crib, I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewelers "Don't know what a Patek is"
Now it's two-tone

Money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought I'd win? (Win, oh)

Asked 'em why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30, like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas bein' goofy
Spending their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail ridin' around with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' one hunnids
Gucci bag, duffels, fifty, one hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call a dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?
Niggas die when they pop up in my mentions
Had the realest nigga tell you're a peasant
Took a Perc' and it got me in my feelings (got me in my feelings)

The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought I'd win? (Win, oh)
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought I'd win? (Win, oh)

Man, I've been trappin' since 2007
My mama was strugglin', I had to help
From juvenile to the penitentiary, I'm better
I'm happy I can say I got it together
Fifty-three percent of these niggas feminine
I am not a gangster, I am a gentleman
We the ones that handle murders like businessmen
Postin' money on the 'Gram, I invented that
I done came a long way from the middleman
I got head for an hour in the Cullinan
I done gave a thousand bows to my brother them
Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up
I put a kit on the Urus, it's bigger now
Told my baby mama we need a bigger house
I'm too real for this shit, I done figure out
Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
She be lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out
I ran it up to a load from a ounce
I'm rockin' clothes I can't even pronounce
Fuck the pandemic, I love me a drought
I ran it up in this motherfucker
Three hunnid shots, that's enough in this motherfucker
Only The Family, it's us in this motherfucker, gang shit

The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought I'd win? (Win, oh)
The money make the world spin (spin, oh)
The money make the girls grin (grin, oh)
Been rappin' since 2010 (ten, oh)
Who ever thought I'd win? (Win, oh)
