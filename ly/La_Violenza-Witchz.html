		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t know what’s wrong behind these eyes
I said it’s crazy on these drugs 
But I can’t get enough 
Cus I love the vibe the highs got me 
Feeling like I’m hanging on a rope and 
God can’t help me no 

Pop a pill and 
Hit the ceiling 
Cop the feeling
Need the healing
This is real and 
Got the feeling
Im the villain 
Sick of dealin said
Pop a pill and 
Hit the ceiling 
Cop the feeling
Need the healing
This is real and 
Got the feeling
Im the villain 
But I’m chillin said

Why do we love the violence
Born with fire in our eyes
Need some silence in our minds
Why do we love the violence
Got a tyrant in our mind
Killing all whats left of light

Why you looking at me fucked up what you see
Its the feelings in cant feel that gets to me
You know deep down I need you to set me free
Cuz baby you know I cannot take this let me

Pop a pill and 
Hit the ceiling 
Cop the feeling
Need the healing
This is real and 
Got the feeling
Im the villain 
Sick of dealin said
Pop a pill and 
Hit the ceiling 
Cop the feeling
Need the healing
This is real and 
Got the feeling
Im the villain 
But I’m chillin said

Why do we love the violence
Born with fire in our eyes
Need some silence in our minds
Why do we love the violence
Got a tyrant in our mind
Killing all whats left of light

Pop a pill and 
Hit the ceiling 
Cop the feeling
Need the healing
This is real and 
Got the feeling
Im the villain 
Sick of dealin said
Pop a pill and 
Hit the ceiling 
Cop the feeling
Need the healing
This is real and 
Got the feeling
Im the villain 

Why do we love the violence
Born with fire in our eyes
Need some silence in our minds
Why do we love the violence
Got a tyrant in our mind
Killing all whats left of light
