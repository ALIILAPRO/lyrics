		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wow, I feel good, I knew that I would now
I feel good, I knew that I would now
I feel good, I knew that I would now
So good, so good, so good, so good, so good
Said I got you

Wow, I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, baby, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, so nice, so nice, so nice
Said I got you

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm

And I feel nice, like sugar and spice (sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar and spice)
I feel, feel, feel nice (I feel nice, yeah)
Like sugar and spice (ay)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (sing)

When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm

And I feel nice, like sugar, sugar and spice
I feel good, feel, feel, feel, feel good
I feel good
I'm looking good, damn, I'm looking good
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel good

Jessie J

You better sing with me, let's go again
Oh, oh, oh
