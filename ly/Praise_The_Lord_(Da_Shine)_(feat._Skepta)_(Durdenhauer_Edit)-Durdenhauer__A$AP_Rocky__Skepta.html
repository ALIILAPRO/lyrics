		  Get it
Get it

Glowin', chart-climbin' on 'em
You think I'm jumpin' out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Times I even stop the smokin' when it's time to focus
My shades Dior, my pants velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Get it

dogs, the games a trap, protect your heart (yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Get it
