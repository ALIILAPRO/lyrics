		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine life
Imagine life without me, it's a waste of time
You want the kind of love that can make a child
Don't want just anybody (not just anybody, not just anybody) 
Ooh

Good love fills my body up like a glass
When you pour it all out
If you know me, you know I mind
Someone like me is hard to find
Not mistaken if I'm there
Well aware you are always mine
And still you seem so surprised
Always gon' be mine

I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it
And I wanna be where you are
I just can't walk away
You drive me crazy, ah
I lose it, lose it

Imagine me
Circlin' through life without a piece of you
Seven out of seven days I'm needin' you
You brin' life to the party
Good love feels like butterflies suffocatin' your insides
Oh, it's a late night, you know I try
I cannot picture when you ride
I'm mistaken thinkin' you were taken
Knownin' now, you were always mine
And still I feel so surprised
You're always gon' be mine

Rarely ever missin', talk is cheap and time is tickin'
Rarely ever trickin', catch me slippin', I put you on leakin'
I'm on mission, payin' millions, I'm Ted DiBiase (God)
Out late night, I'm sinnin', still a Christian, don't tell my Deacon
I mean pastor, oil her down, not talkin' castor
Ridin' 'round with six-seven bitches with no tint, you can see I'm pimpin'
Big four-five on my hip, look like I'm limpin', never simpin'
One of my cousins Crippin', always grippin', shit get dangerous
Always keep it player, we can swap out hoes, I'm never trippin'
Only love my mother, my sister, my daughter
All these hoes get slaughtered 
They can't be mine, pray to the holy father
