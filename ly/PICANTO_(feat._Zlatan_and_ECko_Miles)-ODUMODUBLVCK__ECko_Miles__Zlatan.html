		  (Jimohsoundz killed this)
Blvcksheep for life, Blvcksheep forever
Izgaaju 'til we kpeme, Antiworldgangstars
Ge records, Odumodublvck, you get me
Fizo in the building, praa
(Bile)

They know I came in a Picanto (apachumarimaichupako)
Dey my doormot
Kosi gateman
You go contact o (gi' dem)
They know I came in a Picanto
Hundred men dey your doormot
Kosi gateman
You go contact o

Wey wey, wey dem
Fall out, who goes
Check out, nack am
Dull am, jam am
March am, wey dem
Fall out, who goes
Check out, nack am
Dull am, jam am, march am
We squeeze, we march
They tench o
We dey observe
Dey go discharge
We dey cantab

Wetin I go do for you (ayo)
Tesh, gimme cloth, make I denge pose
Before we go march, I go sip agbo
Fizo dey my back e dey mole igbo
Shayo dey the room
Desperado na why we mezebu
The banger wey been
Scatter settings for my city
Coti been dey find am all along (long)
Today we go pump am
Load dem, shank am
E no go fit to breath
The banger wey been
Scatter settings for my city
Coti been dey find am all along (how many? How many?)
Today we go pump am, load dem, shank am

They know I came in a Picanto
Dey my doormot
Kosi gateman
You go contact o (hundred men)
They know I came in a Picanto
Hundred men dey your doormot
Kosi gateman (Bile)
You go contact o (aye)

I say
Bottega wey dey my face, no dey see enemies (see)
That plenty money must be made by any means (yes)
Abi your papa no go like denge po
Inside rolls royce with two bad bitches from Miami
Ebelebe na who come correct dey get padi
Number wey your sister dey call sugar daddy
Odumodu na who we see korokoro, when we dey soak garri
Such a guy, we must gather garri, you go fear
When you see cartel, when we started
Dem look us less, child of the man
Now everything bless
Now popo stop me say e sabi person
Money and fame don dey my eye, since like thirteen
Booyaka booyakam, when we enter, when we scatter
Stab anybody with my cloak and dagger
Ta gba gbori wole omo ase oma japa
Make nothing join me, join me with sapa

They know I came in a Picanto
Hundred men dey your doormot
Kosi gateman
You go contact o

Abobi roll the kpoli make I kprass (yeah)
I no get time to partake, na hin make I ask
Na the rabba dey my mind, I no need to cast
I don grind, I don find, I no to dey cap
E be like say, the thing don cast
E be like say, your kele don kprass
She go jogodo (jogodo)
Drop better high she go follow go, ay
Secure the bag and gbese, hey
Throway for nyash and face, bullet
Today na crate by crate, we go soft and
Kele dey crash my place
I go fuck now, I go pluck down

Ego necessary
Owo necessary
