		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always harder than I think it is
Sad face when you blow a kiss
How do I exist
I don't know how long I can take this
Time crisis
Bet blue and red we'll make it
It's irrelevant
If I tell you or keep you guessing
So pull yourself back together
Don't let the weight of the world
Come crashing down
So pull yourself back together
Together Together
Always harder than I think it is
Always hard
Not much of a pessimist
I lie I like it
Real quiet
Sun out have fun deny it
I'm real shy
You caught me in the middle of a fight
With myself, I'm right
What's wrong? I'm fine
So pull yourself back together
Don't let the weight of the world
Come crashing down
So pull yourself back together
Together Together
Always harder than I think it is
Always
Always
Always
How long can I take this?
It's irrelevant
