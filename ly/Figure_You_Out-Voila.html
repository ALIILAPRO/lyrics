		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I heard he got you a penthouse
On the westside when will he learn
That you're afraid of heights?
I heard he got you a new Benz
With the white wheels when will he learn
That you like to tandem bike?

Mm mmh and I hate that

I could love you with my eyes closed
Kiss you with a blindfold
Figure you out (mm mmh)
I might hold you with my hands tied
Show you I'm the right guy
To figure you out nah nah nah nah nah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I heard he got you some new friends
With some big dreams when will he learn
That you already got your own? (mm mmh)
Oh, I heard he got you the front row
At the rap show when will he learn
That you like The Rolling Stones?

And I've been thinking
Of all the little things
That you've been missing
When will you learn?

I could love you with my eyes closed
Kiss you with a blindfold
Figure you out (mm mmh)
I might hold you with my hands tied
Show you I'm the right guy
To figure you out nah nah nah nah nah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I could love you with my eyes closed
Kiss you with a blindfold
Figure you out yeah (mm mmh)
I might hold you with my hands tied
Show you I'm the right guy
To figure you out nah nah nah nah nah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I could treat you so much better
I've known you forever figured you out
Oooh ooh ooh

I could love you with my eyes closed
Kiss you with a blindfold
Figure you out (mm mmh)
I might hold you with my hands tied
Show you I'm the right guy
To figure you out nah nah nah nah nah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

I could love you with my eyes closed
Kiss you with a blindfold, yeah
Figure you out (Figure you out, yeah)
I might hold you with my hands tied
Show you I'm the right guy
To figure you out nah nah nah nah nah

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
