		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can hear you say it's a life song
Just to prevent to let you know
I must admit that you're not wrong
I'm not all in it for the show

The stage is like a drug, mostly on the run
I came for you tonight
So we'll have some fun
I'm sorry for the price but it's how we're run
I swing for the show with a hundred songs

We are here to hear you sing (Nananananananana)
We are here to come and bring (Nananananananana)
Anyone to jump in here (Nananananananana)
I'm not sure what I hear (Nananananananana)

The stage is like a drug, mostly on the run
I came for you tonight
So we'll have some fun
I'm sorry for the price but it's how we're run
I swing for the show with a hundred songs

We are here to hear you sing (Nananananananana)
We are here to come and bring (Nananananananana)
Anyone to jump in here (Nananananananana)
I'm not sure what I hear (Nananananananana)

I see someone's not dancing
Grab him bring him along
Anyone here to help
He is alone and should be sad

The stage is like a drug, mostly on the run
I came for you tonight
So we'll have some fun
I'm sorry for the price but it's how we're run
I swing for the show with a hundred songs

We are here to hear you sing (Nananananananana)
We are here to come and bring (Nananananananana)
Anyone to jump in here (Nananananananana)
I'm not sure what I hear (Nananananananana)

We are here to hear you sing (Nananananananana)
We are here to come and bring (Nananananananana)
Anyone to jump in here (Nananananananana)
I'm not sure what I hear (Nananananananana)
