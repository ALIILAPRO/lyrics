		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you're in love with me
I'm feeling the way you're looking at me
we’re spending hours on the phone
these talks just spin my head around

Our friends know nothing about (the rumor)
we spending hours on our own

Don't need no witness
If you gonna let me in or not
Nobody's business
if we gonna make it real or not

We’ve got our own shining star to guide us
all of them shaders got no skin in our lives

no one should feel shame to feel love for someone
no one should feel shame to be loved by someone
no one should feel shame to feel love for someone
no one should feel shame to be loved by someone

I say we‘re on
I say we‘re on
I say we're on


Let me break it down (Amaya)
They wanna take us down
So bad, so bad
I would never ever
Do you wrong
Dont let them take us down, down

I know you see what’s going on in my eyes
I know you know im not the beast in disguise

You’re about to let me in
here we are
at the door
let’s take this dive.
come on

Pa pa pa la pa
Spreading the love
