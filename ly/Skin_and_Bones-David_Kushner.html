		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fantasize to feel you like a bullet
And all your layers to the fullest
But the heavens won't condone it, mm
You deceivin', wayward woman
You're a false prophet at the pulpit
The condition of your soul is erodin'

Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control

As your flatter talk shivers down my spine
I hear the Holy One exposin' all the lies
Lord, forgive me, I know my flesh needs to die
She has the lips red as cherry wine
A poisonous kiss, she's part of the swine
My salvation won't be sacrificed

Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control

But I don't wanna stop, yeah, I just need to see
If your love's the truth or the spirit of deceit
No, I don't wanna talk, baby, give it all to me
There's honey drippin' from your teeth

Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control

(Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical)
But I don't wanna stop, yeah, I just need to see
(Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close)
If your love's the truth or the spirit of deceit
(Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical)
No, I don't wanna talk, baby, give it all to me
(Oh, I'm gonna lose control)
There's honey drippin' from your teeth
