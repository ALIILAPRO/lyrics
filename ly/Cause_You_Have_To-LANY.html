		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chasing a heart is like chasing a ghost
You can't make somebody you love feel the same
If they don't
It doesn't matter the words that you say
'Cause just like the seasons, you can't stop the way
People change

I'd drive through the night
Walk a thousand miles
To feel your head on my chest
I'd give anything
That's what's killing me
'Cause you won't even reach across the bed

The silence is getting too cold
We stopped fighting
'Cause deep down inside, we both know
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?

All of your friends now were all of mine first
Your mom and your dad they were both there for me 
When mine weren't
I can't see tomorrow without you today
But I'd rather let you go 
Than make you feel like you've gotta stay

I'd drive through the night
Walk a thousand miles
To feel your head on my chest
I'd give anything
That's what's killing me
'Cause you won't even reach across the bed

The silence is getting too cold
We stopped fighting
'Cause deep down inside, we both know
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?

So come on, don't be afraid to break my heart
It only gets worse if you wait
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?

I'm so sorry, I wish I could be
The one to love you more
I hope you find somebody
Who's got everything you're searching for

The silence is getting too cold
We stopped fighting
'Cause deep down inside, we both know
Just for once, what do you want? Baby, tell me the truth
Do you only love me 'cause you have to?
