		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They call you a harlot
They call you a whore and I don't mind it
I don't care what you've done
I don't care who you've done

We've all been used before
Nobody's clean
We've all been used before

You don't need a miracle
This is a miracle
You're driving, but you're lost
You don't know what you want

We've all been used before
Nobody's clean
We've all been used before

You don't need a miracle
You are a miracle
You're driving, but you're lost
You don't know what you want

We've all been used before
Nobody's clean
We've all been used before
