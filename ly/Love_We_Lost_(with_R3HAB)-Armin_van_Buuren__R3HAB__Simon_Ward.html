		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I know that you've been hurting
I know I did you wrong
And I've been drownin' in the whiskey
Every night since you've been gone

And I know that I've been trouble
But you've been on my mind
And I'm just pickin' up the pieces
Tryin' to walk on that straight line

I'd walk a thousand miles out through the wild
To get back inside your heart
Just tryin' to light your fire at any cost
And darlin', I'll be standing by you when the sky gets dark
Oh I, I will find all that love we lost
All that love we lost
All that love we lost
All that love we lost

Oh, I know that you've been lonely
Yeah, I've been lovely too
Oh, I've been dancin' with the devil
Got blisters in my shoes

But still, I'd walk a thousand miles out through the wild 
To get back inside your heart
Just tryin' to light your fire at any cost
And darlin', I'll be standing by you when the sky gets dark
Oh I, I will find all that love we lost
All that love we lost
All that love we lost
All that love we lost
All that love we lost

All that love we lost
All that love we lost
