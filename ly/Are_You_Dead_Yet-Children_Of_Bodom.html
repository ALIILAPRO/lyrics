		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't hear, don't deem
Drowning before you dive
Don't care, commit to your self destruction drive

I kiss the ground with love beyond forever
Flip off the sky with bleeding fingers 'til I die

Enemy, take one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?

Wake up, don't cry
Regenerate to deny the truth
The fiction you live in blindfold on your eyes

Disclosure, self loathing 
This time you've gone too far
Or could it be, my nemesis, that you are

Enemy, take one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?

Enemy, take one good look at me
Eradicate what you will always be
Your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror I behold
Throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
Tearing me apart but I don't care anymore
Should I regret or ask myself
Are you dead yet?

Are you dead yet?
