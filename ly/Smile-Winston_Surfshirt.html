		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smile for me, beautiful
I wanna see who you are
Smile for me
'Cause I wanna be who you want

We keep playing, open plains
We sat back and watched the people change
And I was opening doors
Hoping you would make your way towards

We ain't stopping for nobody
And there's no surprise
We can't keep our hands off each other
We're both -otized

Damn, so I keep on waffling
She can't stop me hoping that we happening
And I can't keep denying it
It's true, it's true that I'm admiring

We ain't stopping for nobody
And there's no surprise
We can't keep our hands off each other
We're both -otized

Smile for me, beautiful
I wanna see who you are
Smile for me
'Cause I wanna be who you want

So she was in frame so I couldn't complain
And I was so sold and it's never gonna change
Never gonna change, she got me on her ties
But I ain't gonna spit till I see your smile

We ain't stopping for nobody
And there's no surprise
We can't keep our hands off each other
We're both -otized

I don't wanna take a step back again
We can't stop your lips when I'm beckoning
And I just gotta hold on tight
No one ever felt this alright

We ain't stopping for nobody, ever
We can't keep our hands off each other

Smile for me beautiful
I wanna see who you are
Smile for me
'Cause I wanna be who you want

Smile for me beautiful
I wanna see who you are
Smile for me
'Cause I wanna be who you want
