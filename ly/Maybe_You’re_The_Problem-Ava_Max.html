		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always say you love me but you
Always make it all about you
Especially when you've had a few, oh, oh, yeah

All the things I heard from your ex
Now they make a whole lot of sense
Already feel bad for your next
To have to put up with you, oh, yeah

Worked on myself, open my eyes
You hate my friends, turns out they were right
It takes two to make it all go right

But with you, it's always my fault
And your short fuse, just like a time bomb
And I think you should take a second just to look at your reflection
Baby, maybe you're the problem

Okay, you, you see a pattern?
Your point of view, got it all backwards
You should take your little finger and just point it in the mirror
Baby, maybe you're the problem

You should take your little finger and just point it in the mirror
Baby, maybe you're the problem

Ego always doing the most
Out of touch, you're not even close
Drama always follows you home
But I won't be waiting no more

Worked on myself, open my eyes
You hate my friends, turns out they were right
It takes two to make it all go right

But with you, it's always my fault
And your short fuse, just like a time bomb
And I think you should take a second just to look at your reflection
Baby, maybe you're the problem

Okay, you, you see a pattern?
Your point of view, got it all backwards
You should take your little finger and just point it in the mirror
Baby, maybe you're the problem

You should take your little finger and just point it in the mirror
Baby, maybe you're the problem

It's not me, it's you
It's not me, it's you
It's not me, it's you, ooh

But with you, it's always my fault
And your short fuse, just like a time bomb
And I think you should take a second just to look at your reflection
Baby, maybe you're the problem

Okay, you, you see a pattern?
Your point of view, got it all backwards
You should take your little finger and just point it in the mirror
Baby, maybe you're the problem

You should take your little finger and just point it in the mirror
Baby, maybe you're the problem (hey, hey, hey, hey)
