		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the night is falling
Come and whisper to my ear
Like a ghost in my head
Go through my veins, take my soul away

Ooh, I'm gonna cast a spell
And let it burn, yeah
Like a ghost in your head
Go through your veins, take my soul away

So come and call my name
So come and call my name
Come and call my name
So come and call my name
Come and call my name come and call my

We are the lightning, we are the flame
Talk sweet talk all over again
This is when our eyes meet
This is when our hearts beat as one
We are the lightning, we are the flame
Talk sweet talk all over again
This is when our eyes meet
This is when our hearts beat as one

Save me from the shadows
'Cause they wanna eat my soul
Feel the touch of my hand
I'm taking you there
Your wish is my command

So come and call my name
So come and call my name
Come and call my name
So come and call my name
Come and call my name come and call my

We are the lightning, we are the flame
Talk sweet talk all over again
This is when our eyes meet
This is when our hearts beat as one
We are the lightning, we are the flame
Talk sweet talk all over again
This is when our eyes meet
This is when our hearts beat as one

So come and call my name
Come and call my name
So come and call my name
Come and call my name
So come and call my name, name
So come and call my name, name

We are the lightning, we are the flame
Talk sweet talk all over again
This is when our eyes meet
This is when our hearts beat as one
We are the lightning, we are the flame
Talk sweet talk all over again
This is when our eyes meet
This is when our hearts beat as one
