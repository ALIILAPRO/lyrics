		  Baby brown
Rasimcan
Bah, ha-ha-ha-ha!
Let's go

We are back in this bitch B-E repertoire
Holla back to my clique, I'm a rap superstar
Click-click in your face, boom, everywhere we are
And we know what we do what we do is heavy, ma
Look, I talk about the B-E record stars
And my campaign grows, I like to welcome to my yard
Touchdown for my bitches, pink camouflage
Military soldiers in the big Hummer cars
(Yessir) I'm sitting in the club to chill
Look around, I smell beer
Model chicks in the club, call 'em bitch with no fear
Big booties and tits, sex-style underwear
Hot pants G-string fuck everyone and everywhere
That's the way, how we party call your crew, we be there
Baby Brown is the name, A.K.A bubblebear
Do you know what I mean, oriental poison

Oriental poison

Hey ma (what's up?) I'm yo gangsta kid
No GT, money, but a platinum hit
I wait for a exclusive major deal
Holla to my dawgs and I got no time to chill
Chill with a kid who be rocking this bitch
No job, no ice and no fancy things
No crib, no cars and no diamond bling
But in my hood errbody call me platinum king
I'm a giant, I'm bigger then the golden range
Call me subwoofer, I'm the reason why your truck gettin' banged (ha-ha)
I do my thang on my right way, look at the front, fuck you J
Money, fame, bitches and credit cards
The nigga dream about the easy life star parts and he told me like a brother, baby we get rich
But the game be spittin' oriental poison

Oriental poison

Heavy motherfuckers in the club for y'all
And all the bitches in the club at the Bacardi bar
Okay, I'm a B-E record allstar, and I dont give a fuck about y'all
Trigger finger, twenty-one gunshot salute
Motherfuckers hate me 'cause I be the hood
Hypnotized by my rhymes I'm so Hollywood
B-E record crew, we are boys from the hood

Oriental poison
Oriental poison

Baby brown
Rasimcan production
You know what it is
Bangin the boof
Are you ready, ladies?
Let's go
Ha-ha-ha-ha, boof!
