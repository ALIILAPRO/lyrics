		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was fucked up on a long night
Then I found you under the bar lights
Didn't think much about the passed time
Since the last time, that we crossed minds
Then we ditched it and we listened
To hyperpop in your car, now we're kissing
I was just tryin' to have a good time
Then you crossed lines now you're inside

I'm a lonely bitch, I'm used to it, what do I do now?
Didn't ask for this, now I can't quit the taste of your mouth
And I hate that I don't hate when you're around 'cause
I'm a lonely bitch, you made me glitch, so what am I now?

I was planning to ignore you
Didn't think that I adore you
Tried to keep you in the corner
Take you out if I was but bored but
I tried to fight it, I can't deny it
That you got into my head and I can't think my way out of it

I'm a lonely bitch, I'm used to it, what do I do now?
Didn't ask for this, now I can't quit the taste of your mouth
And I hate that I don't hate when you're around 'cause
I'm a lonely bitch, you made me glitch, so what am I now?

Didn't wanna find another reason why to stay alive, alive
Thought that I could be alone in peace until the day I died, I died
Didn't wanna find another reason why to stay alive, alive
I was just tryin' to have a good time
Then you crossed lines, now you're inside

I'm a lonely bitch, I'm used to it, what do I do now?
Didn't ask for this, now I can't quit the taste of your mouth
And I hate that I don't hate when you're around 'cause
I'm a lonely bitch, you made me glitch, so what am I now?

And I hate that I don't hate when you're around 'cause
I'm a lonely bitch, you made me glitch so what am I now?
