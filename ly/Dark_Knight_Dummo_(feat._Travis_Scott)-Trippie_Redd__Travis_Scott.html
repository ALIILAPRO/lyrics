		  Oh my God (Honorable C.N.O.T.E)
Oh my God
Yeah, haha
Big 14, know what the fuck goin' on
Ayy

Hold up, take a moment, count my guap, count my guap
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in, hold up, ayy
Count my guap, count my guap
Cannot stop comin' in, comin' in

Pulled up in a drop-top, she drop dead
I pulled up in a drop-top, she drop dead
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands, yeah

Hold up, I don't know what planet I'm on (don't know, don't know)
I'm the king, lil' bitch, watch the throne (watch the throne)
I feel like Valdo, I'll chop off your arms (off your arms, yeah), yeah
Steady causin' havoc, yeah (causin' havoc)
Bitch, I'm ballin' hard just like a maverick (yeah)
Money stretch long, lil' bitch, like elastic (yeah)
Now that bitch steady callin' me Mr. Fantastic, yeah, ayy
Know I keep a ratchet (a ratch')
If you play, boy, I'll turn your ass to ashes (ah)
Automatic, doo-doo-doo-doo, bitch, I'm blastin' (doo-doo-doo-doo) 
Yeah, ooh, put you in a casket (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Money sit long, it's elastic
I don't know what planet I'm on (I'm on Mars)
I'm the king, lil' bitch, watch the throne (chop your arms, yeah)
I feel like Valdo, I'll chop off your arms (watch the throne), yeah 

Hold up, take a moment, count my guap, count my guap (yeah)
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in (it's lit), hold up, ayy
Count my guap, count my guap (straight up)
Cannot stop comin' in, comin' in (yeah, yeah)

Pulled up in a drop-top, she drop dead (alright)
I pulled up in a drop-top, she drop dead (yeah)
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands (yeah)
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands, yeah

Astroworld's my planet, my home (yeah)
Car's too hot, the fume's too strong (yeah, yeah, it's lit)
Mixed this cup for way too long (yeah, yeah, alright)
Add it up, don't subtract it (yeah, yeah), yeah
Pour this eighth with me and let's get blasted (yeah, yeah, straight up)
Lambo' drive like a dragon (ooh, skrrt, skrrt)
Can't fall asleep at night 'cause they attackin', yeah
I hop in the coupe, go insane (fast)
I disappear, go David Blaine 
We don't do the same (no)
I feed all my bitches the 'caine (white)
I double cup to drown the pain (drank)
Light the octane (yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah, gas)
I'ma put six in the Lambo' and jet to the plane (skrrt, skrrt)
Move for this chain with your elbow, I hope you got aim
Don't need no more stains or get hot like my name (La Flame)
Yeah, hide out in the trees with the bumblebees, please say the name three times
We gon' pop up on you like I'm Bloody Mary, man (ayy)

Hold up, take a moment, count my guap, count my guap
All these racks bomin' in, they bomin' in, hold up, ayy
Count my guap, count my guap
Cannot stop comin' in, comin' in

Pulled up in a drop-top, she drop dead
I pulled up in a drop-top, she drop dead
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands
My diamonds dancin', hopscotch, they holdin' hands, yeah
