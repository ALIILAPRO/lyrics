		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiet
I don't need no one to bother me 
Tonight
I have to cry until I can't be able to see 

I know your blaming yourself 
Cuz it never worked 
But this one was not our fault 
So blame it on the whole world 

Don't want no body else 
I just can't move on 
I think that Imma die alone 

I've never been so lost 
Can't think about nothing 
Thinking about you is all I know 

Stay
Even as the pain that hurts me all the time 
Clame
Every single thought I have inside my mine 

I know your blaming yourself 
Cuz it never worked 
But this one was not our fault 
So blame it on the whole world 

Don't want no body else 
I just can't move on 
I think that Imma die alone 

I've never been so lost 
Can't think about nothing 
Thinking about you is all I know
