		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People in a show
All lined in a row
We just push on by
It's funny, how hard we try
Don't you wanna know me?
Be a friend of mine
I'll share some wisdom with you
Don't you ever get lonely
From time to time
Don't let the system get you down

Big City Life, me try fi get by
Pressure nah ease up, no matter how hard me try
Big City Life, here my heart have no base
And right now Babylon de 'pon mi case
Big City Life, try fi get by
Pressure nah ease up, no matter how hard me try
Big City Life, my heart have no base
And right now Babylon de 'pon mi case

Don't you wanna know me?
Be a friend of mine
I'll share some wisdom with you
Don't you ever get lonely
From time to time
Don't let the system get you down

Big City Life, me try fi get by
Pressure nah ease up, no matter how hard mi try
Big City Life, here my heart have no base
And right now Babylon de 'pon mi case

(Don't let the system get you down)

Big City Life, me try fi get by
Pressure nah ease up, no matter how hard mi try
Big City Life, here my heart have no base
And right now Babylon de 'pon mi case
Big City Life, me try fi get by
Pressure nah ease up, no matter how hard mi try
Big City Life, here my heart have no base
And right now Babylon de 'pon mi case
