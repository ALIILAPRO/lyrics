		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please, don't put it into words
'Cause I fear what you're thinking
It's gonna make it hurt
You better not try to make me
Believe in someone new

Faithless, on my way
Defenseless from my heart, won't you be?
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
This night will start the exile, run

Now, you tell me what it was worth
Was it meant to be broken?
The circle that wouldn't shed a single tear
And now you wanna redirect me
From the face of the earth

Not willing to share your time
Not near, not far
I'm just a spectator, once loved
Just fear, just scars
A sheer introduction to what I've lost, to what I've lost

Faithless, on my way
Defenseless from my heart, won't you be?
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
(From this night's misery)
One more endless night

To notice all the things I have to be

Faithless, on my way
Won't forgive, from my heart, won't you be?
Heartless, here with me
Breathless, from this night's misery
This night will start the exile, run
