		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lived a lot of life and not a thing's changed
A lot of things change, people don't change
I just spent a quarter million on a fuckin' chain
I just spent a quarter million on that fuckin' plane
I just spent a half a million on a Cullinan
I just spent a quarter million on a butler, man
Yeah, covering my face like Jimmy Butler, man
Yeah, I got couple watches, couple watches move
We don't go band for band, we go bil for bil
We don't link 'n build, we make buildings build
Dystopian society on Silent Hill
I just wanna feel things, I wanna feel real
I want to feel like normal human, don't wanna pop a pill
I wash my hands of all this blood, and then I keep it real
Just tell me how you feeling
When you come inside this building, tell me how you feeling
I don't wanna hear your lies, I wanna hear how you feeling
How you really feeling, and how you really dealing
With all the stress, you say that occupy your mind, you krilling
I don't know nobody at all, I'm not even from this planet
I could take the first shuttle off, and I don't even know where I'm landing
I don't even know my home phone, I don't even know my planet
Don't even know how I made this shit, don't even know how I planned it
Used to be popping Percocet like shit was fuckin' candy
I'm gone call up Elon Musk and ask him where we landing
I just called up Space X and asked 'em, "Where my planet?"
I can't listen to what you said, I told you to fuckin' can it
Divide is way too real, but now I understand it
Underestimated you, but now I understand it
I can't listen to no music, I can't fucking stand it
Popped so many X pills, I don't know how I'm standing
When you live like me so much, and then you'll understand it

When you feel amazing, do you feel a mess?
I feel amazing, feel it in my chest
When I take a breath, no, I don't inhale
If you said all that shit and you meant it
Don't take it back, don't take it back, don't take it
I seen a thousand things that I can't explain
But I did a thousand things that could push you away
And I know it's not for me 'cause I'm out of the way
When I live like this, you know that you never could stay
And I take it all too seriously, I never could play
But I lived a lot of life so I can't complain

Lived a lot of life and not a thing's changed
A lot of things change, people don't change
I just spent a quarter million on a fuckin' chain
I just spent a quarter million on that fuckin' plane
I just spent a half a million on a Cullinan
I just spent a quarter million on a butler, man
Yeah, covering my face like Jimmy Butler, man
Yeah, I got couple watches, couple watches move
We don't go band for band, we go bil for bil
We don't link 'n build, we make buildings build
Dystopian society on Silent Hill
I just wanna feel things, I wanna feel real
I want to feel like normal human, don't wanna pop a pill
I wash my hands of all this blood, and then I keep it real
Just tell me how you feeling
When you come inside this building, tell me how you feeling
I don't wanna hear your lies, I wanna hear how you feeling
How you really feeling, and how you really dealing
With all the stress, you say that occupy your mind, you krilling
I don't know nobody at all, I'm not even from this planet
I could take the first shuttle off, and I don't even know where I'm landing
I don't even know my home phone, I don't even know my planet
Don't even know how I made this shit, don't even know how I planned it
