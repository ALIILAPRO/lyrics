		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah-yeah, ayy
Ayy
How long are you stayin' in New York?
Shit, I don't know but I'm in it, look

How long are you stayin' in New York?
I don't know but I'm in New York, yeah
Yeah-yeah, ayy (ayy)
Oh, great, you're in town
New teeth, baby, bite down
Clarity pinky on your ring
You up at terminal five with the gang
See you been makin' your rounds
Go 'head and network, shawty, I'm proud
See, I know that I'm workin' with a G, yes
No squares, only legits, yeah
Keepin' it a bean, the squad need a general
To go and get the money and motivate
'Cause they ain't got they own
Don't know what they doin', don't know where they goin'
Show 'em where to go
And they all look up but don't do it like you do it
Move it like you move it, genius goin' stupid, I, I

I never wanna leave
I want you to stay (uh-huh)
I hope you never leave me
I want you to stay (I won't never leave)

She my little empanada mama
Got her hair straight from her mama
Dirty, dirty dancin', she like she salsa
Had me up in Brooklyn, Queens or Harlem
New York in the summer
Ain't nothin' been quite like this
Talk to me nice when you're live like this
Fear in your eyes when I slide to the crib, baby

I never wanna leave
I want you to stay (yeah)
She never wanna leave
I want her to stay (ooh-whoa)
Everything's better in New York
I never wanna leave
I want you to stay (uh-huh)
I hope you never leave me
I want you to stay (I won't never leave)

Ayy, look
Probably got that first gen of the story that you didn't like (ayy)
That was a diversion to keep us far apart 'cause we just alike (look)
A movie ain't a movie 'less it's starrin' you and I
And you know we runnin' game, we keep it playa and keep it quiet
It don't come as no surprise, in our twenties but we both so jaded
Should be in L.A. but we still in New York
My hands on your waist, girl, I'm tendin' to
That pussy brought me to tears, I should've brought a tissue
'Cause I miss you

I never wanna leave
I want you to stay (yeah-yeah)
I hope you never leave me
(I won't never leave, uh-huh, uh-huh)
(Never)
