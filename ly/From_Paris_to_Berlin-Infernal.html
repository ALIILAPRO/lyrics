		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From Paris to Berlin
In every disco I get in
My heart is pumping for love
Pumping for love
'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you

From Paris to Berlin
In every disco I get in
My heart is pumping for love
Pumping for love
'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love

Patience is a game
And every night I say your name
Hoping that you'll answer
'Cause I'm going insane
It's quite along time ago 
You brought me out of control
Hungry for you lovin'
Like I know what that might be

From Paris to Berlin
In every disco I get in
My heart is pumping for love
Pumping for love
'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you

Teasing was the thing 
And now I just can't let it go
Meeting you was something no one else needs to know
I guess I'm thinking of you, 
Like I would know what to do
If and when I found you, but I don't 
I've got no clue

From Paris to Berlin
In every disco I get in
My heart is pumping for love
Pumping for love
'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you

From Paris to Berlin
In every disco I get in
My heart is pumping for love
Pumping for love
'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you

From Paris to Berlin
In every every disco I get in
My heart is pumping for love
Pumping for love
'Cause when I'm thinking of you
And all the things we could do
My heart is pumping for love
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
You left me longing for you
