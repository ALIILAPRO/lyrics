		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't no use in calling up your friends
Ain't no use in hiding in your bed
And ain't no use in standing on your head
'Cause only silence can fill your loneliness

Seven days of time to fix your head
Seven days of time you walk the ledge
And every time you catch a sight
Of your reflection
You can't decide of you should cry
Of if it's time to learn

Can't count how many times I've heard you say
You'd give up all you got for just a day
Of feeling fine
No counting lines
That settled up under your eyes
To fall in love to fall in love to fall in love

In sympathy, no doubt you hurt your friend
And it's too late now
But I wrote this down back then
There ain't no use in cutting through
The darkness that envelops you
You have to let the light come in instead
