		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, man, man, uh

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez (uh) in the trap

Man, I been did that, man, I been popped off
And if she ain't trying to give it up she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie, bitch, bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off no joking
Like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit then I'm with that bat (baow)

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin' (true)
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap (yeah)
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap (2 Chainz)

Okay now Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this do-hicky
If I weren't rappin' I'd be trappin'
If I weren't trappin' I'd be pimpin'
If I weren't pimpin' I'd be gettin' it, period
I don't smoke no Bobby, but my denim be from Ricky (Ricky)
Got your girl on Molly and we smokin' loud and drinkin' (drinkin')
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin' (thinkin')
And if you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin (Franklin)
Money (money), thousands (thousands), True Religion trousers (tell 'em)
Got a private home, started from them public houses (damn)
Hair weave killer (killer), 'causing her arousal (true)
Audi A8, told them, "Outtie 5000," uh

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothing
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know, man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know, man, I'm shittin' on your whole life

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Man, I'm out in Texas
Man, I'm out in A-town
Then I'm up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin' it down
It's that New Orleans, it's LA or The Bay
It's New York, Philly
And the whole DMV
I'm a Detroit Player, man, it's North-South Cack
Ohio, Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck
It's Delaware, Connecticut, it's New Jersey got hella bricks
It's Queens, Brooklyn, and yeah, they wildin'
Bronx, Harlem, and Staten Island

Bitches ain't shit and they ain't saying nothin'
A hundred mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, be-beez in the trap

Damn, damn what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know, man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
Damn, damn what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know, man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
