		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back from the grave, they rise
The dead have come to ravage
Awoken by a chemical agent
Rotten corpses revitalized
Peeling flesh. Rancid decay.
Hungry for the brains of humans
Dead metalheads here for revenge
Killing posers and eating people
The graveyard from which they rise
Is in a town full of college dropouts
House venues littered with bodies
Dead metalheads who partied too hard
They've come back for one more night
To get fucked up and feed on flesh
They will not stop until they are fed
The dead rise to get fucked up
Only half a mile away
They hear death metal music
House show filled with beer and weed
The perfect feeding ground
As they approach no one is shocked
They fit right into the crowd of thrashers
Drunk idiots covered in puke
The time has come to eat the living
Zombie Party Rockers
They came to rock
They will suck your dick
Then eat your cock
From the grave
The essence of fear
They're coming for your brains
And also beer
You try to run
You try to fight
Zombies all around you
No escape in sight
They're drawing nearer
They never quit
You must endure
The ZOMBIE MOSH PIT
From the grave
Into the pit
Smoking weed
Doing drugs, drinking beer
Hungry for
Human brains
Try to run
You are trapped, no escape
You cry in fear but there is no where to hide
The dead have come to party hard tonight
Fight for your life but there is no end in sight
Zombie Party Rockers are in the house tonight
