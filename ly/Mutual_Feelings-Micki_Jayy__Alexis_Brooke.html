		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me is it me you want
Am I running in your mind
Do you read between the lines
Tell me if you want me yea
Ready for the week now yea
I don't wanna say it, I might say it too soon
I don't wanna play it, I don't wanna feel blue
They don't know what we been thru
They just wanna do what I do
They just wanna take you boo
They just wanna do me too
I wanna feel the motion
Friction on your body
Yea you know I'm missin'
Having you around me
Tell me do you feel the same
Tell me that you want me
Never when it's easy
Tell me that you need me
Not because you're lonely yea
I don't wanna say this too soon
But man I'm feeling you
I know that it's mutual
Hoping that you see us through
I be saying crazy shit, hoping that it get to you
Call me after work come slide on it
I wanna spend my nights with it
All up in my feelings
Boy I need that healing
I need you to say it back
All up in my feelings
Tell me is it me you want
Am I running in your mind
Do you read between the lines
Tell me if you want me yea
Ready for the week now yea
Tell me you want me too
You got the feelings too
The things I wanna feel
The things I wanna do
I wanna feel the motion
Friction on your body
Yea you know I'm missin'
Having you around me
Tell me do you feel the same
Tell me that you want me
Never when it's easy
Tell me that you need me
Not because you're lonely yea
