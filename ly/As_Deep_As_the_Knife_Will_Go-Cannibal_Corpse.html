		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The blade goes in you and it enters smooth
Disturbing moans begin to soothe
Scraping bone with steel to feel it once
Keep pushing hard it never stops

Had to do it
Had to put it in your gut
Nothing to it
Grab the handle let it slice

Heart polluted
As it's cut out of your chest
Gushing fluids
Bleeding it dry

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

The blade has always done its job well
Seems like its work is never done
Scraping bone with steel to feel it twice
Keep pushing hard it doesn't stop

Desecrated
A body rid of living
Future faded
Gaping hole from front to back

Heart dissected
As it sits upon your chest
Gushing fluids
Drain you empty

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go

Bleed it dry
Bleed it dry
Drain you empty
Drain you empty 

Bleed it dry
Bleed it dry
Drain you empty
Drain you empty 

As deep as the knife will go
A life changing transfer of power
As deep as the knife will go

As deep as the knife will go
Every inch of it in you savored
As deep as the knife will go
