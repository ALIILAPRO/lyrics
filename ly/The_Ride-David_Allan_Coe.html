		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery
I had my guitar on my back
When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
He was dressed like 1950
Half drunk and hollow eyed
He said, "it's a long walk to Nashville 
Would you like a ride, Son?"

Well, I sat down in the front seat
He turned on the radio
And them sad old songs coming outta them speakers was solid country gold
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale 
When I asked him for a light
And I knew there was something strange about this ride

He said, "Drifter, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues? Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?"
He said, "Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
'Cause if you're big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride"

Then he cried just south of Nashville
And he turned that car around
He said, "This is where you get off, boy
'Cause I'm goin' back to Alabam"
As I stepped outta that Cadillac
I said, "Mister, many thanks"
He said, "You don't have to call me mister, mister
The whole world called me Hank"

He said, "Drifter, can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues? Can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them guitar strings?"
He said, "Boy, can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
'Cause if you're big star bound let me warn you it's a long hard ride"

He said, "Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing?
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues?
Can you bend them, guitar strings?"
He said, "Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside?
'Cause if you're big star bound let me warn you, it's a long, hard ride"
If you're big star bound let me warn you it's a long, hard ride
