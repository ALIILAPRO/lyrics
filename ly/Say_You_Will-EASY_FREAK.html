		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby can you stay
I know it's getting late
But, let's just celebrate
This beauty God has made
This figure is on straight
This form with not one mistake
Your finesse, your fur√®
You push and pull, give and take
Girl
'Cause you got the looks that'll show 'em
And I just had a change of heart
Baby, I could go on
You know it's written in the stars

(Say you will)
(Stay the night)
(I promise it'll be magical)
(I'll hold you tight)
(You know that I won't let you go)
(Like Romeo and Juliette)
(We're memorable)
(That's you and me and more)

(Say you will)
(Stay the night)
(I promise it'll be magical)
(I'll hold you tight)
(You know that I won't let you go)
(Like Romeo and Juliette)
(We're memorable)
(That's you and me and more)

Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour

(Say you will)
(Stay the night)
(I promise it'll be magical)
(I'll hold you tight)
(You know that I won't let you go)
(Like Romeo and Juliette)
(We're memorable)
(That's you and me and more)

(Say you will)
(Stay the night)
(I promise it'll be magical)
(I'll hold you tight)
(You know that I won't let you go)
(Like Romeo and Juliette)
(We're memorable)
(That's you and me and more)

Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour
Bonjour, bonjour mi amour

(Say you will)
(Stay the night)
(I promise it'll be magical)
(I'll hold you tight)
(You know that I won't let you go)
(Like Romeo and Juliette)
(We're memorable)
(That's you and me and more)
