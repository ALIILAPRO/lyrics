		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What we doing? (One, two, three, four)

They say we're losers and we're all alright with that
We are the leaders of the not coming backs
But we're alright though (woo-hoo, yeah)
Yeah, we're alright though

(Woo-hoo, howdy, y'all)
Welcome to the show
Alright, Luke

My girlfriend's bitchin' 'cause I always sleep in
She's always screaming when she's calling a friend
She's kinda hot though (yeah)
Yeah, she's kinda hot though
(Just a little bit hot)

My shrink is telling me I got crazy dreams
She's also saying I got low self-esteem
She's kinda hot though
Yeah, she's kinda hot though
(Just a little bit, a little bit hot, yeah, yeah)
She put me on meds, she won't get out of my head
She's kinda hot though

(One, two)
(Three, one, four, two)

My friend left college 'cause it felt like a job
His mom and dad both think he's a slob
He's got a shot though
Yeah, he's got a shot though
When you've got bigger plans that no one else understands
You've got a shot though
(Ohh, one, two, three, four)

They say we're losers and we're alright with that
We are the leaders of the not-coming-back's
But we're alright though
Yeah, we're alright though
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, we're alright though
(One, two, three, go)

Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm going insane
My neighbor told me that I got bad brains
But I'm alright though (we're alright though)
Yeah, we're alright though (we're alright though)
'Cause we're the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
But we're alright though (we're alright)
(One, two, three, four)

They say we're losers and we're alright with that
We are the leaders of the not-coming-back's
But we're alright though (we're alright though)
Yeah, we're alright though (we're alright though)
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
But we're alright though

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We are the kings and the queens of the new broken scene
Yeah, we're alright though

Meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow
Meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow-meow
That'll do
Breeze all that, right?
