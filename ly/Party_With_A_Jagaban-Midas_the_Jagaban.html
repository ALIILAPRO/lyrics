Oya na na na na na
Oya na na na na na
Midas touch, I got the rightest (AoD)
She wanna see the mighty
I got the rightest

Said she wanna party with the jagaban (jagaban)
Because she never met nobody badder than, baby
Brown and bad just like a jagaban (jagaban)
I ain't never seen nobody badder than
I say, baby do you wanna be a jagaban (jagaban)
Are you sure you can party with the jagaban (jagaban)

Say she wanna party with the jagaban (jagaban)
Because she never met nobody badder than (jagaban)
Long long time baby you've been on my mind
Long long time baby I've been on my grind
No 419, baby you've been on my mind
No 419, baby I've been on my grind
I'm a jagaban (jagaban)
Classy, bougie, riffraff (riffraff)
Only fuck with good vibes (good vibes)
Hennessy with no chaser 
Only thing I chase is paper 
I'm a jagaban
Classy, bougie, riffraff (riffraff)
Only fuck with good vibes (good vibes)
Hennessy with no chaser
Only thing I chase is paper 
Only thing I chase is paper 
Only thing I chase is paper 

Only thing I chase is paper 
Because I am a jagabanbanban
A jagaban
The only thing I chase is paper
paper na na na na na na
Said she wanna party with the jagaban
Because she never met nobody badder than, baby
Brown and bad just like a jagaban
I ain't never seen nobody badder than
I say, baby do you wanna be a jagaban
Are you sure you can party with the jagaban
Say she wanna party with the jagaban
Because she never met nobody badder than

Long long time baby you've been on my mind
Long long time baby I've been on my grind
No 419, baby you've been on my mind
No 419, baby I've been on-
Where you dey, where you at

When I was on my 'lone there 
Nobody to show me love
When I was on my 'lone there
Now I'm makin' money
She wanna feel the boy
Then there's lotta of money
This eleven money
I'm Midas
I'm a Jagaban
And she knows that
Nobody badder than

Na na na na na na, oya na na na na na na
Oya na na na na na, oya na na na na na na
Classy, bougie, riffraff
Only fuck with good vibes
Hennessy with no chaser
Only thing I chase is paper 
Only thing I chase is paper 
Only thing I chase is paper 
Only thing I chase is paper 
Because I am a jagabanbanban
A jagaban
The only thing I chase is paper 
Paper na na na na na na
Said she wanna party with the jagaban
Because she never met nobody badder, baby
Brown and bad just like a jagaban

I ain't never seen nobody badder than
I say, baby do you wanna be a jagaban
Are you sure you can party with the jagaban
Say she wanna party with the jagaban
Because she never met nobody badder than
I'm a jagaban
Classy, bougie, riffraff (riffraff)
Only fuck with good vibes (good vibes)
Hennessy with no chaser
Only thing I chase is paper 
Baby do you wanna be a jagaban
Oya na na na na na na
