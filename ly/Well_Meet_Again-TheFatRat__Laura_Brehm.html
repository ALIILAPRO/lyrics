		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Suddenly, you're nowhere to be found
I turn around and everything has changed
Looking for a way to work it out
I'm trying to find some peace to navigate

The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I'm not a soldier but I'm fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
We'll meet again

We'll meet again

Everything we wanted turned to gold (turned to gold)
The path we chose, the future on our side
Never thought I'd do this on my own (on my own)
But now I wield the sword you left behind

The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I'm not a soldier but I'm fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
We'll meet again

We'll meet again

Dark for the sunrise
Clouds for a blue sky
Space for the traveling star
Strong from the inside
You're still my lifeline
I feel you wherever you are

The oak tree where I met you
And the writing on the statue
I still remember every word you said
I'm not a soldier but I'm fighting
Can you hear me through the silence?
I won't give up 'cause there will be a day
We'll meet again

We'll meet again
We'll meet again
