		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once
Lately I can't find the beat
I used to feel the rush

Started with a little bit
Now I don't know how to quit
Always feel inadequate
Same way that my daddy did
Mama told me not to try
And I should have taken her advice
And now I'm all twisted
When it's all gone, I miss it

I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'
Else that gets me through the day
'Til I find another way
I'll try just to do somethin'
I'll try 'cause I got nothin'
Even if I lose again
I won't quit

I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once, uh
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

And now I need you to feel the vibe
I need you to see the point
I need you to feel alive
I need you to fill the void

My insecurities are
My own worst enemy, yeah
Something's not lettin' me
Move the way I used to
Thought you could better me but
Then you stopped lettin' me walk
Now you're just settin' me off
So I'm tryna lose you

I'll fight just to do somethin'
I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'
Else that gets me through the day
'Til I find another way
I'll fight just to do somethin'
I'll fight 'cause I got nothin'
Even if I lose again
I can't quit, mmm

I wonder how I got by this week
I only touched you once
Lately I can't find a beat
I used to feel the rush

And now I need you to feel the vibe
I need you to see the point
I need you to feel alive
I need you to fill the void
I need you to fill the void
I need you to fill the void

You paralyze me every time
I try to find some paradise
I've got to fill the void
And now I'm paranoid
You paralyze me every time
I try to find some paradise
I've got to fill the void
And now I'm paranoid
