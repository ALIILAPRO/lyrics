		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything disgustin', conversation is so borin'
Heard about what?
"I hate her", "I don't agree", "I did it first"
I give a fuck, I just wanna fuck, eat, sleep, love, happy
Can you make me happy? Can you keep me happy?

Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

I need humanity
You're like humanity
Drownin' in vanity
Cravin' humanity
You're like humanity
I need humanity, I need

Everybody wanna be beautiful, scared of the unusual
Scared of givin' mutual respect, all that you hate
It reflect all that godlike
You forget how to love somebody
I ain't everybody, I ain't everyone
Let's talk about A.I., robot got more heart than I
Robot got future, I don't
Robot get sleep, but I don't power down
I'm wide open, I'm awake, I'm on autopilot
I'm out of my mind and I'm wide open

Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

I need humanity
You're like humanity
Drownin' in vanity
Cravin' humanity
You're like humanity
I need humanity, I need

You said all my friends are on my payroll
You're not wrong, you're an asshole
Screaming at you in the Ludlow
I was yours for free (free, free, free)
I don't get existential
I just think about myself and look where that got me
Standin' on my own in an airport bar or hotel lobby
Waiting to feel clean
That's so fucking boring

Can you distract me from all the disaster?
Can you touch on me and not call me after?
Can you hate on me and mask it with laughter?
Can you lead me to the ark? What's the password?

I need humanity
You're like humanity
Drownin' in vanity
Cravin' humanity
You're like humanity
I need humanity, I need

Those who have forsaken their humanity
They're trying to patch their life with morality
I think I might be tryna patch my life with morality
I'm curious, I'm curious
