		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  However long it takes, I'ma take my time
It's gone show who really with you
Heard a lot of shots before
I got to take mine
You gone blow it or get richer?
Up another level I been
Pourin I been sippin'
Totin' on this metal cause I
Know a couple victims
Money made it better but I
Swear it made a change
I'ma always be the same I'm
Just knowin' what I'm riskin'
Askin' where u been at I
Been tryna catch time
'Til I need a break to chill
Long as I could pay the bills
And I'ma feed mine, long as
They don't break or spill
Niggas acting fake forreal
Ain't always all good
Still a lot to make wе got family in the hood
Dealin' with the statе pay the
Lawyer get it done
They prolly can't relate I ain't
Doin this for nun my momma only son

I'm just givin' my pain
I'm just givin' my mind uh uh
I'm just tryna maintain
I'm just tryna get mine uh uh
Niggas thinkin' I changed
They ain't knowin' both sides uh uh
I ain't showin no shame
I been holdin shit down uh uh
I'm just givin' my pain
I'm just givin' my mind uh uh
I'm just tryna maintain
I'm just tryna get mine uh uh
Niggas thinkin' I changed
They ain't knowin' both sides uh uh
I ain't showin no shame
I been holdin shit down uh uh

Yea, like when I get the truth
In my face I'ma face it
Truthfully I'm losin' patience
With myself I been selfish with
Time just to waste it
If you ain't see it I won't say shit
Ima go and get by quick high won't erase it
This fame shit really basic
It really ain't shit
It got me losin' motivation rollin
Round with no destination
Chasin' tryna catch
