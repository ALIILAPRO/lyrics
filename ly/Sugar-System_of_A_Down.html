		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar
Sugar

I'm not there all the time, you know
Some people, some people, some people
Call it insane, yeah, they call it insane (sugar)
I play Russian Roulette everyday, a man's sport
With a bullet called life, yeah, mama, called life (sugar)
You know that every time I try to go
Where I really wanna be
It's already where I am
'Cause I'm already there

The Kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray
Sugar

I got a gun the other day from Sako
It's cute, small, fits right in my pocket
Yeah, right in my pocket (sugar)
My girl, you know, she lashes out at me sometimes
And I just fucking kick her, and then, ooh baby, she's okay (sugar)
People are always chasing me down
Trying to push my face to the ground
Where all they do is suck out my motherfucking brains, my brains (sugar)

The Kombucha mushroom people
Sitting around all day
Who can believe you?
Who can believe you?
Let your mother pray

I sit, in my desolate room
No lights, no music
Just anger
I've killed everyone
I'm away forever, but I'm feeling better
How do I feel?
What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
Fuck you, it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
How do I feel?
What do I say?
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
In the end it all goes away
