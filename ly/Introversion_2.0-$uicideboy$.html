		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Barrel full of gasoline, and still
They try matchin' me
Plague with the wicked ways
It's back to the rapturing
Actually capturing souls in a black canteen
Open the cap, and become blackened
Back to the back of the 'Lac
Flickin' cigarette ash
Got a chain made of crack, I smoke diamonds
And laugh at y'all strapped with the gat
Like I'm actually scared to die
Pull the fucking trigger
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah!
Back to the back, eyes rollin' back
Spent all my racks, spent it on crack
Spent it on smack, look where I'm at
Ain't going back, ain't going back

Got a heart so cold, remember sellin' dope
Remember sellin' coke, DEA pulled me over
Plain cars, plain clothes, I
Didn't bend an inch
I'm strictly sticking to the code
Few years ago was masked up, robbin' stores
Set 'em up on Craigslist
Then robbed 'em at the door
I'm at the bottom tryna eat, I got no hope
Fuck big Ben's death had my head fucked up
I'm poppin' Roxys with the Benzos
Chest fucked up (I guess my luck's up)
