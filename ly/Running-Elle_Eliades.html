		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where the hell do you think you’re going?
You’re running running
Starting line is where it’s at
Finish line you won’t find that
Too much troubles at your door, you
You leave it closed search for more
I don’t know where you’ve been at
I don’t need to know to see that
You been running from something
Stop running stop running
Stop running
Where the hell do you think you’re going?
You’re running running
Where the hell do you think you’re going?
You’re running running
Usain bolt can’t run as fast
But somehow you still finish last
No time to stop and say grace, no
But slow and steady always wins the race
You been running from something
Stop running stop running
Stop running
Where the hell do you think you’re going?
You’re running running
Where the hell do you think you’re going?
You’re running running
