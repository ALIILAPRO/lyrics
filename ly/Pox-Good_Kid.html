		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A pox, a pox, upon this ground
I'd give it up just to burn it down 
And if they die here you can blame it on me 
I've been setting up gravestones in my hometown 

I wish I had been born at sea,
Then you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't know me
Ebb and flow, they just won't carry me home
It's only water and air as far as I can see 

There was a time when you would let me know 
Because your words weren't taken by your indigo
And i could write it all down in a matter of lines
To read back what we had from a previous time 

My ancestral passage here
Was written down each year by year 
But the map is too old, see they've forgotten the roads
And so we're living by the creases

A pox, a pox, upon this ground 
I'd give it up just to burn it down 
And if they die here you can blame it on me 
I've been setting up gravestones in my hometown 

I wish I had been born at sea,
Then you wouldn't care, and you wouldn't know me 
Ebb and flow, they just won't carry me home
It's only water and air as far as I can see
