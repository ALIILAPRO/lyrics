		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get the goosebumps every time,
I clench my teeth and close my eyes.
I get the goosebumps every night,
I clench my teeth and

Close my eyes,
Prepare to die.
It could be now,
Just tell me how.
It's got me feelin' like somebody is watching me,
Sneaking through my hall, I guarantee it.

I get confused,
My brain, it loses all sense truth.
Tell me who I'm gonna call when the shadows are stalking me?
And watching me, watching me, watching me, watching me, yeah.

Your nightmares, they come to life, so beware,
Enjoy the ride, if you dare.
If you dare.

I get the goosebumps every time,
I clench my teeth and close my eyes.
I get the goosebumps every night,
I clench my teeth and close my eyes.
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna close my eyes.
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna close my eyes.

I am that thing that goes bump in the night,
That leaves you wondering why deceased are coming to life.
Your whole life’s decided by a roll of tumbling dice.
It’s all fun and games ay?
Until somebody dies.

So set your pumpkins alight, buckle up and come for the ride,
A brush with the other side is a humbling sight.
I’m always watching… waiting… until the time,
The clock tick tocks, indicating your turn to die.

Some people like hockey, hunting is my hobby.
I try not to be a litterbug, sorry if you find bodies.
(I'm sorry)
I’m the monster under the bed... the one that’s touching your leg.
You watching me, watching me, watching me, watching me, yeah?

Your nightmares, they come to life, so beware,
Enjoy the ride, if you dare.
If you dare.

I get the goosebumps every time,
I clench my teeth and close my eyes.
I get the goosebumps every night,
I clench my teeth and close my eyes.
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna close my eyes.
I wanna, I wanna,
I wanna close my eyes.

I get the goosebumps every night,
I clench my teeth and close my eyes.
