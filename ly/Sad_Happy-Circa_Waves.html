		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was waiting so sad happy
Thought I lost you in a nightmare dream
You were too high to hold on
I was losing all track of time
For a moment I thought I'd died
Searching for someone

But I will not find
Myself tonight
No, I will not find 
Myself tonight

But you can't see
My heart's made out of concrete
You know me, I'm sad happy
You know me, I'm sad happy
No, you can't see
My heart's made out of concrete
You know me, I'm sad happy
You know me, I'm sad happy

I was dancing with my eyes wide shut
Trying not to think too much
Too high to fall down
So wait for me, sad happy
I know this feels like a dream
But the good times will come 'round

And I will not find
Myself tonight
No, I will not find
Myself tonight

But you can't see
My heart's made out of concrete
You know me, I'm sad happy
You know me, I'm sad happy
No, you can't see
My heart's made out of concrete
You know me, I'm sad happy
You know me, I'm sad happy

Sad happy
Sad happy
