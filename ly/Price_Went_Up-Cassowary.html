		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been happening for a while baby 
You've got me crying like a child, baby girl
I can tell you're lying babe
Don't you think I know my baby girl?
It's been happening for a while baby 
You've got me crying like a child, baby girl 
I can tell you're lying babe
Don't you think I know my baby girl? 

I'll be on my steez if I got my G's and I got my cheese and I got my weed  
I'ma roll my Dutch, I'ma sip my cup, when it comes to love, man that price went up
I'll be on my steez if I got my G's and I got my cheese and I got my weed  
I'ma roll my Dutch, I'ma sip my cup, when it comes to love, man that price went up. 

We were chilling on the island baby
Yours was mine and mines was yours and you were my whole world
Now you're acting silent babe
These are just reminders of my world
Happening for a while baby
You've got me crying like a child, baby girl
I can tell you're lying babe
Don't you think i know my baby girl?
