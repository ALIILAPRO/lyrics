		<p>
		  What the fuck I'ma say in the intro?
Hahaha
You want me to say somethin' so bad
(Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT)
Can you, please?

Think you the shit, bitch?
You not even the fart (grrah)
I be goin' hard (grrah)
I'm breakin' they hearts, like
Bitches be quick, but I'm quicker (like)
Bitches be thick, but I'm thicker (like)
She could be rich, but I'm richer (damn)

Take-takin' her man (takin' her man)
Don't give a fuck (don't give a fuck)
Out in the Yams (out in the Yams)
And I'm keepin' one tucked (keepin' one tucked)
I make me some jams (I make me some jams)
Unlocked that advance (unlock that advance)
I said four hundred bands (I said four hundred bands)
Just to do my lil' dance (grrah)
Bitch, I'm a brand (like)
Bitch, I'm a baddie, I get what I want (damn)
All in Balenci', I look like a bum
I got the jatty, he just wanna hump (hump)
Walk through and start shakin' my hips
I'ma dip when I stack all my chips (like)
Strip a dummy, I want the whole 'fit
I got a French nigga sendin' me tips, grrah

Think you the shit, bitch?
You not even the fart (grrah)
I be goin' hard (grrah)
I'm breakin' they hearts, like
Bitches be quick, but I'm quicker (like)
Bitches be thick, but I'm thicker (like)
She could be rich, but I'm richer (damn)

His bitch at home playin' dress-up (huh?)
She must've thought she could catch up (grrah)
I got my foot on they necks, I can't let up (grrah)
She all on the floor, told her, "Get up" (get up)
She my son, but I ain't her mammy (I ain't her mammy)
Bitches can't stand me (bitches can't stand me)
Eat through my panties (eat through my panties)
Hard knock life, no Annie
I need a vacay, I'm losin' my tan (damn)
I'd lose anything before my man
I'm a pretty bitch, I don't like fightin'
On the beat, I'm goin' Super Saiyan (grrah)
I said, "Mirror, mirror, who the fairest?" (Huh?)
Leave a bum nigga lookin' embarrassed (like)
Spent a hundred-fifty on some carats (grrah)
That shit cray like them niggas in Paris

Think you the shit, bitch?
You not even the fart (grrah)
I be goin' hard (grrah)
I'm breakin' they hearts, like
Bitches be quick, but I'm quicker (like)
Bitches be thick, but I'm thicker (like)
She could be rich, but I'm richer (damn)
