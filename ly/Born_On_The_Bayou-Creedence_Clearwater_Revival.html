		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now when I was just a little boy 
Standin' to my daddy's knee
My Poppa said, "Son, don't let the man getcha, do what he done to me"
'Cause he'll get ya 
'Cause he'll get ya now, now

And I can remember the Fourth of July 
Runnin' through the backwood bay
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin' 
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, Lord, Lord

Wish I were back on the Bayou 
Rollin' with some Cajun Queen
Wishin' I were a fast freight train
Oh, just a-chooglin' on down to New Orleans

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, em, em, em
Born on the Bayou
Do it, do it, do it, do it

Oh, get back boy

And I can remember the Fourth of July 
Runnin' through the backwood bay
And I can still hear my old hound dog barkin' 
Chasin' down a hoodoo there
Chasin' down a hoodoo there

Born on the Bayou
Born on the Bayou, Lord, Lord
Born on the Bayou
Alright, do 
Do it, do it, do it, do it

Mm okay
