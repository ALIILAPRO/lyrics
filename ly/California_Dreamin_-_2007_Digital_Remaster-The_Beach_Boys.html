		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreaming on such a winter's day

Stopped in to a church, I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees and I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming on such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day, yeah
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreaming on such a winter's day

California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming on such a winter's day

California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming on such a winter's day
California dreaming on such a winter's day
California
