		  Girl, I understand why
See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something that I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I love you I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And it's better for me to let it go now, than hold on and hurt you
I've gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think ya gonna change ya
I do but you don't
Think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake
Now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now
To get my shorty back
Oh oh oh oh
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
Without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (let it burn)

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (oh)
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh (can you feel me burnin'?)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh

So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return

When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go
'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over
We knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
