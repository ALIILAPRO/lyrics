		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on
Oh baby don't you want to go
Come on
Oh baby don't you want to go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Come on
Baby don't you want to go
Hidehey
Baby don't you want to go
Back to that same old place
Oh sweet home Chicago

Well, one and one is two
Six and two is eight
Come on baby don't ya make me late
Hidehey
Baby don't you want to go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Come on
Baby don't you want to go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Six and three is nine
Nine and nine is eighteen
Look there brother baby and see what I've seen
Hidehey
Baby don't you want to go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago

Oh come on
Baby don't you want to go
Come on
Baby don't you want to go
Back to that same old place
Sweet home Chicago
