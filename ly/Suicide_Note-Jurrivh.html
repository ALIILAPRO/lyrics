		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To whom this may concern, I'm sorry
If you're reading this now, it's too late
I wish I could've bettered myself sometimes
Maybe then, I wouldn't have died

Just to find some happiness,
Just to find some kind of peace

I wasn't the person you all knew before
An ego I couldn't grasp control over
Scared to find another person to love
'Cause we'll both get hurt in the end

I'm sorry to disappoint you all,
As I crawl back into the dark, just know I love you all
