		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Umm, I know, I know
I'll make em feel silent
Umm, I know, I 
I see the sun rise up at night

Are you not seein' it?
The world's fadin' (uh)
The world's bleedin' 
Let me stain it all

Just watch the city burn
And see me born again 
in hard concrete and ashes

I see fire, too wild to stop it
I see fire, I got em watchin'
I see fire, it's just started

Sparkin'

Watch it

Ooh-ooh
( In the middle of war. The city is devastated, covered with fire. )

 Signal 

Why do we choose a side?
Lie, too many lies
Fight, too many fights (yeah)

They don't see they are blind
We got no where to hide
Now we're on new life

( Running to escape from this broken world. )

I see fire, too wild to stop it
I see fire, I got em watchin'
I see fire, it's just started

Sparkin'

Watch it

Ooh-ooh
( Entering the new world. )

Why do we choose a side?
Lie, too many lies
Fight, too many fights (yeah)

They don't see they are blind
We got no where to hide
Now we're on new life
