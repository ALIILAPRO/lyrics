		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't be technology
So I can turn up your love like some cold machine
Don't feed me scraps from your bed
I won't be the stray coming back just to be fed

I'll be wait
Come and seal the fate, Marie
Just pretend that you want me
To be my babe
To be my babe 
To be my babe 
To be my babe 
To be my babe 
To be my babe 
To be my babe 
To be my babe 
To be my

Well don't be that note I can't hold
Well don't be that joke that I told and told 'til it got old
Don't be that hand 'round my throat so I can't breath
Say you're my friend but why won't you be my family?

And if you break
Just don't tell me
To be my babe

To be my dream
Tell me you know what I mean
(Prove me wrong)
You set on me but, you are not the sun
You are not the sun
(How do they know where I am?)

(Burn it down)
Outside your cold lips again
You set on me but, you are not the sun
You are not the sun
You are not the sun

So let's pretend that you love me
And be my bait
To be my bait
