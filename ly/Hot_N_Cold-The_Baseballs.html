		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woooh, alright
2, 3, 4!

You're hot, you're cold

You (you) change your mind (your mind)
Like a girl (a girl) changes clothes (sheewab sheewah)
Yeah you (you), PMS (MS)
Like a bitch (a bitch), I would know (sheewab sheewah)

And you (you) over think (always)
Always speak (always) cryptically (sheewab sheewah)
I should know (know)
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay
But you don't really wanna go
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

We used to be
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery

Used to laugh (to laugh) 'bout nothing (nothing)
Now you're plain (plain) boring (sheewab sheewah)
I should know (know)
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay
But you don't really wanna go
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're hot (uh), you're cold (then you're hot)
You're hot (you're hot), you're cold (you're hot)
You're hot (so cold), you're cold (so cold)
You're hot (yeah), you're cold

Wooh, woooh, yeah, alright
Come on, haha, wooh, yeah come on

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of love bipolar
Stuck on a roller coaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up
You don't really wanna stay
But you don't really wanna go
'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down

You're hot, you're cold
You're hot, you're cold
You're hot, you're cold
You're hot, yeah
