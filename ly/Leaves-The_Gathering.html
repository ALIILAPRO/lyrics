		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I close your eyes with my mouth
Now you don't see anything
But you feel my breath all over
I can feel you too

Although I don't really know you
I don't really care

Cry with me make my day
Tomorrow all will be gone
All the sweetness and all the fun
No, I don't wanna know...

Although I don't really know you
I don't really care

Now that you're gone I don't know
How to really feel inside
Baring the hope to see you again
Guess I never will

Although I don't really know you
Yes, I really care
