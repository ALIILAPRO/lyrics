		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy man, if you got your motherfuckin' pepper steppers on, man
Tie them hoes up tight 
'Til where you got no circulation in your ankles (you can't even walk, nigga)
'Cause, 'cause vibe to the song, man
If you got your shit on, look (for real)

Ayy, if you got that shit on, take it off
Bitch, vibe to the song, from the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop, put this on TikTok
No, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop, put this on TikTok

Flip, flip, flip, run a nigga out his flip-flops
Flop, flop, flop, crack a bitch off a TikTok
Rock, rock, rock, don't stop 
Like you runnin' from the cop, cop, cops
Let this thing pop, pop at the opp, opp, opp
I just got the drop, drop at a nigga drop-drop (drop, drop)
Stop and roll, grab the pole, let me know what you know

If you got that shit on
Bitch, vibe to the song, from the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop, put this on TikTok
No, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop, put this on TikTok

Ayy, do your stuff, pick it up
Drop it down to the ground
Round for round, pound for pound
Make a sound like this sound
Round of applause for the cost
Don't worry what it cost, Blueface, baby, I'm a boss
If I lost, take a loss
Get it back, got a crack
Lift that ass with a jack
Put a bitch on her back
That's a fact, I'm a mack
She gon' do it for a stack
Stack it up, stack it up, grey cup, do your stuff
Pussy wet like a tub
We gon' do it in the shower for an hour

From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop, put this on TikTok
No, not like that, like this, watch
From the left to the right
From the front to the back then it's back to the right
To the left, mop it up, clean it up
Grey cup, do your stuff
Take a sip then you dip with the hip-hop, put this on TikTok (TikTok)
