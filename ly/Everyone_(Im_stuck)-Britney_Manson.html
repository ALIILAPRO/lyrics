		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you looking for someone
Something that you never knew
Your vision is like a gun 
I am killed by these two 

While I follow you around
you don’t even notice me 
Why as always your choice is
Everyone who’s not me 

EVERYONE 
Who’s not me
ANYONE 
Just someone other 
EVERYONE 
I am not 
ANYONE
You’re undercover

EVERYONE 
Except me
it’s doesn’t matter
You are 
Not my stepbrother 
but I’m stuck

Do you know, its not okay
To Settle for forbidden love
It’s not your special way
You’re just an idiot 

Why you prefer to be used?
I could give you everything 
Why as always your choice is
Everyone who’s not me 

EVERYONE 
Who’s not me
ANYONE 
Just someone other 
EVERYONE 
I am not 
ANYONE
You’re undercover

EVERYONE 
Except me
it’s doesn’t matter
You are 
Not my stepbrother 

So starting from here Just tell me now
Who are you really And who am I 

This is the moment to speak a truth
Im still loving you 

can i tell you some truth
i'm still loving you
have i cross this borderline
i just want you to be a mine
