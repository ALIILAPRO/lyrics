		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darling, I've been having dark dreams
They come home to haunt me
I can't seem to let them go
Darling, I've been having sad dreams
I don't know where I've been
But I know what I've gone to

How about we play a game?
I know you'll like it, ooh
You stay as far as you can
Before they get to you
I may seem crazy but
It's only 'cause I am
Before they capture your mind
Run, run, run, run

Run
I'm tired but I can't sleep
'Cause they're waiting for me
These bad dreams are more than true
And they'll get you
And they'll get you, ooh

Darling, I've been having weird dreams
I don't know what they mean
But I know I don't want to
Darling, this is getting scary
Why can't I stop shaking?
I hope you don't see them
Glances, all I see are glances
Left and right, they like it
When they know I'm anxious
Shadows, all I see are shadows
Hiding where the wind blows
And where my mind got torn

How about we play a game?
I know you'll like it, ooh
You stay as far as you can
Before they get to you
I may seem crazy but
It's only 'cause I am
Before they live in your mind
Run, run, run

Run
They will follow me 'til I can't breathe
And I'm begging for mercy on mine, oh
Run
Run
I'm tired but I can't sleep
'Cause they're waiting for me
These bad dreams are more than true
And they'll get you
And they'll get you, ooh
And they'll get you
Oh, oh, oh
