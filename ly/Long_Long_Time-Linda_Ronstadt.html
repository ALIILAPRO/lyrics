		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love will abide
Take things in stride
Sounds like good advice
But there's no one at my side 
And time washes clean love's wounds unseen
That's what someone told me
But I don't know what it means

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time

Caught in my fears
Blinking back the tears
I can't say you hurt me
When you never let me near
And I never drew one response from you
All the while you fell all over girls you never knew

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think it's gonna hurt me
For a long long time 

Wait for the day you'll go away
Knowing that you warned me
Of the price I'd have to pay
And life's full of flaws
Who knows the cause?
Living in the memory of a love that never was

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and change your mind
And I think I'm gonna miss you
For a long long time

'Cause I've done everything I know
To try and make you mine
And I think I'm gonna love you
For a long long time
