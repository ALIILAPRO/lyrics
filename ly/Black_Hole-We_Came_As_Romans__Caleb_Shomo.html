		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Floating free suspended aimlessly
Emptiness, but I don't feel a thing
As soon as I turn around
Convinced that I'm safe and sound
Feel both my feet on the ground
I fall into a black hole in my head
Reach into the darkness for what's left
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
Black hole

The other side, another life
Chasing the great unknown
I'll never know the afterglow
'Cause I can't let it go
As soon as I turn around
Convinced that I'm safe and sound
Feel both my feet on the ground
I fall into a black hole in my head
Reach into the darkness for what's left
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
Black hole

Go, I

As soon as I turn around
Convinced that I'm safe and sound
Feel both my feet on the ground
I fall into a black hole in my head
Reach into the darkness for what's left
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
I fall into a black hole in my head
Sinking in the words I left unsaid
I'm fighting the gravity
It's pulling the worst part out of me
Black hole, black hole
Black hole, black hole
