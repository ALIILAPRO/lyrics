		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A-Team, A-Team
Please don't try to play us
A-Team, aw, A-Team, A-Team
Please don't try to play us
A-Team, aw, A-Team

Call my B up, call Sherita
Let's link up, ain't no days off
'Less I'm paid off, these niggas play soft
We just play ball
A-Team, won't you sign up
Join my roster, you a scholar
A-Team, know you ready
My right hand steady, coach you if you let me
A-Team, got that A1
A1 steak sauce, aw can't take loss
A-Team, join my FIFA
Roll my weed up, keep my D up
Aw, A-Team

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (A)

When I back off the curb
In back of the back the Batmobile heard
I'm back on alert
I'm back what's the word
I'm back what's the word
I'm back in the third
They back on my mind, they back on my nerves
Can't take back the time so I'm back, back, back spending
I'm back on the splurge, I'm back on the splurge
They jump when I jump out then jump in and swerve swerve (Yeah, yeah)
It's halftime gon' show that
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm a dog you know that
Can't be from New Jersey how you throw back

A-Team, A-Team
Please don't try to play us
A-Team, aw, A-Team, A-Team
Please don't try to play us
A-Team, aw, A-Team
