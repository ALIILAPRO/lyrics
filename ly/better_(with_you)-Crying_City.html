		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Head's still beating from things I never said
Planned on leaving, yet here i am again

I shouldn't believe
But I'm stuck in your hold
There's something in your eyes that feels like home
Apologies, for flooding your phone
I never was meant to be alone

Be
Better when I'm with you
Better that I'm the fool
Never wanted something new
Always knew it's you

Rather be used by you
Never really knew the rules
Tried to match your every mood
Tried to be like you

Beat up
Tired out
I'm lost in this fleeing crowd
I wanted so bad to stand out

I shouldn't believe
But I'm stuck in your hold
There's something in your eyes that feels like home
Please let me be
Just give me one day
I hope it's okay to be

Better when I'm with you
Better that I'm the fool
Never wanted something new
Always knew it's you

Rather be used by you
Never really had a clue
Tried to match your every mood
Tried to be like you
