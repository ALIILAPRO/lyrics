		  Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh

Knock me down, all the demons creepin' in, oh
Another round tradin' shots with my ego
Runnin', can't help me now
Your chains only drag me down

I've battled hard with the face in the mirror
Every scar makes me dig down deeper
Push it 'til there's nothin' more
'Cause I'm stronger than I was before

It's time to stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up

Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears
Make the pain taste sweeter

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer

Feel the pulse in my veins like a fighter
I'm the rush like the heat from the fire
Nothing can stop me now
I'll scream it 'til my lungs give out, oh

It's time to stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up

Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears
Make the pain taste sweeter

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer

Stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
Show me what you're made of

It's time to stand up, stand up
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
Show me what you're made of

It's time to stand up, stand up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Show me what you're made of

It's time to stand up, stand up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Show me what you're made of
Hands up, hands up
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)

Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
Blood, sweat, tears
Make the pain taste sweeter

(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Fight the fear
Fight the fear
(Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
Rise up from the ground
Gonna make you a believer
