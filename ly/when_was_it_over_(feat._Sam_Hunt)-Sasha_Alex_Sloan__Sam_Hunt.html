		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm-hm-hm

Was it that night you didn't ask where I had been?
Was it that fight we didn't have when I came in?
Was it the first time that you saw me drunk?
Second time that I said I'm sorry
Third time that I didn't call
Stayed out and missed your party
That time I met your friends I was indifferent
The way you're acting's got me questioning

When was it over for you?
When was it over?
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me
It's still not over for me

When I didn't ask if you were okay after a fight with your mom
And last time I stayed over at your place and you woke up alone
Was it the first time you pulled away?
Second time that we drove to Texas
Third time we ran into one of my random exes
So, was it ever real or was it all pretend?
The way you're acting's got me wonderin'

When was it over for you?
When was it over? (When was it over?)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me
It's still not over for me

I'm still holdin' onto you
But I know you're already gone
I'm still wakin' up to you
I've been holdin' on for too long

When was it over for you?
When was it over? Oh (when was it over?)
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
Tell me, when was it over for you?
When was it over? Oh
When was the moment you knew
That you were gonna walk out eventually?
It's still not over for me

I'm still holdin' onto you
But I know you're already gone
It's still not over for me
I'm still wakin' up to you
I've been holdin' on for too long

(When was it over?)
(Mm-hm-hm)
(Mm-hm-hm)
