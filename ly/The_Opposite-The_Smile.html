		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What will now become of us? (What will now become of us?)
The straw is coming out of us (straw is coming out of us)
It goes back and forth followed by a question mark
Lit up like a firework (lit up like a firework)

Can we have a next contestant please?
In this logical absurdity (logical absurdity)
I'm quitting unexpectedly (quitting unexpectedly)
Opposites attract (opposites attract)
The ashen dozen, pockets full of emptiness

He doesn't mean anything
He doesn't mean anything
He doesn't mean anything
He doesn't mean anything
Anything at all

Objects coming near us (objects coming near us)
Sometimes can appear too close (appear too close)
It goes back and forth, followed by a question mark
Opposites attract (opposites can work it out)
Lit up like a firework (lit up like a firework)
Elected billionaires (happens to the best of us)
