		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see your deep blue eyes, 
Calling into mine. 
I see your deep blue eyes, 
Deeper than the ocean. 

My head is filled with dread,
But you calling me back over. 
Thought it was done and said, 
But you promise it's not over. 

And you say, 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 
Like, 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 

I see your deep blue eyes, 
Calling into mine. 
I see your deep blue eyes, 
Deeper than the ocean. 

I know if I don't leave now, 
Imma never leave here. 
Always call me back, always call me back. 
I know if I don't leave now, 
Imma never leave here. 
Always call me back, always call me back. 

And you say, 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 
Like, 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 

I see your deep blue eyes, 
Calling into mine. 
I see you deep blue eyes, 
Deeper than the ocean. 

I see your deep blue eyes, 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 
I see your deep blue eyes, 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me? 
Uh, don't you wanna be around me?
