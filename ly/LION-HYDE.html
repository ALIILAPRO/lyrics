		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a lion in a freak show with a twisted point of view
I feel like I'm living in lies and I don't know what to do
So is this, as good as it gets, gotta take my chance to know
I can't wait until it's too late, I was made for so much more

Oh no, nobody's safe now
Lock me down but I'm gonna break free
I'm taking back the night

I've been looking for a reason I've been searching for my truth
We only know what they wanna show
It's a game we we're made to lose
So is this, as good as it gets, gotta take my chance to know
I can't wait until it's too late, I was made for so much more

Oh no, nobody's safe now
Lock me down but I'm gonna break free
I'm taking back the night

Oh no, nobody's safe now
Lock me down but I'm gonna break free
I'm taking back the night

This time let the lesson be
Lock us down and we're gonna get free
This time let the lesson be
Lock us down and we're gonna get free

This time let the lesson be
Lock us down and we're gonna get free
This time let the lesson be
Lock us down and we're gonna get free

Oh no, nobody's safe now
Lock me down but I'm gonna break free
I'm taking back the night

Oh no, nobody's safe now
Lock me down but I'm gonna break free
I'm taking back the night
