		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The only place I call home
You are
Every hope and dream I've ever had
You are
In other lifetimes without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you

Like a cool breeze on a summer day
You are
Like a brightest star up in the sky
Girl you shine
Keep making me wanting more
Girl you are what I am looking for

I love you (love you oh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
I love you, you're my only one

I love you (I do)
Love you still I always will
I want you to know how I feel
And all the promises that I'll fulfill
My only one
My only lovе

The only place I call home
You arе
Every hope and dream I've ever had
You are
In other lifetimes without any doubt
I'll keep choosing you

Like a cool breeze on a summer day
You are
Like a brightest star up in the sky
Girl you shine
Keep making me wanting more
Girl you are what I am looking for

Oh I love you (love you oh)
I love you in every universe
You'll always be the first
I love you, you're my only one
I love you (I do)
Love you still I always will
I want you to know how I feel
And all the promises that I'll fulfill

My only one
My only love
My only one
My only love
