		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Toss and turn all night
It's getting intricate
I'm on my knees I'll fight
Until I feel a bit
I might OD this time
The kill is intimate
Oh no
Oh no
And now I don't hear no more love in your breathe
We dance until angles knows every step
They hold my regret like guns to my neck
And light them all up like my cigarettes
How would I know
You would let go
Oh no my rope broke
Ice to the bone
Heart made of stone
Late to the show woah
Baby I know
Coming in close
You need your space though
But I can't breathe
Helmet it leaks
Toss and turn all night
It's getting intricate
I'm on my knees I'll fight
Until I feel a bit
I might OD this time
The kill is intimate
Oh no
Oh no
And now I don't hear no more love in your breathe
We dance until angles knows every step
They hold my regret like guns to my neck
And light them all up like my cigarettes
Nah nah nah nah nah oh
Nah nah nah nah nah oh
Nah nah nah nah nah oh
Nah nah nah nah nah oh
Yea
Tell me you love it when everything colder
The strict paranoia of numbing the loaner
Heart getting borrowed by all those who know you
You call those the photos of past rebel soldiers
Fight for a cause that you argue is love
Gun in the glove driving by all the lust
Getting too deadly
The sins 7 heavy
Ascend your forgetting
The pain never ending
I don't need none
Loner who numb
Come and entice me
Falling in love
thoughts of the trust
Run away hiding
Follow the truth
Lies in a suit
Oh how inviting
Atmosphere filled
Poison you feel
Toss and turn all night
It's getting intricate
I'm on my knees I'll fight
Until I feel a bit
I might OD this time
The kill is intimate
Oh no
Oh no
And now I don't hear no more love in your breathe
We dance until angles knows every step
They hold my regret like guns to my neck
And light them all up like my cigarettes
Nah nah nah nah nah oh
Nah nah nah nah nah oh
