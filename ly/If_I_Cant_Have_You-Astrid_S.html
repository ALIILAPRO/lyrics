		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never got to your dad
But maybe someone else will now
I guess that we proved him right
He didn't think we'd work out
I wish you cheated on me
Just so I could have a better reason to
Leave you behind

No one can have you
If I can't have you
No one can touch you
Like I used to
How can I leave without looking back?
How can I breathe when it hurts like that?
No one can have you
If I can't have you
If I can't have you

You never came to my shows, you
Were always good at excuses
And I was too proud to let it show
That it hurt but the truth is
Now I miss all the fights and the lies
That I never even liked about you
And I
Mhm

No one can have you
If I can't have you
No one can touch you
Like I used to
How can I leave without looking back?
How can I breathe when it hurts like that?
No one can have you
If I can't have you
If I can't have you
