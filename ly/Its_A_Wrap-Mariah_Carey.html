		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shoo do, shoo do, shoo do

Yet another early mornin'
And you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See I know you seen me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead

Let me take a breath (let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you F'd up, it's over
'Cause when it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot, scoo do do doot, baby

It's a wrap for you, baby (scoo do do do do, scoo do do do do, baby)
(It's a wrap)
It's a wrap for you, boy (it's a wrap)
Oh, baby
(Ooh-wee-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-wee-ooh)

If I ever misrepresented
My self-image, then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent (acquiescent)
But I've learned my lesson, boy, you're sorry (boy, you're sorry)
Bum-bum-bum-bum, out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich

Let me take a breath (let me take a breath)
And regain my composure
Told you one more time (told you one more time)
If you F'd up it's over
'Cause when it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo do do doot, scoo do do doot, baby

It's a wrap for you, baby (scoo do do do do, scoo do do do do, baby)
(It's a wrap)
It's a wrap for you, boy (It's a wrap)
Oh, baby

Put all of your sh- in the elevator
It's goin' down like a denominator
Tryna keep holdin' on, holdin' on, boy, let me go
You gon' wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot, you ain't comin' back
It's the Martini, I mean it, baby

It's a wrap
(It's a wrap)
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong (you're dead wrong)
So just scoo do do doot, scoo do do doot, baby
Boy, I ain't checkin' the gate
It's wrap, yeah, I told you, I told you (scoo do do do do, scoo do do do do, baby)
It's wrap, if you act up one more time, it's over 
It's wrap, so get up out my face, I'm hungover (so just scoo do do doot, scoo do do doot, baby)
Been sitting here all night, leave me alone (scoo do do do do, scoo do do do do, baby)
Since quarter to three I've been drinking Patron
Watch the credits roll, it's a wrap
