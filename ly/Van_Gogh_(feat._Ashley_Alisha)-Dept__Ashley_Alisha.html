		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got something like a funny feeling
Stare at self portraits 'til I cry
Take it away, take it away
Just take it away
A cafe terrace gleaming in the nightime
Where I sit and write my mind
Don't take it away, take it away
Don't take it away

Wish you could see what I see babe
Before it really is too late
I know sometimes it's hard to take a step away
If I could gather some words to explain
It's almost like light shines through your pain
Emotion I never knew awake
But at the time I didn't know
One in a million things you showed
Straight from your heart miles apart
Who was it for?
I got something like a funny feeling
Stare at self portraits 'til I cry
Take it away, take it away
Just take it away
A cafe terrace gleaming in the nightime
Where I sit and write my mind
Don't take it away, take it away
Don't take it away

I wouldn't say I have misfortune
'Cause there's nothing I would change
I'm just waiting for my moment
But is it in vain (is it in vain)
And every piece that I've been painting
Should I throw them all away
The night cafe
Flower vases, bring me pain
I wrote my pain to what you hear
But I know that they don't care
But I know that you don't care
I'm sorry for whatever I put you through
It's not easy putting down
All of your love on a canvas but you
I got something like a funny feeling
Stare at self portraits 'til I cry
Take it away, take it away
Just take it away
A cafe terrace gleaming in the nightime
Where I sit and write my mind
Don't take it away, take it away
Don't take it away
