		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted
I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted

I took up too much space when I was next to you
But now it's just me all alone in this damn room
Can't sleep imagining the things I'd say to you (won't say to you)

I need help, lost myself
Don't know who's in the mirror
Is this hell? Hear you yell
But there's nobody here
Feel unwell, can you tell?
That I need you in my dream
Now you're here, now you're here

I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted
I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted

My heart racing, I swear you're standing next to me
My thoughts are overcrowded, my room's empty
The more I search, the more I lose clarity (clarity)

I need help, lost myself
Don't know who's in the mirror
Is this hell? Hear you yell
But there's nobody here
Feel unwell, can you tell?
That I need you in my dream
Now you're here (now you're here)

I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted
I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted
I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted
I'm haunted
Haunted
Haunted
