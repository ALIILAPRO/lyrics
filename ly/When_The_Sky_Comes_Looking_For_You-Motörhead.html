		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What are you going to do now?
Out in the lonely times
How will you ever get through now?
Remembering all of your crimes

What will you do, what will you do
Who do you think would attempt a rescue?
Dreaming, screaming, knocked right out of your shoes
Who would you blame, who could you sue
If the sky came looking for you?

How are you gonna live now
Out in the lonely fields?
What do you have to give now
I wonder how do you feel?

What will you say, what will you say
What will you say when god turns away?
Running, jumping, praying it wasn't true
How would you look, without a clue
When the sky comes looking for you?

Looks like the same old story
Looks like the same old game
Don't think you're bound for glory
I think you might be insane

What do you think, what do you think
What do you think with your nerves on the brink?
Dogging, weaving, trying to find a way through
Gonna be bad, whatever you do
When the sky comes looking for you
