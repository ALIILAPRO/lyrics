		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can say I'm mad you can say I'm crazy
But I'm only as bad as the maker who made me

Sittin' in the darkness lying in the church
Deaf man's silence blind man's search

Tear drop falling memory recalling
Ghost in your dreams in your secret recordings

Mad man's match there's a lump in your throat
Be under your mattress hole in your coat

Singer with the sound down
Winter on the come down
Poets in the overcoat looking for a sun tan
On his birthday prisoner on his first date
Tired of the new wave

I rise to meet you
As your trust is always a shame
All this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints on the path in which I came
I'm the beast and your the beast in me

(Which way are we going?
The doors close in an hour)

You can say I'm mad you can say I'm crazy
But I'm only as bad as the maker who made me

Needle for the user the pain in your chest
Beggar and the chooser the wicked man's rest

Fear in the stuntman sneer in the playground
Bottle in the hand of a dirty old drunk man

Leaf falling autumn calling
Dark clouds forming

I rise to meet you 
As your trust dissolves to shame
Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints
Off the path from which I came
I'm the beast in you, the beast in me

Bite my nails
Right down to the skin
Where one trust ends and another lie begins

Patch over holes in my weakened heart
Which angels hold
And devils pull apart

I'm the beast in you
The beast in me
The bitterness, the jealousy
The part of you that never sleeps

(Are you my angel?
Will we walk all night through solitary streets?)

And you hardly can imagine
What you never had before
And the reason that you're given
Still leaves you wanting more

And you hardly can imagine
What you never had before
And the reason that you're given
Still leaves you wanting more

I rise to meet you yeah
As your trust dissolves to shame
Oh, this innocence has turned and lost its way
Retrace the footprints
Off the path from which I came
I'm the beast in you, the beast in me
The bitterness, the jealousy
The part of you that never sleeps
