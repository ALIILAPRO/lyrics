		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thinking about you
Thinking about you
Constantly thinking about you

I've been thinking too much about you
See the sunset with no sleep at all
Constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all

Thinking about you
Thinking about you

I've been thinking too much about you
I've been staring at the floor
I've listened to all the tunes I love
That make me feel quite blue

Thinking about you

I've thinking too much about you
See the sunset with no sleep at all
Constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all

I've been thinking too much about you
I've been staring at the floor
I've listened to all the tunes I love
That makes me feel quite blue

I've been thinking too much about you
Staring at the floor
I've listened to all the tunes I love
That makes me feel quite blue

I've thinking too much about you
See the sunset with no sleep at all
And I'm constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all

There are people standing in line
There are people queuing up from behind
There are people standing in line

Constantly thinking about you
And I can't get through this at all

Constantly thinking about you
