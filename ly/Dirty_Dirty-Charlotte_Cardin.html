		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see the way, I see the way, the way you want her
You're not easily impressed
Baby, I got more under my dress
But you won't twitch

I see she's got, I see she's got some thing I don't
You know I'm jealous in my head
'Cause you'd look so good in my bed
But you really like the bitch

So I can cry for my age, my life and my face
And I will wash off all the dirty
Dirty thoughts I had about you
And I can cry 'cause I got so much she has not
And I will wash off all the dirty
Dirty thoughts I had about you now
Wash off all the dirty, dirty thoughts I had about you

Maybe I'm young, maybe I'm too young to understand this
But you're a mess in your own ways
Let's mess it up together, babe
I'm what you need

Who could I, oh, who could I be just to get to you?
You should be ripping off my gown
Turning me on, you just send me down, down on my knees 
Pretty little tease

So I can cry for my age, my life and my face
And I will wash off all the dirty, dirty thoughts I had about you 
And I can cry 'cause I got so much she has not
And I will wash off all the dirty, dirty thoughts I had about you now
Wash off all the dirty, dirty thoughts I had about
And I can cry for my age 
My life and my face 
I will wash off all the dirty
Dirty thoughts I had about you
And I can cry 'cause I got so much she has not
And I will wash off all the dirty, dirty thoughts I had about you now
Wash off all the dirty, dirty thoughts I had about you
