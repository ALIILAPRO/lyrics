		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dutch kids huff balloons in the parking lot
The Golden Arches illuminate the business park
I eat myself to death, feed the corporate machine 
I watch the movies, recite every line and scene
God bless America and all of its allies 
I'm not the first to live with wool over my eyes

I am so blissfully unaware of everything
Kids in Gaza are bombed and I'm just out of it
The tensions of the world are rising higher
We're probably due another war with all this ire 
I'm not smart enough to change a thing 
I have no answers, only questions, don't you ask a thing

All the silver tongued suits and cartoons that rule my world
Are saying it's a high time for hypersonic missiles 
When the bombs drop darlin' can you say that you've lived your life
Oh, this is a high time for hypersonic missiles

Cities lie like tumors all across the world
A cancer eating mankind hidden in our blindside
They say I'm a nihilist 
'Cause I can't see any decent rhyme or reason 
For the life of you and me
But I believe in what I'm feeling
And I'm firing for you
This world is gonna end
But 'til then, I'll give you everything I have
I'll give you everything I have

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh (come on)

All the silver tongued suits and cartoons that rule my world
Are saying it's a high time for hypersonic missiles 
When the bombs drop darlin' can you say that you've lived your life
Oh, this is a high time for hypersonic missiles
They all do the same, only their names change honey
You can join their club if you're born in to money 
It's a high time for hypersonic missiles
You know this is a high time for hypersonic missiles
You know this is a high time for hypersonic missiles
Oh, this is a high time for hypersonic missiles
