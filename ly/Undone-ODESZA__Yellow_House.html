		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no time to hide from the sun
There's no time to come undone
That's easier said than done
Just pick your poison and run

I'm struggling to find out where I stand
I keep wrestling with God and with man
Tryna forge a little life in-between
A man can only but dream

The time's come to lay it on the line
When meaning seems so hard to find
It all weighs heavy on the mind
It's easier to leave it behind
There's no time to hide from the sun
There's no time to come undone
That's easier said than done
Just pick your poison and run

Life can't be won, can't be tamed
The point of it all goes unnamed
The lost and the gained weigh the same
When returned to dust or to flame

I'm struggling to find out where I stand
I keep wrestling with God and with man
Tryna forge a little life in-between
A man can only but dream

The time's come to lay it on the line
When meaning seems so hard to find
It all weighs heavy on the mind
It's easier to leave it behind
There's no time to hide from the sun
There's no time to come undone
That's easier said than done
Just pick your poison and run
