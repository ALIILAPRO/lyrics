		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I've got a thing or two to say
You see of late, my love
Things just haven't been the same
Oh but I don't wanna be too rude
I don't wanna cause a scene
But all these boys are next to you
You're playing games in front of me
And I don't want to keep on playing

Oh how the world is crashing down, my love
Angel of Libra, Angel of Libra
I need you more than ever now, my love
I was never good at sharing anyway
No I can't bear to be away from you
So are you coming back home?

You see, baby, I'm lost for words with all your apathy
See I've committed seven deadly sins
And I would do it all again for you and me
Oh but my insecurities have left me green
This love we had is wearing thin
And I just want to have you back again

Oh how the world is crashing down, my love
Angel of Libra, Angel of Libra
Oh I was never good at sharing anyway
No I can't bear to be away from you
So are you coming back home?

My arms are open wide and never closing for you
Your pale blue eyes have left me frozen for you

Oh how the world is crashing down, my love
So are you coming back home?
It's how the world is crashing down, my love
So are you coming back home?
No I can't bear, I can't bear to be away from you
So are you coming back home?
Are you coming back home?
