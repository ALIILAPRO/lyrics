		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that we ain't got the style
We ain't got the class
We ain't got the tunes that's goin to put us on the map
And I'm a phony in disguise
Trying to make the radio
I'm an anti-social anarchist, I sound like so and so
They say I'm just a stupid kid
Another crazy radical
Rock and roll is dead I probably should've stayed in school
Another Generation X who somehow slipped up through the cracks
Oh they'd love to see me fall but I'm already on my back

And it goes in one ear
And right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know I never bother
I goes in one ear
And right out the other
People talkin' shit
They can kiss the back of my hand

Now I know I'm not a saint
I been a sinner all my life
I ain't tryin to hide me flaws
I'd rather keep them in the light
They wanna criticize, scrutinize
Cast another stone
Burn me at the stake and sit and watch it from their throne
They say the devil is my pal
I do a lotta drugs
The crowd will only like me if they're really fuckin' drunk
They think they know my thoughts
But they don't know the least
If they listened to the words they'd find the message tucked beneath

But it goes in one ear
And right out the other
People talkin shit even though they never bother
It goes in one ear
And right out the other
People talkin' shit, they can kiss the back of my hand

(You hear that)
(You hear what's coming? Oh you better run for the hills)
('Cause we're coming to your town, and we're gonna burn that mother fucker down)

Here's the moral to the story
We don't do it for the glory
We don't do it for the money
We don't do it for the fame
So all the critics who despise us, go ahead and criticize us
It's your tyranny that drives us, adds the fire to our flames

And it goes
In one ear
And right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know we'll never bother
It goes in one ear
And right out the other
I'm only playing music 'cause you know I fucking love it
It goes in one ear
And right out the other
People talkin' shit but you know we'll never bother
It goes in one ear, and right out the other
People talkin' shit well you know they can kiss the back of my hand
