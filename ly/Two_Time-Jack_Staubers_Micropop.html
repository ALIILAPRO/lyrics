		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey (give it a little attack-tack)
(Work)
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)
(Listen, oh)
(Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)

We could leave the lights on, sun-tan (bo-bow-bo-bo)
We could get lunch, aw, man (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
I think that I like you (you do?), Yeah
But something bugs me 'bout the way you lick your envelopes, so-

I'm out on the block again (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
So hopped up that I can't pretend
Two time (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa), stay friends
Problem that you can't defend (oh)
Hands up, feel okay (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Whose heart could I break today?
Two time (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa), stay friends
Problem that you can't defend

Slip me in your pocket
Chicka-chew the way out
Oh man, was that your last piece of gum? (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
(Come on) But we both wanted some
I know, and you can get in the hole too
ER, what can you say?
I never read the package anyway (haha, oh)

I'm out on the block again (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
So hopped up that I can't pretend
Two time (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa), stay friends
Problem that you can't defend (oh)
Hands up, feel okay (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Whose heart could I break today?
Two time (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa), stay friends
Problem that you can't defend

I'm out on the block again (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
So hopped up that I can't pretend
Two time (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa), stay friends
Problem that you can't defend (oh)
Hands up, feel okay (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa)
Whose heart could I break today?
Two time (pa-pa-pa-pa-pa), stay friends
Problem that you can't defend
