		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the clouds surround you
And you're lost in the dark
When the sun won't come
And there's rain in your heart
When you need somebody
And there is nobody who understands
Yeah, oh
Wrap these arms around you
Take hold of my hand
Never have to feel alone
Oh, you know where I am
Any time you call me
As fast as lightening 
I'll be there by your side
I'll be standing by

I'll come runnin'
You got someone
I'll, I'll always be there, yeah

I'll love away your troubles
When you're feeling low down
I'll be the friend you need
When a friend can't be found
I'll be the rock you lean on
When this old world just leans too hard on you
Yeah, oh
You just send a signal
I'll send you my heart
Never have to be afraid
When you're wrapped in my arms
Any time you need me
The widest ocean couldn't keep me away, no
Just call out my name

I'll come runnin'
You got someone
I'll, I'll always be there, yeah

Let me tell ya
I got something
You can trust in
I'll, I'll always be there, yeah

I'll come runnin'
I'll come runnin'
I'll come runnin', baby
Come runnin'
I'll come runnin'
Come runnin', baby

When you feel down
I will be around, arms open wide
I'll be standing, I'll be standing by

I'll come runnin' (whoa, yeah)
You got someone
I'll, I'll always be there
(Be there for you, baby) yeah

I got something
You can trust in (you can trust in me, baby)
I'll, I'll always be there, yeah

What I'm saying is
I'll come runnin'
I'll come runnin', baby (yeah, baby)
When you need me
You can reach me
(Just dial my heart) yeah
I'll come runnin'
I'll come runnin', baby (I'll come runnin' to you)
When you need me (to you)
You can reach me, yeah (to you)

I got something (I'll come runnin', baby)
You can trust in
I'll, I'll always be there (ohh, yeah, yeah, baby)
