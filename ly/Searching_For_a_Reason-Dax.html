		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No weapon formed against you shall prosper
You are our Light huh

Trust gets you killed, love gets you hurt
Bein' real gets you hated
So tell me what it's worth
I done seen these people change and try
To twist up all my words
I been stuck inside a maze
They say that means that I'm on earth
(LexNour)

If they wanna know my pain
Then they can read it in the verse
If they prayin' on my name
It better be inside a church
Don't need diamonds, don't need chains
I ain't a slave to all these pеrks
I ain't perfect, but it I'm workin'
God, I swear that I'm still
Sеarchin' for a reason
Now I'm drownin' like I'm diving
Off the deep end
Underwater, don't nobody hear me screamin'
I'm surrounded by these money hungry demons

I'm surrounded, so many fakes
I stopped countin'
No gravity, but I'm still grounded
They can't see 'cause they vision is clouded
Man, I feel like I'm walkin' up mountains
My hearts broke, but yes, it's still poundin'
Lost my soul and then went and found it
I hope heaven ain't full or crowded
Hell ain't worth it, I'll scream and shout it
Don't make these people your idols
Forget 'bout all of the followers
Jesus had twelve disciples
If they tell you it's fake
It's 'cause they ain't fought for survival
And when they facin' the judge
They still put they hand on the Bible
Got my faith like a gun and I
Let it off like a rifle
I'll keep speakin' the truth and I
Do not care if it's viral
I ain't changin' for nothin'
Not gettin' trapped in yo' cycle
'Cause I know failure ain't fatal
And that success isn't final
I got love for my enemies
You can check all my vitals
All the negative energy is
A downwarding spiral
You can cancel me, laugh at me
Call me out of my title
It won't break me or shake me, no
I will not show weakness
Is this real life or am I dreamin'?
(Dreamin')
Why are these times so misleadin'? ('Leadin')
I don't see God, but believe Him
(Believe Him)
And I don't need fame, you can keep it

Trust gets you killed, love gets you hurt
Bein' real gets you hated
So tell me what it's worth
I done seen these people change and try
To twist up all my words
I been stuck inside a maze
They say that means that I'm on earth

If you walked inside my shoes
You wouldn't last a day
I ain't got nothin' to lose
By havin' some faith
I ain't got nothin' to prove
To people who hate
So what I'm finna' do is say it again, yeah

Trust gets you killed
(yeah) , love gets you hurt (Okay, okay)
Bein' real gets you hated
So tell me what it's worth
I done seen these people change and try
To twist up all my words
I been stuck inside a maze
They say that means that I'm on earth

If they wanna know my pain then they
Can read it in the verse
If they prayin' on my name
It better be inside a church
Don't need diamonds, don't need chains
I ain't a slave to all these perks
I ain't perfect but it I'm workin'
God, I swear that I'm still
Searchin' for a reason
(Now I'm drownin' like I'm divin'
Off the deep end)
(Underwater, don't nobody hear me screamin')
(I'm surrounded by these money hungry demons)
(Hungry demons)

Dear God protect us from anything that
Wasn't sent by You amen
