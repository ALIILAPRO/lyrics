		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I forget the names from all of the signs 
On the roads, we take on the longest drives
Looking out like I opened my eyes for the first time 
You burned me out I never realized 
I was under your cloud thickest smoke with no fire 
Just hanging around everything had a dull shine 

I've got a lot of practice keeping it all inside 
Maybe that's why everybody thinks I'm blind 
I've already lived too many lives 
Maybe I struggle to keep inside the lines 
I was under your cloud thickest smoke with no fire 
Just hanging around everyone had a dull shine

I never start anything (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
That I couldn't finish (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
So baby if it ends (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
You'll still be forgiven (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's so unrealistic (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
That's what I like about it 

Show me and I will believe it 
I will believe it
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
Show me and I will believe it 
I will believe it
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)

Gonna throw my problems out in the ocean 
Then I'll probably drown when I jump in to save them 
I can't let them down it's just one of the reasons 
Still haven't found out what it is that I'm needing 
Was screaming out loud but my mouth was shut tight
Looking around everything had a dull shine

Everyone just tell me (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then it would be so easy (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Until I try to resist (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
Need a drive-in priest or therapist (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)

Why am I so nervous (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
What the fuck just happened (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
The world's completely lost it 
So baby let's hold on to nothing
Hey hey

Show me and I will believe it 
I will believe it
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
Show me and I will believe it 
I will believe it
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)

Show me and I will believe you 
I will believe it
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
 Hey, hey
(Everything, everything has a dull shine)
Show me and I will believe you
I will believe you (everything, everything has a dull shine)
I will believe it (everything, everything has a dull shine)
