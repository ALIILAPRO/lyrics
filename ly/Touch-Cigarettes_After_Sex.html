		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I missed you and I cried
But I said that I was alright
And I know it's been a while
Since I needed a distraction

'Cause I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I need to stay alive
So sad that I could die

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

And I watched you do a line
That you spread out on the table
I don't need to see you wired
I just wanna see you upside down

I wanna do everything
That you want me to, to tell you the truth
I listen to you cry all night
Through the telephone

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love

Couldn't say you didn't want me there
When we were lyin' in my bed that night
You were acting like a different person
As if, suddenly, you wanted to just be friends
I was hurting so I took a shower
So you couldn't hear me, knowing I had to cry
Sad to know that while my heart was breaking
You were sleeping or just faking

It's leading me on, every time we touch
Leading me on, every time it hurts
Feeling so lonely, 'cause it's not enough
Missin' you only ever since we fell in love
