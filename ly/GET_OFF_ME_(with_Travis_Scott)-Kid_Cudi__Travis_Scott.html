		  Question (Zombie on the track)
What's it called when your music changes the world?
I call it magic (Zombie on the track)
Welcome to Magic City
Everybody leaves with a smile on they face (hahaha)
When wizards collide, things get monumental
Things get legendary, some things may never be the same
This what y'all was waitin' for?
Now watch the competition disappear, poof

Intercept, we go (uh, uh), too bossy (aye)
Bet a nigga cooler than the motherfuckers talkin', too flossy (ayy)
Tell them we ain't trippin' 'bout them ho niggas
Leading the team is somebody in the law (yah)
Keep the money on flow when I'm getting what I need
It's a car, what it cost? I'm raw
Yeah, get it off me, ah
Yeah, get it off me, yeah
Livin' when I'm zooted so often (ah)
This shit lit, get out bad (yeah, yeah)
In fact, I ain't even worried 'cause I'm triple G, hear 'em
Look at the stars, no cap, OG hit em
When I give 'em what I bleed for the fam, yeah, hit 'em

Ooh, the drop, cruise in the drop, hit me
Rollin' rock, too much fresher than y'all, hit me
Bitch, get off me
Bitch, get off me
Bitch-itch, get off (yeah)
Bitch-itch, get off me, off

Bitch, get off me, uh
Bitch, get off me
Bitch, get off me, uh, me
Bitch, get off me, uh
Bitch, get off me, uh
Bitch, get off me

Yeah, okay, tints is off, okay (oh)
Top is off, okay (oh)
Knock it off, okay (yeah)
Not talkin' top when I say, I hit exhaust, decay
Green like moss, diamonds hit like Voss, okay (yeah)
She know all the lay of the land, she know how I get
She know how I'm gettin' my piece
She still don't know 'bout the treats
I keep it, I keep, to find it like hide and go seek
She go out and find me a fee, like sometimes she find me a fee
I keep her right out of the streets and put her right out in the trees, yeah

Ooh, the drop, cruise in the drop, hit me
Rollin' rock, too much fresher than y'all, hit me
Bitch, get off me
Bitch, get off me
Bitch-itch, get off (yeah)
Bitch-itch, get off me, off

Nigga (yeah), we all over (huh)
Tell your friends we murk arenas
Damn, this shit so easy, tell the world, too mega
Phenoms, too big for arenas (woo)
In my backyard, build a bowl wall like Kema
Get hot like a steamer
When you shakin' that ass, you be shaking them demons
En route, bet they wanna come catch me, come, quick seize
So a nigga jumpin' on a cloud (yeah)
But I'm just smokin' weed, give 'em my high screams
Shawty be feelin' my style, grippin' my jeans, fingernails runnin' through my seams
She get high, see dreams, she say things, guess we twins, mami

Ooh, the drop, cruise in the drop, hit me
Rollin' rock, too much fresher than y'all, hit me
Bitch, get off me
Bitch, get off me
Bitch-itch, get off (yeah)
Bitch-itch, get off me, off

Bitch, get off me, uh
Bitch, get off me
Bitch, get off me, uh, me
Bitch, get off me, uh
Bitch, get off me, uh
Bitch, get off me
