		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Errrrr

At
Peace
With all you've prized
Material mind
As you face age
Inevitable our lives will change
Signs of heavy heart
"What if I can't grasp change?"
But you can grasp pain?
That's all you'll find not letting go

I know it's hard
But I promise this
You'll wake up loving every second you exist
So listen please
And free your mind
Cause in time it will be justified

I can tell you first hand when you hold on to the past
I know
It will only bring misery
Find yourself letting go a pain that never lasts
Let go
You'll always have the memories
Why hang on to the burdens that only weigh you down
You deserve to be happy again
Cause I can tell you first hand when you hold on to the past
You'll only find misery

Grief
Pain
And hate
That's all you'll find stuck like this
A life
So
Free
Why stay chained

Cut this out
Sever all the ties from a former self
Breaking down
What breaks you
Cut this out
Everyone who's ever done you wrong and won't change for the world we made
Pain is just something we make
And on the surface we will fake
Everything that we hate
Bringing us back to the ground
We can all come back from the pit we dug our selves
Let go

I know you're scared
But I can swear
You'll forget the times you've screamed out
"Life's not fair"
So listen please god damn it's time
To take back your Fucking life

I can tell you first hand when you hold on to the past
I know
It will only bring misery
Find yourself letting go a pain that never lasts
Let go
You'll always have the memories
Why hang on to the burdens that only weigh you down
You deserve to be happy again
Cause I can tell you first hand when you hold on to the past
You'll only find misery

I can tell you first hand
When you hold on to the past
It will only bring misery
I know it hurts letting go
But the pain will never last
And you'll always have the memories
Why hang on to the burdens that only weigh you down
You deserve to be happy again
Cause I can tell you first hand when you let go of the past
You'll learn to love your life again
