		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

When the union's inspiration
Through the workers' blood shall run
There can be no power greater
Anywhere beneath the sun
Yet what force on earth is weaker
Than the feeble strength of one?
But the union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

It is we who plowed the prairies
Built the cities where they trade
Dug the mines and built the workshops
Endless miles of railroad laid
Now we stand outcast and starving
Mid the wonders we have made
But the union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

They have taken untold millions
That they never toiled to earn
But without our brain and muscle
Not a single wheel can turn
We can break their haughty power
Gain our freedom when we learn
That the union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong

In our hands is placed a power
Greater than their hoarded gold
Greater than the might of atoms
Magnified a thousand-fold
We can bring to birth a new world
From the ashes of the old
For the union makes us strong

Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
Solidarity forever
For the union makes us strong
