Uh-oh

This shit is a knocker, a bopper, a knocker, like choppers
The boppers, they love me, they show up, give topper
The Benjis, the Benzos, the reason I gotta
Then cha-cha, we slid, the reason we got ya
The oppers, the coppers get no love, get nada
The block'll get hotter and hotter and hotter
It's in me, so they envy, try reachin' for the watch-a
The Glock'll go "blakka", go "blakka", and "blakka"

I do this, it's nada, I hit your baby mama
Suckin' them titties like a baby, give me baba
I'm fuckin' on a Iggy, was fuckin' on a Lala
My new bitch give me throat, I call her Lady Gaga
My roster don't let me get messy, like pasta
The movies, I made 'em with bitches, need Oscars
The Gucci, the Louis, the Fendi, the Prada
The Saint, the runners and Balenciagas
The money buy plenty, the pennies, the dollars
The nickels, the dimes came straight from the bottoms
The bottom, the bottom, but the top is where they spot 'em
And when you on the top, all the boppers let you dot 'em
Her daddy went home, now lil' daddy got her
Slut her out proper like NLE Choppa
Got shotters on shotters on shotters on shotters
Wipe a nigga nose like, "Nigga, clean that snot up"

This shit is a knocker, a bopper, a knocker, like choppers
The boppers, they love me, they show up, give topper
The Benjis, the Benzos, the reason I gotta
Then cha-cha, we slid, the reason we got ya
The oppers, the coppers get no love, get nada
The block'll get hotter and hotter and hotter
It's in me, so they envy, try reachin' for the watch-a
The Glock'll go "blakka", go "blakka", and "blakka"

See, no singin', it's an opera, bank on Big Poppa
I don't trust a soul, once you sleep, I gotta watch you
Ayy, when you top me, do it sloppy when I'm tied up
If you a loyal bitch, I get you gifts, yeah, I got you
She tryna hit a nae nae, I'm tryna hear the ah-ah
These hoes thirsty for a nigga, they need wawa
Good pussy, when you inside, it feel like lava
Good morning, woke up to a check, I feel like "haha"
Gettin' cheese enchiladas, the Glock came with lobsters
Chill, 'fore you niggas shellfish and hit your block up
Boy, get your stock up, 'kay, get your knot up
I heard bitch around the name, that's how you know it ain't about us
Left her wet, mop up, let them legs lock up
In a rich nigga mansion where that good head got you
4Hunnid 'til they stop us, but who gon' stop us?
Stop us, stop us, who, us? Not us

This shit is a knocker, a bopper, a knocker, like choppers
The boppers, they love me, they show up, give topper
The Benjis, the Benzos, the reason I gotta
Then cha-cha, we slid, the reason we got ya
The oppers, the coppers get no love, get nada
The block'll get hotter and hotter and hotter
It's in me, so they envy, try reachin' for the watch-a
The Glock'll go "blakka", go "blakka", and "blakka"
