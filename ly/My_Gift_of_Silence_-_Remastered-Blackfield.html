		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I compiled all my crimes and my lies into amnesty
Would you come back to me?
The smile on my lips is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me
And I don't hear my own soul scream

I'll read your lips, watch your scarf play at your hips
And I know it's true
But I don't hear him call to you

Don't blame yourself
Don't change yourself
I just wanna be over you, see, if you'll love
Don't hate yourself

If I compiled all my crimes and my lies into amnesty
Would you come back to me?
The smile on my lips is a sign that I don't hear you leaving me
And I don't hear my own soul scream

Don't blame yourself 
(don't blame yourself)
Don't change yourself 
(don't change yourself)
I just wanna be over you, see, if you'll love 
(don't hate yourself)
Don't hate yourself
