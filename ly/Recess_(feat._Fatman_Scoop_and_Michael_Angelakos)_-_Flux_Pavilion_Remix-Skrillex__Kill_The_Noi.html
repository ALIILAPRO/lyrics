		  Come on

Fight till you can't fight
Everybody's alright
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight

Fight till you can't fight (fight till you can't fight)
Everybody's alright (everybody's alright)
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight

Fight till you can't fight (fight till you can't fight)
Everybody's alright (everybody's alright)
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight

(Fight till you can't fight) turn it up
(Everybody's alright) turn it up
(Don't let it stop, don't let it stop) higher
(D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight) higher

T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up-up
T-turn it up, t-t-t-t-turn it up-up
Turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it, turn it
(Make it to the, make it to the, to the)
Bass drop

Don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight
Don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight

Everybody listen to me
On the count of three we gon' go all together
Right here, right now
One, two, three, everybody just

Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
J-j-just bounce, bounce, bounce

All the ladies, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care (we don't care)
All the fellas, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care (we don't care)

All the ladies, put your hands in the air
Say we don't care (we don't care)
Everybody, put your hands in the air
It's Fatman Scoop, Kill The Noise, Skrill, come on

Fight till you can't fight (fight till you can't fight)
Everybody's alright (everybody's alright)
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop
D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight

Fight till you can't fight (fight till you can't fight)
Everybody's alright (everybody alright)
Don't let it stop, don't let it stop (everybody alright)
D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight (make it to the daylight)

(Everybody) (fight till you can't fight)
(Everybody's alright)
(Don't let it stop, don't let it stop)
(D-don't let it stop till we make it to the daylight)

Put your hands in the air
Hands, hands in the air
Put your hands in the air
Hands, hands in the air
Put your

Take it to the daylight

Everybody alright
Everybody alright
Everybody alright
Everybody alright
Perfect, cool?
