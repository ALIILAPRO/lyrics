		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?

I'm so afraid to put you down
But when we're safe we're all allowed
And I got a gift, I use my voice
But you can't hear amongst the noise
There's dirt around my neck, I'm blind
No, I don't have to hear them, why? It's nice
I got a mother, y'all got moms
And they love every fuckin' song
They help me hold my-

Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high?
Never hold my head high
Can you feel the head high? (Yeah)

Fatherless, I do act so fatherless
Except that's not acting, actually, I lack some confidence
They draggin' my name through the web
They should call me, "Spider Bitch"
You got no designer, you gotta take care your momma 'nem
You work 9-5s and you still managin' to comment this?
Fuck is your problem, bitch?
I know you ain't proud of this
Deep down you just wish you didn't feel stuck in the life you live
Deep down you got power to change the view they assigned you with
Lost faith in humanity
Also, lost the common sense
Also, lost the motivation to begin to find this shit
I won't take it personally, 'cause I get addicted as well
Had to wish enemies well
That's how the internet feel
Herd to hold my

Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)
Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)
Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)
Never hold my head high (hard to hold my head high)
Can you feel the head high? (Can you feel the head high?)
