		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm at the end of my rope
My bitch she's tatted it's wrapped up her throat
Open her mouth and I spit in that hoe
Break away all of my soul, ay okay what
Think i'll stick around now hanging with the hell hound militia
Hater took his body
Now he's sleeping with the fishes
Posing with the homies but they hating
You could see it in the pictures
Now the boy ends up missing
I am the grunt the ruh that come to bring the drum
To pierce the lung the eyes the ears the punks
Hear the fucking thunder with gorillas with the drums
Say ay
I'm so fucking anxious really hate it when I lay
I cannot sleep i'm not sane
Feels like i'm cursed with the plague
Losing all my vision like an animal
Manifesting vision that's intangible
Cruise with the reaper and pull out the Molotov
Light it and set it off
Feels like i'm falling now
Swerving and coughing up
Vision is blurring up
Ay okay what
I'm insane bruh
Hey wassup
Fake fuck
You can't fucking hang bruh
What
What
I'm at the end of my rope
My bitch she tatted its wrapped up her throat
Open her mouth and I spit in that hoe
Break away all of my soul
Ay okay, what
