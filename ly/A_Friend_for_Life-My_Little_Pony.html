		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)
A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)

I couldn't see what was right there in front of me
Turned my back, got my mind off track, yeah
You saw a world that was something new entirely
Helped me to see all the possibilities

Oh, like a star in the daylight
Or like a diamond at night
Your light was hidden from my sight

A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)
A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)

Every friendship is tested
You say sincere, but it's all unclear now
But with a word, everything changes
And just like that, you and I are right back

Oh, like a star in the daylight (star in the daylight)
Or like a diamond at night (diamond at night)
The light will shine when the time is right

A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)
A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)

When I put my hand out and I thought I would fall
You knew what I needed and you came around to fix it all

A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)
A friend for life
That's what you are to me (ah-ah-oh)

A friend for life
That's what you are to me, oh whoa (like a star in the daylight)
A friend for life
That's what you are to me (like a diamond at night)

Ah-ah-oh, ah-ah-oh
That's what you are to me
