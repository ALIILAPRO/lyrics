		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music

Take your time
Find a way to do control the line
Let the record get into your mind
And let it start to renovate
Do it good, do it now and don't you wait
I'm an addict
I don't give none
Yes I'm hooked by music and on the run
If you wanna behind take your score
And give me more

Slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music

I'm a party freak
And I really mean a freak
Every day of the week
I can't live my life without jammin'
That is why my life is so slammin'
I take you up to a place where you've never been
Far away from home and then back again
Get ready for this and get dressed
Cause when you miss the boat you gonna be stressed
Yeah, three two one
Countdown and the party has begun
Let's do it right now, let's go for it
Cause I feel for you and I show for it
S.t.a.y. MC
If you wanna have fun you better call me
Get done, get down to my sound
I'm in town

Slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music

Mmh, you better believe what I told ya
If you don't I will come back to hold ya
And when you're ready, come on and tell me
I'm gonna be right down waiting for the yell, see
Yes, cause I'm talking about a change
I'm talking about a change of lifestyle
The way you went to me was very strange
Stay tuned for a while
I could have been a criminal
Because I live like an animal
Our homeplace was terrible
I was a kid so I tried to live with it
Same kid was a weak individual
But I was not, I was so strong
And so the music helped me get along
Take a look at me now, cause here I am
I'm your mate, man

Slave to the music
I'm a slave to the music
