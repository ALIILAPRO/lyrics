		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh-oh-oh, forget, let me breathe, let me live
Just run away from my mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh, forgive, I don't need, I won't breathe
Just get away from my life

You lost one and all, so fly away
Over the clouds, under the sky
Never come back, no, run away
With all your might, gave up you

I don't believe anymore your shallow heart
I know that it's you who just do play this trick
I never forgive you, not for anything
And now you are left with nothing

Oh, oh-oh-oh, forget, let me breathe, let me live
Just run away from my mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh, forgive, I don't need, I won't breathe
Just get away from my life

Oh, oh-oh-oh, forget, let me breathe, let me live
Just run away from my mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh, forgive, I don't need, I won't breathe
Just get away from my life

There's no other time to make
In happiness you have mistaken
We have no progressive future
I know your lying nature

There's no other time to make
In happiness you have mistaken
We have no progressive future
I know your lying nature

Oh, oh-oh-oh, forget, let me breathe, let me live
Just run away from my mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh, forgive, I don't need, I won't breathe
Just get away from my life

Oh, oh-oh-oh, forget, let me breathe, let me live
Just run away from my mind
Oh, oh-oh-oh, forgive, I don't need, I won't breathe
Just get away from my life
