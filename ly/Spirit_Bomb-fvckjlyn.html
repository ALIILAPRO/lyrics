		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel like I was made for this shit, awe yeah
Niggas be hating like a bitch, awe yeah
Snatch a niggas soul like the Lich, awe yeah
Little do they know I'm the shit, so what?
Rap in my genes, it's genetic
Not made of fabric synthetic
Throwing their shade, it's pathetic
Thought I was finished? Forget it
Said I can't rap, bitch, dead that
Your comment really tells me where your head's at
My cheese, nacho business
Going beast mode, flip the kill switch
Wait
You really tryna tell me that I ain't on shit?
Ha, that shit is laughable
Throwing shade cus you know my shit valuable
My ego's superhuman, you're just mad that you can't do this
Feeling like I'm Super Saiyan
Goku bouta get to slaying
Little nigga, quit your playing
If you're feeling big, then say it
You can feel my energy
Yes, you're feeling less than me
You gave into jealousy
You was not a friend of me
Spineless like anemones
Looking like a jellyfish
Nigga, Imma talk shit
Yeah, I had to flex a bit
I got a lot of shit to say but I wont say the rest of it
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
Spirit Bomb
