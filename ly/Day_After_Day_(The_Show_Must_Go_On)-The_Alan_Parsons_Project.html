		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gaze at the sky
And picture a memory
Of days in your life
You knew what it meant
To be happy and free
With time on your side

Remember your daddy
When no one was wiser
Your ma used to say
That you would go further
Than he ever could
With time on your side

Think of a boy with the stars in his eye
Longing to reach them but frightened to try
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday

But day after day
The show must go on
And time slipped away
Before you could build
Any castles in spain
The chance had gone by

With nothing to say
And no one to say it to
Nothing has changed
You've still got it all to do
Surely you know
The chance has gone by

Think of a boy with the stars in his eye
Longing to reach them but frightened to try
Sadly, you'd say, someday, someday

But day after day
The show must go on
And you gaze at the sky
And picture a memory
Of days in your life
With time on your side

With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
With time on your side
(Day after day, the show must go on)
