		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm scared
Of all the signs
Don't ever leave me
Alone at night
I think I'm scared (I think I'm scared)
I don't know why (I don't know why)
Just leave the lights on
And close the blinds

Because
I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks
Because 
I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks

I think I'm scared
I have no time (he has no time)
I scream out loud
Just to see if I'm alive
I think I'm scared
I don't know why (I don't know why)
So leave the lights on
I'll stay inside

Because
I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks
Because 
I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks

Dial 911
I'm calling from under my bed (under my bed)
It's hard to breath when you're not there (you're not there)
I find everything a nightmare (a nightmare)
Sometimes I know you don't care 
But I feel like I'm

Disappearing in a hole
And nobody will know (know)
Nobody will go (except when I'm with you)
Sitting in my room alone
And nobody will know (know)
Nobody will go (except when I'm with you)

Why does no one understand
When I say I am just afraid
Why does no one lend a hand
When I say I will drift away

And there are clouds in disguise (oh no)
And I'm always terrified
They might just rain on me

I'm losing my mind (oh no)
But I think I'll be alright
Just hold my hands you'll see

I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks
I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks

I know that you think 

I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks
I'm a scaredy cat
Please
No more heart attacks
