		  Fuck me off a Perc', ayy, turn me up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc', ayy, turn me up, Perky (ayo, Q)
Fuck me off a Perc' and we goin' up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc' and I'm slowin' up
Percocets, this Perky sex
Drop a bag on me, I'm worth the flex
Left my ex on blocked, ain't worth the stress
On God, you are not even worth a text

Can I fuck you in the crib or the car?
Fuck you in the Wraith with the stars
I can pull strings like a guitar
I'm like Picasso, baby, you a work of art, ayy
Wanna bend you over, make it arch
Burberry pattern on my scarf, ayy
Wanna bend you over, make it arch
Burberry pattern on my scarf, ayy
I be so in my bag, I be stuck in it
Said she got some good pussy, so I'm fuckin' it
Said she want relationship, I'm duckin' it
Said I want all the smoke, nigga, so I'm clutchin' it
Got a big old chop, it's from Russia
I be re-rockin' Runtz in the Gushers
Get a blunt and let it burn like Usher
I'ma get this money every day 'cause I'm a hustler
They said I got hoes, a ton of 'em
Lil' bro need work, I front him
Said I got hoes, a ton of
Lil' bro need work, I front him
Got so many bitches, they attemptin'
Can you keep a secret, keep me out your mentions?
Extracurricular detention
Said she got good brain, ayy, not to mention, ayy

Fuck me off a Perc', ayy, turn me up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc', ayy, turn me up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc' and we goin' up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc' and I'm slowin' up
Percocets, this Perky sex
Drop a bag on me, I'm worth the flex
Left my ex on blocked, ain't worth the stress
On God, you are not even worth a text

Freak, yeah, ayy, you knowin' that I'm nasty
And you know my game is everlasting
Comin' through splashin'
We the ones that's murderin' the fashion
Your friends could get murdered by the pantry, ayy
We the ones doin' all the braggin', ayy
'Cause we the ones turnin' up active, ayy
These niggas all uppercase letters to me 'cause these niggas do a whole lot of cappin'
And these bitches all lie, bitch
If you go against me, it's suicide, bitch
And you know I'm big Glock 45, bitch
Not a stock, what I got up in my clip
Okay, ayy, ayy, ayy
I'm finna get paid and lay
Fuck yours, bitch, my shit straight
Treat a Monday like Saturday

Fuck me off a Perc', ayy, turn me up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc', ayy, turn me up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc' and we goin' up, Perky
Fuck me off a Perc' and I'm slowin' up
Percocets, this Perky sex
Drop a bag on me, I'm worth the flex
Left my ex on blocked, ain't worth the stress
On God, you are not even worth a text
