		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got my attention, my new obsession
Made me feel like I just died and went to heaven
But did I mention, you do my head in
It's the way you use your body as a weapon

Tell me are you out there?
I can't figure out, yeah, what's on your mind
And tell me how your feelings
Wound up disappearing overnight

I'm feeling stressed out, upside down
My heart's a ghost town when you're not around
I'm running out of ways to tell you that I need you now, oh
I'm feeling locked down, got no way out
My heart's a ghost town when you're not around
I'm running out of ways to tell you that I need you now, oh

An empty bottle, a waste of time
That's all I am without you in my life
Every second turns to days, only way I can be saved
If you call me up and come over tonight

Tell me are you out there?
I can't figure out, yeah, what's on your mind
And tell me how your feelings
Wound up disappearing overnight

I'm feeling stressed out, upside down
My heart's a ghost town when you're not around
I'm running out of ways to tell you that I need you now, oh
I'm feeling locked down, got no way out
My heart's a ghost town when you're not around
I'm running out of ways to tell you that I need you now, oh

Stressed out, upside down
My heart's a ghost town
