		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

Our love is like the moonlight in the dark
No better feeling than your warm hand
You're the only name I call out when it's hard
'Cause, baby, only you know who I am
Whenever you're down and suffering
I promise that I'll be your only friend
'Cause I know that the demons come knockin'
But we will never, ever let 'em in

Don't let the world ruin it 'cause you got one chance

All in your hands, in your hands
The world is yours when I'm in it
In your hands, in your hands
You can't let go or you'll lose your chance
'Cause after me, you'll never fall in love again, la-la-la
'Cause after me, you'll never fall in love again (la-la-la)

I'm the bandage for you when you're bleeding out
Like the trees, I supply your oxygen
Whenever your thoughts, they try to doubt (try to doubt)
Baby, just remember who I am

Don't let the world ruin it 'cause you got one chance

All in your hands, in your hands
The world is yours when I'm in it
In your hands, in your hands
You can't let go or you'll lose your chance
'Cause after me, you'll never fall in love again, la-la-la
'Cause after me, you'll never fall in love again (again)

(You'll never fall in love again)
(You'll never fall in love again)
