		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could watch you for a lifetime
You're my favorite movie
A thousand endings
You mean everything to me
I never know what's coming
Forever fascinating
Hope you don't stop running
To me 'cause I'll always be waiting

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema

Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
My DJ gonna break it down (my cinema)
Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
My DJ gonna break it down (my cinema)
Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
My DJ gonna break it down (my cinema)
Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
Dr-dr-dr-dr-drop the bass

My cinema

Stars spell out your name
Like in a science fiction drama
Romance growing
Like a flower in the summer
You always keep me guessing
Forever my wonder
Hope you start undressing
All my dreams and take me under

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema 

Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
My DJ gonna break it down (my cinema)
Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
My DJ gonna break it down (my cinema)
Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
My DJ gonna break it down (my cinema)
Get up, get down (my cinema), rinse that sound
Dr-dr-dr-dr-drop the bass

My cinema

You are my cinema, I could watch you forever
Action-thriller, I could watch you forever
You are my cinema, a Hollywood treasure
Love you just the way you are
My cinema, my cinema

My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema, my cinema
My cinema
