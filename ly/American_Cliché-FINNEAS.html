		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Okay)

Too little to do for too long and
Too little of you for my songs
To be anything but lonely
In a couple weeks, you'll own me
Too tired to sleep, good morning
And I'm too wired to heed the warning
That there's danger in the summer
The calm before the thunder

I'm an American cliché
Missing a girl in a French café
I say, "Goddamn, you're beautiful"
You're blushing, duck out of frame
I'm an American cliché
Missing a girl in a French café
I say, "How'd I get along, so long without you"
And you say, "Same"

Graveyard, Jim Morrison, forever
In my arms, they'll have to bury us together
'Cause I'm never gonna let you go
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Missed my flight, making love in the morning
While everybody else was boarding
They love to say they told you so
I know, I know, I know

I'm an American cliché
Missing a girl in a French café
I say, "Goddamn, you're beautiful"
You're blushing, duck out of frame
I'm an American cliché
Missing a girl in a French café
I say, "How'd I get along, so long without you"
And you say, "Same"

Come on over now
You're one layover down
No one that we know around
Don't want the city without you
I want you
We'll go all over town
No one that we know around
Can't say I'm sober now
Do something I'm not allowed to
I want you

I'm an American cliché
Missing a girl in a French café
I say, "Goddamn, you're beautiful"
You're blushing, duck out of frame
I'm an American cliché
Missing a girl in a French café
I say, "How'd I get along, so long without you"
And you say, "Same"
