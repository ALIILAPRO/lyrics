		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can go pretty far
If you wanted
'Cause I know it's not your thing
To stay in one place, yeah
I can be what you want
I can be anything
As long as I'm not myself
I think I'll be safe, yeah

What am I looking for
In this state between love and war
Am I chasing a chemical
That just leaves me wanting more
And is there a difference
Between truth and happiness
If ignorance is bliss
To the emotional masochist

Yeah, we can go pretty far
Yeah, we can go pretty far
We can go pretty far
If you wanted
'Cause I know it's not your thing
To stay in one place, yeah
I can be what you want
I can be anything
As long as I'm not in love
I think I'll be safe

Yeah, we can go pretty far
We can go pretty far
Yeah, we can go pretty far
We can go pretty far

Yeah, we can go pretty far
We can go pretty far
Yeah, We can go pretty far
We can go pretty far

Yeah, we can go pretty far
Yeah, we can go pretty far

Yeah, we can go pretty far
We can go pretty far
Yeah, we can go pretty far
We can go pretty far
