		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you want
I know what you're thinking
And right now, I don't mind
I'm tired of being alone
Way too much to drink
And I'm tired of wasting time

You know that love don't come easy
How do I know you'll never leave me?
Can you go for miles?
Feeling some things I ain't felt in a while

I think you should try (try)
Try to blow my mind, ooh
Think you should try (try) 
To drive me through the night

Rendezvous
Take time to catch a vibe with you
Take me up, love me deep
Make me weak with all of your mind
Oh, you know that love don't come easy
How do I know that you'll never leave me?
Can you go for miles?
Feeling some things I ain't felt in a while

I think you should try (try)
Try to blow my mind, ooh
Think you should try (try) 
To drive me through the night

So good, the only time that I ain't looking at it
Is when my eyes roll back
And you bring me to my knees
Too good at pleasing me
And giving me just what I need

I think you should try (try)
Try to blow my mind, ooh
Think you should try (try) 
To drive me through the night (try for me)
(Try for me, try for me, try for me, yeah)
Try for me, baby
Try, try, try for me baby

It's not just making love
I need you to blow my mind
