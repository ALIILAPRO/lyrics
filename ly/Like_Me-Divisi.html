		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at your face 
There's a reason for the scars and for the feelings we fake and
What did you think my friend 
You didn't think that you would get to rest 'cause
Sweet dreams ain't made of these
These are made of cold sweat and cheap thrills it seems and
There's a reason for the come down 
That I don't know
No I don't know
And I know you own me you evil harpy
But you're just a heart beat
Like me

Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud 
Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud

Looks like I'm late
Just in time to wipe that smile off your fucking face and
What did you think my friend
You didn't think that you would get to rest 'cause
Sweet dreams ain't made of these
These are made of lack of love and shitty puns and weed and
There's a reason for the come down
That I don't know 
No I don't know
And I know you own me you evil harpy
But you're just a heart beat
Like me

Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud 
Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud

My friend and I we like to drink, we like to sing 
Well my friend and I he likes to drink, I like to bleed
I bleed all the time
Now don't you mind It ain't what you think 
Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud 
Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud

Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud 
Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud

Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud 
Oh I ain't gonna make it any how, any how, any how
So sit and watch while I be loud, while I be loud, so be loud
