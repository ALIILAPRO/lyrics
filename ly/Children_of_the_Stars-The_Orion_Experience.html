		  Children of the Stars

Children of the Stars unite
Don't you be afraid to share your light
Together we can burn so bright
That we'll chase the shadow from the World

They'll tell you it's all about money
They'll tell you it's all about fame
You'll spend all your life chasing diamonds and furs
cnd you're left with a ball and a chain
Now time is an infinite journey
cnd life is a trial by fire
You give up your wings for material things,
Baby, how can we get any higher?

You are not alone my child
So don't give up the fight
We can shake the World awake
cnd break that spell tonight

Children of the Stars unite
Don't you be afraid to share your light
Together we can burn so bright
That we'll chase the shadow from the World

They'll tell you that Science is fiction
cnd Magic is all but a lie
They'll make you bow down with your eyes to the ground
cnd they won't set you free till you die
But Power, it flows through your fingers
cnd Lightning caresses your hair
This world will be ours, cause we come from the Stars
So the doubters had better beware

You are not alone my child
So don't give up the fight
We can shake the World awake
cnd break that spell tonight

Children of the Stars unite
Don't you be afraid to share your light
Together we can burn so bright
That we'll chase the shadow from the World
Children of the Stars be brave
Never let them doubt your heart, or how it's made
Just let your love go Super Nova

Children of the Stars unite
Don't you be afraid to share your light
Together we can burn so bright
That we'll chase the shadow from the World
Children of the Stars be brave
Never let them doubt your heart, or how it's made
Just let your love go Super Nova
