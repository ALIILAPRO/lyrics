		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you for the dirty and clean
When you're wakin', in your dreams
When you bite my tongue and make me scream (and make me scream)
See, I've got everything that you need
Ain't nobody gon' do it like me
We are burning at a high degree (at a high degree)

And you make me feel like it burns, and it hurts, uh
Baby, that's part of the rush, this is us

What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
What is love?

Yeah, yeah, uh huh
I walk it, I talk it, I live it
What we do behind doors, it's our business
On my body, he givin' me kisses
I'm wet when I'm with him, I pop it like Adderall

Baby, dive in my beach and go swimmin'
Let's go deep 'cause you know there's no limits
Nothin' stronger than you when I'm sippin'
I'm still gonna finish, I'm drunk, I ain't had enough

One day you here, then you ghost
Tellin' me lies and it's killin' me slowly (yeah, yeah)

What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me (yeah)
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me (yeah), no more (no more)
What is love?
(Uh huh, yeah, yeah)
What is love? 

(Hey, yeah, yeah)
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more (yeah)
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Don't hurt me, no more
What is love?
