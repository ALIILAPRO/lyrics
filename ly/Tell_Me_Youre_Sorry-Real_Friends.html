		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll leave it up to you 
To let me down again 
It's bittersweet to know 
I can still count on you for something 

You stabbed me in the back
Deeper than you'll admit
You'll never understand
You didn't see the blood on your hands

Tell me, tell me that you're sorry 
Even if you're lying through your teeth 
Tell me, tell me that you're trying
Just to break the silence 
And put this behind us

I'll leave it up to you to fuck this up again
You pushed me off the edge but never cared how far I'd fallen 

You're a coward with a broken promise 
And probably thought that I'd forgotten 
I wish you knew
It cut right through

Tell me, tell me that you're sorry 
Even if you're lying through your teeth 
Tell me, tell me that you're trying
Just to break the silence 
And put this behind us

(Behind us)

Tell me, tell me it gets better 
Broken and the pieces won't fit back together
Maybe, maybe you just fucked me up
Wasted my time, wasted my trust
Wasted my love

Tell me, tell me that you're sorry 
Even if you're lying through your teeth 
Tell me, tell me that you're trying
Just to break the silence 
And put this behind us

Tell me you're sorry
