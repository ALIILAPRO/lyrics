		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Great Pains
I've gone to
Gang slang
I've gone to
Lame brain
Looking for gold I
I have become someone else
Outside
Stepping to inside
Stepping to inside
Stepping I wade through shit

He's a loser
He's a loser, she said
he's a loser
he's a loser, she said

I am mine
I am mine
I am mine
I am mine
I can't become someone else

He's a loser
He's a loser, she said
He's a loser
He's a loser, she said
