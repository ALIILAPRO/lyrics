		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All this time has whittled away
Like so many days in one
Back and forth the leaders sway
Backing it up with guns

Superpowers flex their wings
Hold the world on puppet strings
Egos will feed while citizens bleed
That's always the way it goes

When will the world listen to reason?
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
When will the truth come into season?
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
I have a feeling it'll be a long time

All they want is what they can defend
Before their time is up
Make the same mistakes again
Heard it all before

Superpowers flex their wings
Hold the world on puppet strings
Egos will feed while citizens bleed
That's always the way it goes

When will the world listen to reason?
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
When will the truth come into season?
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
I have a feeling it'll be a long time

Well, if they tried, maybe they'd see
It'd do a little good to let the world be free
Handshake and a smile gets you on through
Then turn it all around with a suicide move

But you know it's not fooling anyone but me
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see
But you know it's not fooling anyone but me
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see, oh yeah

I see you, superpowers flex their wings
Hold the world on puppet strings
Egos will feed while citizens bleed
That's always the way it goes

When will the world listen to reason?
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
When will the truth come into season?
I have a feeling it'll be a long time
I have a feeling it'll be a long time, oh yay
