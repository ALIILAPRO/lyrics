		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Hook]
I’m calling your bluff
I’m never enough
It’s all in my head
My lover is dead

Can’t bring you back to my world
I’m still holding on
The nights that we spent
Getting high in your bed

[Bridge]
I’m tryna pick the pieces up
I feel them crashing down.
I try to let go of the feeling
Always comes back around.

She said, “Put your head on straight
cause the more you feel
then the more you will get hurt”

[Verse]
I can’t wake up
Replay it in my head
Where we left off
It’s all that I have left

All that I want.
I’m falling for your silhouettes
of the past and the present again.

[Hook]
I’m calling your bluff
I’m never enough
It’s all in my head
My lover is dead

Can’t bring you back to my world
I’m still holding on
The nights that we spent
Getting high in your bed

[Bridge]
I’m tryna pick the pieces up
I feel them crashing down.
I try to let go of the feeling
Always comes back around.

She said, “Put your head on straight
cause the more you feel
then the more you will get hurt”

[Verse]
Take me, I’m tryna break free
Blame me, like you could save me.
Waiting, my time is wasted.
My mind is made up.

“What you running from,
you already won.
Dig me out the dirt,
I’ll fuck you till you’re numb”
I can’t take it anymore.

[Hook]
I’m calling your bluff
I’m never enough
It’s all in my head
My lover is dead

Can’t bring you back to my world
I’m still holding on
The nights that we spent
Getting high in your bed

[Bridge]
I’m tryna pick the pieces up
I feel them crashing down.
I try to let go of the feeling
Always comes back around.

She said, “Put your head on straight
cause the more you feel
then the more you will get hurt”
