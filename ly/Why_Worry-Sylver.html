		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stones are getting colder
Leaves are turning brown
Paintings loose their color
Kings lay down their crown

[Chorus]
Why worry, why worry
I'm still here for you
Why worry, why worry
'Cause my light will always shine on you

Nights are getting longer
Soldiers lost their faith
Dreamers have stopped dreaming
Heaven no longer waits

Earth has stopped revolving
Moon has lost it's glow
Seasons have stopped turning
Rivers no longer flow

[Chorus 2x]
Sometimes the one thing
That you're looking for
Will be the one thing
You can't see

[Chorus 3x]
