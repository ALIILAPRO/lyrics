		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of my head, I'm begging for skin to skin
You don't say much 'cause you've been cheated before me
I know you think I think I'm better than I am
But I'm not trying to wake up in some promised land

I just want a secret life
Where you and I can get bored out of our minds
I just wanna have you in a secret life
'Cause I'm sick of chasing after holy ghosts
Been trying to tell you I want you the most

You're always looking like a photograph just took
Acting high life, reading your old Russian books
Don't I know you think I think I'm better than I am
Oh, honey, I'm not trying to wake up in some promised land

I just want a secret life
Where you and I can get bored out our minds
I just wanna have you in a secret life
'Cause I'm sick of chasing all these holy ghosts
I've been trying to tell you I want you the most

And I talk so much
I talk so much, it's nice
I talk so much because I'm scared to begin

God, I want a secret life
Where you and I can get bored out of our minds
I just wanna have you in a secret life
'Cause I'm sick of looking after all my ghosts
Been trying to tell you I love you the most
