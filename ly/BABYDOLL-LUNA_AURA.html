		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty face just the way you like 
Raw hand running up her thigh 
Bet she knows how to make you cry 
Bet you choke on all her lies 
Everything I could never be
Fever tongue, bring you to your knees 
Still feel her hands on me 
Good things always come in 3's 

Your babydoll has a wondering eye 
And she keeps looking at me
Yeah she keeps looking me (2x)

Hope you get everything you want 
She just wants anything I got 
And I'm not gonna make her stop 
No I'm not gonna make her stop 
Does she know what you did to me 
Held me down while you watched me bleed
Go ahead this one's on me 
Show us all how good you'll be 
Your babydoll has a wondering eye 
And she keeps looking at me
Yeah she keeps looking at me (2x)
