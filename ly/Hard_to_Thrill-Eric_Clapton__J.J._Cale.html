		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore
Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore
There is nothin' you can show me
That I haven't seen before

I got the time to kill, keepin' to myself inside this room
Time to kill, keepin' to myself inside this room
Over forty years of Fridays
And you give up tryin' too

Hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore
I'm hard to thrill, nothin' really moves me anymore
There ain't nothin' you can show me
That I haven't seen before

Hard to thrill, but nothin' really moves me anymore
Hard to thrill, but nothin' really moves me anymore
