		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where did all these smart girls come from?
I don't think that I could choose just one
Where did all these smart girls come from?
Someone tell me how to get me some

On the floor, in the car
On the seat at the bar
Wherever I go
That's where they are

Smart girls
Never get enough, of those
Smart girls
Smart girls

I want to be a bad boy right now
The real me is dying to hang out
I know you know what I'm talking about
I've got a feeling you could show me how

On a bus, on a train
On a boat, on a plane
I'm falling in love
What was your name?

Smart girls
Never get enough, of those
Smart girls
Sleeping in the buff

Yumi, Sherie, Alison, Mary
Which one do I want to marry?
They're all smart girls
They're all smart girls
Sheena, Lola, Fabiola,
Don't you know you make me lose my mind?

Where did all these smart girls come from?
I don't think that I could choose just one
Where did all these smart girls come from?
Someone tell me how to get me some

Lisa, Brittany, Paula, Whitney
Which one do I want here with me?
They're all smart girls
They're all smart girls

Debbie, Donna, Tatiana
Don't you know you make me lose my mind?

Smart girls
Never get enough, of those
Smart girls
Skipping in the buff

Smart girls
Talkin' 'bout smart girls
All I want is smart girls
Talkin' 'bout smart girls
