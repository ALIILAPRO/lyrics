		<p>
		  Bring the action

When you hear us in the club
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up

When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

See the boys in the club
They watching us
They watching us
They watching us

Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh

You are now now rocking with
Will.i.am and Britney bitch
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Bring the action

Rock and roll
Everybody let's lose control
On the bottom we let it go
Going faster, we ain't going slow-low-low hey yo

Hear the beat, now let's hit the floor
Drink it up and then drink some more
Light it up and let's let it blow, blow, blow hey yo
Rock it out and rock it now

If you know what we talking 'bout
Turn it up and burn down the house ha house, hey yo
Turn it up and go turn it down

Here we go we go shake it bam 'cause everywhere we go we
Bring the action

When you hear us in the club
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up

When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

You see them girls in the club
They looking at us
They looking at us
They looking at us

Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh we oh

You are now now rocking with
Will.i.am and Britney bitch
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

It goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever
'Cause I was feeling down and now feel better
Maybe it goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever, forever forever ever ever, ever

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh we oh
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
And scream and shout and let it out
We sayin' oh we oh, we oh, we oh

You are now now rocking with
Will, I.Am and Britney bitch
