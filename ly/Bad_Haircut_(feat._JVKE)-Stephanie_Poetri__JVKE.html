		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always thought loving was scary
Letting your heart go like that
Never truly knowing if you'd get it back
In one piece or in pieces
Put it back together then repeat
I always thought loving was scary
'Cause my parents thought they got it right
And 7 years went by and although they tried
They're just not meant to be
So I told myself that love wasn't for me

And, I can't figure out
How you got it all to go away
And have me waiting every day for you
I guess it's all about
Who you are and the little things you do
To make me love you i know I do

'Cause you still look good with a bad haircut
And I'd dance with you every single night
Like do do, do do do, do do
Do do, do do do, do do
And your morning breath never stops my kiss
I can feel my heart beating just like this
Like do do, do do do, do do
Do do, do do do, do do, do

I always thought loving was stupid
Letting myself get attached
To someone who could walk
Away without a scratch
While I'm shattered to pieces
I've been broken before can't repeat it
I always thought loving was stupid
Cause all of my friends were a mess
Watching from the bleachers while
They're playing games
And they lose every season
All their exes are still undefeated

I can't figure out
How you got it all to go away
And have me falling deeper into you
I guess it's all about
Who you are and the little things you do
To make me love you i know I do

'Cause you still look good with a bad haircut
And I'd dance with you every single night
Like do do, do do do, do do
Do do, do do do, do do
And your morning breath never stops my kiss
I can feel my heart beating just like this
Like do do, do do do, do do
Do do, do do do, do do, do
