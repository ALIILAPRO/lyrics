		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so far away
This tiny thing called entropy
The end of all you've ever been
But you can't sleep (but you can't sleep)

And I can't lie to you
Like all the grown up people do
The clock stops, people go
People go

If I could lock up light in your little heart
Keep your innocence of the deep down dark
I would (I would, I would, I would, I would)

In the dead of night
I'll be here by your side
Ghosts don't sing
So you know that I'm alive

I still get the dreams
And the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you
The pills, they'll lie to you

You can't stop the time
When it's time that you go
There's no God
But it's better you know

I still get the dreams
And the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you
I don't wanna frighten you

(I don't wanna frighten you)
(I don't wanna frighten you)
(I don't wanna frighten you)
(I don't wanna frighten you)

Oh, if I could save
You from the fear of yesterday
From what will go and what will stay
It wouldn't change a thing (it wouldn't change a thing)

And it's been haunting me
I'm just as small as yesteryear
Drink until it disappears
It won't disappear

If I could lock up light in your little heart
Keep your innocence of the deep down dark
I would

In the dead of night
I'll be here by your side
Ghosts don't sing
So you know that I'm alive

I still get the dreams
And the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you
The pills, they'll lie to you

You can't stop the time
When it's time that you go
There's no God
But it's better you know

I still get the dreams
And the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you
I don't wanna frighten you

In the dead of night
I'll be here by your side
Ghosts don't sing
So you know that I'm alive

I still get the dreams
And the feeling of doom
I don't wanna frighten you
I don't wanna frighten you
