		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Throw away, your yesterday
a cautionary tale where there’s
nothing left to gain
Tell me how’d your soul collapse?
A haunted past
Just excuses
I know that you are
 
Violent Chemistry, your a Toxic enemy
Watching while I burn
Hurting just because you like it
happy nihilist

Lately I’ve been closing doors
Furthermore
Locked and tossed the key
So tell me what you’re waiting for
Prepare for war 
Show your colors
I know that you are 

Violent Chemistry, your a Toxic enemy
Watching while I burn
Hurting just because you like it
Happy Nihilist

Endless horizons
You could pick any sunset, but you’re eclipsing me
try to decipher
The endless path that took you to your personal wasteland, hopeless causing pain
 
Violent Chemistry, your a Toxic enemy
Watching while I burn
Hurting just because you like it
Happy Nihilist

I try, to float along with the tide
I try, but still we seem to collide
I try, to reset and override
