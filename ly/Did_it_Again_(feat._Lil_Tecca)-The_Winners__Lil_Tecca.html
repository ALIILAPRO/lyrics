		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a pack, hit 'em and do it again
Fuckin' her, I'm fuckin' her friend
I got bands, one day I'm flying to France
Juggin' 'til a nigga land
You got a man, know what I do to ya mans?
No I ain't shootin' the hands, took an L, I ain't took one again
Crashed the 'Rari so I hopped in the Benz
So, oooh, it's crazy how they watch a young nigga gon' move
It's crazy, worry about yourself nigga, make a move
You steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas, you gon' lose
I don't gotta prove, you steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas
You gon' lose, I don't ever lose

Flyin' my mom to Japan, flyin' my dad to Japan, we in a Benz
We gon' link up with the fam, yeah I'm talkin' MBM, yeah yeah
Buddy, I never lack, the choppa' make a nigga dance
Versatile, freelance, fuck any bitch nigga, depends
Only with the shits if you a 10, pickin' any bitch, yeah I'm the man
If you want a feature, give me a grand
Drip on my body, I'm cool like a fan
I can not lose, I was up grindin', they snooze
Fuck all the fightin', be cool
Fuck all the dyin', keep tools

I got a pack, hit 'em and do it again
Fuckin' her, I'm fuckin' her friend
I got bands, one day I'm flying to France
Juggin' 'til a nigga land
You got a man, know what I do to ya mans?
No I ain't shootin' the hands, took an L, I ain't took one again
Crashed the 'Rari so I hopped in the Benz
So, oooh, it's crazy how they watch a young nigga gon' move
It's crazy, worry about yourself nigga, make a move
You steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas, you gon' lose
I don't gotta prove, you steady watchin' all the winnin' niggas
You gon' lose, I don't ever lose
