		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run away

You got the face of an angel but the heart of a monster
Body of a goddess but your heart ain't true
Took me for granted, girl, you played me like a fool
Out here wondering why I fall hard, no parachute

Gave you my heart and my heart and my soul
Gave you the time and affection you wanted
You're not the one for me
Everyone but me could see

I got to run away, run away from you
Run away, run away from you
I got to run away, run away from you
Run away, run away from you
(Let's go)

(I got to)
(Oh, I got to run away)
(I got to)

You got the face of an angel but the heart of a monster
Body of a God, yeah, but your heart ain't true
I put my love on the line, 'cause I was waiting for you
You told me to show I was true, but you broke my heart into two, mm

I should have read, I should have read from the signs
Everything we had was a lie
Now I'm out here believing love is a crime
But I got a plan

I got to run away, run away from you
Run away, run away from you
I got to run away, run away from you
Run away, run away from you
(Let's go)

(I got to)
(Oh, I got to run away)
Run away, run away, run away
(I got to) Run away
Run away from you
