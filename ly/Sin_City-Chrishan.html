		  Sin
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it
Right now

Take that off
I just wanna see you
Your legs so soft
I had to be near you
Thoughts in mind, going so crazy
I just wanna hear you
One touch on your body, what I've prepared for you
Nothing will spare you
Pussy so wet, I feel the drip coming down
Must be in Houston
You close your eyes, you feel the rise, I go inside
I'm shooting (on sight)

Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it
Oh you know it

No more calls, no one's coming over
Ride it like you stole it
Tonight you're the owner, ooh
Other girls they be hating, 'cause they texting too late
But I'm yours now
Babe just tie these restraints, tell me who's it is and ain't
Hit the floor now, yeah

Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Sin City wasn't made for you
Angels like you
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
Oh you know it, oh you know it
