		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ah, ah (ah-ha-ha)
Nina, ah, ah, ah-ah
Yeah
Ah, ah, ah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Yeah, ah, nah-nah-nah-nah
Let's go, Faygo
(We love you, Tecca)

Knock-knock, who's there at the door right now?
They like, "If you don't open that ho, we gon' kick it down"
I had to grab my fire, I told them step inside
When I came around that corner, that boy almost cried

No, I promise I'm not 'bout to play, yeah
Young nigga tryna stack up his cake, yeah
Benihana, baby, that's my kinda date, yeah
Ex wanna love me, but it's too late now
Sorry, lil' mama, I cannot save ya
Once I did, I tried to change ya
You tried to shoot me in the heart with lasers
That turned me into a hell-raiser

I'm tryna rack up and skrrt in a Tesla
Baby on my dick, she say, "Faygo, you next up"
That lil' nigga reckless, tryna run me a lil' check up
Niggas tryna be cool 'cause that beat by my nigga Tecca
No, I don't wanna have to stretch ya
She gon' flirt in front of her nigga
She like, "Faygo, you gettin' bigger
I remember when you was a lil' nigga"
My niggas got stripes like that boy Tigger
No, you don't be pullin' no triggers
Don't wanna have the blick up on nobody
Don't know why these niggas steady wanna try me
La-di-da-di-da-di-da-di
I knew shorty was a thotty
She tryna take off in the Masi'
Countin' this guap like I hit a lottery (yeah)
Wait a minute, stay quiet please (yeah)
You said that you would ride for me (yeah)
Now that you see me glow up
You done ho'ed up, now you down for me

Knock-knock, who's here at the door right now?
They like, "If you don't open that ho, we gon' kick it down"
I had to grab my fire, I told them step inside
When I came around that corner, that boy almost cried

No, I promise I'm not 'bout to play, yeah
Young nigga tryna stack up his cake, yeah
Benihana, baby, that's my kinda date, yeah
Ex wanna love me, but it's too late now
Sorry, lil' mama, I cannot save ya
Once I did, I tried to change ya
You tried to shoot me in the heart with lasers
That turned me into a hell-raiser (yeah, yeah)
