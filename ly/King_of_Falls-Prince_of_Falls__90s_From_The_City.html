		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you take it up a notch
Cause I’ll be feeling like I’m always drowning with the gods
A demon in the light
A phantom in a ghost
Who’s screaming out my lungs
Shawty please leave me the fuck alone
My demons always watching
Shadows creeping through the smoke
And you are now he’s for the night
Hanging on the feeling like he’s not your type
Ohh I’m bad enough
It’s okay cause have been on a high
Kingdom from all above
And the fire from my mind

[Bridge]
Shit
I really fucked up
I really fucked up
I don’t think I can do this anymore
This has to stop
It just had to stop

[Chorus] x 2
What the fuck you think we living for
When Niggas get involved
And now, we have to justify it
We searching for a life of the king of falls
(Ahh nahh)
I think the devils dancing
You think it’s all a game
Baby what the fuck you think we living for

[Post-Bridge]
And clearly we been out stage
So vibe tonight, leave him
Cold feet, swear your nigga so surprised
Ayy
I don’t need need it babe
I just love getting high

Bridge]
Yeah
Cause it is drugs, sex and rock n roll
Make a nigga lose himself
Drugs, sex and rock n roll
Make a nigga lose himself
Drugs, sex and rock n roll
Make a nigga lose himself
Drugs, sex and rock n roll
Make a nigga lose himself
The fuck you think we living for

[Chorus]
When Niggas get involved
And now, we have to justify it
We searching for a life of the king of falls
(Ahh nahh)
I think the devils dancing
You think it’s all a game
Baby what the fuck you think we living for

[Outro] x2
But I’m lonely as a knight might be
I’m freezing up can’t breathe tonight
