		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to roll my eyes
I just couldn't sympathize
With cards on Valentine's Day
And couples who say "babe"
I used to take my pride
In the way that I defied
All romantic conventions
And unrealistic expectations
I confess I'm lactose intolerant
And I might regret it, but I'll take the hit
I'll stay true to my feelings
And try romanticizing
'Cause when it comes to you and me
I don't mind a little cheese
I love you to the moon
You're a dream come true
You're the bread to my butter
The shade to my summer
I wanna be together
I love you three thousand
More than the highest mountain
You're the sun in my sky
The apple of my eye
All I want is you and I
I never thought I was sentimental
But I guess I always had the potential
I think I had a feeling from the start
When you became the match to my spark
So even if you're not in the mood
I'll feed it to you on a silver spoon
I hope it don't make you feel queasy
'Cause I'm about to get real cheesy
I confess I'm lactose intolerant
And I might regret it, but I'll take the hit
I'll stay true to my feelings
And try romanticizing
'Cause when it comes to you and me
I don't mind a little cheese
I love you to the moon
You're a dream come true
You're the bread to my butter
The shade to my summer
I wanna be together
I love you three thousand
More than the highest mountain
You're the sun in my sky
The apple of my eye
All I want is you and I
