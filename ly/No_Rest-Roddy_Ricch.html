		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't ever get no rest (no rest)
Workin', I ain't even got a desk (uh-huh)
Poppin' bad hoes out of catch
Poppin' bad hoes out of catch
Playin' out field like the Mets (play ball)
Don't tolerate no disrespect (no way)
Gotta top good drink with X (X)
Nigga, I don't ever get no rest, ayy

Watchin' my toddler, while he watchin' TV 
All money in, money counter for a hundred
When I'm outside, you can't even see me
All the things you did, lil' nigga, I done done it
All we know is fuck the hoes and get the money (get the money)
She want me fuck her four times, pop a honey (pop a honey)
Work her out, make a bitch do lunges (work her out)
I've been drownin' in this water like plunges
We at the top of the T-O-P
Money could climb up to G-O-D
You can never reach my P-O-V
Nigga can't question me, I'm P-V-C-C (woo)
Can't condone sucka shit, niggas know that I'm overly lit
Why the fuck would I commit to a bitch?
New stones on my wrist, told her, "Give the pinky ring another kiss"
Lookin' like Cold Stone's in this bitch (yeah, yeah)

I don't ever get no rest (no rest)
Workin', I ain't even got a desk (uh-huh)
Poppin' bad hoes out of catch
Poppin' bad hoes out of catch
Playin' out field like the Mets (play ball)
Don't tolerate no disrespect (no way)
Gotta top good drink with X (X)
Nigga, I don't ever get no rest

(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest

I'm cold like ice and I never think about the price
The inside the house look nice
Only like red and I don't like Tris
I was in the H, ridin' with the Prince
Ran the money up, I been rich ever since
Bust through the gate, I ain't straddle on the fence
Open up her throat, get top off rip
Stayin' out the way, I don't like it in the mix
Suited and booted like I got a tux, had the birthday with Drake in the cut
I'm lovin' the way that you fuckin' me, baby, I bought Chane'-ne' for the lust
The Miami high-rise is luxury, two-fifty on the furniture, luxury
Got my dawgs on my back, got the city on my back, you know they put their trust in me

I don't ever get no rest (no rest)
Workin', I ain't even got a desk (uh-huh)
Poppin' bad hoes out of catch
Poppin' bad hoes out of catch
Playin' out field like the Mets (play ball)
Don't tolerate no disrespect (no way)
Gotta top good drink with X (X)
Nigga, I don't ever get no rest

(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
(Woo, woo) I don't ever get no rest
