		  Hey, Mickey

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you-
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind

Met this boy named Mickey
He had on some yellow Dickies
I knew he was a hoe because his neck had hella hickies
I said "It's nice to meet you", shook his hand and it was sticky
I looked into his eyes and then that's when it hit me, I said
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
I just might let you come into my life and waste my time
I don't see no other men
Boy you done turned me blind
You make me deaf 'cause I believe you even when you lyin'

Never met a nigga like this (Never met a nigga like this)
Make a bitch wanna cash in all her chips (Wanna cash in all her chips)
Tell my friends I'll see ya later girl I gotta dip (I'll see ya later girl I gotta dip)
'Cause I gotta meeting with a man named dick (Meeting with a man named dick)

But I call him Richard
He's richer than Bill Gates
Gets me wetter than Superior Lake
Takes me on hundred thousand dollar dates
And I don't even have to give him cake
He just call me baby, he don't call me Tate
He whip up that white girl, he beating on Kate
I just might marry that nigga today
But then I found out that Mickey was gay

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind

Aye Mickey maybe I could be yo' Minnie
Uh-huh, I'm about my cheddar, but I never been no snitchey
Zip them lippy's, flexin' all that cash
But you acting like a kiddie
This ain't Disney
Real boss bitch, leave a nigga quick
What I look like? I'm too litty
Ay, bay bay, I'm with Tate
She a Taurus, I'm a Cancer
Where my college bitches?
USC my alma mater
"Is her booty real?"
Girl, does it even matter?
Cause Saweetie breaking hearts
And you know these hoes can't stand her

FaceTime him, got my booty shorts on
If you gonna whip it out
Boy, it better be long
Wait, hol' on one sec
Put my lip gloss on
Damn lovin' what I see when I'm lookin' at my phone
Hey Mickey, can you take my pic-ey
I look good at every angle so just take it
I ain't picky

Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind
Oh, Mickey, you're so fine
So fine you blow my mind

Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey
Hey, Mickey
