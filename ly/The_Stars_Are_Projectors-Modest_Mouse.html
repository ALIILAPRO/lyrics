		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the last second of life, they're gonna
Show you how
How they run this show. Sure. Run it into 
The ground

The stars are projectors, yeah.
Projectin' our lives down to this
Planet earth

Everyone wants a double feature, they
Want to be their own damn teacher, and
How, all the stars are projectors, yeah.
Projectin' our lives down this 
Planet earth

It's all about moderate climates, you gotta
Be cold and be hot for sure.
It's all about the moderate climates, you
Want to be blessed and be cursed for sure.

The stars are projectors, yeah.
Projectin' our lives down to this
Planet earth. The stars are projectors, yeah.
Projectin' our lives down to this
Planet earth. Everyone wants a double feature, 
They want to be their own damn teacher, and
How, all the stars are projectors, yeah.
Projectin' our lives down this 
Planet earth.

You've got the harder part, you've got the kinder heart and it's true.
I've got the easy part, I've got the harder 
Heart, ain't this true.
Right wing, left wing, chicken wing.
It's built on findin' the easier way through.

God is a woman and the woman is an 
Animal, than animal's man and that's you.

Was there a need for creation? 
That was hiddin' in a math equation and that's this.
Where do circles begin?
