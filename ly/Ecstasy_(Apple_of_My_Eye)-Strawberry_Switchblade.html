		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my darkest dreams I see
You're much close now to me
I have got you in my hair
I can feel you round me everywhere

If I ever was to tell
I could talk of you so well
But you're here in me and will always be
The secret that I want to keep, and -

In a kiss lies so much more than touch
And my life has found a new temptation
And ecstasy has meaning once again
I find suddenly I'm closer to you
And I find all my wildest dreams
Have come true
While I spin round
My heart is beating for two
And I am wishing
It will always be you and I

I will always come with you
Doing all we want to do
Seeing things we've never seen
Going places we haven't tried to be

Touching me and touching you
All the love we never knew
Marked with "X" you see is our destiny
As we run together we could be so free

In a kiss lies so much more than touch
And my life has found a new temptation
And ecstasy has meaning once again
I find suddenly I'm closer to you
And I find all my wildest dreams
Have come true
While I spin round
My heart is beating for two
And I am wishing
It will always be you and I

You and I

In a kiss lies so much more than touch
And my life has found a new temptation
And ecstasy has meaning once again
I find suddenly I'm closer to you
And I find all my wildest dreams
Have come true
While I spin round
My heart is beating for two
And I am wishing
It will always be you and I

You and I
