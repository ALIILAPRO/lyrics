		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Grey park look the same
And the days are pale
I never thought it would rain this way
I should be knowing that, it used to be me

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?

Your smile has decayed
It will never be the same
I never thought I would laugh again
I should be knowing this, it used to be me

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?

Now it's dark and you're colder
Now it's dark and I'm older
Now it's dark and you're colder
And you tell me my parks are grey

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?

Grey park look the same
All the days are pale
I never thought it would rain this way
I should be knowing that, it used to be me

Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
Let's stay here for a while
Is something gonna happen today?
