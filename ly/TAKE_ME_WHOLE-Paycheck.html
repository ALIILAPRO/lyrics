		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been fucking lonely
You ain’t calling home
Acting like you own me
Then treat me like a ghost
You think you control me
I promise that you don’t
So what’s your fucking angle?
Who will be my-

If I let my feet hit the ground
I’ll never see you again
My heart beat when you around
Feels like the world’s at an end
And I keep caving
Severing my friendships, I feel disconnected
Wondering how I fucked us
Lies & misconceptions
So tell me how I wronged you
Say I don’t deserve you
Save me from my pride or it’ll burn you

Cause I been fucking lonely
You ain’t calling home
Acting like you own me
Then treat me like a ghost
You think you control me
I promise that you don’t
So what’s your fucking angle?
Who will be my angel
And take me whole

(Ooh)
Take me whole
(Ooh)
Take me-

Leave me where you found me
Bleeding knee-deep in the darkness
Hung by guilt and shame from trying
To be anything but heartless
(Heartless)
Send me down a spiral
With my demons and my memories
Cut me where it’s vital, slit my reason with your pedigree
Call me up despite of disagreement or supremacy
Running from our love will be the death of me

Cause I been fucking lonely
You ain’t calling home
Acting like you own me
Then treat me like a ghost
You think you control me
I promise that you don’t
So what’s your fucking angle?
Who will be my angel
And take me whole

(Ooh)
Take me whole
(Ooh)
Take me-

Cause I been fucking lonely
You ain’t calling home
Acting like you own me
Then treat me like a ghost
You think you control me
I promise that you don’t
So what’s your fucking angle?
Who will be my angel
And take me whole

Ooh
Ooh
