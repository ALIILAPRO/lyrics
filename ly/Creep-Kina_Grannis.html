		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
Just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so very special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
And I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so very special
I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

Oh, she's running out again
Oh, she's running out again

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so very special
I wish I was special
