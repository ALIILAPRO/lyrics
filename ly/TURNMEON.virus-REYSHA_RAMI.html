		  Turn me on, I pop up on your screen
Whacha know about it
Click it open, say hello to me
You won't live without it
Minty fresh I taste like Listerine
Whacha know about it
I'm your technologic figurine
You won't live without it
Ooo
You won't live without it
I've seen everything you've ever seen
Whacha know about it
Maybe you can give me what I need
You won't live without it
Playing like a silly kind of dream
Whacha know about it
Sentimental viral little queen
You won't live without it
Ooo
You won't live without it
Ooo
Turn me on, I pop up on your screen
Whacha know about it
Click it open say hello to me
You won't live without it
Minty fresh I taste like Listerine
Whacha know about it
I'm your technologic figurine
You won't live without it
I've seen everything you've ever seen
Whacha know about it
Maybe you can give me what I need
You won't live without it
Playing like a silly kind of dream
Whacha know about it
Sentimental viral little queen
You won't live without it
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo
Ooo
