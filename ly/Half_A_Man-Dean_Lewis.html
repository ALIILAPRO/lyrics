		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was wrong to say I loved her
I was wrong to think I'm right
But when I told her it was over
My darling I had lied
I've been running from my demons
Afraid to look behind
I've been running from myself
Afraid of what I'd find

But how am I supposed to love you
When I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me
When I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning
So let go of my hand
Oh, how can I give you all of me
When I'm only half a man?

And now I'm stuck in this hotel room
By a cold neon light
I've been waiting for an answer
But it won't come tonight
And every bottle I have stolen
Lay shattered on the floor
What's broken can't be whole anymore

But how am I supposed to love you
When I don't love who I am
And how can I give you all of me
When I'm only half a man
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning
So let go of my hand
And how can I give you all of me
When I'm only half a man?

And no one can ever hurt me
Like I've hurt myself
'Cause I'm made out of stone
And I'm beyond help
Don't give your heart to me

But how am I supposed to love you
When I don't love who I am?
And how can I give you all of me
When I'm only half a man?
'Cause I'm a sinking ship that's burning
So let go of my hand
And how can I give you all of me
When I'm only half a man?
Hmm, hmm hmm, hmm, hmm
