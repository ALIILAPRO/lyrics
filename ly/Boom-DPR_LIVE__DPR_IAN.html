		<p>
		  Fuck

She goes boom!
She don't fuck with me now
But she don't really wanna wait and see

She goes boom!
She don't fuck with me now
But she don't really wanna wait and see (okay)

She goes boom!
Uh she feels it now
Oh God, she feels it loud

She goes boom!
Her eyes rollin' out
Damn, volume out

She goes boom
Way higher than my ceiling
Got me fucked up in my feelings
So now, you got me looking around
I'm kinda thinking
It's funny how you think the world is always spinning around you
She don't fuck with me now
But she don't really wanna wait and see (I said don't run to me, bad girl)
She said just run to me
You're gonna blow! Okay

She goes boom!
Uh, she feels it now
Oh God, she feels it loud

She goes boom!
Her eyes rollin' out
Damn, volume out (COMING TO YOU LIVE)

She goes, "Oh my God!" 
Boom! Her legs wide open
왼손은 얼굴 오른손은 중요 부분
I hold her down 'cause she wants to see the full moon
뭐 말을 들어야지 주지 girl, don't be rude
"Give it to me pretty, please
다빈 tell me why you're such a fucking tease, ay
Fuck it up, Bon Appétit"
And there she goes in, three, two, IITE COOL

She goes boom!
She don't fuck with me now
But she don't really wanna wait and see

She goes boom!
She don't fuck with me now
But she don't really wanna wait and see (okay)

She goes boom!
Uh she feels it now
Oh God, she feels it loud

She goes boom!
Her eyes rollin' out
Damn, volume out out

I don't think I've been in touch with you lately
Too many no's and a whole lot of maybe's (we don't know!)
Standing outside 
Baby, who is that guy?

I don't think I've been in touch with you lately
Too many no's and a whole lot of maybe's (we don't know!)
Standing outside 
Baby, who is that guy?

I don't think I've been in touch with you lately
Too many no's and a whole lot of maybe's (we don't know!)
Standing outside 
Baby, who is that guy?

I don't think I've been in touch with you lately
Too many no's and a whole lot of maybe's (we don't know!)
Standing outside 
Baby, who is that guy?

She goes boom! (She went!)
She goes boom! (She went!)
She goes boom! (She goes boom! Boom!)
She goes boom! (She went!)

She goes boom! (She goes boom)
She goes boom! (She goes boom)
She goes boom! (She goes boom)
She goes boom!
