		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How long I have wanted
This dream to come true
And as it approaches
I can't believe I'm through

I've tried, oh
How I've tried
For a life, yes a life
I thought I knew

Oh it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
Makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Time seems to have frozen
But the mind can be fooled
As the days passed I discovered
Destiny just can't be ruled

Hard times, oh
Hard times
For the price, yes the price
I thought I knew

Oh it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Oh it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
makes me wodner if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done

Oh it's the price we gotta pay
And all the games we gotta play
makes me wonder if it's worth it to carry on
'Cause it's a game we gotta lose
Though it's a life we gotta choose
And the price is our own life until it's done
