		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you
You love me too
But what a shame
We are far away
What we can do?
Love equals me and you
I can not wait
I don’t want to be late

I don’t want to be late
I don’t want others
Baby I need you to stay
You are my favorite person
I have ever met
I can’t hold back my feelings
So I dream of a date
You’re my love
Think about
You every day and night
You’re my love
Have no doubt
Like diamond — caught me eye
You are thief stole my heart
I can’t not wait
Always knew that you were my fate
You’re my love
Think about
You every day and night
You’re my love
Have no doubt
Like diamond — caught me eye
You are thief stole my heart
I can’t not wait
Always knew that you were my fate

I love you
You love me too
But what a shame
We are far away
What we can do?
Love equals me and you
I can not wait
I don’t want to be late

It don't matter what I do,
I always think of you,
And when we stayed up til morning,
Watching movies while I hold you.
Could we do it all again,
And just leave it at just friends.
Even though I feel this way about you
And now you've gone somewhere else,
So I'm leavin' love on the shelf,
It's my fault, I hurt myself.
Holdin' all in the pain in my chest so well.
Somebody tell me these feelings are wrong,
So I don't have to sing this solemn song.

I love you
You love me too
But what a shame
We are far away
What we can do?
Love equals me and you
I can not wait
I don’t want to be late
Oooh
I love you
I love you
