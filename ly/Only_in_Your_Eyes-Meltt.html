		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Floated down
This river of time
In currents that we're bound
I've come to find
That only in your eyes
Sunlight

The current's strong
Our presence won't last for long

For now, somehow
Moments move right through you
Your light
the night could not hope to hide you 
Always in your eyes
Only in your eyes
For now

Driftin' out
To the ocean's embrace
Oh, did I make it count?
The moments we chased
But only in your eyes
Horizon's alight

The sun goes low
As I cling to the fading glow

For now, somehow
Moments move right through you
Your light
The night could not hope to hide you 
Only in your eyes
Sun begins to rise, for now
For now
