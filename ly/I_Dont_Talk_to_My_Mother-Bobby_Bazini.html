		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't talk to my mother
And she don't talk to me
Someday up in heaven
Maybe we'll all be free
It's not that I don't love her 
I hope she knows I do 
But ma we lost each other
In different points of view
Oh lord, forgive me 
For, I don't talk to my mother 

Lord don't let me down
Don't let me down 
Lord don't let me down 
Don't let me down 
Lord don't let me down 
Don't let me down 
Lord don't let me down
Down

I don't see my brothers 
All my friends are gone 
The cold ground is lonely
When you fall all alone 
This world is filled with answers 
But some choose to make up their own
They say family is everything 
I found truth in another home 
Oh lord, forgive me 
For I don't see my brothers 

Lord don't let me down
Don't let me down 
Lord don't let me down 
Don't let me down 
Lord don't let me down 
Don't let me down 
Lord don't let me down
Ahh

Don't let me down!
Don't let me down
Oooh
Oh, oh
Oh don't let me down 

I don't see my father
Don't think I ever could 
Oh lord, forgive him 
Oh lord, forgive me too
