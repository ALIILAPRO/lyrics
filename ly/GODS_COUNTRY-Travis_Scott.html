		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la (watchin' in)
La, la, la, la
Only one they watchin' in (la, la, la, la) yeah 
La, la, la, la
It ain't up to you no more
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
God Country, this is war
(Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Wakin' up, I see the light 
I been drunk and it's alright 
I took the drive to clear my mental
Would tint the whip but it's a bike 
It's demon time, I got it on me (on me)
Might earn a teardrop overnight 
Wear Louis shades to block my psyche (psyche)
It's hot as hell, we'll wear the ice
You in God's Country, not in Montgomery
Go Ted Bundy, then go home and play Al Bundy
The card black and you know it got a sky limit
I make a mill' every-, you decide, choice is yours
The butterfly reflect the doors
I hit the gas and metamorph
Couldn't get this shit off credit score
Hunnid thousand, pack the fans
Got 'em jumpin' with no hands (hands)
Need more spaces where we jam (jam)
In God's Country with the fam
Yeah, whoa

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
