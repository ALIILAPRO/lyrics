		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the rain on my happy days (ooh)
Dark cloud, you're the storm in the rain (ooh)

An intoxicated storm
If there's sunshine let me know
All my thoughts move in the darkness of pouring rain

Downpour of our storm
My soul is torn

Should I pretend like we're just dancing in the sunlight?
I'm done waiting everyday until I realize

You're the rain on my happy days (ooh)
Dark cloud, you're the storm in the rain (ooh)

Steppin' away, steppin' away, steppin' away from this vibe
Hidden away, hidden away, hidden away were your lies
Kill every happy thought that was inside
Kill any hope that I had in my life
I'm sick 'cause you wasted my time, inside my skies

Should I pretend like we're just dancing in the sunlight?
I'm done waiting everyday till I realize

You're the rain on my happy days (ooh)
Dark cloud, you're the storm in the rain (ooh)

If there's blood in the water the sharks will know
My happier thoughts are the place I roam
Hope for this rain to wash out the history, history
I'll find my happy place, oh my happy place
I'll find my happy place, oh my happy place

You're the rain on my happy days (ooh)
Dark cloud you're the storm in the rain (ooh)
