Free all my lil' homies, they was goin' insane (woo-hoo)
Couple of new niggas tryna join the gang (woo-hoo)
Tell me he a stepper and he tryna hang (woo-hoo)
I did not believe it 'til I seen him bang (phew, woo-hoo)
Creepin' down the street, I'm poppin' out a pane (brrt)
The homie died, can't let his name go out in vain (woo-hoo)
Pussy ain't no Blood, he never seen a flame (woo-hoo)
Tweakin' out, I feel that Molly throbbin' in my veins
Hmm, hmm, hmm (okay), hmm (psh), hmm (psh)
Hmm, hmm (okay), hmm (psh), hmm (psh)

My baby a real geeker (huh, yeah, hm)
Baby off a sixty (Perky), lookin' pissy (yeah)

Caught them boys in person, shit got sticky, yeah
Fuckin' up a sack on that pussy (damn)

Yeah, yeah (psh, go)

Gimme the light (go)
Gimme the light (what?)
Gimme the light (what?)
Gimme that, uh (yeah)

I'm in the back of the Benz, I'm in the back with twins (yeah)
Bendin' the back on Wock', never been sippin' on Gin (okay)
I put diamonds in my mouth when I grin
You ain't gon' get back, pussy, take it on the chin (yeah)

Gimme the light (yeah, okay)
Gimme the light (yeah, phew)
Gimme the light (hmm, okay)
Gimme the light (brrt)
Gimme the light (hmm, yeah)
Gimme that

Yeah
