		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep playing scenes over in my head
Of all of the ways we could've ended
I never chose this
If only we'd opposed it

We keep burning words
Like they might never end
Writing pages we're never sending
Living in the past tense
It's tearing us apart and I'm just

Staring at a stranger's floor
Cos we declared open war
Open war
Just settling scores
I'm staring at my feet
But I don't wanna leave
Cos now you just gone
And now it's just me
So why don't we fight some more
Cos we declared open war

And fuck it's been a week
It feels like such a long time
It's messing with my state of mind
Pretending like I got this
But falling into darkness
I'm just

Staring at a stranger's floor
Cos we declared open war
Open war
Just settling scores
I'm staring at my feet
But I don't wanna leave
Cos now you just gone
And now it's just me
So why don't we fight some more
Cos we declared open war

So tell me what you meant
Just saying words until the end
Broken like we'll never mend
I'm doing what you're asking
Leaving the apartment
I'm just marching on
Moving down another path
Trying to forget our past
And I'm pretending like I got this
But falling into darkness
I'm just

Staring at a stranger's floor
Cos we declared open war (Cos we declared open war)
Open war
Just settling scores
I'm staring at my feet
But I don't want to leave
Cos now you just gone
And now it's just me
So why don't we fight some more
Cos we declared open war

And I keep playing scenes
Over in my head
Of all of the ways we could've ended
