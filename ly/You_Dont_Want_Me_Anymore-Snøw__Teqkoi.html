		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes the truth hurts more than the lie 
My feelings for you, they’ll never die 
You say I’m perfect then won't it be worth it to try Again
You’re going through shit just don’t make excuses 
You don’t want me anymore 
Anymore 
Anymore
Anymore 
And you say you love me but tell him you want him 
You say you’re sorry but then go look for him 
You got me so fucked up 
You got me so fucked up 
And maybe if we met a different time 
Things would be different now
Things would be different now 
And maybe if we met at a different time 
Things would be different now
Things would be different now
