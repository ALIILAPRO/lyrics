		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Really made a way when it wasn't a way to be made

Can't get crazy 'bout it, I ain't gon' play about it
Not a broad, bro, I'm talkin' 'bout this paper
You can play if you want to
I let 'em say what they want to, I'm ready for all of this shit
No matter how hard it can get
That boy on the top of the list
I put up a wall and block all of this shit
Stay on my feet, I can't fall a lil' bit
They killed my man, we was all a lil' sick
Tryna get to a point where we all can get rich
Go all the way, ain't no stoppin' this shit
They respect it of course, but it's still a lil' tension (hold on)
Still in the cut, I just darken the tints (hold that)
There's a trophy on every last one of my wrists
Take care of every last one of my bitches
I fuck around, put my heart in this shit, but you sold out
Fuck I look like letting you get over?
I never talk on the pillow
Can't get a bond, they get bailed out
How many you chargin' to mail out?
Soon as they land, we gon' sell out
Hope vacuum seals keep the smell out
Snitch on the gang, you a sellout
I tried to tell 'em to "Chill out"
Beat all the trials, you can get out
Keep that shit on when you step out
It's only goin' one way, seven mill' in one day
Run it up and invest in shit
Heart broke when they made him sick
Can't find time for relationships
Van Cleef, Cartier bracelets
I'm a shootin' star, you can make a wish
Startin' to feel like I was made for this
If they don't, I will, I see life for what it is
Count and spend a dub on a crib
Make some more time for my kid
Everybody solid who I'm with
Spend it when it's time to get spent (spend it)
Send 'em when it's time to get sent (send it)
Uh, Baby made a way for himself
They want credit for shit they ain't did
She back outside, I'm in the field
If I catch you, you know what it is
That's right, she get the biz' (I don't play)
Yeah right, you in the middle (I don't play)
You get left there for straddlin' the fence (stupid)
I'm prepared for whatever they send

Yeah, I'm know where I'm goin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah

They think I'm crazy the way that I'm spendin' this money
I ain't goin' out like Mike Tyson
I'm in that mode, super cool on you friendly-ass hoes
If I like her, she gotta be feisty
Why every time that I turn around, one of these rappin'-ass niggas be actin' just like me?
In the back of the Maybach, I'm sightseein'
My lil' nigga still robbin', free Shiesty (free bro)
I went all the way there on a boat, I ain't stoppin'
I'm all the way up on the low, I can pop it
You niggas can't get it, I'm first when they drop it
My billionaire partner just told me to step on 'em (don't stop)
Can't turn my back on nobody that's there for me
I ain't trippin' on you, bae, don't trip on me
All this money don't make me the big homie
Put in work, got the hood on steroids
This for the times we had no lights and no water
Mama stressin' herself to make ends meet
I done went on a sixty month winnin' streak
Brodie wanted for murder, this shit deep
I be always on go, barely get sleep (nah)
Love my family to death, but we barely speak
I be all around the globe, makin' sure we eat (forever)
Really know what I'm doin', I'm from the streets

Yeah, I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
I know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Know what I'm doin', they callin' me crazy
Yeah
