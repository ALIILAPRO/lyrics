		<p>
		  Oh, oh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (no, no)
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (no)
Uh, uh, uh

Used to hit the block and serve
Work the rock like Kyrie Irv'
Link up with gang, like, what's the word?
Pull up, skrrt, switchin' lanes might jump the curb
And, yeah, bitch, I'm really him, put that on fire, fuck what you heard
Got three .50s, that's 150, ain't no limit, I fuck with Herb
Lil' kids turned grown men, we come from cribs dysfunctional
Gotta learn how to play your own hand, don't ever get too comfortable
That's lil' shit, he can think he hot 'til them real killers come and humble you
All day, tell 'em, "Spin the block," 'til your best friend laying under you
Know 'bout late nights and that hunger
Know 'bout rainy days and that thunder
I know lil' niggas on slime shit, no Young Thugs and Gunnas
We was in the field, Glock kick back, we gon' kick it off like punters
I'm Too Turnt Gang, got five in me, I ain't never been no runner (bitch)

I can't ever go back to the way shit was (oh, oh, oh, no)
I done really came from nothing, now I got everything that I want
I can't ever go back to the way shit was (no)
I done came too far, put that on everything I love
Roaches in the crib, mama on drugs (uh, no)
I can't let it go back to the way that it was
I can't never go back (no, oh)
I can't never, I can't never
I can't never, I can't never, oh

I come from the muddiest part of the trenches 
Where niggas are dyin' today
Niggas into it with you but niggas gon' hang
In clique and be in the way (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd rather be on the case and stay in the mix 
Than be in a nigga case (be in a nigga case)
I don't sneak diss, the shit I tell my dawg 
The shit I'll say in your face (say in a nigga face)
Perc' got Fentanyl on 'em, he still want him a sixty (want him a sixty)
I took my brother Ruger and told him think and I gave him a .50 (oh)
That backdoor cool where I'm from, that shit new in the city (oh, oh, oh)
And y'all be hanging and playing the game together, you know you snitchin' (oh, oh, oh)
I be tired of losing my niggas to niggas who knew the killer (who knew the killer)
Threw up my guts, I seen that footage
You don't know that feeling (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't hang with my niggas, homies dolo
I don't know them niggas (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why they play with me on IG like we lame? They know we killers, yeah

I can't ever go back to the way shit was (oh, oh, oh, no)
I done really came from nothing, now I got everything that I want
I can't ever go back to the way shit was (no)
I done came too far, put that on everything I love
Roaches in the crib, mama on drugs (uh, no)
I can't let it go back to the way that it was
I can't never go back (no, oh)
I can't never, I can't never
I can't never, I can't never, oh
