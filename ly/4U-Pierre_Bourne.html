		  Yo, you know what I'm sayin'?
A lil 'somethin' is what I'm sayin 
Don't feel no way
(Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

If you're getting mad, you're supposed to (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'ma get this bag, then I don't know you (damn, damn, damn, damn)
If I ain't have this bag (you wanna come out here?)
Would you want to? (Psh, woo, psh)
Huh, lookin 'in the mirror (yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?)
But I can't tell what you go through (yeah, damn, damn, damn)
