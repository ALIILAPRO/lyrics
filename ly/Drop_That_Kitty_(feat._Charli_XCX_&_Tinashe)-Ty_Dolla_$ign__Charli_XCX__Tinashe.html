		  Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Shop that like a window
I'm gonna make you explode
Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Take that video phone
Drop that kitty down low

Drop that kitty down low
Pop it like a pistol
Make it clap for a stack
Don't forget to look back, no
Ass up, face down
Give it to me, give it to me now
Send me the pics and the videos
Ooh she so material, here we go
Here we go, I got a bad one
Now shake that if you got a fat one
Pour it up and spill it out
Let a boss pour it in your mouth, girl
Who is she? She's not with me
She the type of chick in the club every week, oh work that
Told her drop it to the ground and bring it back

Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Shop that like a window
I'm gonna make you explode
Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Take that video phone
Drop that kitty down low

I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin', drop that kitty down low
I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin', drop that kitty down low

Shake, shake, shake it like a salt shaker
She goin' hard like a jawbreaker
Dress fittin' on that body like wallpaper
I want it right now, not later
Left right, left right, girl get it, get it
Bring it right here, hey kitty, kitty
Stop playin' with it
The kitty good? I'm stayin' with it
One hunnid, yeah everything one hunnid
I got a pitbull, make the kitty run from it
Give it that work, I'm playin' with the kitty and it ain't got fur
Money long, my money long
You ain't worry bout it girl, you got your own
Yeah, independent
Drop it to the ground and get it, get it

Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Shop that like a window
I'm gonna make you explode
Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Take that video phone
Drop that kitty down low

I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin', drop that kitty down low
I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin', drop that kitty down low

Come a little closer, come be my boy

Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Shop that like a window
I'm gonna make you explode
Drop that kitty down low
Pop that kitty down low
Take that video phone
Drop that kitty down low

I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin', drop that kitty down low
I know you want it all, I'm giving you a show
You like what I'm doin', drop that kitty down low
