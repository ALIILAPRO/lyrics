		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when we're still one
Your laugh, your voice and your bright eyes
We're together in this love
Promised we'll forever
And now you left me alone
'Cause you find someone better
You're in that way with her
And one thing I know

You break my heart, break my hope
Make me so down in a loneliness
You left me when I'm deep
Thought you are my best scene
Being my prince, but I was wrong
Baby, you change a pink into the blue

And what does it mean, all the things that we have written?
The great conversation and a beautiful future
Perfect definition of sadly flower

You break my heart, break my hope
Make me so down in a loneliness
You left me when I'm deep
Thought you are my best scene
Being my prince, but I was wrong
Oh, baby, you change a pink into the blue

Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
(Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)

You break my heart, break my hope
Make me so down in a loneliness
You left me, you left me when I'm in love
(Thought you are my best scene)
(Being my prince) I was wrong 
(But I was wrong) I was wrong, oh

I was wrong (I was wrong)
I was wrong (I was wrong)
I was wrong (I was wrong)
Ah, why do I fall in you?
