		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I swear I'ma keep it real, tell you how I feel
Only squad I trust, for my squad, I bust
You be honest, be for real, that's how you feel
I'm touring on my tour bus, smoking la, la, la
I don't care how you feel, that's how I feel
I'm higher than the stars and you like blah, blah, blah
I swear I just wanna chill, and smoke some kill
And watch my numbers just rise, rise, rise

For the squad I bust, for the squad she bust
I used to be broke, well, not anymore
I got racks all in my drawers, I got racks all on the floor
I think that I'm shit so I blow hunnas out my nose
I throw fifties on a bitch, six-fifty on my kicks
Couple thousands on a shirt
For my pants five-hundred bills, my belt fifteen-hundred bills
It's just the 300 here
You know we throw hundreds here
Strip clubs, they love us there
Words of Ben Franklin, in God I trust
And when it goes down, in my squad I trust
I swear you'll never find a squad like us
A squad that shine bright in the dark like us
Because we the Glory Boyz, we just hope you know that
We full of ignorance and we a bunch of shooters
We the Glory Boyz, we just hope you know that
We full of ignorance and we a bunch of shooters, yeah

I swear I'ma keep it real, tell you how I feel
Only squad I trust, for my squad, I bust
You be honest, be for real, that's how you feel
I'm touring on my tour bus, smoking la, la, la
I don't care how you feel, that's how I feel
I'm higher than the stars and you like blah, blah, blah
I swear I just wanna chill, and smoke some kill
And watch my numbers just rise, rise, rise
Yeah

I swear I'ma keep it real, tell you how I feel
Only squad I trust, for my squad, I bust
You be honest, be for real, that's how you feel
I'm touring on my tour bus, smoking la, la, la
I don't care how you feel, that's how I feel
I'm higher than the stars and you like blah, blah, blah
I swear I just wanna chill, and smoke some kill
And watch my numbers just rise, rise, rise, yeah
