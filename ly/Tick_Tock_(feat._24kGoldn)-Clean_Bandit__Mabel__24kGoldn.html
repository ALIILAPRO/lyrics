		  Tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, tick tock

I don't need no other, I'm satisfied
Doing it on my own
Only takes one lover to change your vibe
Ain't that the way it go
I don't need nobody, but you on replay
Caught in the memory
When you touch my body and you say my name
Giving me what I need (tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

Every minute, so lost in it
Like you're in my bed
Every hour, give you power
I'm losing mine instead (tick tock, tick tock)

24/7 got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day
But my head is screaming, "go away" (tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
24/7 got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day
I'm losing all control of me

Na na na na na (tick tock)
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na (tick tock)
Na na na na na na na

(Hey) 24/7, I got a place with your name on it
Just in case you decided you comin' out, mmm
No time for thinking, too busy dancing and drinking
Know you been meaning to get up out of your house, mmm
Baby, throw that Fendi on the floor
Addicted to your loving, need some more
Heard you want my body, I want yours
You already know that I already know

24/7 got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day (and day)
But my head is screaming, "go away" (away)
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)
24/7 got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day (and day)
I'm losing all control of me (of me)

Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na

Every minute, so lost in it
Like you're in my bed
Every hour, give you power
I'm losing mine instead

Tick tock, mmm
Tick tock, tick tock, mmm
Tick tock, yeah
(Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock)

24/7 got you on my mind
Think about you all the time
My body wants you night and day
But my head is screaming, "go away"
24/7 got you on my mind
Darling, I don't have the time
My body wants you night and day (night and day)
I'm losing all control of me (yeah yeah)

Na na na na na (tick tock)
Na na na na na na na (tick tock, tick tock)
Na na na na na na na (tick tock)
Na na na na na na na (got me losing all control of me)
Na na na na na (tick tock)
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Tick tock, yeah
