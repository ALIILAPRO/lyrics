		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love the way you say my name
You say it with so much shade
And you walk around nose up, looking down
Running your mouth 'cause you love how you sound

While I sit here, listening to your rambling
Another evening of feeding your self-centered being
So here's my lullaby

So, fuck you and you and you
You think you're so cool
Like you've done something new
You spend your whole life manipulating minds
To make you feel alive
Repeating the same lines

So um, fuck you and you and you
You think you're so brave and that I need to behave
You think you're so indispensable, so exceptional
Try to tell me I'm too emotional
No, no
You think you're so right

You say I overthink
Another lie, I know just what you're doing
You keep walking around acting like you're proud
When in reality, you're about to break down

So I sit here, witnessing it all unraveling
Another evening of feeding your self-centered being
So here's my lullaby

So, fuck you and you and you
You think you're so cool
Why don't you try something new
You spent your whole life manipulating minds
To make you feel alive
Repeating the same lines

So um, fuck you and you and you
You think you're so brave and that I need to behave
You think you're so indispensable, so exceptional
Try to tell me I'm too emotional
No, no 
You think you're so

Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck you
Fuck 

Huh, ah-ah-ah, la-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, oh, da-da-da, mm
