		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two oceans in between us
And away for sure
There's a gate I see
There's a way for me
Now this one sits here
And whispers things to me
Now I got the Devil inside
This one made a pig of me
This world is primal
My grinding jaw
The headache pill
The necktie on my bedroom door
My conscience burning
My eyes are too
Cuddled up with a heart condemned
I should love you and I swear I do

This world is rabid
This world is through
Follow me through an empty dream
I'm sleeping next to someone new
My conscience burning
My beastly flaw
The headache pill
The necktie on my bedroom door
And I'm such a coward
These wretched things I do
Disgrace and treachery
I'm a sickness and I know it's true
This world is learning
This world is pure
But she could be my Valentine
Underneath my sheets on the bedroom floor

Gonna push her down
Gonna spread her out
Gonna taste her tan
Gonna suck her fat
Gonna hold her back
Then the shameful slack
Gonna wake up dry

I don't have anything
