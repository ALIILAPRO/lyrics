		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm going in for the kill, mmm mmm (It's Tekky)
I'm doing it for a thrill
Ohh, I'm hoping you'll understand (Whyjay)
And not let go of my-

You'd better mind out, we're still here inside the 9

Yo, no privilege, but I had a option
To never be stuck up on the block then
More money, more problems
We don't get along like Arsenal, Tottenham
Everybody wanna hate now, but fuck them
Gyal from North London said I made it
Big Russian, must come in function
Still make a rich man haffa back it and aim it
Chop it and shave it
Haters, nearly had a strop on my saving
I've popped and now they can't face it
Chased it, chased it until just made it, ooh (ooh)
'Member when I couldn't buy food (food)
'Member gyal lookin' up smooth (smooth)
Lambo truck on the move (buh)
Should've rolled out in the proof

But all of these guys wan' tek 'way my life (grrt, grrt)
But all of these gyal wan f with the 9 (mmm mmm)
And my new ends, the percentage of crime (boom)
You better mind out, we'll still close with the 9 (buh, buh, buh, buh)

But all of these guys wan' tek 'way my life (grrt, grrt)
But all of these gyal wan f with the 9 (mmm mmm)
And my new ends, the percentage of crime (boom)
You better mind out, we'll still close with the 9 (buh, buh, buh, buh)

Prada always treat me and my set like Gianfranco Zola
In N9, see me, I'm like Pep Guardiola (buh)
Even on street, see me was a soldier
Say they wanna be like me when he's older
All this crud that my knees went weak
Man I put all my weight in a Rover
You can never be like me, no
Made a quarter milli' last week, shows (mmm)
Of course I gotta keep the right team close
Why they wanna see me D-I-E?
They know I ain't far from a beast
Run, everybody, run from police (buh)
All these brothers all talk in the streets (pussies)
Brothers say they involved in the beef
Tom Ford suit now I'm feelin' all trendy
'Member when the wallet was empty (money)
Copped these boots, feel Edouard Mendy
Real black brother in Chelsea
No talk, I'll stay out field
I feel more hungry, makin' a meal
I was so broke, couldn't pay for the bill
Course I'm goin' in straight for the kill (buh, buh, buh, buh)

But all of these guys wan' tek 'way my life (grrt, grrt)
But all of these gyal wan F with the 9 (mmm mmm)
And my new ends, the percentage of crime (boom)
You better mind out, we'll still close with the 9 (buh, buh, buh, buh)

But all of these guys wan' tek 'way my life (grrt, grrt)
But all of these gyal wan f with the 9 (mmm mmm)
And my new ends, the percentage of crime (boom)
You better mind out, we'll still close with the 9 (buh, buh, buh, buh)

Old times in the ends
We were just ridin' on them
I looked the judge in the eye
And I just lied for my friend
I listen to these UK rappers
And they just lyin' again (you liar)
I'm a rocker, I got bare haters
But I got fire fi dem
When we was young bruk fellas
Everybody was breddas (Mad)
It was cool 'til we made it, then everybody got jealous
I didn't get a dime from the block
Whether you like it or not (mmm)

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Ohh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my-

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
Ohh, I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my-

(Boo ahh)
