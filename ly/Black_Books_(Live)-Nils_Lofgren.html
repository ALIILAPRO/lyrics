		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One last time from Freddy's joint
We drove out to lover's point
Shared our last kiss eye to eye
Spoke of tender times long past
Said they weren't meant to last
Too many different dreams to satisfy

She wants
New shoulders to cry on
New backseats to lie on
And she always gets her way
She wants to see other guys
Get lost in other eyes
Baby's in the black books
Yes she's in the black books today

I've yet to find a dreary bar
Where whispers don't drift from afar
About her wild and wicked ways
The hardest truths don't have a why
Often true love will just die
And leave a grief to haunt
The lonely nights and days

She wants
New shoulders to cry on
New backseats to lie on
And she always gets her way
She wants to hurt other guys
Put tears in other eyes 
Baby's in the black books
Yes she's in the black books today

She wants to hurt other guys
Put tears in other eyes
Baby's in the black books
Yes she's in the black books today
