		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brenda, Brenda
You can call him with your agendas
He the father, send your sins up
To the alter, Heaven rinse us
Praise the Lord

They just had to let the beast go
Never liked it peaceful, should've never gave you people
Access to key codes, now the spirits in the buildin'
Story that the priest told, or how the heat throw
With Timbs and a peacoat, I know what the streets know
Who you think I speak for? Lotus got that juice
Nasty like Tampico, crafty with the lingo
Flashy with the jewels, but never test the fuel
'Cause I don't think you'd do well, find me on Pulaski
Catfish that do wells, or on my way to Cali
Like James with the two Ls, that's it in a nutshell
Nothin' sweet, blue bell, she just recess
Didn't you hear the school bell? Fresh, yeah, new smell
Mindstate do tell, high stakes and screw face
Stay open like I'm two twelves, Beethoven with the papyrus
Energy, catalyst, rattlin' your clavicle
Count me in, advocates, calamities, upwards
Over average buzz words, the expletive expert
Without usin' cuss words

Brenda, Brenda (yeah, State)
You can call him with your agendas
He the father, send your sins up
To the alter, Heaven rinse us
Praise the Lord

Spirit got my diction open, pit of fire, sea of smoke and
Pullin' from a place that's broken, glued together, that's the notion
I will only spew the truth, be the light, teach the youth
The basement days are over now, far from when I claimed uncouth
Those who really know me, caught that line like it's an L-train
Never did it for fame, mostly use my right brain
Spiritually in balance, like I practice Kundalini
Close to goin' veggie, make my pasta with zucchini
I live my life Jamaica, meanin' every ting gets irie
Searchin for the soul? Then I recommend you try me
Abstract is the mindstate, and mindstate will continue
Pushin' culture forward with this music, true essentials
Who He, where He sent you? God don't make mistakes here
Baptise you in lyrics, y'all gon' stay awake here
I know what's at stake here, we ain't talkin' red meat
I'm talkin' evolution, we evolve you from the deadbeat

Brenda, Brenda
You can call him with your agendas
He the father, send your sins up
To the alter, Heaven rinse us
Praise the Lord
