		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm edging closer, shivers all over
It's way too real, I'm way too sober
Usually they've got you covered all over
Lack of composure, I'm walking over
What will I do?
I never had a chance to

There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion

Trying to be patient, I'm feeling ancient
Trying to control but the wave that I'm facing
Suppose that I didn't care anymore
Fate can decide, I can ignore
I'll just pretend that I always knew
That I had the chance to

There's no one else around you
I've done all this waiting, vision ever fading
Making such a promise
Only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talk about it highly
Try to stay in motion

It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles in overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

It made my heart run in circles and overflow
And I was closer than ever to letting go
It made my heart run in circles in overdrive
And I was closer than ever to feeling alive

There's no one else around you
Not that I was waiting, vision ever fading
Heading for the deep end
Soon as I remember, baby, I surrender
I just need to breathe out
Decisions are approaching, reality in motion
Let's not think about it
Put your arms around me, I can sense you doubt me
You don't need to promise
That only leads to heartache, closer to an earthquake
Talk about it highly
All that's left to do, all that's left to do
