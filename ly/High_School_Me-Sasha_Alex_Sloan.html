		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The only color I wear is black
'Cause someone at school said you look fat
The boy you like doesn't like you back
But it won't always be like that

I won't say it all gets better
But fifteen doesn't last forever

If high school me could see me now
I bet high school me would be so proud, she'd find out
The cool kids, they ain't everything
The world is so much bigger then her town
If high school me could see me now

You drink just 'cause you think you should
But it never makes you feel that good
And you gave away your innocence
Only 'cause he talked you into it

I won't say it all gets better
But fifteen doesn't last forever

If high school me could see me now
I bet high school me would be so proud, she'd find out
The cool kids, they ain't everything
The world is so much bigger then her town
If high school me could see me now

See me now, wish she could see me now
See me now, see me now
See me now, wish she could see me now
See me now, see me now

If high school me could see me now
I bet high school me would be so proud, she'd find out
The cool kids, they ain't everything
The world is so much bigger then her town
If high school me could see it then
I bet she'd feel better in her skin, she'd begin
To see the things that all go wrong
Are things that she'll be writing songs about
If high school me could see me now

See me now, wish she could see me now
See me now
If high school me could see me now
See me now, wish she could see me now
See me now, see me now

Wish I could go back, tell her it's okay
(Tell her it's okay)
Wish I could go back, tell her it's okay
(Tell her it's okay)
