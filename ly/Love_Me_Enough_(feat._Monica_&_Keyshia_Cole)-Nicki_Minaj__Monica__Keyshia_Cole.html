		  Ooh
Monica and Keyshia Cole 

I used to think love had to hurt
So I'd do shit to make it worse
Got off on the toxic words
I used to think love had to hurt

But, lately
I've been thinkin', maybe
No one needs to save me
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all
And, lately
They've been tryna change me
But that shit don't faze me
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all

Uh, ayy, yo
I used to think my happiness depended on a man (a man)
Diamond on the ring finger blingin' on my hand (my hand)
Sativa or indica, it don't matter what the strain
The worst drug of all, the addiction to a man (a man- ooh)
Insecure, real jealous, bitter little man (a man)
Cursin', beat a woman, but he never hit a man (a man)
Man, yeah, you such a man, damn (a man)
Like Tina in a limo, well, bitch had to go ham, scram (aah)
Fuck I look like? (Brrt) I wish I would like (yeah)
Wasted a couple years now I'm good like (yeah)
It's worth the pain, I'ma still have a good life
Still be a great mother, still be a good wife

I used to think love had to hurt (used to)
So I'd do shit to make it worse
Got off on the toxic words
I used to think love had to hurt

But, lately
I've been thinkin', maybe
No one needs to save me
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all (all of y'all)
And, lately
They've been tryna change me (ooh)
But that shit don't faze me (ooh)
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all

Uh, ayy, yo
I don't need bitter betty's to believe me (ooh, yeah)
And I don't care how media to percieves me
I just do it for the girls who ain't never had it easy (ooh)
The woman who conceived me, the girl in the mirror that just cries when she sees me (oh)
Easy, I'm breezy
Finger on the trigger yellin', "Squeeze me, relieve me" (oh)
I thought that everyone who loved me would leave me
But, fuck that, I love this new chic named Me-Me (I love)
First things first, all my girls, know your worth
Self-love is the greatest love on earth (yeah) 
Cry your eyes out, get it out, it's the worst
But love don't hurt, no

I used to think love had to hurt (used to)
So I'd do shit to make it worse
Got off on the toxic words
I used to think love had to hurt

But, lately
I've been thinkin', maybe
No one needs to save me
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all (all of y'all)
And, lately
They've been tryna change me (ooh)
But that shit don't faze me (ooh)
'Cause I love me enough for all of y'all

Love me enough, love me enough, love me enough for all of y'all (I love)
Love me enough, love me enough, love me enough for all of y'all (all of y'all)
All of y'all, all of y'all, all of y'all, all love for y'all (all of y'all)
All of y'all, all of y'all, all of y'all, all love

Oh, baby, don't you play
Wipe your pretty little face
Let 'em say what they say
Oh, baby, walk away (ooh)
Oh, baby, don't you play
Wipe your pretty little face
Let 'em say what they say
Celebrate you walked away
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate you walked away (celebrate)
Celebrate, celebrate (you walked away, yeah), celebrate you walked away (oh)

Walked away
I gotta celebrate, we gotta celebrate
Walked away, c'mon, woo
