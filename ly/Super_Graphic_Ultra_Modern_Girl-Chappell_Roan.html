		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what they say
Never waste a Friday night on a first date
But there I was, in my heels with my hair straight
And so I take him to this bar, this man wouldn't dance
He didn't ask a single question
And he was wearing these fugly jeans
It doesn't matter though
He doesn't have what it takes to be with a girl like me

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk
Wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me

Telling secrets there on the mattress
Wearing nothing but glitter and lashes
At every party we're the party, shaking our asses
Making out while the world collapses

Not overdramatic, I know what I want
We're leaving the planet and you can't come

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk
Wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me (shake it for me)

Get up off your feet, get up on that bar
Walk that walk from Tokyo to New York
With everything you feel and everything you are
Walk that walk, flash the camera
Flash the camera, flash the camera, you're a star

Uh-huh, I'm through
With all these hyper mega bummer boys like you
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern girl like me
We're hot, we're drunk
Wow, look at her moving, baby, she's the one
Oh yeah, I need
A super graphic ultra modern
Ooh, you got me la-la-la-ing
Hyper-sexy top to bottom girl like me
