		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been through all five stages
Grieving comes in phases
Swear I see you in the crowd
And in somebody else
Know it's been two years now
But I still don't know how
I can leave us in the ground
Six feet down
I still think about you all the time, and it's strange
'Cause none of my friends even know your name

If you died today, my life wouldn't change
'Cause you haven't been in it since the night you walked away
Would your mother call? Would I even know at all?
Even though we're strangers now, I know my heart would break
If you died today

Turned from all I wanted, into something haunted
Faster than the word "Goodbye" ever crossed my mind
It's not fair, I swear, you're right there
Every time I close my eyes

But if you died today, my life wouldn't change
'Cause you haven't been in it since the night you walked away
Would your mother call? Would I even know at all?
Even though we're strangers now, I know my heart would break
If you died today (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
If you died today (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

If you died today, my life wouldn't change
'Cause I already miss you like I'm sitting at your grave
Your mom wouldn't call and it wouldn't be her fault
I hate how I'd find out from an old friend ten days late
Even though we're strangers now, I know my heart would break
If you died today
