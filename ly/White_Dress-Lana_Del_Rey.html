		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun, stare, don't care with my head in my hands
Thinking of a simpler time
Like Sun Ra, feel small but I
Had it under control every time

When I was a waitress
Wearing a white dress
Look how I do this
Look how I got this
I was a waitress
Working the night shift
You were my man
Felt like I got this

Down at the men in music business conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the men in music business conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Summer, sizzling, listening to
Jazz out on the lawn
Listened to white stripes
When they were white-hot
Listening to rock all day long

When I was a waitress
Wearing a tight dress
Handling the heat
I wasn't famous
Just listening to Kings of Leon to the beat
Like look how I got this
Look how I got this
Just sing in the street
Down at the men in music business conference
I felt free 'cause I was only nineteen
Hey hey
Such a scene

Summer's, summer's almost gone
We were talkin' 'bout life
We were sitting outside 'til dawn
But I would still go back
If I could do it all again I'd fly
Because it made me feel
Made me feel like a god
'Cause it made me feel
Made me feel like a god
Somehow it made me feel
Made me feel like a god

When I was a waitress
Wearing a white dress
Look how I do this
Look how I got this
When I was a waitress
Working the night shift
You were my man
Felt like I got this

Down at the men in music business conference
Down in Orlando, I was only nineteen
Down at the men in music business conference
I only mention it 'cause it was such a scene
And I felt seen
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

When I was a waitress
Wearing a tight dress
Like look how I do it
Look how I got this
I was a waitress
Wearing a tight dress
Like look how I do this
Look how I got this

Made me feel
Made me feel like a god
It kinda makes me feel
Like maybe I was better off
Because it made me feel
Made me feel like a god
Kinda makes me feel
Like maybe I was better off
