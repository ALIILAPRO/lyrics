		  Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh

Speak it all the time, speak it all the time
And I'll never tell you what is mine
I don't know what it means, but I see it, it's fine
It's hardly any other it can bother inside

Think it all the time, think it all the time
And I'll never tell you what is mine
I don't know what it is but when I see it, it's fine
It's hardly any other it can bother inside
Ooh, ah, yeah

Being myself makes me feel like I can't touch the ground
Here on the Earth makes me feel like I can't get the sound
Being myself makes me feel like I know who you are, mm
'Cause boy you can be with the words who you are, who you are
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
I don't want to let you go
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Oh, you're all I need know
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Oh, you could be a better friend
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
'Cause I could be a better man yeah

Some days, you know, you know that I wonder why (up and down up and down, and down)
Had dream of falling lying upside down whoa

Being myself makes me feel like I don't know the trick mmm
'Cause boy you will be who you want, who you want to be yeah yeah yeah
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Ooh, I don't want to let you go
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Oh, do you need love?
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Oh, you could be a better friend
Ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh, ah uh
Oh, and I could be a better man
