		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Haha, okay, yeah

One, two, check, three bitches on deck
Got four, five diamonds chains, hangin' 'round my neck (ice)
Six karats to my ears, seven hunnid for the rings
I'm a black millionaire, fuck what the Forbes say
I'm a cold-ass rapper, I get hotter by the day
And she know I hit it first but I ain't Ray J
Fuck her with the blindfold but I don't go on blind dates (yeah)
It's me motherfucker, the one niggas love to hate (yeah)

If I fall asleep, better put my chains in the safe
First thing in the mornin', tell that bitch she gotta skate
Don't be mad at me (mad at me)
Don't go bad on me (bad on me)
You ain't my girlfriend (girlfriend)
We just fuckin' buddies (ow)

Girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me (nasty girl)
Girl, shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (ass for me)
Shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (ass for me)
Girl, shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (ass for me)
Shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (nasty girl)

Bitch, drop like it's hot, coupe with that hard top
When I drop, it's a bop, graduated school of hard knocks (yeah)
Bitches hop, slob on my rock, met her friend, swap
Lick the mop, move your crop top, make your titties pop
I like when the bitch act bougie and she ghetto (woo)
My type of bitch that don't even say, "Hello" (hello)
Married to the game, I don't need a wedding ring, ho
Leave out the backn another bitch at the front door

If I fall asleep, better put my chains in the safe
First thing in the mornin', tell that bitch she gotta skate
Don't be mad at me (mad at me)
Don't go bad on me (bad on me)
You ain't my girlfriend (girlfriend)
We just fuckin' buddies (ayy)

Girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me (nasty girl)
Girl, shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (ass for me)
Shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (ass for me)
Girl, shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (ass for me)
Shake that ass for me (ass for me), shake that ass for me (nasty girl)

Nasty girl
Get low, get low, don't be shy
Nasty girl
