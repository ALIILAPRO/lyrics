		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have often told you stories about the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day

When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
"Come lay with me and love me"
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveller
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you

But those days I thought my eyes had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going round
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune

I can hear the sound
Of a windmill going round
Guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune

I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune
