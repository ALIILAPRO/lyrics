		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a wrong turn this evening
Kinda hope I'd catch you leaving
'Cause part of me is still believing
You'll call me sometime
Heartbreak doesn't come with blueprints
Like fresh snow doesn't come with shoe prints
It won't even take me two drinks
To call you tonight
The grass ain't always greener
And the line is never silver or white

I'm terrified, that I'll look back in ten years time
And still be holding onto every single memory
While you're holding somebody who isn't me
I won't lie, I look for you in strangers eyes
It kills me you don't even care we had to say goodbye
When I know that it'll haunt me
'Til the day I die

Keeping your seat at the table
It's got me feeling less than stable
And I swear to God, it's almost fatal
This cut that you left in my heart
The grass ain't always greener
And the line is never silver or white

I'm terrified, that I'll look back in ten years time
And still be holding onto every single memory
While you're holding somebody who isn't me
I won't lie, I look for you in strangers eyes
It kills me you don't even care we had to say goodbye
When I know that it'll haunt me
'Til the day I die, ohh-ohh
'Til the day I die, ohh-ohh

I'm terrified, that I'll look back in ten years time
And still be holding onto every single memory
While you're holding somebody who isn't me
I won't lie, I look for you in strangers eyes
It kills me you don't even care we had to say goodbye
When I know that it'll haunt me
'Til the day I die
