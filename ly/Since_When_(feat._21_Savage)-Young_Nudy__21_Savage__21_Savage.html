		  Huh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Huh, hahahaha

I know they don't like me
They scared to come try me
They scared to come try me
You try me, I got it
You know that I got it
The pistol is on me, I cock and I pop it
You know I'ma pop it
I'ma aim at yo head and nigga gon' drop it
Y'all niggas gon' drop it
You niggas be playin' you know that we drop shit
My nigga we drop shit
We pull up on opposite, nigga, we pop shit
You know that we pop shit
These niggas callin' 12 but they can't stop this (stop this, nah)
Nah, forreal bitch, nah, forreal, forreal, forreal, forreal, forreal

Zone 6, nah forreal' nigga
Nigga like to sell cocaine and go kill nigga
Trick nigga we rob niggas, nah forreal' nigga
EA, what's the deal nigga? I'm the deal nigga
King of the fuckin' hill nigga
Top of the 'partment, young nigga, boy forreal' nigga
Toe tag, catch a body at a young age
AK, SKs, .38, throw a weight
Glock-9 long way
Y'all niggas dying wit' plate
Shit was crazy back in the day
Y'all cannot last a day
Shit was crazy in my 'partment
You can ask my nigga Tre
Young nigga spraying that thang'
Young nigga havin' a K
Robbin' shit everyday
I swear we weren't havin' our way
Really weren't havin' our way
But we was jus' doin' our thing

I know they don't like me
They scared to come try me
They scared to come try me
You try me, I got it
You know that I got it
The pistol is on me, I cock and I pop it
You know I'ma pop it
I'ma aim at yo head and nigga gon' drop it
Y'all niggas gon' drop it
You niggas be playin' you know that we drop shit
My nigga we drop shit
We pull up on opposite, nigga, we pop shit
You know that we pop shit
These niggas callin' 12 but they can't stop this (stop this, nah)
(Chop, chop chops, chop chops)

I keep a chopstick
One in the head, I already caught it
One to the head, call up the coroner, time to mark it
Y'all niggas cappin', y'all niggas faggots, y'all like to jump dick
4L gang, really a savage I'm not with that opp shit
Say he want smoke, you don't want no smoke, you runnin' to 12
I kept me a Glock, I had to do 5 when I was 12
I'm silent nigga, keep it 100, yeah I'm Shell
He caught a body, he kept it 100, he made bail
I got so many niggas down to roll, nigga, everybody gotta touch green
Y'all niggas be talkin' like hoes, nigga, ain't nann nigga touch me
Got 500 shots in hotbox, we ain't nun but 4 deep
Every time we pull up we wackin' shit, nigga ain't like the police

I know they don't like me
They scared to come try me
They scared to come try me
You try me, I got it
You know that I got it
The pistol is on me, I cock and I pop it
You know I'ma pop it
I'ma aim at yo head and nigga gon' drop it
Y'all niggas gon' drop it
You niggas be playin' you know that we drop shit
My nigga we drop shit
We pull up on opposite nigga we pop shit
You know that we pop shit
These niggas callin' 12 but they can't stop this (stop this, nah)
