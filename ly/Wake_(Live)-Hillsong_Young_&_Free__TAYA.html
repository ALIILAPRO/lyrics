		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At break of day
In hope we rise
We speak Your Name
We lift our eyes
Tune our hearts
Into Your beat
Where we walk
There You'll be

With fire in our eyes
Our lives alight
Your love untamed
It's blazing out
The streets will glow
Forever bright
Your glory's breaking
Through the night

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life
Shining through me everyday

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life
Shining through me everyday

You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever

You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever

With fire in our eyes
Our lives alight
Your love untamed
It's blazing out
The streets will glow
Forever bright
Your glory's breaking
Through the night

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life
Shining through me everyday

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life
Shining through me everyday

You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever

You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever

Forever forever forever
In Your love
Forever forever forever
In Your love
Forever forever forever
In Your love
Forever forever forever
We know that

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life
Shining through me everyday

You will never fade away
Your love is here to stay
By my side, in my life
Shining through me everyday

You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever

You wake within me
Wake within me
You're in my heart forever
