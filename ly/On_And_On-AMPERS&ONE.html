		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ready, no breaks in the moment (hoo)
우리의 race, here we go
따라와 jump into motion
What you want?
What you need?
What you say?

날 믿고서 get it started
걸어 봐 switch on vroom, vroom (no, no)
출발해 come on, let's go
Yeah-yeah

So if you wanna get loose
니 뜻대로 get loose (ayy)
우린 준비 끝 gotta move
Everybody one, two
필요 없어 no rules
나를 따라 take it to the moon (hey)

숨겼던 난 going crazy
마치 hero 새로운 miracle to show
벽을 넘어 봐 knock, knock
We at the door

On, on, on and on
We can start it up, ooh-whoa
너에게 보여줄게
Feel the rush
I'm singing
On on, on and on
We can start it up
달려가 태양을 향해
Oh, let's have some fun

Take my hand, take your chance 니 꿈을 따라가
Here we go 더 위로
Take my hand, do the dance 리듬에 올라타
Here we go 더 뛰어
We go on and on and on and on

Never slow down, never slow down (yah)
터트려 봐 포텐 we poppin', pop
Break the rules 예상 못 할 we vibin' (yah-yah)
Turning point, give it a shot, you know, yeah (yah-yah-yah-yah)
Drop it, drop it, drop it like it's hot, hot

Under pressure, I don't stress out
겁 따윈 몰라 (what's up?)
Nothing lasts forever 휘청거려도 yeah

So if you wanna get loose (loose)
니 뜻대로 get loose
우린 준비 끝 gotta move
Everybody one, two (two)
필요 없어 no rules
나를 따라 take it to the moon (hey)

숨겼던 난 going crazy
마치 hero 새로운 miracle to show
벽을 넘어 봐 knock, knock
We at the door

On, on, on and on
We can start it up, ooh-whoa
너에게 보여줄게
Feel the rush
I'm singing
On, on, on and on
We can start it up
달려가 태양을 향해
Oh, let's have some fun

Ready for the fire
Ready for the fame
또 다른 세계로 we won't stop

Ain't nobody stoppin' us
바삐 뛰어들어 드리워진 검은 (shadow)
땀방울, 그림자조차 널 잡지 못하게 해
준비가 됐으니 that's we
발 닿지 않게 movin'

On, on, on and on
We can start it up, ooh-whoa
너에게 보여줄게
Feel the rush
I'm singing
On, on, on and on
We can start it up
달려가 태양을 향해
Oh, let's have some fun

Take my hand, take a chance 니 꿈을 따라가
Here we go 더 위로
Take my hand, do the dance 리듬에 올라타
Here we go 더 뛰어
We go on and on and on and on
