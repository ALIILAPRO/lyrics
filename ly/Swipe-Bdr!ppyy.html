		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want it then you know that I got it
I ain't gotta show my face because my tattoos iconic
Said I won't goin be shit now I find that ironic
How I blew up super fast but you working at sonic
But I'm tripping on the low end
Might just kick yo door in
Eight up in the four leave the woccy overflowing
Pull up to yo city, I got all the bitches with me
And I leave yo town kinda like Croatoan
Leave me ghosting
Let me skirt off in a phantom
Pull up to the mall taking pictures with a random
If I say I don't like it then my city try to ban em
Everytime I drop a new hit now they say it's they anthem
But shit
All my checks look good in blue
I'm talking bout the money to the Instagram too
When I show you that it's real I can't rock with the fu
If I wear it one time then I'm buying something new
I just swipe swipe
type type
Take his lil bitch I might (might)
Shooting like a movie but we fight fight
On site yeah, on site

But we pop out at the club getting lit on a weekday
Bottles coming in you bitch you think it's my bday
Runnin to the bank back and forth like a relay
Getting what I want in an instant like replay
I give you the facts, I'm not with the he say
I give you the pack in the end you goin repay
I'm hot forever baby I ain't no heatwave
I hop in the whip and we swerve in the Eway like

Leave me ghosting
Let me skirt off in a phantom
Pull up to the mall taking pictures with a random
If I say I don't like it then my city try to ban em
Everytime I drop a new hit now they say it's they anthem
But shit
All my checks look good in blue
I'm talking bout the money to the Instagram too
When I show you that it's real I can't rock with the fu
If I wear it one time then I'm buying something new
I just swipe swipe
type type
Take his lil bitch I might (might)
Shooting like a movie but we fight fight
On site yeah, on site
