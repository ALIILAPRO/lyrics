		  Hmm, hmm-mhm
Hmm-mhm, hmm-mhm
Hmm, hmm-mhm
Hmm-mhm, hmm-mhm-hmm
Hmm-mhm, hmm-mhm
Hmm-mhm, hmm-hmm-hmm

I was a moving thing
Before I was a human being
I was the ice before it melts
I was the tree before it fell
My dear, come near
Do you understand what is happening?

Crawl beneath the earth
To feel the hunger and the thirst
If you could fly and be the bird
Then you would see the forest burn
My dear, come near
Do you understand what is happening?

(Hmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Who is calling me
For the emergency?
(Hmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Who is listening
To the sirens singing?

We are stood and somehow calm
Within the madness of a storm
With no solution for the scared
Tasting pollution in the air
My dear, come near
Do you feel my hand? It is there

(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale
(Exhale) Inhale

(Hmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Who is calling me
For the emergency?
(Hmm, mmm-mmm, mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm)
Who is listening
To the sirens singing?

Take from our world no more
Take from my world no more
Take from our world no more
Take from my world no more
