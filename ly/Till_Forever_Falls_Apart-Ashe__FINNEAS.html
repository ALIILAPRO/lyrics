		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out on our own
Dreaming in a world that we both know
Is out of our control
But if shit hits the fan we're not alone

'Cause you've got me and you know
That I've got you and I know

If the tide takes California
I'm so glad I got to hold ya
And if the sky falls from heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time falling into love
We've been living on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime giving you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever
'Til forever falls apart
'Til forever falls apart

So this is it, that's how it ends
I guess there's nothing more romantic than dying with your friends
And I'm not sorry for myself
I wouldn't wanna spend a minute loving anybody else

'Cause you've got me and you know
That I've got you and I know

If the tide takes California
I'm so glad I got to hold ya
And if the sky falls from heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time falling into love
We've been living on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime giving you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever
'Til forever falls apart

'Til forever falls apart
We never had it from the start
'Til death do us part

If the tide takes California
I'm so glad I got to know ya
And if the sky falls from heaven above
Oh, I know I had the best time falling into love

We've been living on a fault line
And for a while, you were all mine
I've spent a lifetime giving you my heart
I swear that I'll be yours forever
'Til forever falls apart
