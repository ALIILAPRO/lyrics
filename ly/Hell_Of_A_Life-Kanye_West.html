		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the C.P.r.
She gave that old nigga an ulcer
Bitter sweet taste made his gold tooth ache (uh)
Make a knee shake, make a priest faint (uh)
Make a nun cum, make her cremate (uh)
Move downtown cop a sweet space (uh)
Livin' life like we on a sweep stakes (what?)
We headed to hell for heaven's sakes (huh?)
Well I'ma levitate, make the devil wait (yeah)

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You can hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen
You a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gang bang
It's kinda crazy, that's all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lot of niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and
Baby we'll live a hell of a life

One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roll play, 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
Especially if she can't get that dress form Oscar De
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
That's a dress of her back and told her get away
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck wit' the lights on
(Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)
(Fuck wit' the lights, fuck wit' the, wit' the lights on)

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me what you think, we've crossed the line
No more drugs for me
Pussy and religion is all I need
Grand my hand
Baby we'll live a hell of a life

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in the bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life
