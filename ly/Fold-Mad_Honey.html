		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drifting in and out of focus
Headspin, found down on the ground
Wonder where I've been? Ain't seen me
Would change but I already did
Pirouette in a strange formation
Don't wanna get caught in the fold
Don't think too clear so I keep you with me
It's good but nobody knows
Strange days
This time
It's good but no one knows
Drifting in and out of focus
Have you found fault in your fight?
Mind already gone - to have one
Would try but I'm already gone
Pirouette in a strange formation
Don't wanna get caught in the fold
Don't think too clear so I keep you with me 
It's good but nobody knows
Pirouette in a strange direction
Don't wanna get caught in the fold
Don't think too clear, so I keep you with me
It's cruel cause nobody knows
