		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go to that place where I took you last summer before the fall
Where the sky was purple and we drank from the bottle
We felt it all

By the lighthouse on the hill we opened a door to a different world
Leaving everything behind
Just you and I
Open up your eyes

I wish that I could stay here all my life
Just you and I sitting under purple skies

Let's go to that place where I took you last summer on top of the hill
Where the path was golden as it led to the ocean
Quiet and still

By the lighthouse on the hill we opened a door to a different world
Leaving everything behind
Just you and I
Open up your eyes

I wish that I could stay here all my life
Just you and I sitting under purple skies

I wish that I could stay here all my life
Just you and I sitting under purple skies
I wish that I could stay here all my life
Just you and I sitting under purple skies

There is a place nothing compares to but we only know
With a meaning so special
A place that was meant for more than we know
By the lighthouse on the hill we opened a door to a different world
Leaving everything behind
Just you and I
Open up your eyes
