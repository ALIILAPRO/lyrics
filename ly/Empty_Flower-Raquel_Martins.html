		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Empty flower
What's your power
Do you mind 
If I try

Not so common
What about her
Soak it all in camomile
I think about you all the time

Where do we go from here
Why is this song lasting this long
Where do we go from here
Building my walls
Is it wrong though
Where do we go from here

Lonely hour
Tasted sour
I learned to be with my own mind
Still dream about this all the time

I'm changing fast
cnd I'm so done with doing 
What's right everytime
Where do we go, I don't know

Where do we go from here
Why is this song lasting this long
Where do we go from here
Building my walls
Is it wrong though
Where do we go from here

This temporary feeling 
Makes you grow
Building your own freedom
Just hold on
