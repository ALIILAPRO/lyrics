		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't quite tell no-how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I don't understand no-how?
Maybe I should try it now
Or maybe I should be shy of it now-now-now-now-now-now

'Cause you know, you know that I can't explain it
And then you know that it's worth the pain of it
Uh-huh, what is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no-how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I don't understand no-how, new love
Gimme love
Gimme love (love, love, love)
Love-love-love, love
