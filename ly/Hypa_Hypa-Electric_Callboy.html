		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
Move your body, girl, all night long
Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
You're gonna be my girl, all night long

There's a fire on the floor
Anytime you hit the club
Your body moves, hypnotize me
God, I want it
You are my drug
You're everything I want
I would give my soul
For a girl like you at once

Put your hands up
Well let me see you shake your hips
Medicate me
I want that juice on your lips
Yeah, you like that
I wanna know that it's true
You're dancing for me
And I'm living for you

Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
Move your body, girl, all night long
Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
You're gonna be my girl, all night long

And I can't look away
I'm addicted to your smile
Dance for me, dance
Never stop, girl
God, I love it
You are my drug
You make my dreams come true
I would give my life
For a pretty girl like you

Put your hands up
And let me see you shake your hips
Medicate me
I want that juice on your lips
Yeah, you like that
I wanna know that it's true
You're dancing for me
And I'm living for you

You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn the light
You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn, turn, turn on

You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn the light, turn the light, turn the lights on
Wanna rip off your clothes now, baby
Turn the light, turn the light, turn the light

You're alone on the dance floor, baby
Turn the light
Wanna rip off your clothes now, baby
And turn the light

Step by step, getting closer to you
Step by step, getting closer to you
Dance, baby, dance (dance?)
I wanna dance
I'm gonna hit so hard
Imma break down the floor
I wanna dance
Baby, can you see my moves?
Gonna love it
Imma kill it, like I never did before

Hypa, hypa
Hypa, hypa
Hypa, hypa
Hypa

Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
Move your body, girl, all night long
Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
You're gonna be my girl, all night long

Hypa, hypa, you're pretty and I like ya
You're gonna be my girl, all night long

Ugh, god, I want it
