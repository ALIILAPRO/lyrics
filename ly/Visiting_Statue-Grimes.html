		  So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
Bring it all home, bring it all home
Bring it all home (oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)
So, so, so, so, bring it all back

I would start to see that I was scared to see it
Bring it all home, bring it all home,
Bring it all home (oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)

So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
Bring it all home, bring it all home
Bring it all home (oh, oh, I'm a ghost, ghost)

So, so, so, so, bring it all back
I would start to see that I was scared to see it
Bring it all home, bring it all home
Bring it all home (oh, oh, I'm a ghost)
