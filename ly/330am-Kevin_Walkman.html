		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue lights
Colors changing everywhere
Tonight
Said you'd leave alone but I'm still there
Close your eyes
Don't be afraid it's in the air
Tonight
I'll be whatever you need me to weather love
'Cause it's easy to fake it
Don't bother picking up the pieces if you ain't break it
I don't want a text from you at nine a.m.
I don't want to hear a word from you please don't see me again, and
Maybe you're different, maybe you're special
Maybe we'd vibe, we could lay down and cuddle
Maybe there's something if we let it grow
Maybe it's love, guess that we'll never know 'cause
Let's close the blinds, and waste your time
I'm glad you stuck around
You'll be one good distraction, get some action
If you're down
Don't tell me 'bout your problem's bitch
I've heard it all before
I need a fucking band-aid
For a wound that I ignore
So fuck it skip to the good part
I've been eyeing up your body I don't care about your heart
I don't care about my conscience if that ain't so crystal clear
I don't have a reputation, I don't have a fuck to give
Baby I'll pretend we're in love if you're digging it
Thanks for coming you've lost your innocence
Thrill is gone, there's no more time to play
So please don't bother asking me if I'm doing okay, and
Let's close the blinds, and waste your time
I'm glad you stuck around
You'll be one good distraction, get some action
If you're down
Don't tell me 'bout your problem's bitch
I've heard it all before
I need a fucking band-aid
For a wound that I ignore
