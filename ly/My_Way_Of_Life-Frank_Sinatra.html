		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gotta have you near all the time, with your dreams wrapped up in mine.
Gotta be a part of your soul and your heart all the time.
Nothing in the world that I do means a thing without you.
I'm just half alive in my struggle to survive without you.
You are my way of life, the only way I know, you are my way of life.
I'll never let you go, never let you out of my sight, be it day, be it night,
You belong to me, that's the way it will, be wrong or right,
I don't need crowds at my door, the applause from the floor,
All I need is you and the love we once knew, nothing more.
You are my way of life, the only way I know, make me your way of life.
