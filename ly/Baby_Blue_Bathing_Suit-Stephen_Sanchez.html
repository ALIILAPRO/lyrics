		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It feels like yesterday that we were flyin'
Can't go back to her, but I'll keep tryin'

'Cause, the older I get
The more that it's true
That heaven's a girl in a baby blue bathing suit

Oh, my suntanned girl with the freckles and curls
Looks good when she swims in the water
Oh, those deep green eyes, little mean, little nice
Midnights couldn't get any hotter
Give me the big, blue waves and a tan that stays
'Til the good old days are gone 
Let them remind you (ahh)
That summer's a place for
Everyone

I'm daydreaming of you, and it knocks me sideways (oh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We're traveling up and down an endless highway
Whoa

And, the further I get 
The more that it's true
That heaven's a girl in a baby blue bathing suit

Oh, my suntanned girl with the freckles and curls
Looks good when she swims in the water
Oh, those deep green eyes, little mean, little nice
Midnights couldn't get any hotter
Give me the big, blue waves and a tan that stays
'Til the good old days are gone
And let them remind you
That summer's a place for
Everyone

Sweet memories
Oh, they're calling my name
Putting me back to sleep
I wanna dream all day
'Cause summer's the place where I met you
The reason I cannot forget you

Oh, my suntanned girl with the freckles and curls
Looks good when she swims in the water
Oh, those deep green eyes, little motel bride
Midnights couldn't get any hotter
Give me the big, blue waves and a tan that stays
'Til the good old days are gone 
And let them remind you
That summer's a place for
Everyone
