		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been sitting in the shower
It must have been hours
Lights off think they cut the power

Lately I've been sinking way below my normal levels
I been drowning in my sleep while I struggle with my devils
Bury me six feet deep
Somewhere underneath the evergreens in a body bag

Paranoid, paranoid
Every little noise, every little noise
Sends shivers down my spine
Happens all the time
Wake up in a sweat
Claustrophobic in my bed

I confess, I'm a mess, I've become my own antagonist
Lost in a war I'll never win
Sinking like I'm made of lead
Down the hole inside my head
So if I'm too deep, bury me
Underneath the evergreens

I'm still driving all night to clear my head
Kill the noise with a 40 in a paper bag
I'm slipping through cracks of an hourglass
Out of time once again as I sink under sand

Paranoid, paranoid
Every little noise, every little noise
Sends shivers down my spine
Happens all the time
Wake up in a sweat
Claustrophobic in my bed

I confess, I'm a mess, I've become my own antagonist
Lost in a war I'll never win
Sinking like I'm made of lead
Down the hole inside my head
So if I'm too deep, bury me
Underneath the evergreens

I confess

Big yelling noise

Bury me underneath, underneath the evergreens
Bury me underneath, underneath the evergreens

I confess, I'm a mess, I've become my own antagonist
Lost in a war I'll never win
Sinking like I'm made of lead
Down the hole inside my head
So if I'm too deep, bury me
Underneath the evergreens

So bury me, bury me
