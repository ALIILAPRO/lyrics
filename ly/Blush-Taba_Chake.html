		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunday morning I wake up at 9
smile at the sun for a while, and then I blush a little thinking of you pinch myself to check if it's you I see everywhere
what falls next is all the same
lying around and waiting on skype
hey! are you there?
yes you give wings to my heart
to fly high and touch the stars that shines bright
when I think of you
my heart skips for a beat
I look at these old photographs all laughter that we shared you’re so far away
I miss you everyday
without you by my side
I could barely even smile
darling, you’re so beautiful
they say two is better than one
but they don’t know
I want us to be one, you my better half we’re going to breathe in love
together we’ll see as one, and smile on feel each other's skin wrinkle with age love and fight, fight and love,
cuddle you like a sleeping child.
 
when I think of you
my heart skips a beat
I look at these old photographs all laughter that we shared you’re so far away
I miss you everyday
without you by my side
I could barely even smile
