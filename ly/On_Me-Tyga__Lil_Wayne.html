		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, shut the fuck up, bitch, you know who I are (bitch)
Point blank range, and I'm shootin' for the stars (blah)
You niggas subpar and I just raised the bar (yeah)
You got Rollies on your wrist (ha), this is Chopard (ice)
Slide on your block like a fuckin' go-kart (skrrt)
My nigga A and R, still got an AR (baow)
Bitches wanna kick it like my name Neymar (hah)
She wanna be my first, bitch couldn't get a yard (yeah)
Stay back (yeah), where the fuckin' antennas at
Broke niggas always askin' where the liquor at (yeah)
Hella tats, but I ain't into goin' tit for tat (nah)
Fitted hat, to the back, fuck her, no cap
This ain't freeze tag, you play, I'm gon' react
My hoes work, bitches know I put 'em on the map
These bitches wanna suck it like a similac
I did what I does and we fucked, I don't take it back

Don't bring that bullshit around me ('round me)
I got the ice and the pack on me (on me)
Like an eyepatch, one of you gon' see (you gon' see)
All you niggas ain't schemin' on me (on me)
I got a Benz and a Bimmer on me (on me)
Got the blow and the heater on me (on me)
Got a Spanish bitch suckin' on me (on me)
Nigga, and I put that on me (on me)

Bad bitch fuckin' on me, homie
I'm with two hoes that I call one and only
One ratchet, one bougie, you can call 'em R&B
One blunt in between two fingers, world peace
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm up there somewhere
Hell yeah, fuck yeah, fresh air, what smell?
Long hair, don't care, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You can get shot there and there and there and there and there
Play it fair, fuck fair, it's unfair, hell yeah
I was twelve, rich as hell, welfare farewell
I done got too big, now the world is handheld
I done broke a whole desert down to a sand drill
Yeah, it's on me and what it's gon' be?
It's gon' be money over bitches, not the homies
It's gon' be money over bitches, not the halo
And if it's on me, then we okay and that's a K-O, mula

Don't bring that bullshit around me (Tunechi) ('round me)
I got the ice and the pack on me (on me)
Like an eyepatch, one of you gon' see (you gon' see)
All you niggas ain't schemin' on me (on me)
I got a Benz and a Bimmer on me (beep beep)
Got the blow and the heater on me (bap bap)
Got a Spanish bitch suckin' on me (on me)
Nigga, and I put that on me (on me)

Tyga, Tunechi
Mula, baby
Mula, baby
Tyga is an inspiration, you know what I'm sayin'?
It be a lot of clone ass niggas and shit, this nigga's original
He's the first nigga to fuck with a Mustard beat, all this shit
I fuck with this nigga for life, this that real king shit
See y'all recognize when y'all in the presence of a king
Don, all this shit
Like, very few niggas that inspire me, my nigga, period (damn)
