		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, only know what I've seen
walls all dissolve and then you come to me in my dreams

a fire inside me is burning brightly,
and all that you need is inside you, you said to me lightly

I'll follow til the edge of tomorrow
there's nowhere to run to no we're going straight through the middle

sometimes I just feel the need to scream from a high place
and sometimes, I just need to feel the wind on my face

what if we
suddenly
up and leave
what if, what if, we just, we just left it all behind

and if we're
cuttin free
what are we
gonna be
if we if we cross in cross into the otherside

You're the only one that I trust
you were there when I was just dust

floating in a beam of light
an ember in a dream at night

now a fire inside me is burning brightly,
and all that you need is inside you, you said to me lightly

the day that I met you I got what I needed
all along it turns out that I had the key to this
I just had hid it away from myself
every time that they hurt me I strayed from myself

walked away from love, went straight for the dark
but the dark didn't suit me, it clashed with my heart
and I couldn't be something til I became nothing
ego was blockin me, took it apart

the day that I met you I got what I needed
all along it turns out that I had the key to this
I just had hid it away from myself
