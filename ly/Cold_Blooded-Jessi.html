		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh ooh, cold blooded ho
Co-cold blooded, blooded
Co-co-cold blooded ho, co-co-cold blooded, blooded
Ooh-ooh
Cold blooded ho, co-cold blooded, blooded
Co-co-cold blooded ho, co-cold blooded, blooded

(Ooh ooh)
I'm so cold blooded, I'm so naughty 
우린 전문가 넌 돌팔이
You's a nobody with no body
난 무대 위에서 까 노가리 (ooh ooh)
겁나 매운맛으로 잘 나가는 맛집 차렸네 
My kimchi so delicious, need a Michelin 
That good good in ya mouth boy 
걍 툭툭 보채지마 boy 

To-touch your toes
Then drop it low 뒤돌아보고 튕겨요
(Drop it low, drop it low)
흔들어 흔들어 흔들어 spank!
(Drop it low, drop it low)
손들어 손들어 손들어 bang!

Cold blooded ho, co-cold blooded, blooded (ice cold, baby ooh-ooh)
Co-co-cold blooded ho, co-co-cold blooded, blooded (ice, ice, ice ooh-ooh)
Cold blooded ho, co-cold blooded, blooded (ice cold, baby, ooh-ooh)
Co-co-cold blooded ho, co-co-cold blooded, blooded (ice, ice, ice ooh-ooh)

Now, now, now look into my brown eyes 
Yeah yeah
그래 거울 속의 나나 (that's me)
내게 이러쿵저러쿵 해봤자
Ain't no hasta mañana

이건 간식 이건 상식
랩 때려 박아버려 나의 방식
Co-come and beat it up like a mosh pit 
땀이 흘러내린다 like CrossFit
피가 차네 난 피가 찬 애
That mean that ice in my vein
기가 세네 난 기가 센 애
깡이 좀 세 like I'm Rain
J-E crooked letter, crooked letter
You know what the name is, yes
아무 말이나 해도
다 말이 돼 말이 돼 'cause I'm famous

Cold blooded ho, co-cold blooded, blooded (ice cold, baby ooh-ooh)
Co-co-cold blooded ho, co-co-cold blooded, blooded (ice, ice, ice ooh-ooh)
Cold blooded ho, co-cold blooded, blooded (ice cold, baby, ooh-ooh)
Co-co-cold blooded ho, co-co-cold blooded, blooded (ice, ice, ice ooh-ooh)

이리로 와
Look at me, look at me, look at me now
I am not playing around, I got the crown 
You cannot play on my ground
이리로 이리로 와 
Look at me, look at me now 
I got the crown, this is my town 
I do not, I do not F with you clowns

We don't give a what
Mind your own (mind your own)
I'm really in my zone
Got it going on (got it going on)

We don't give a what
Mind your own (mind your own) 
I'm really in my zone
Got it going on
Got it going on
