		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
Think I'll just give in
Taking medication
Till our stomach's full
Neither side is sacred
Crawling in my hole

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps me clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Take the time and I'll be true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
But I can't give in
Taking medication
Till our stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
When I'm in my home

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps me clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Take the time and I'll be true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

Oh

Neither side is sacred
No one wants to win
Feeling so sedated
But I just give in
Taking medication
Till our stomach's full
Feelin' so sedated
Crawling in my home

The grass is greener over here
You're the fog that keeps me clear
Re-inventing what we knew
Take the time and I'll be true
You're the reason I feel pain
Feels so good to feel again

Oh
