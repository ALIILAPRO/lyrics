		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lost in time with you
I'm committed did I mention
I was calling you
Needed all your attention

I lost a good girl I was lonely on my birthday
Felt like the end of the world it was the worst day
I needed something to take my mind off this shit
If we stick to the rules everything will be okay
I'm not tryna hurt you in the worst way
I was searching for a fling on a Thursday
I remember praying with you on church day
I was kissing my boo
It was under the rain
It was cold but we felt no more pain
The only thing that mattered was the stain that our memory likes to paint

Lost in time with you
I'm committed did I mention
I was calling you
Needed all your attention

The night was young when we first met
We like to run from our problems we get
And life is so short to be so alone
I don't want to live to fall in this love trap yet
Once again

I was going for the fence
I was looking for star
Like a main event

And if you find me
Then you can find out
That we can do it however you want it

I'm falling to pieces
I'm torn all apart
You know all my secrets
Don't want you to see this
And how I am, and what I've done
It's a lot, I hope you understand
It's something that you wanna know
I know you wanna know
