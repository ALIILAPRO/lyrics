		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You turn your back, you're a broken man
You come around and just dying to shake your hand
I don't expect you to understand
Just keep telling yourself there's no shame

They don't know 'bout who we are
They don't know 'bout you and I
They ain't know 'bout the stars of your eyes
Oh hot blood love is gonna get ya

You wanna prove you're the better man
You wanna reach for the things that nobody can
Oh all you need is to break away, yeah
Just keep telling yourself there's no shame

They don't know 'bout who we are
They don't know 'bout you and I
They ain't know 'bout the stars of your eyes
Oh hot blood love is gonna get ya

And then you get up and get up and get up again
Singing, get up and get up, yeah nobody cares
And then you get up and get up and get up again
Oh Lord
Yeah Lord

Never run down
You're holding your light above me now
Never run down
Never run down

Hot blood
Hot blood, yeah
Hot blood
Hot blood
And then you get up and get up and get up again
Singing, get up and get up, yeah nobody cares
And then you get up and get up and get up again
Oh Lord
Woah, yeah
(Get up)
