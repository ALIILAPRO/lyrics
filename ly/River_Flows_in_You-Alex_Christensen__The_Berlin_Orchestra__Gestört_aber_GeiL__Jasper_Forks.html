		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you have the time come share the road with me
If you can imagine we could both be free
What I long to do is give my heart to you
So that you can always hold it close to you

Holding you, holding you
It's in you, the river flows in you
Slowly now, slowly now
It's in you, the river flows in you

It's in you, the river flows in you

If you have the time come share the road with me
If you can imagine we could both be free

Holding you, holding you
It's in you, the river flows in you
Slowly now, slowly now
It's in you, the river flows in you

It's in you, the river flows in you

The river flows in you
