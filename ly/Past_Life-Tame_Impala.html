		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was picking up a suit from the dry cleaners
Which was standard for me
Thursday, 12:30, I gotta pretty solid routine these days
I don't know it just works for me
Anyway, I was leaving I was getting in my car
And I went to adjust the rear view mirror, but in its reflection
Just for a second, I saw a figure, started to trigger
Memories of what I had learned, stopped me in my tracks
Who was that? It was my lover, my lover, from a past life

From a past life (feel like I saw a ghost)
From a past life (not what I expected)
From a past life (it's transfixed)
From a past life

Well somewhere between a lover and a friend
It was different back then, surreal
Poetic so I'd say, like a bizarre shape or a confusing image
But I shot it down, closed it off
The sounds and smells I made myself forget
A cheap solution to block out a friend, but it was real
It just feels like a past life

From a past life (crazy)
From a past life (it takes a lot to trip me out)
From a past life
In the long time

So I go about my day as normal
But I can't seem to pass it off as just a random event
It consumes me, I thought I was moving on
But I guess I was just switching off
And now I see my life as the banal slog it suddenly became
And I don't know if I can go on the same
But I don't wanna dig up old bones
I mean, I don't even know if she has the same phone number
Who knows? Maybe she does

From a past life
(I guess there's no harm in trying)
From a past life
From a past life
In the long time
From a past life
From a past life
From a past life
In the long time
