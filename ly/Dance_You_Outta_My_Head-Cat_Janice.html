		<p>
		  (Dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)
(Gonna dance you outta my head)

Walk in the room
And I'm glowin' like a million fireflies
Mhm
A diamond
Don't clear half as much as my body tonight
Ah, ah, ah
I'll catch a glimpse of your face in the neon
Suddenly beggin' please set me free from
Your eyes, your touch, history, secret crush I've got to hide
I, I, I
You wanna take me up high (you wanna take me up high)
I wanna dance instead (I wanna dance instead)
Get you out of my head (out of my head)
This is gettin'

So complicated
It's a mess, cold ages
And I'm feelin' it, feelin' it inside
Dancin' on the edge of disaster, makes my heart beat faster
And the feelin', the feelin' ain't right

And so I'm gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Dance you outta my head

Must be the red wine or am I intoxicated by your style?
I close my eyes
You spin me 'round and on, but I can't beat your smile
I, I, I
So help me God (so help me God)
So fuckin' hot (so fuckin' hot)
Dance you out of my life
This is gettin'

So complicated
It's a mess, cold ages
And I'm feelin' it, feelin' it inside
Dancin' on the edge of disaster, makes my heart beat faster
And the feelin', the feelin' ain't right

And so I'm gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Dance you outta my head (this is gettin')

So complicated
And I hate that I don't hate it
I'm feelin' it, feelin' it inside
Dancin' on the edge of disaster
Hold my hands up, it don't matter
I need it, I need it (I need it, I really, really need it)

So complicated
It's a mess, cold ages
And I'm feelin' it, feelin' it inside
Dancin' on the edge of disaster, makes my heart beat faster
And the feelin', the feelin' ain't right

And so I'm gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
Gonna dance you outta my head
