		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ima get to bussin’ at the first chance
Shawty bad as hell but I ain’t into romance
I let the money talk , codeine dance
Shawty just got her soul snatched off of one glance
4:30 , nigga ain't rich but still got blue faces busting out the rubber bands
Sippin on juice while i'm tryna get the upper hand
9 am I hit the airport out of Dallas I was still a little off balance
Flying in and when I land i'm in the hood still tryna duck the fame status
But if you pull me to the side I got time fasho
A lot is on the line girl that’s all I know
But I figured its still worth it
I need time I’m still searching
But its not easy , I got eyes on me
Rolling with a bad bitch who only got eyes for me
10 racks on a bag you got expensive taste
Tattoos on her ass, she don’t have a waist
Ima get to bussin’ at the first chance
Shawty bad as hell but I ain’t into romance
I let the money talk , codeine dance
Shawty just got her soul snatched off of one glance
4:30 , nigga ain't rich but still got blue faces busting out the rubber bands
Sippin on juice while i'm tryna get the upper hand
9 am I hit the airport out of Dallas I was still a little off balance
Flying in and when I land I’m in the hood still tryna duck the fame status
Cant let you run off with me
I'm still one call away
Girl your still getting tipsy
And I still wont fade away
