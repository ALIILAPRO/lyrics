		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Since you've stepped into my life
Like someone brought the vision to the blind
Every time that you smile
Like the sun that shines in the midnight sky

You are the (the only one)
You are the only one (the only one)

When you stand by my side
I want to hold you tight and stop the time
Anything that makes you cry
I'm going to find the way to make your tears run dry

You are the only one (the only one)
You are the only one (the only one)

You are the only one who can rewrite my story
The only one who can rearrange my heart beat
Is you
You are the only one who can remake the world I've seen
The only one who can replace my empty dream
Is you

If one day we have
To say good bye
Ah ah
My love will belong to you until the day I die

You are the only one who can rewrite my story
The only one who can rearrange my heart beat
Is you
You are the only one who can remake the world I've seen
The only one who can replace my empty dream
Is you
