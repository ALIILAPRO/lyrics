		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should be here with me
No, oh-whoa-whoa, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no (don't you know what you are missin'?)

Yeah, yeah
Oh-whoa, yeah
Oh, whoa
Yeah, yeah

Fuck what they say (say, say)
I think you should take a break (uh)
Get on a plane (plane, plane)
Call it the sweetest escape
I wanna go
I wanna feel
I wanna feel your body
People gon' talk
Like it or not
So maybe don't tell nobody (mmm)

And I know I been distant
I been seeing other guys
You been kissing other bitches (mm-hmm)
I think you should come and visit
I got someone else who isn't you
Pulling up in minute, uh, yeah

Don't you know what you're missing
In a five-star high hotel in Mauritius? (I, I, I, I)
Think I know what you're missing
In a five-star high hotel in Mauritius, mmm

Come seek, I'm hiding
Sick of drunk dialing
Come to my hotel, baby, don't fight it
I just wanna hang on your neck like a diamond, uh-uh
Look at that timing
I take you to dinner fine-dining
I'ma take off how I land that, pilot
5-star telly pree a bad bitch ride it, uh-uh

I'm on the road
Took the Benz down to the coast
I'm tryna drink, I'm tryna smoke
Set it on fire, I took a toke of that (ooh, ah)
Clearing my mind, if you were mine
You would be here, we would be fine
There would be wine
We would be high on that, mmm

And I know I been distant
You been loving other girls
I won't tell you who I'm kissing, yeah
I think you should come and visit
I got one fine piece of man
Standing in position, oh, baby 

Don't you know what you're missing
In a five-star high hotel in Mauritius? (I, I, I, I)
Think I know what you're missing
In a five-star high hotel in Mauritius, mmm

Come seek, I'm hiding (hiding, hiding)
Sick of drunk dialing
Come to my hotel, baby, don't fight it
I just wanna hang on your neck like a diamond, uh-uh
Look at that timing
I take you to dinner fine-dining
I'ma take off, how I land that, pilot
5-star telly pree a bad bitch ride it, uh-uh

5-star telly pree a b bitch ride it, uh-uh
Ah

Don't you, huh
Don't you
Don't you know what you missing?
Touching, kissing
I like persistence
Don't you wanna roll in my Rolls
With the stars on the ceilings
Come see this feeling now
Come feel like you're dreaming now
Come be by my side baby, I take you on a ride, baby
I'll show you why I'm different
You don't need a reason, no
We've always been distant
Always just existing
Well, let's exist together now

Ooh, ooh, baby
Don't you know what you're missing
In a five-star high hotel in Mauritius?
Ooh, ooh, baby
Don't you know what you're missing
In a five-star high hotel in Mauritius?
