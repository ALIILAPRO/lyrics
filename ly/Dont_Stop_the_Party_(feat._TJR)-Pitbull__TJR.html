		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't get them girls loose loose (TJR)
You don't get the world loose loose
You don't get money woof woof (Mister Worldwide)
But I do I do

You don't get them girls loose loose
You don't get the world loose loose
You don't get money woof woof
But I do I do

I say, y'all having a good time, I'll bet

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'm running through the world like I'm running back
Scarface, world's mine, running back
Thirty thousand people in Hanover to see me
Eighty thousand people in London, Wembley
Ninety thousand people in Morocco
And I'm just getting warmed up, papo
Catch me with Red One in Stockholm,
Beirut, cafe getting my drink on,
Voli
Where all the pretty women hit the hooka
All of them sweet, azucar, azucar
Dale disfruta

They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party

I say, y'all having a good time, I'll bet

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'm from the city where they stress and they sleep real bad
And now I'm doing shows in Helsinki (Finland)
I know what ya'll thinking, you're thinking,
That you can out think me, but you can't frankly
I'm out for the Benji's, Frankie's, c-notes
Just cause you ain't me, don't hate me
As a matter fact you should thank me
Even if you don't, you're welcome Yankees
Zig-a zig-a zig-a zig-a-zow
Who got the keys of the world, now, yours truly, blow

They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will stop the party

I say, y'all having a good time, I'll bet

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'm a give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
I'm a give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
I'm a give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
Get funky, get funky
Now stop!

I say, y'all having a good time, I'll bet

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

Yeah, yeah, yeah (to the money makers it's the place to be)
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah (to the sexy people it's the place to be)
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

Yeah, yeah, yeah (to the money makers it's the place to be)
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah (to the sexy people it's the place to be)
Qué no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
