		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes my love, I confess to you
I am only here to break your heart in two
The very flower you chose that day
Its only task was to decay
You see?

When I watched your first bathing
I only warned you with a lowered voice
"Be wary of my river's undertow
It flows with water from the coldest source"
Did you hear?

And then I made sure
You would always return
You still know of dawn
But you always return

When you hid under my black wings
They couldn't have protected you from anything
Once in flight they would have let go
You would have once again wound up below
Only broken

Indeed, it's wrong to keep you near me
One could call me cruel and deceiving
But in your sacred air I am full of light
Your loving arms are the true delight
To which I'm lost

And you've noticed it
There is something right here
You have come to love, yes you've come to love
What you always will fear

(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Yes, my love, I confess to you
I've nothing but the means to break your heart in two
My part in yours may seem important now
But with every spring it will seem so small
Just for now I am your fall
I am your fall
I am your fall
