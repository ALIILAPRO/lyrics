		  [Hook]

We gone take it to the Body

We gone take it to the Head

We bust a bitch head

We bust a bitch head

We gone take it to the Body

We gone take it to the Head

[Magic]

I done made a deal with the devil

So you don't wanna touch me

Pussy, you lucky that things don't get ugly

My daddy always told me catch a nigga from the blind

Knock his ass off

Express whats on my mind

Ain't nothing about me phony

My nigga I'll keep it real with ya

Jump stupid and Body Head gone deal with you

Both of your jaws swollen like the measles

The only man can save you is Jesus

I'll say a prayer for ya

For I despose of ya

I'll take your hoes from ya

I'll brake your nose for ya

I'm the sickest, I'm suicidal

So don't get me excited

The roof ain't on fire

But bet cha I'll get it lighted

[Hook]

[Choppa]

First of all most I ain't coming for no foolishness

You better question round and ask somebody who you're fooling with

You making an ass out of me like the same possibility

of you winning the power ball lottery

You gotta be outta your mind to even start

I'll Chop your dam pork with out a knife and a fork

You niggaz oughta wait, polish your skills up for another day

'cause I'm the biggest shark in this park and you just another bait

Choppa that name ringing in your brain

From the Body to the Head and we bringing niggaz pain

Street Ballas ballin in the streets behind the chain

So don't make us up them thangs and get to sprayin'

[Hook]

[RJJ]

If breads gettin broke then I'm breaking it with my peeps

Body Head bangers we're taking over the streets

You couldn't get us no tighter with pliers

Nothin but womanizers so bitches despise us

Pensacola I'm a rep it to death 'cause I'm a Florida boy

nothing more nothing less

You disrespect or test what I say

It's Body to the Head til shit go my way

I'm a gutta boy with a bunch of gutta ways

Gutta mentality but the gutta got me paid

You had your chance we about to pop

Big bread take lil bread like it or not...nigga

[Hook]
