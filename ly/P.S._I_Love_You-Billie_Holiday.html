		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dear, I thought I drop a line
The weather is cool
The fooks are fine
I'm in bed each night at nine
PS I love you

Yesterday we had some rain
But all in all I can't complain
Was it dusty on the train
PS I love you

Write to the Brown's just as soon as you're able
They came around to call
And not burn a hole in the dining room table 
Now let me think; I guess that's all
Nothing else for me to say
And so I'll close, but by the way
Everybody's thinking of you
P.S. I love you
