		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Come on
Woo
Huh

I had a friend was a big baseball player
Back in high school
He could throw that speedball by you
Make you look like a fool, boy
Saw him the other night at this roadside bar
I was walking in, he was walking out
We went back inside sat down had a few drinks
But all he kept talking about was

Glory days, well, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Well there's a girl that lives up the block
Back in school she could turn all the boy's heads
Sometimes on a Friday I'll stop by
And have a few drinks after she put her kids to bed
Her and her husband Bobby well they split up
I guess it's two years gone by now
We just sit around talking about the old times
She says when she feels like crying
She starts laughing thinking about

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

(Rock it now)
Woo

Think I'm going down to the well tonight
And I'm gonna drink 'til I get my fill
And I hope when I get old I don't sit around thinking about it
But I probably will
Yeah, just sitting back trying to recapture
A little of the glory of, well time slips away
And leaves you with nothing mister but
Boring stories of

Glory days, yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days
Yeah, they'll pass you by
Glory days, in the wink of a young girl's eye
Glory days, glory days

Well, alright
Ooh yeah
Well, alright
Come on now
Well, alright
Ooh yeah
Well, alright
Come on now
Woo
Woohoo
Woohoo
Woohoo
Alright boys, keep it rocking now
Keep on going
We're going for home now
Bring it home
Yeah
Bring it home
Oh, oh
Alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Well, alright
Let's go
