		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you're hurting deep down
When you're feelin' like you're never gonna dig your way out
Never gonna dig your way out
Keep pushing up the river
Keep mining for the silver
'Til you've shot gold
Gotta whether the storm

'Cause it can't rain forever, no
I'm telling you

We all fall on hard times, you know
Each day is a hight climb, you know
Some days your body has to carry on
So you gotta show a little backbone
You know
You know
You know
You gotta show a little backbone

These troubles so real
We're all facing temptations
And our own fears
Year after year

But it can't rain forver, no
I'm telling you

We all fall on hard times, you know
Each day is a high climb, you know
Some days your body has to carry on
So you gotta show a little backbone
You know
You know
You know
You gotta show a little backbone
(You gotta show a little backbone)
You know (you gotta show a little backbone)
You gotta show a little backbone

Are you strong enough to get back up?
When the chains hold you to the ground
So let's break 'em down, yeah, uh
Let's break 'em down
Let's break 'em down
Woah, I'm telling you

We all fall on hard times, you know
Each day is a hight climb, you know
Some days your body has to carry on
So you gotta show a little
We all fall on hard times, yeah
Each day is a high climb, you know
We all fall on hard times, you know
(You gotta show a little backbone)
We all fall on hard times, yeah
(You know each day is a high climb, you know)
We all fall on hard times each day is a high climb, you know
So you gotta show a little backbone
