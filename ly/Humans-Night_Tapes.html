		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We’ve been walking around

turning around

in the dust crowd

on a speck of light



I’m not sure if it’s me

but in the trees

every 30 years

there has been a fight



Journey the night - 

driving with your eyes

wide shut to the fear


In clusters of time 

could you recognise 

a message unclear?

In an imperfect mind we're


Singing why?

Could you treat us like humans, please?

Singing why?

Could you treat us like humans, please?

We’re not unreasonable 



And the higher the highs

the lower the lows-

everything grows

to a forest fire


And the longer it’s been

the higher the sin

for the kindling

of the emperors crime



Walk through the tides

with a higher eye

on no one else here


Project the sight

on the other “I” 

that won’t disappear

Just a word to the mirror, mirror 


Singing why?

Could you treat us like humans, please?

Singing why?

Could you treat us like humans, please?

We’re not unreasonable 



To trust

To love

To risk

To grow



To trust

Singing why?

Could you treat us like humans, please

Singing why?

Could you treat us like humans, please
