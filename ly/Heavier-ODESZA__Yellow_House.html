		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll sip your hemlock
Drip my fingers down your back
Lovers tied up, tethered
Kiss me through the fetters

Ooh, you're bending and breaking
Through the dim light
Take me on again
Ooh, pristine, deftly moving
No rules to abide
Nothing left to hide

Ooh yeah, you're taken
But you're take-take-taken for granted (hardly wanted)
Ooh yeah, you'd break him
Yeah, you'd break-break-break him for nothing (for nothing)
Ooh, you're forsaken
You're left ache-ache-aching for loving (for loving)
Ooh yeah, you're taken
But you're take-take-taken for granted (hardly wanted)

I'll find peace in your nightshade
And the warmth inside your cool blade
And lead you down a labyrinth of desire

Ooh, you're bending and breaking
Through the dim light
Take me on again
Ooh, pristine, deftly moving
No rules to abide
Nothing left to hide

Ooh yeah, you're taken
But you're take-take-taken for granted (hardly wanted)
Ooh yeah, you'd break him
Yeah, you'd break-break-break him for nothing (for nothing)
Ooh, you're forsaken
You're left ache-ache-aching for loving (for loving)
Ooh yeah, you're taken
But you're take-take-taken for granted (hardly wanted)
