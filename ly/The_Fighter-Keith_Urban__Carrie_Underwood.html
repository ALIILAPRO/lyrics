		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know he hurt you
Made you scared of love, too scared to love
He didn't deserve you
'Cause you're precious heart is a precious heart
He didn't know what he had and I thank God, oh
And it's gonna take just a little time
But you're gonna see that I was born to love you

What if I fall? (I won't let you fall)
What if I cry? (I'll never make you cry)
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall? (I won't let you fall)
What if I cry? (I promise I'll never make you cry)
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

Look in the mirror
You're beautiful, so beautiful
I'm here to remind you
You're my only one, let me be the one
To heal all the pain that he put you through
With love like you never knew
Just let me show you

What if I fall? (I won't let you fall)
What if I cry? (I'll never make you cry)
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall? (I won't let you fall)
What if I cry? (I promise I'll never make you cry)
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

I wanna believe that you got me, baby
I swear I do from now until the next life
I wanna love, wanna give you all my heart

What if I fall? (I won't let you fall)
What if I cry? (oh, I'll never make you cry)
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
What if I fall? (I won't let you fall)
What if I cry? (I promise I'll never make you cry)
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter

What if I fall?
What if I cry?
And if I get scared? (I'll hold you tighter)
When they're tryna get to you, baby, I'll be the fighter
