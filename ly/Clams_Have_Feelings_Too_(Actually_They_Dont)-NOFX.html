		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Birds are dumb with small bird brains
But so are kids and old people
Some birds talk most others sing
I don't see you eat a talking bird

Pigs smell bad and roll in poo
But so do kids and elderly
I don't see you chop off an old man's feet
Put them in a mason jar and pickle them

No chowder for you, 'cause clams have feelings too
Actually they don't have central nervous nets
No manhattan style, clams have the right to smile
Come to think about it they don't have a face

They have no face; no place for ears
And no clam eyes to cry clam tears
No spinal cord, they must get bored
Might as well just put them out of misery

I don't believe it's selfish
To eat defenseless shellfish

No chowder for you clams have feelings too
It could happen to you, clams have feelings too
I don't think they do, clams have feelings too
