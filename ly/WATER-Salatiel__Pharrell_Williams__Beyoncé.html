		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Shoot!

Baby, o, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, o, can I drink from your water?
Baby, o, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

Yes, we can make it far 
Don't need inflatables 
That's what the waves are for 
What are you waiting for? 
Yes, we can make it far 
Don't need inflatables 
That's what the waves are for 
What are you waiting for?

Well, darling, if you leave, I'll go wherever you go
I'll wear your heart on my sleeve so everybody here knows
But if you tell me to stay, you'll never be on your own
So baby, don't wait too long

Baby, o, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, o, can I drink from your water?
Baby, o, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

Yes, we can make it far
Don't need inflatables 
That's what the waves are for 
What are you waiting for?
Yes, we can make it far 
Don't need inflatables 
That's what the waves are for 
What are you waiting for?

I'll bring you back the moon just so we got all night
I'll bring the sun down too, so I can show you the light
Trust me, if you ever leave, I'll be right by your side, oh
For you, I will ride, ah

Baby, o, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, o, can I drink from the water?
Baby, o, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry

Yes, we can make it far 
Don't need inflatables (yeah)
That's what the waves are for (yeah)
What are you waiting for? (Yeah)
Yes, we can make it far (yeah)
Don't need inflatables
That's what the waves are for (yeah)
What are you waiting for?

Baby, o, I'm not much of a talker
Baby, o, can I drink from the water?
Baby, o, meet me down by the river
We can dance to the rhythm
'Til the sun is high and the water runs dry
