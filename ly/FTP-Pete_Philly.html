		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember feeling stuck
I remember thinking I was outta luck
Now I’m struck by my own perfection
Basking in the light of my resurrection

I don’t need no stress
I just feel blessed
Passing every test
Of the universe
I got reimbursed for the pain & sweat & for feeling cursed
Now That’s church
Good lord, my chord in in major key
I cannot afford to ever stop or freeze
Doing what I please 

How I get the cheese, so
It’s so old, tired
Little hater in my brain got fired, 
Retired, curtailed
Expanding my lane and I won’t fail


Free the people
Free the nipple
Drop the needle
We a ripple
Another drop in the ocean
Feel the wave, feel the motion

I remember feeling sick
I remember it really sucking
It came wit, losing all of my wit
I cursed & spit, 
The whole thing a real slow drip
I did trip, mourned the loss of it
Became the boss of it
Started tossing it all aside
Then left the pride, didn’t wanna hide 
Now I’m here, no fear, so clear
It is my year, you cannot steer me away
Yeah I’m here, I cheer, my peers, 
my dear, you cannot steer me away 
from my destination
it’s elevation
I’m my own creation
It’s a whole sensation
Taking no vacation
This is my vocation
