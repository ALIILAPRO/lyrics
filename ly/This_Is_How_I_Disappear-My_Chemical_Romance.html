		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go

To un-explain the unforgivable
Drain all the blood and give the kids a show
By streetlight this dark night
A s√©ance down below
There're things that I have done
You never should ever know

And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now

Who walks among the famous living dead
Drowns all the boys and girls inside your bed
And if you could talk to me
Tell me if it's so
That all the good girls go to heaven
Well, heaven knows

That without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now
And without you is how I disappear
And live my life alone forever now

Can you hear me cry out to you?
Words I thought I'd choke on figure out
I'm really not so with you anymore
I'm just a ghost
So I can't hurt you anymore
So I can't hurt you anymore

And now, you wanna see how far down I can sink?
Let me go, fuck
So, you can, well now so, you can
I'm so far away from you
Well now so, you can

And without you is how I disappear
And without you is how I disappear
Whoa whoa (and without you is how I disappear)
Whoa whoa (and without you, is how, is how, is how)
Forever, forever now
