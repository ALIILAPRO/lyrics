		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So long I've been trying to match
It doesn't work, I'm trying, I don't know
The aberration of this world I tried to deal with
It killed a part of me that was raging
The pain is gone, the denial
I ran away from institutions
I owe myself life

There's no way
I will respond to this passion, anger flowing through me
There is light in this world I fight for
The reason you won't leave this cage, betray your child
The desire that you once had to reveal yourself
Forgot to create your own life

Anger, lies, denial

This righteous anger boiling inside of us
Won't last forever
Don't fear to let it out
Branches have grown through
The wolf is your master 

The sky is all
Over me

I run on time
