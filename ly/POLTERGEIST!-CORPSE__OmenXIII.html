		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cross my heart and hope to die
I can't fucking sleep at night
Blew up for the thousandth time
Guess I'm always lucky, right?
Pop some shit then fall behind
I jump the gun and take what's mine
Looking like you seen a ghost
Moving like a poltergeist

I'm like, "Wait, what's his name?"
I'm like, "Huh what'd he say, bitch?"
I don't want your two cents, you ain't even paid, bitch
We are not the same, I dropped out in seventh grade, bitch
Came up from the grave, fuck everything you claim, bitch

You've never seen a trap or a bando
Only time you the pull a strap is when you wearing Velcro, uhh
Say you hit licks, bitch, hell no
Talking like you gonna do shit but you won't
I see through the shit that you do
Watch me, then steal how I move
Your label faked your breakthrough
Fake place, fake views and fake you

I don't sleep, I'm a freak
When I wake up, I see concrete
Risk my life on concrete
It's too hard to starve me
Feast, feast, feast, feast
All I see is options
Everyone's got problems
Anyone's a target (fuck my life)
Can't pay the price 'cause I bet it
Thinking ahead, I expect to see dead ends
Count money, count blessings, and tuck you a weapon
Somebody knows something you don't, can't be guessing
Where I'm from we don't think about tomorrow
Keep two fingers crossed, nothing is promised
Nobody knows how I feel when I go out
That's what I learned 'cause I came from the bottom (fuck)

"Wait, what's his name?"
I'm like, "Huh what'd he say, bitch?"
I don't want your two cents, you ain't even paid, bitch
We are not the same, I dropped out in seventh grade, bitch
Came up from the grave, fuck everything you claim, bitch
