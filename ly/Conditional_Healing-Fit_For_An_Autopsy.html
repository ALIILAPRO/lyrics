		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me how to make the room stop spinning.

Bridge burner thought machine.
Car crashing fantasy.
Burnout, a blaze of glory.
No one repents if they’re living a dream.
Force fed false peace.
Crawl into the cage.

Slow pace through sewer grates.
Constricted veins of snakes.
Conditional healing, you fucking fakes.
I want their heads on a fucking stake.

Systematic heaven dispenser.
Automated addict rejector.
Sharpened syringe orgasm injector, tools of the trade.
Thirty milligrams of violence.
Between sun and moon there is silence.
The alarm clock rings, shivering, and you’re left with nothing.

Heal me with what kills me.

Tell me how to make the room stop spinning.

Shamans breed slavery.
Chained to the gurney.
Overdosed, a blaze of glory.
Licking the wound of dependency.
When it has you, it has you for eternity.

Systematic heaven dispenser.
Automated addict rejector.
Sharpened syringe orgasm injector, tools of the trade.
Thirty milligrams of violence.
Stand for a moment of silence.
Eighty-one thousand times the light died.

How many more mothers have to bury their sons,
you sick motherfucker.

All for what?
A seat at the table in hell.

Heal me with what kills me.

Tell me how to make the room stop spinning.
