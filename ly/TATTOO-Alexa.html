		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey-yeah-yeah
Whoa-oh
Ay
Listen up

What the hell you gonna do?
You don't know what I've been through
Such a player, that's your nature
Here we go again

It's a road that I've been down before (before)
I ain't gonna do that shit no more (no more)
I got fed up, need a change up
Gotta tell ya
It never felt much better

Wow
You gotta way, gotta way, huh
Now
I'm gonna tell you like it is, hun

Up and a down and a round we go
I'll toss you off like a rodeo
Don't think I ever gonna say that I do
Then why you stuck on me just like a tattoo? (On me like a tattoo)
Don't try to call I'ma be a ghost
Hittin' me up when it hurts the most
You're sweet talking, but it's all déjà vu (déjà vu)
Then why you stuck on me just like a ta
On me like a tattoo

Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo
Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo
Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Ugh

I'm so tired, I'm so fed up
I don't need the drama
We've been here before
Your lovin' only causing trouble
And it was beautiful (so beautiful)
But that was long ago (yep)

Right now, I'm busy swaying on my own
Right now, I'm happy doing it alone
'Cause he can't gimme what I like
I just found another type
And it's me myself and I

Ooh-hoo, wishing you got lucky
No, you won't get this juicy
Now
I'm gonna tell you like it is, hun

Up and a down and a round we go
I'll toss you off like a rodeo
Don't think I ever gonna say that I do
Then why you stuck on me just like a tattoo? (On me like a tattoo)
Don't try to call I'ma be a ghost
Hittin' me up when it hurts the most
You're sweet talking, but it's all déjà vu (déjà vu)
Then why you stuck on me just like a ta
On me like a tattoo

Don't think that I'll ever call ya (ohh)
Oh, baby, why do you bother?
I'll never say I do (never say I do)
You broke my heart in two (hey)

I'll rub you off
Staying put for long enough
Sail away, sail away now (sail away)
Now

Up and a down and a round we go
I'll toss you off like a rodeo
Don't think I ever gonna say that I do
Then why you stuck on me just like a tattoo? (On me like a tattoo)
Don't try to call I'ma be a ghost
Hittin' me up when it hurts the most
You're sweet talking, but it's all déjà vu (déjà vu)
Then why you stuck on me just like a ta
On me like a tattoo

Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo 
Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo
Tattoo, tattoo, tattoo
On me like a tattoo
