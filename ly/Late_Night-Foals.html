		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Calling out your name (name, name, name)

Oh, I hope that you are somebody
Someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
When I was in doubt

Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
I'm calling out your name
Oh now Mama, do you hear me?
Calling out your name
Calling out your name

Now I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown

They said I swam the sea that ran around
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found

And I know the place another way
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name

And I know the place another way
I feel, I feel no shame
Oh now Mama, do you hear my fear?
It's coming after me

I'm calling out your name
