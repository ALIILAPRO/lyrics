		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk to me, tell me, baby (ooh oh)
Talk to me, tell me, ohh
Tell me, yeah, ohh, oh
Yeah

We got comfortable (ooh, yeah, yeah)
Maybe that's why I feel like I'm in control (ooh, yeah, yeah)
Meanwhile, now the love just feels occasional
Where's that smile we used to have?
I tell jokes, and you get mad
You think I'm still in the past (didn't we?)
Didn't we used to try when we got started? (Baby, didn't we?)
Now we can't even lie, this ain't our hardest (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I think we can bring it back
Tell me what you care about
Air it out

What do we do now? (Hey)
What do we do now? (Hey)
What do we do now? (Hey)
What do we do now? (Hey), do now?

What do we do?
We don't make no moves, we don't make no moves together
What do we do?
We were one now two, we were one now two, together
What do we do?
I know we're not finished, I don't wanna end it
But we gotta figure it out

You used to think of my love like a prize (prize)
A prize to earn
I feel like I'm losin' you to your pride (pride)
And I gotta let it burn
We go through the motions, emotions complacent, I hate it
Feel like our love is degraded
Maybe I'm crazy for waitin'
If you ain't gon' say it then, boy I'ma say it, oh
For you, it's worth it to work it out
Ain't nothing perfect but I'm nervous now
Don't wanna feel like a burden
But I gotta say something, baby I'm hurtin'
So what are we gonna do?
You ask me, and I give you the truth
I don't know, I don't wanna let go 
'Cause I'm still in love with you

What do we do now?
What do we do now? (Hey)
(I need to know)
What do we do now? (Hey)
(What do we? What do we?)
What do we do now? 
What do we do now?, do now? 

What do we do?
We don't make no moves, we don't make no moves together
What we do? (Baby we don't move the same)
We were one now two, we were one now two, together
What do we do?
I know we're not finished (no, no)
I don't wanna end it (I know)
But we gotta figure it out

Can we figure it out?
Talk to me, tell me, baby, oh
