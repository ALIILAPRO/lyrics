		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love, I love

I love when you rage with me (I-I-I love)
I love when you stay with me (I-I-I)
How long can you stand with me? (I-I-I love)
How long can you stand for me? (I love)
Oh, do you understand what we saying to you?
I'm off the drugs in the club (I love, I love)
I love when you show, love when you show, love when you show
I love, I love (I love, I love)

I love, I love when I go up 'cause I go up, yeah, all the time (so what?)
I love, I love all the time, in the crib, in the whip, on the down
And I'm flying, and I'm on the jet all the time, uh
I'ma buy your fucking company and sell your hard work for a dime, uh
I seen 2093 and fuckin' came back, yeah, every time, yeah
I'm tryna tell you something, but you won't listen to mine
And it's fine, it don't surprise me but I- (I love, I love)

I love it, I love it, I love when they hate, oh, I love it
I love it, I kn-, I know you ma-, I know you love it
I know you tryin' not listen to me, yeah, but I know you love it
I know you can't resist the temptations put in front of you, uh
I know you tryna do this, so I'll sho-, I-, I'll show you
I know you need to cry so here's a-, uh, uh, here's a shoulder
I heard you tryna die, so here's a-, here's a boulder (I love, I love)
(I love, I love)

I love when you rage with me (I-I-I love)
I love when you stay with me (I-I-I)
How long can you stand with me? (I-I-I love)
How long can you stand for me? (I love)
Oh, do you understand what we saying to you?
I'm off the drugs in the club (I love, I love)
I love when you show, love when you show, love when you show
I love, I love (I love, I love)

I love, I love when I go up 'cause I go up, yeah, all the time (so what?)
I love, I love all the time, in the crib, in the whip, on the down
And I'm flying, and I'm on the jet all the time, uh
I'ma buy your fucking company and sell your hard work for a dime, uh
I seen 2093 and fuckin' came back, yeah, every time, yeah
I'm tryna tell you something, but you won't listen to mine
And it's fine, it don't surprise me but I- (I love, I love)

I love it, I love it, I love when they hate, oh, I love it
I love it, I kn-, I know you ma-, I know you love it
I know you tryin' not listen to me, yeah, but I know you love it
I know you can't resist the temptations put in front of you, uh
(I love, I love)
