		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you need the warmth of love?
Well me neither
Do you need the God above?
Yea me neither, me neither, here's my hand i'll never leave ya

You've taken everything
And you've wasted all of me
Spare your flowers and revery 
Cause you are the devil inside of me

Hey lover!
I wanna be somebody's baby
I crave a little east coast comfort 
You bloody mess you missed your shot, your shot 
And now your stuck with what you got  

You've taken everything
And you've wasted all of me
Spare your flowers and revery 
Cause you are the devil inside of me

You're the devil inside of me
You're the devil inside of me 
You're the devil inside of me 

You've taken everything
And you've wasted all of me
Spare your flowers and revery 
Cause you are the devil inside of me
