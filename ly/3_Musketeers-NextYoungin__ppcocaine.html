		  (Da-da-damn, what you doing?)
Hey Daddy Kaine! (Listen up)
I got bitches (you got bitches?)
Haha, aye, aye

Tell lil' shorty come here
Trap bunny bubbles!

Bitch, I still get texts from my ex
You think that's yours but she movin' to the next (the next!)
No bitch can compare, they all think I'm the best (fuck it!)
Real witch bitch, put yo' ass in a hex (voodoo!)
Bitch I got big stack, big flex (Big flex)
Baby call my phone, tryna blow her tax check
Call me nympho 'cause I like good sex (oh!)
But don't be mad when you going through my texts!

Aye aye!
Tell lil' shorty come here (come here!)
I'm tryna blow her back out
Walking funny for the year (wobble, wobble!)
Tell me that you want me
That's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers
Aye, aye! (musketeers?)
Tell lil' shorty come here (come here!)
I'm tryna blow her back out
Walking funny for the year (wobble, wobble!)
Tell me that you want me
That's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers

Bitch, shake that ass or kick rocks (kick rocks!)
Fuck a situationship, I'm tryna see that box
Saw her on her Tinder, said she likes long walks (oh the beach?)
Runnin' with my phone but bitch who got these locks?
Dumb hoe! Who bought this motherfuckin' phone?
Yeah, shorty love it 'cause I'm making her moan
Try to find another bitch, get hit in the dome
Yes, I know I'm a queen 'cause I'm sitting on the throne

Aye aye!
Tell lil' shorty come here (come here!)
I'm tryna blow her back out
Walking funny for the year (wobble, wobble!)
Tell me that you want me
That's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers
Aye, aye! (musketeers!)
Tell lil' shorty come here (come here!)
I'm tryna blow her back out
Walking funny for the year (wobble, wobble!)
Tell me that you want me
That's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers

Hey, Gang, NextYoungin
It's Daddy Kaine in this bitch
Pull up to the function and she tryna get lit
Shorty talkin' foreign
Yeah, I'm thinking she a brit
Never stay strapped 'cause my brothers with the shit
Keep talking money 'til they hit you with a lick
All yo' shit fake but there's Gucci on my fish
She want bread for the head but no, I'm not a trick (nah)
Switchin' up the roles, charge a rack for the flick
Keeping dirty money but my hands still clean (yo)
Bitches' high tech, yeah, I think she off the lean
Don't try to kiss me, hoe, you need some Listerine
Drown in this money, all you see on me is green
I bought her a perc and I bought her a beam
Now she blowin' up my phone so I know that she a feind
Got her in her feelings, yell her bestie that I'm mean
No, I never need no hoes, I just pass 'em to the team

Aye, aye!
Tell lil' shorty come here
I'm tryna blow her back out
Walking funny for the year
Tell me that you want me
That's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers
Aye, aye!
Tell lil' shorty come here (come here!)
I'm tryna blow her back out
Walking funny for the year (wobble, wobble!)
Tell me that you want me
That's the shit I always hear
I got three bitches on me like the three musketeers (musketeers)

Oh!
You got bitches, Nya?
Hell yeah
How many?
Three musketeers
Hoe! (Da-da-damn, what you doing?)
Daddy Kaine and Cocaine
Yeah! Daddy Kaine and Cocaine! Huh!
