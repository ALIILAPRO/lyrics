		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put in your head girl It's only right
If It's really real just give me a sign
I'm not really used to feeling good inside
Turn it off turn It off while we're dancing
I'm damaged
I'm still getting higher just to manage
I'm lonely
But when she on me
I call her my only
We're both unholy
I can tell she dirty I got evidence
Don't be shy around me girl just give It In
I do not deserve you girl you heaven sent
She don't even know about the half of It
I can tell she dirty I got evidence
Don't be shy around me girl just give It In
I do not deserve you girl you heaven sent
She don't even know about the half of It
I need new things
Help me deal with pain a different way It's like she knows me
I could hardly feel the fucking difference from my old ways
Getting kinda nervous I think that she's probably noticing
No don't tell me I don't wanna know
Anything you say I'm ready down
I always feel good when your around
I can't get enough I hate It when I'm coming down
Coming down
I can tell she dirty I got evidence
Don't be shy around me girl just give It In
I do not deserve you girl you heaven sent
She don't even know about the half of It
I can tell she dirty I got evidence
Don't be shy around me girl just give It In
I do not deserve you girl you heaven sent
She don't even know about the half of It
I can tell she dirty I got evidence
Don't be shy around me girl just give It In
I do not deserve you girl you heaven sent
She don't even know about the half of It
