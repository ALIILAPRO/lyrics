		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You niggas ain't it, ha
You up the score, we up the score, it ain't much to come spin
You double-back, we triple-back, quadruple, fuck it, come quint-
Hmm, huh, you gotta wave the white flag, that's the only way to end
Haha, I'm tryna win
Can't fuck with niggas that fuck with opps, see, that's dangerous
Can't talk to niggas that talk to cops, see, that's dangerous
These bitches givin' up the drop, see, that's dangerous (oh)
Can't fuck with niggas that fuck with opps, see, that's dangerous
Can't talk to niggas that talk to cops, see, that's dangerous
These bitches givin' up the drop, see, that's dangerous (oh)

If I slide, then it's gon' be a scene, he ain't die, run it back again, ha
.223's runnin' through your house, you should've never ran your mouth, ha
You act like you don't know what we about, ha
You act like breathin' don't compare to clout, ha
We gave him five, he still walkin' 'round, ha
Next time, we gon' walk him down, ha
Every day, we on the block, we on that same strip
Front line, ready to stop, we on the same shit
Talkin' this and this and that, ya'll just be sayin' shit (oh)

You niggas ain't it
Can't fuck with niggas that fuck with opps
You up the score, we up the score, it ain't much to come spin
These bitches givin' up the drops
You double-back, we tripe-back, quadruple, fuck it, come quint-
Can't fuck with niggas that fuck with opps
You gotta wave the white flag, that's the only way to end
These bitches givin' up the drop, see, that's dangerous (haha, I'm tryna win)

Really don't like you (I don't like you)
I just went on a competition, like Mike do
Spin on niggas, like Michael (Jackson)
Wave that stick, like a maestro (woo)
I hear you rappin' that killer shit, like you psycho
Y'all play tough for them white folks
When it's war, I ain't fuckin' bitches, that's really not my style (I'm chillin')
I got all my hoes blocked, until somebody get knocked down (word)
You know it come with this shit, that's part of wearin' a crown
Some niggas ready, some niggas not, some niggas might throw in that towel
Careful what you wish for, you just might get sent for
It could be your lucky day, you should've played the pick 4 (haha)
Dropped a quarter on your hood, and I could've spent more
Y'all niggas not bulletproof, but I just did the Benz doors

You niggas ain't it
Can't fuck with niggas that fuck with opps
You up the score, we up the score, it ain't much to come spin
These bitches givin' up the drops
You double-back, we tripe-back, quadruple, fuck it, come quint-
Can't fuck with niggas that fuck with opps
You gotta wave the white flag, that's the only way to end
These bitches givin' up the drop, see, that's dangerous (haha, I'm tryna win)
