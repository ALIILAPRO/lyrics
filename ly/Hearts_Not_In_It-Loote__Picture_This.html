		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Face, the face, the space between our bodies
Could talk a lot about the things that we are not
And I don't wanna lie to you so I turn off the light
The song beside the queen sized mattress
We had to buy because the king won't fit in a
Studio apartment, baby, so tell me how is it that

I'm still with you
And I still miss you
But I just wish you
Felt how you used to
Oh, what am I gonna do? I

I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it and your heart's not in it
No, don't believe it, don't believe it, I
Don't believe it when you hold my body close
'Cause you're miles and miles away
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it and your heart's not in it
No, I've been sleeping, I've been sleeping
I've been sleeping with your shadow in my room
'Cause you're miles and miles away

Try to hide the doubt, my body already
Knows when I'm alone but when you pull me close
I don't wanna let you, so I turn off the light
That's on my side, sometimes honesty hurts
A little worse, than keeping it inside
I'm still wondering why

I'm still with you
And I still miss you
But I just wish you
Felt how you used to
Oh, what am I gonna do? I

I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it and your heart's not in it
No, don't believe it, don't believe it, I
Don't believe it when you hold my body close
'Cause you're miles and miles away
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it and your heart's not in it
No, I've been sleeping, I've been sleeping
I've been sleeping with your shadow in my room
'Cause you're miles and miles away
