		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
I been here waiting lookin' at 'em
Tryna catch up take it how you wanna take it
Left the place in panic
Left to take another planet
Left to make another statement
XG baby say the names right
Spell it out so you can learn it
Smell the tires when they turnin'
Smell the fire when it's burnin'

You can tell we all made it work for us
Made it but we had to work for it
Work work work so perfect
That it hurt don't it? surf on 'em
Right away ride the wave ride away
'Cause we had the right of way
Bye bye bye flying past then we fly away
Into outer-space

Drop top in a coupe outside
When I hop up out of this plane
Look at my fit right now
When I just walked outta my bed
Fix my hair and fix my make up on the way
Bound to the next stop
Bound for the great
Make 'em bow down to the X (uh)

A little more than ordinary honorary
Underestimated leavin' all you broke
I'm the judge and jury I don't wanna hear it
I'm the one they fearin' keep it on the low
This is automated I'm the motivator
Told my haters "Yo more the merrier"
Y'all my entertainment fascinated
I'm just laughing 'cause it's so hilarious

Little girl with a big mouth, uh
Small group with a big house, yeah
Big watch on the wrist now, uh
I just thought of that flow now, just now
Put a little more down for the buss down
Went on tour on a bus and tore the bus down
Everything custom now
Fans rushin' out
Security had to push me out

Forty-eight laws of power
Little girl with a big motor on a kid tho mhm
Watch me rip tho
Watch me snap like motorola flip phone mhm
I don't wanna hit you this hard on a intro
Bring that bounce like six four
Find me in Tokyo rappin' in a skirt
Are you catchin' my drift tho

Woke up lookin' like this
So don't get under my skin
Woke up lookin' like this
Like this (like this, like this, like this)
Woke up lookin' like this
So don't get under my skin
Woke up lookin' like this
Like this (like this, like this, like this)

Yeah
Light flex go easy (whoa)
Tag it up graffiti
Drop a pin or addy
That's where I'll go
Rip the show and that's all I know
I'm super visioned
Y'all just built on superstitions
Watch me do
Everything everywhere
All at once all the time
All around the world

Woke up lookin' like this (whoa)
So don't get under my skin (don't)
X-G-A-L-X
And that's the name of this ship "And that's it!"
Den mother mother wolf
So don't make fun of my kids
We all fam and stand tall now
So don't talk down on my kin, hey

Welcome to the party
Floatin' like it's mardi gras, yeah
You can call me HARVEY
But I'm not your barbie doll, yeah
Hardy hardy ha laughin' at 'em
While we blast away
Black on black on black
Outfits all packed away (packed away)

C to the O C O
That's me lord have mercy
Young queen but I act like an unnie
Young blood but I'm built like an OG (yeah)
Gotta lift weight for the bags (bags)
Lookin' real fit for the mags (mags)
And I'm a wolf in a pack (pack)
So I just woof and attack, uh-huh

Woke up lookin' like this
So don't get under my skin
Woke up lookin' like this
Like this (like this, like this, like this)
Woke up lookin' like this
So don't get under my skin
Woke up lookin' like this
Like this (like this, like this, like this)
