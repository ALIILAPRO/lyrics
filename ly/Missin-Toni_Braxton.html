		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many feet on the desk though
Let's go somewhere so we can be alone
Just like a shell on the seashore
Baby I wanna take you home
I play by a different set of rules
Dealing with someone like you
Keep you around like I'm in a crew
Hold me down like I depend on you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messin' around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinkin'
That you got the type of love that I be missin'

Yeah, yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, eh
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you for days

I felt your eyes and it hit me
Heard my heart, skippin' a beat
Wanna feel you breathin' 
On my body
I play by a different set of rules
So you better be ready for what I might do
When it's me and you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messin' around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinkin'
That you got the type of love that I be missin'

Yeah, yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, eh
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you for days

But for now, I'll be steel
Until you come back to me
I'll use my will
And miss you for real 

Ooh missin' (I'm missin', I'm missin', I'm missin')
Missin' you darling
Missin' you, missin' you
Miss you

I don't ever wanna think for one second
That messin' around with you is the wrong decision
'Cause someone just like you has got a girl thinkin'
That you got the type of love that I be missin'

Yeah, yeah, eh, yeah, yeah, eh
Like I'm trapped under a wave
I'll be missin' you for days
Missin' you, missin' you, hey hey
