		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tonight is the night I die

Lonely, another day
Drowning, please save me
I am struggling
In my own daydream

I know I can't live much longer
Hear the angels sing

Tonight is the night I die
Tonight is the night I die
Tonight is the night I

Surrender to my pain
Locked inside my cage
Could I be a prisoner not for the voices in my brain?
My mind is gone to waste
Can't stand to look at my face
All these thoughts inside my head be silenced by the bang

I know I can't live much longer
Hear the angels sing

Tonight is the night I die (believe me believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die (believe me believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die

Die another day
What they want me to say
What they want me to say
Die another day
Die another day
Die another day
Tonight is the night I die

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I look at you as I take my last breath
As I die and fall to the floor
My pain and suffering is no more

Tonight is the night I die (believe me believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die (believe me believe me when I say)
Tonight is the night I die

Die another day
What they want me to say
What they want me to say
Die another day
Die another day
Die another day
Tonight is the night I die

Tonight is the night I die
