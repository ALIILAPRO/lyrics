		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someone in the world tonight
Is dancing on their own
Trying hard to get it right
Tired of being alone
Arms spread open wide
Face up to the sky
There's nobody by your side
But still you're asking why

Is there someone out there to keep you breathing
Tryna find an answer to somehow stop this feeling
Can you hold on? I'm through with losing
Is there someone out there who really loves you?
In the dark, near or far, found a heart who wants you
Can you hold on? I'm through with losing

I wonder how you sleep at night
Are all your roses thorn?
Is everything on black & white
Since I've been gone?
'Cause I don't know 'bout you now
And I is gone, and ask you if, if your life turns upside down
Whether you still reminisce?
But you know I wish you well, in everything you do
But it's me who left behind, and I have feelings too
Anyway

Is there someone out there to keep you breathing
Tryna find an answer to somehow stop this feeling
Can you hold on? I'm through with losing
Is there someone out there who really loves you?
In the dark, near or far, found a heart who wants you
Can you hold on? I'm through with losing

Is there someone out there to keep you breathing,
Tryna find an answer to somehow stop this feeling
Can you hold on? I'm through with losing
Is there someone out there really loves you?
In the dark, near or far, found a heart who wants you
Can you hold on? I'm through with losing

I'm through with losing
I'm through with losing
I'm through with losing
