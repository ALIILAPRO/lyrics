		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm back at the start, falling apart in the old ways
I wish I was flawless, I'm not
Was fading away but everything fell into place
When you told me your name

Two halves of a heart hardly beating alone
But now that I've found you, I'm not letting go

Fall into me
Everyone's broken and I got this missing piece
Honestly
You fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me

You've been in the dark believing your thoughts
When they tell you you're anything less than you are
But that's just not true 'cause all of the scars
And the bruises, they're what make you human

We didn't need fixing all of this time
'Cause all of your edges fit right into mine

Fall into me
Everyone's broken and I got this missing piece
Honestly
You fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me

Fall into me
Everyone's broken and I got this missing piece
Honestly
You fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me (for me)

For me, you fit me like no-one
You're perfectly broken for me
For me, me, you're perfectly broken for
