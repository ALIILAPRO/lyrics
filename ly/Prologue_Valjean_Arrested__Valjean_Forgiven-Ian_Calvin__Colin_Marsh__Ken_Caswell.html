		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell his reverence your story
Let us see if he's impressed
You were lodging there last night
You were the honest Bishop's guest
And then, out of Christian goodness
When he learned about your plight
You maintained he made a present of his silver

That is right
But my friend you left so early
Something surely slipped your mind

You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind?

So Messieurs you may release him
For this man has spoken true
I commend you for your duty
And God's blessing go with you

And remember this, my brother
See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man
By the witness of the martyrs
By the passion and the blood
God has raised you out of darkness
I have bought your soul for God!
