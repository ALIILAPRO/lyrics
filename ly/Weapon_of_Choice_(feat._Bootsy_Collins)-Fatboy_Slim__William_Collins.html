Don't be shocked by tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice
Don't be shocked by tone of my voice

Walk without rhythm, it won't attract the worm
Walk without rhythm, and it won't attract the worm
Walk without rhythm, and it won't attract the worm
if you walk without rhythm, huh, you'll never learn

Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice
Don't be shocked by the tone of my voice
Check out my new weapon, weapon of choice

Be careful, we don't know them 
Be careful, we don't know them

(Spiral Music)

Organically grown
Through the hemisphere I roam
To make love to the angels of life, yeah and my girl 
I guess you just don't understand
It's gone beyond being a man
As I drift off into the night
I'm in flight
She's a boy's scoundrel gal
But I'm gonna hold my cool
Cause the music rules
Yeah, so move on baby, yeah 

Halfway between the gutter and the stars
Yeah
Halfway between the gutter and the stars
Yeah

You can blow wit' this
Or you can blow wit' that
You can blow wit' this
Or you can blow wit' that
You can blow wit' this
Or you can blow wit' that
Or you can blow wit' us

You can blow wit' this
Or you can blow wit' that
You can blow wit' this
Or you can blow wit' that
You can blow wit'
