		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now in the street there is violence
And a lots of work to be done
No place to hang out our washing
And I can't blame all on the sun, oh no

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Workin' so hard like a soldier
And can't afford a thing on TV
Deep in my heart, I'm a warrior
And can't get food for them kids, good God

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Oh no oh no
Oh no oh no

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Who is to blame in one country

You never can get to the one
Dealin' in multiplication
And you konw you never can to feed everyone
Oh no

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Out in the street out in the street
Out in the daytime out in the night

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Out in the street out in the street
Out in the playground
In the dark side of town

We gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh, we gonna rock down to Electric Avenue
And then we'll take it higher
