		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Usually a drink will do the trick
Take the edge off quick, sitting in the dark
With a shared cigarette
Seeing eye to eye and heart to heart
But maybe I'm just getting old
Used to work but now it don't
A long gone drive
You know the kind where you take a turn and you don't know why
But it clears your mind, a surefire cure
I need something stronger
That'll last a little longer

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me, so far, just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

I wish I didn't know so much
I peeked behind the curtain
Now that magic rush
Feels like a trick that isn't working
But I haven't lost all hope yet
Yeah, it's hurtin' but it ain't dead

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me, so far, just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song

Give me a sign or a rhyme or a reason
Just something that I can believe in

I could use a love song
That takes me back, just like that
When it comes on
To a time when I wouldn't roll my eyes
At a guy and a girl
Who make it work in a world
That for me, so far, just seems to go so wrong
Yeah, I could use
Yeah, I could use, I could use a love song, ooh
