		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once
Doesn't mean anything to me
Come
Show me the meaning of complete
Where
Did our love go wrong
Once we were so strong
How can I go on?

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
How could I know
That you would go
That you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

Why
Can't I just leave it all behind
I
Felt passion so bright that I was blind
Then
Something made me weak
Talking in my sleep
Baby, I'm in so deep and you know I believed

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
How could I know
That you would go
That you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one

Your lips
Your face
Something that time just can't erase
Find my heart
Could break
All over again

When you told me you loved me
Did you know it would take me the rest of my life
To get over the feeling of knowing
A dream didn't turn out right
When you let me believe that you weren't complete
Without me by your side
How could I know
That you would go
That you would run
Baby, I thought you were the one
