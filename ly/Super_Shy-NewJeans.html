		  I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy

And I wanna go out with you
Where you wanna go? (Huh?)
Find a lil spot, just sit and talk
Looking pretty, follow me
우리 둘이 나란히
보이지? (봐) 내 눈이 (ha) 갑자기 빛나지
When you say I'm your dream (ha)

You don't even know my name
Do ya?
You don't even know my name
Do ya?
누구보다도

I'm super shy, supеr shy
But wait a minute while I make you minе, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy

나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지
I don't like that
Something odd about you
Yeah, you're special and you know it
You're the top, babe

I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
I'm super shy, super shy
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy

You don't even know my name
Do ya?
You don't even know my name
Do ya?
누구보다도
(Super shy, super shy) you don't even know my name
Do ya? (make you mine, make you mine)
(On my mind all the time, I wanna tell you but I'm) you don't even know my name
Do ya? (super shy, super shy)
