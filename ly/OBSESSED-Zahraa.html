		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught in your feelings, when you're alone
You can't accept you can't have everything you want
Thinking you're in control, but you jaded
Taking sip after sip, getting faded
Can't get me out of your mind, boy it's aimless
And if we're honest
We both know baby
That you're wrapped around my finger
All in your feelings lately
Go ahead and keep your distance
You're obsessed
Mais tu seras toujours mahwoos
Got you locked up, oh mahboos
Living in your head
So don't think that you get to choose
Mais tu seras toujours mahwoos
Want me bad but you're confused
Living in your head
So don't think that you get to choose
Tu peux masquer mes stories
Tu peux même me bloquer
Bghiti oula krehti
Ghan nkoun dima dans tes pensées
Jareb tnssani m3a chi hed tani
I promise 3amrek ma gha tel9a fhali
You say you hate my teasing
Dissociate from your feelings
A thousand girls but still feening
Mon chéri your life lacking meaning
We both know baby
That you're wrapped around my finger
All in your feelings lately
Go ahead and keep your distance
You're obsessed
Mais tu seras toujours mahwoos
Got you locked up, oh mahboos
Living in your head
So don't think that you get to choose
Mais tu seras toujours mahwoos
Watching my every single move
Living in your head
There's no way you can cut me loose
Still, you want me to be the one
Though I trust no one
Still, you want me to be the one
Though I trust no one
Still, you want me to be the one
Still, you want me to be the one
Still, you want me to be the one
The only one
Mais tu seras toujours mahwoos
Got you locked up, oh mahboos
Living in your head
So don't think that you get to choose
Mais tu seras toujours mahwoos
Watching my every single move
Living in your head
There's no way you can cut me loose
You're obsessed yeah
You're obsessed
Nooo
You're obsessed yeah
Nooo
