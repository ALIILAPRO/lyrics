		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Wondering where I been, yeah
I done transcended
I done made it up to the Heavens
Even as I'm counting blessings
Still gripping weapons
I know homies out there doing 211s, yeah (yeah)
Whoa

I been getting death threats
Still I'm out in the field (outside)
Too many hoes got my name tatted
You gon' have to show me something else
Like would you love me on them pills?
Send me letters in a detox
Or do me like them other hoes
Take it all and leave me cleaned out (fuck)

I keep watching all my fam die
All these hoes they be fanned out
Got no trust for a damn thot (damn thot)
They couldn't handle what I'm really on (really on)
Pop a pill, get my kidneys going
In the ville with the semi on
Hard to stand so I lean on
If I'm ducking let me dream on (yeah)

Yeah
Dream on
Whoa, dream on
Dream on
Whoa, dream on 
Dream on (let's go, let's go)
Whoa, dream on
Dream on
Whoa, dream on (okay)

Coming out my motherfucking body
Choppa with me and it's sitting shotty
Spoiled bitch with a new body
In the valley swerving Maserati (Masi')
I could never tell you how it feel (how it feel)
Independent I don't sign a deal
Za up in the vacuum seal
Washing Xan with some chamomile
Whoa, think I lost my brain, yeah
Mortgage on the chain, yeah
Codeine in my veins, yeah
In the field with the gang, whoa
Northside what we bang, whoa
Get a bitch, get her trained, whoa
Don't know the shake he ain't gang no
Breaking legs on a voodoo doll
Talk to spirits, I know who to call
Word is scripture like my name was Paul
I got razors tucked up in my jaw
Yeah, mhm
Turn the city grey, yeah, yeah
For my opps I pray, yeah, yeah
Right before they slayed, yeah, yeah
Pcp the cig, yeah, yeah
Fuck her 'til she piss, yeah, yeah (fuck that)
Wait too lit to live, yeah, yeah
Russian roulette click, yeah, yeah
Mhm, damn
Feed the pigs, they won't leave no bones (yeah, yeah)
Chrome cowboy, Jerry Jones
I get high 'til I'm all alone

Dream on
Whoa, dream on
Dream on
Whoa, dream on 
Dream on
Whoa, dream on
Dream on
Whoa, dream on

You know, I remember that one time I was talking to my brother on the phone
And, uh, he said, you know
"I know you got Sage, I know you got these people around you
I know you got your money, I know you got this, I know you got that"
And he's just, you know, naming off a bunch of stuff
And he was like, "Bro, I want you to know that I see you"
And I don't know what the fuck he meant by that
I'm like, "What does that mean?"
And he was like, "You still all alone"
