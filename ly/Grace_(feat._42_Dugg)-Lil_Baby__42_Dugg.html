		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a lotta new flames, still need 'em blue
Three hundred fifty thou', times that by two
New Dawn, no roof, I still see the sky
Peace to my grandma, I can still see my guys
Turned his back, must've felt let down
Heard a down-set-hut, what you gon' bet now?
Yeah, I used to be a twerp, bitch, a vet now
Luke, get up, doggy, I need you
Only nigga made sure that I was eatin'
Free Nef still, nigga, RIP Reese
Get her nails done, still charge for the feature
Baby, we ain't that, nah, we ain't this
All that fuckin', I don't do no kiss
Bitches ain't shit, word to my niggas
All in my mentions (yeah)
Bitch really wanna get hired
Tell the lil' hoes I'm Bryson
I done hit more shit than Mike Tyson
Get popped, nigga, I ain't doin' no fight
Sinnin' 'bout cash, I ain't doin' no right

Car too fast, can't stop at no light
I hit the gas, it skrrt and I pull off
I'm on they ass, I just took a year off
She shakin' her ass, call me when she get off
Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up, whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force One, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name 
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out
Hands down, bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building
Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Tev, wish shit was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my nigga
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head and I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5, just beat his murder
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah
