		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  $uicide

It's that marble martyr, fucking daughters
Rocking Starter, going farther
Sauce ain't tarter, bitch, it's barbecue
Bitch, I be that
Breadcrumb-covered motherfucker
Bitch, I'm fucking southern fried
Lyin' to all you look-alikes just to
Further you from the truth
Sippin' white wine, then committed $uicide
Now I'm sippin' red wine in the booth
Blowin' on a blunt, puffin' up
Me and $lick go poof goku on the beat
Steady getting money like a toll booth nah
I'm just playin'
Bitch, I'm broke, $loth broke too
Ridin' in that drop-top with the whole crew
No proof
White pearls wit' one gold tooth, uh

Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck

Ride till the Sun up
Old trucks with the top up
Yet these bitches still stutter
Yung Christ, and I'm smokin' on butter
Just another white creep with no respect
Everyday I hold my breath, tryna meet Death
No check, no balance, and no debt
No money, no cars, but I'm on flex
See you motherfuckers don't get
That I could give a fuck about this rap shit
Born with a dope flow and an accent
808s with the slap got ya' back bent
So here's a big "fuck
You" to you motherfuckers
Buncha clones, $uicide not like the others
So if you wanna meet that devil
Shit I got in me keep talking, lil' bitch

Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck
Let me get the keys to the Rover truck

I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna
I'm the number one stunna, yah!
