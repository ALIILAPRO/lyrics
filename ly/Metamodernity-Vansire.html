		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Next to Hudson Yards
It's crowded on the weekdays 
From April to May 
Parse apart a troubled heart from an E Train 
And sing about it in LA

With clouds in the rearview 
You start humming along
To the first verse
Of your favorite song
That you quote each day with the words all wrong

So call me when the world looks bleak
I love you but it's hard to believe
With every day we'll start to see
The rest is metamodernity 

With agrestic charm
It's humid in the midwest
From June to July 
All beneath a pinkish sky from the wildfires
Which mantle the horizon line

From the outset 
It's been hard to tell 
Why I'd feel this down
When it all bodes well

So call me when the world looks bleak
I love you but it's hard to believe
With every day we'll start to see
The rest is metamodernity
