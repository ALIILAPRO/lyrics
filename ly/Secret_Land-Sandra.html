		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember
Leaves were falling down in St.Germain
It was a cold November
You went away
An' I got a dream

Nobody knows who I am
Maybe you would understand
Anybody knows what I am
Down in a secret land

Nobody knows how I try 
Not to tell another lie
Anybody knows in the end
I'll find a secret land

I need you
I feel you
I can't life without you
So long

I know that
We parted
I'll stay in this town
Cause I miss you so

I feel it
I mean it
The secret that I'm gonna show

An' I turn back
I see that
All my love had to fail
But I miss you so

Nobody knows who I am 
Maybe you would understand
Anybody knows what I am
Down in a secret land

Nobody knows how I try
Not to tell another lie
Anybody knows in the end
I'll find a secret land
