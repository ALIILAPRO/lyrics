		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I catch a fever that's so hard to bear

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I wanna treat you right

You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
And fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you outta know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said to Julie, "Baby, you're my flame"
He givest fever
When we kisseth
Fever with my flaming youth
Fever, I'm on fire
Fever, yeah, I burn forsooth

Captain Smith and Pocahontas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said, "Daddy, oh don't you dare"
He gives me fever
With his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Daddy, won't you treat him right

Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Cats were born to give chicks fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
We give ya fever
When we kiss ya
Fever if you live and learn
Fever 'til you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn

You give me fever
Catch the fever
Catch the fever
