		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire, ooh

Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em, man, white knuckle tight
Through black and white

Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
Ooh, and on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire
Yeah

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, oh, yeah
Take the corner, join the crash
Headlights, headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Yeah, lives way too fast, fast, fast, oh-oh

Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
Ooh, and on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire, ooh, yeah

White knuckle tight

(On and on and on and on)
Give me fuel (on and on and on and on)
Give me fire (on and on and on and on)
My desire (on and on and on and on)

Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
Ooh, and on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Give me fuel, give me fire
Give me that which I desire, ooh

On I burn
