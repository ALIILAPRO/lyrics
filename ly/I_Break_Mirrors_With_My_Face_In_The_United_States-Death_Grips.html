		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I break mirrors with my face in the United States
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Everything rigged at this place, it's not me
Don't break my concentration with those thoughts baby
I don't care about real life
Feel just like I look to you
Gawk at me all you see is you
Anyday trip, mayday trip
Can't break my face I'm in a state trip
Spit on you spit on me
All we know spit must be us
Spit fits us we spit and sniff
We sniff and clutch each other's fate
I don't care about real life
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
Too many mirrors share my face
Can't braille which mirrors my mistake
Too many mirrors wear my face
These broken mirrors take my place
I don't care about real life
Too many mirrors share my face
Can't braille which mirrors my mistake
I break mirrors with my face in the United States
