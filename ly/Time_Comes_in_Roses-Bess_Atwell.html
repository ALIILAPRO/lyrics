		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [V1] Anyway, you’re seeing stars at night inside the
plane
You’d like to light me up, but I don’t play
“Hey” you say “Summer’s on her way”
[PC] But she doesn’t know it’s the end of the world
And she dances you back to the garden, girl
[C] But time comes in roses
I really love ya
I’m tired of being like my mother
I get excited, I get depressed
I’m never happy with how I’m dressed
[V2] Anyway, there’s nothing I won’t tell you or not
say
And you like the way you hurt yourself today
With the tv on the back foot up the way
[PC2] I’m scared of sleeping and I don’t know why
How it dances you into a lonely night
[C] But time comes in roses
I really love ya
I’m tired of being like my mother
I get excited, I get depressed
I’m never happy with how I’m dressed
Five years wasted, I’m still young
But only by a couple months
And then I’m dead
For all intents and purposes
And I’ve been slower than I thought
At getting my life off the rocks
Nobody thinks I’m special yet
Nobody thinks I’m special yet
