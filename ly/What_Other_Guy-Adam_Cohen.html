		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you look like in the morning
Your kisses are soft and warm
I can draw you with my eyes closed
See you with nothing on but the radio
I know how many years of French you took
Your favorite movies, your favorite books
I know what really gets you going… glowing

I know where you go with your beautiful friends
I know what you taste like when the night ends

I know the kind of thing that makes you laugh
The way you tilt your head for a photograph
What other guy knows you like that?

And I can name the first guy you ever kissed
I can name the perfume on your wrist
What other guy knows you like that?

Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne

I know what you want by what you're wearing
The kind of night you're preparing
I know what your hands do when you're kissing
Your number one and number two favorite positions
I know how your skin glistens… listen

I know where you go with your beautiful friends
I know what you taste like when the night ends

I know the kind of thing that makes you laugh
The way you tilt your head for a photograph
What other guy knows you like that?

And I can name the first guy you ever kissed
I can name the perfume on your wrist
What other guy knows you like that?

Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne

I know where you go with your beautiful friends
Yes I know what you taste like when the night ends

I know the kind of thing that makes you laugh
The way you tilt your head for a photograph
What other guy knows you like that?

And I can name the first guy you ever kissed
I can name the perfume on your wrist
What other guy knows you like that?

Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne

Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
Oh, Anne
