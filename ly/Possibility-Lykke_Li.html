		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a possibility,
There's a possibility,
All that I had, was all I'm gonn' get

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

There's a possibility,
There's a possibility,
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare
All I'm gonn' get is gone with your stare

So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one who knows
Tell me when you hear my silence
There's a possibility I wouldn't know

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

Know that when you leave,
Know that when you leave,
By blood and by me, you walk like a thief,
By blood and by me, I fall when you leave

So tell me when you hear my heart stop
You're the only one who knows
Tell me when you hear my silence,
There's a possibility I wouldn't know

So tell me when my sorrows over
You're the reason why I'm closed
Tell me when you hear me falling
There's a possibility it wouldn't show

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

By blood and by me, I'll fall when you leave
By blood and by me, I'll follow your lead

Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
