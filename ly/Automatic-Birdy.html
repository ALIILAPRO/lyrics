		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah, oh)
If I reach out for you (yeah, oh)
Will you pull me towards you? (Yeah, oh)
There's a voice that's callin' (yeah, oh)
Me into the forest in the night
And I hear you talkin' (yeah, oh)
And my heart is stallin' (yeah, oh)
Not gonna restart for you (yeah, oh)
I've already cut the wire

Don't ask me to need you like that
Don't ask me to give what I can't
Don't ask me to love you
Don't ask me to love you, no

I, I can't cut through the static
Maybe I think too much about it
If I could love you automatic
I would
Oh, you make it sound so simple
Drop my guard and act on impulse
If I could love you automatic
I would

Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would love

If I numb my senses (yeah, oh)
Could I try pretendin'? (Yeah, oh)
Couldn't be so reckless (yeah, oh)
To hide in the corners of my mind
When I caught sight sterlin' (yeah, oh)
Couldn't say it for certain (yeah, oh)
That it won't hurt you (yeah, oh)
I know how to kill the fire

You know, I, I can't cut through the static
Maybe I think too much about it
If I could love you automatic
I would
Oh, you make it sound so simple
Drop my guard and act on impulse
If I could love you automatic
I would

Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would love

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
I would
Oh, oh, oh

Automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love automatic, I would
Love
