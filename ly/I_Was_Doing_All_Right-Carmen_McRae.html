		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was doing all right
Nothing but rainbows in my sky
I was doing all right
'Til you came by

Had no cause to complain
Life was as sweet as apple pie
Never noticed the rain
'Til you came by

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing better than ever now

But now whenever you're away
I can't sleep nights and suffer all the day
I just sit and wonder
If love isn't one big blunder

But when you hold me tight
Tingling all through, I feel somehow
I was doing all right
But I'm doing, yes, I'm doing
I'm doing much better than ever now
