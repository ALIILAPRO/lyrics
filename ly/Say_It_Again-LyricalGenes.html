		  Say it again
Wont you say it again
Say it say it
Wont you wont you
Say it again
Say it again

Cause your in my head
I don't want to pretend
Over again
You keep playing games
I don't want to be friends
Cause I
Bet you dont know how I feel
All of these years im your personal shield
I would protect you from evil you know that I'm real
Take care when you feeling ill
Ohhh
I would promise one day
You wont have to be afraid
I would be here to stay
And baby don't worry cause i will just say it again
Say it again
Wont you say it again
Say it say it
Wont you wont you
Say it again
Say it again
Oh wow
Oh wow
Wont you say oh oh oh oh
Wont you say oh oh oh oh oh
Don't you want to just to say
Don't you want to just to say
You are on my mind
All the time
Baby see i hate it when you say goodbye
Ill be waiting until you realise
I aint going no where cause im by your side
Ohhhh
Baby can you get me out the friend zone
Baby you're the only one that I want
Baby dont trip you got no flaws
You wont stick around for the small talk
What can I do to received you're attention
Ill do my best for you're love and affection
So tell me what do i do
If it gotta be youu yeah
Say it again
Wont you say it again
Say it say it
Wont you wont you
Say it again
Say it again

Oh wow
Wont you say oh oh oh oh
Wont you say oh oh oh oh oh
Don't you want to just to say
Don't you want to just to say
