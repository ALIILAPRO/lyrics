		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Broken hearts and battle scars
From the shadows, here we are
Fallen angels in disguise
Waiting for the right time

We've got our backs against the wall
We'll stand our ground and we won't fall
Fighting to be who we are
Waiting on the front line

Hands up
It's going down
Let me hear you say it
Right now
It's going down
If we lose it all tonight

Who's gonna save us, tonight
Who's gonna save us
(Oh oh oh oh) who's gonna save us
(Oh oh oh oh) who's gonna save us

Broken promises and lies
There will be no compromise
Long as we are side by side
We won't be defeated

This is it, our time is now
Rising up and screaming out
If we can't bend the laws they make
Then we will have to break them

Hands up
It's going down
Let me hear you say it
Right now
It's going down
If we lose it all tonight

Who's gonna save us, tonight
Who's gonna save us
(Oh oh oh oh) who's gonna save us
(Oh oh oh oh) who's gonna save us

And on the darkest night
Before the break of light
If we don't stand and fight
Who's gonna save us
