		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm remembering the old me who was lonely on a Saturday
I've been catering to your needs so you like me
Now I finally see

I've been holding back
Pretending this is who I am

But you no longer tell me what to do
I got nothing left to prove
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good

I go nanananana
Tonight I will be testing my luck in the club
My body's going nananana in the club
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good

I go nanananana
Tonight I will be testing my luck in the club
My body's going nananana in the club
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good

Had a breakdown when we broke up
It was bad for me
You said you wanna makeup, that was made up
Now I clearly see

I've been holding back
Pretending this is who I am

But you no longer tell me what to do
I got nothing left to prove
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good

I go nanananana
Tonight I will be testing my luck in the club
My body's going nananana in the club
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good

I go nanananana
Tonight I will be testing my luck in the club
My body's going nananana in the club
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good

(I go nanananana
Tonight I will be testing my luck in the club
My body's going nananana in the club
Without you I feel good
Without you I feel good)
