		  (Turn that shit up, 2)

(Maximum) i feel it (I feel it, yeah)
I feel it (yeah)
That they tried to take my style from me
(yeah, I feel it)
When that bitch, she taking a bath for me
(yeah, I feel it)
They ain't think that I was this wise
I didn’t reach my peak yet
I ain't even at the maximum
Yeah I'm with my twizzy yeah my spiders
Not tarantulas
I think that the trackhawk wheels on fire
Cause look how fast we was
Your lil thotty threw that brain
On me so good, i got a bachelors

Yeah this shit is a new
Body two hundred thousand, two hundred dash
Yes like three hundred three hundred
Yeah I got cash got a bag full of cash
Say y’all outside let me
See somеthing see something
Wish it out on digital dash
Just got to keep guarding yeah my new crib
This shit so big shit so vast
Just hit thе bank there ain't
Shit in the envelope
Bitch I'm appraising the bag
If you think you richer and
Smarter and stronger than me
Then do what you said
You better not hit my phone
Yeah you did not just forget what you said
(Blocked) well then I used to have nothing
(who) so anything now I feel like the shit
Im on to go the moon
(go) , Im a goat emoji (bag)
Watch my brother pull up with it
He don't even have to load (bah, bah, bah)
Too many oxys in my brain right now
I feel unstoppable (yeah)
Why she call my phone so many damn times
You know that you blockable (Hah)
(yeah baby)
Burberry, Burberry, Burberry shoes
Hey baby, I got Burberry shoes
Yeah, I'm a still junky
Ain't a real junky, I just got money
I get high everyday
I swear to god I work at NASA
Put me on that rocket ship
Lil bitch you'll get some answers
This shit not rocket science, or maybe it is
Please don't waste my time
Or you already know that I’m gone as a bitch

(Maximum) i feel it (I feel it, yeah)
I feel it (yeah)
That they tried to take my style from me
(yeah, I feel it)
When that bitch, she taking a bath for me
(yeah, I feel it)
They ain’t think that I was this wise
I didn't reach my peak yet
I ain’t even at the maximum
Yeah I'm with my twizzy yeah my spiders
Not tarantulas
I think that the trackhawk wheels on fire
Cause look how fast we was
Your lil thotty threw that brain
On me so good, i got a bachelors
