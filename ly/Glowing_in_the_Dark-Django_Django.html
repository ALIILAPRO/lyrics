		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't see in front of me
Draw on my memory, ah
My sense has taken leave
I need the space to breath, ah

It starts to emanate
This space between, illuminates
Give me a remedy
A hand, a guide, and now we see
The speed of light is leaving
Us behind

Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark, d-d-dark

I lay awake at night
It's gonna melt my mind, ah
Your eyes will radiate
They're gonna lead the way, ah

It starts to emanate
This space between, illuminates
Give me a remedy
A hand, a guide, and now we see
The speed of light is leaving
Us behind

Now we're glowing in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the-
Now we're glowing in the dark
Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the-

Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark, d-d-dark

Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark
Now we're glowing in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, d-d-dark, d-d-dark

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
