		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well can you put your hands in your head, oh no!
I said "far out, what a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well you know, you had it comin' to you
Now, there's not a lot I can do

Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer
So now you put your head in your hands, oh no

I said, "far out, what a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well you know, you had it comin' to you
Now, there's not a lot I can do

Work it out someday
Oh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma

(If I could see something) you can see anything you want, boy
(If I could be someone) you can be anyone, celebrate, boy

(If I can do something) you can do something
(If I could do anything) but can you do something out of this world?

Take a dream on a sunday
Take a life, take a holiday
Take a lie, take a dreamer
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream along
Dreamer, dream and dream along
C'mon and dream, dream along (come along)
(C'mon and dream, dream along)

(C'mon and dream, dream along) na na na na na na na na
Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer (c'mon and dream and dream along)
Can you put your hands in your head, oh no! (c'mon and dream and dream along)
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer (c'mon and dream and dream along)
Can you put your hands in your head, oh no! (oh, come on, oh, come on)
Oh no
