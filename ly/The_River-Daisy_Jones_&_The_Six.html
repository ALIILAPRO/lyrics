		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could've sworn this was the way
Tell me again, why do we stay
On such a lonely, lonely, lonely road?
You'd never guess, I'd never know
We're on the same side and it's gonna
Be a lonely, lonely, lonely road

If I follow you to the river
Send my blues out to the sea
Will you stay with me forever?
Will you chase me in my dreams?
If I throw it all in the river
And let the rhythm take the lead
Will it stay with you whenever
That you lean on me?

Ooh, I know, I know
Ooh, I know

You had a choice I couldn't make
And this is the last turn that you take
On a lonely, lonely, lonely road
Give me your hand, here is my heart
Where does it end? When do we start?
On a lonely, lonely, lonely road

If I follow you to the river
Send my blues out to the sea
Will you stay with me forever?
Will you chase me in my dreams?
If I throw it all in the river
And let the rhythm take the lead
Will it stay with you whenever
That you lean on me?

Ooh, I know, I know
Ooh, I know

I'm an echo in your shadow
And your shadows, I'm in too deep
In the river, your reflection
Is a promise you couldn't keep
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I took you here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
This is fair

Oh, ah
Ooh-ah
Ooh-ah, ah
Ooh-ah
If I follow you to the river

If I follow you to the river
(If I follow you to the river, if I follow you to the river)
And your shadows, run out so deep
Oh, if I follow you to the river (if I ever see you there)
And your shadows, in the river, your reflection
Is a promise you couldn't keep
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, if I (ooh, oh)
If I follow you to the river (ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If I follow you there (to the river)
In the river, your reflection (oh, if I follow you to the river)
Is a promise you couldn't keep
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I'm an echo, and your shadow
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I lost you here
I know, I know I love you now
