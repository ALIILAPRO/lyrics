		  Don't go, don't
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't
Don't go

My Mona Lisa, baby
My masterpiece, bae (masterpiece)
When I'm in pieces, baby
You give me peace of mind
You tell me we'll be fine
You always get me right
When it's dark, you're my light

Baby, that's why I need you on the regular
And if it wasn't you, no, it would never work (never work)
Got me going out my way to show you what you're worth
Don't go (don't go)

I put in the work to hear you say (don't go, don't go)
Misery missing your company (don't go, don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way (don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you're supposed to be (don't go)

I woke up in the city
I ain't seen your face
Almost lost my mind, medication (woah)
Five stars for participation (yeah)
It's a COVID operation (woo)
Hope you hear this where you stationed (stationed)
I lost my Bonnie
By that time you already banged it (banged it)
She armed and dangerous
That long hair got me tangled up (yup)
You are my Topanga
Stood your ground even when they aimed at us (yeah, yeah)
Even through all of that pain
None of it was in vain
And I'm proud of who you've become
Hope you feel the same (the same)

Frozen, don't let me go (don't go, don't)
But let it go, please
We been so close (don't go, don't go)
Don't go ghosting me, my vital OG (don't go)
That's on the record, you made me better (don't go)

I put in the work to hear you say (don't go)
Misery missing your company (don't go, don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way (don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you supposed to be (don't go)

Peace and love (peace and love, don't go)
You talk about him like he's decent enough (decent enough, don't go)
I see you moving, is he keeping up? (keeping up, don't go)
Don't know what you're doing, but you needing love (needing love, don't go)
Needing love (needing love, don't go)

How far can you get, girl? (don't go, don't go)
You know I been in love with you since the beginning, girl (don't go, don't go)
Talking out of tone to me, gotta be kidding, girl (don't go, don't)
Get you all alone with me, gotta be committed, yeah (don't go)

Girl, I need to see your face
Hit the gas to win the race
Thirty pounds of loaded bass
Move it, babe, I love the chase
Do your dirt, I keep the taste
Pop that shit and make me wait
Shorty like that (shorty like that)
She call me up but I might be late

I put in the work to hear you say (don't go, don't)
Misery missing your company (don't go, don't go)
See 'em pulling at you that way (don't go)
Ooh, if this is where you're supposed to be (don't go)

(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
(Don't go)
