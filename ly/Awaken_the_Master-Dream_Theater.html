		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Finding your way
On a frozen path where the air is thin
The angel of balance keeps you alive

A flower unfolds
A heartbeat brings new meaning to the universe
The angel of balance keeps you strong
Discovering what has been all along

Spinning through life, lost in the spiral of time
Turning the stone, circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

You made it to the top just to find out
You're only halfway there
All along, missing the point of the journey

The will of the soul like a peak so high
You look inside to rise, searching out a dream
Climbing, reaching further
And the voices of the angels bring you closer

Spinning through life, lost in the spiral of time
Turning the stone, circles of darkness and light
Remember hereafter

Spinning through life, lost in the spiral of time
Turning the stone, circles of darkness and light

Spinning through life, we balance the heart and the mind
Turning the stone, embracing the truth that we find

Remember hereafter
The end of a chapter
Awaken the master
Awaken the master
