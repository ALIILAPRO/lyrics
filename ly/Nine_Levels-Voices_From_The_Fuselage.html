		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is it easier to stay, and suffer the pain?
Waking up to such disdain every single day.
You place your hope in someone strange, and hope things will change.
I'm here to save you from this place (undo your fall from grace).

I will carry you through, break those shackles from you.
(Your legacy will ensue).
Take my hand before we sink into entropy.
(This world is not done with you).

I've fallen into a pursuit
Where monsters reign and fear takes root.
But all the realms I battle through,
It's all for you. It's all for you.
I've seen the shape of things to come.
Where order fades and chaos runs.
The adversaries I cut through,
It's all for you. It's all for you.

One is light and one is dark, you know which dwells deep in your heart.
(You know which dwells deep in your heart).
I'm holding out for one more breath before my maker's met.
I'm here to save you from regret (override the sins we shed).

I will carry you through, break those shackles from you.
(Your legacy will ensue).
Take my hand before we sink into entropy.
(This world is not done with you).

Are you alone are you alone down here?
Do you need me do you need me to evict your fear?
It pulls you underneath. Like nothing i've ever seen.
Are you depraved are you depraved down here?
Will you survive the place i've endured for several years?
It pulled me underneath. This is not my usual dream.

Let this be a mistake
Let it be one more lie
I live to break the rules
And tempt you down to fire

I've fallen into a pursuit
Where monsters reign and fear takes root.
But all the realms I battle through,
It's all for you. It's all for you.
I've seen the shape of things to come.
Where order fades and chaos runs.
The adversaries I cut through,
It's all for you. It's all for you.
