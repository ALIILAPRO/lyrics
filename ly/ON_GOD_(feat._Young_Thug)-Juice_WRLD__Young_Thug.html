		  DY Krazy
Uh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Brand new Chanels
Don't look at the tag, baby
I bought her ass, best believe that I'm gon' tap, baby
I drive in the Jag crazy
I crash that bitch daily
Had to upgrade to a Mercedes (ayy)

I made a bag, baby (yeah)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I'm in my bag (on God)
I drive it real fast, baby (on God)
Mercedes Benz (on God)
I'm in my bag, baby

I'm in first class, baby (on God)
You in last, baby (on God)
I'm a 90's baby
But I cook that shit from the 80's (on God)
Hardtop Mercedes (on God)
I'm ridin' in a drop Mercedes (on God)
Fuck all your opps, don't save 'em (that's on God)
Just let the AK rearrange ya (that's on God)
Fuck on a opp nigga's bitch on the daily (on God)
Ball on a bitch, Tracy McGrady (that's on God)
Throw B's up for the brazy (on God)
I put the K in crazy (on God)
I went No Limit dance on the daily (on God)
That choppa turn ya like pages, uh (on God)
Headshot your face lookin' crazy, uh (on God)
Did I say cray? I meant brazy, uh
I got four pockets with lettuce
We 'bout to show 'em who the best is
I need an ambulance up in the nosebleeds
I designed her lil' body, she a trophy
And she do what designer say
I'm 'bout to buy her the All-State
I'ma fill up this bitch with some more shit
Whatever, bitch, she a Barbie

Brand new Chanels
Don't look at the tag, baby
I bought her ass, best believe that I'm gon' tap, baby
I drive in the Jag crazy
I crash that bitch daily
Had to upgrade to a Mercedes (ayy)

I made a bag, baby (yeah)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I'm in my bag (on God)

My niggas in your crib, baby (on God)
They go real brazy (that's on God)
I'ma pull up in the latest (on God)
Matte black, you know that I painted it (on God)
New millennium, totin' the stainless (on God)
Got a red beam for long ranges, yeah (on God, on God, on God)
I got savage ways (on God)
I got baddie babes (that's on God)
I got me the swings (no cap, on God)
All I'm bringin' in (no cap, on God)
Yeah (uh)
The way you lied to me is too fugazi (on God)
No magazine shells fade away (uh)
I'm in Japan with an Asian persuasion (yeah, on God)
Bitches from the Himalayas bringin' me bacon
Gucci robes like masons, fuck her in a Bathing Ape apron
My bitch foreign
I don't know where she from, I ain't tryna be racist (on God)
I don't fuck with niggas, I'm racist, uh
Get my dick sucked by a soultaker, uh
I told her I just want the top
Your clothes, don't even take it off (that's on God)
I'm Paul Walker when I'm takin' off
I'm fast and furious on you hoes (on God)
Unlike you broke-ass niggas, I actually achieve my goals (that's on God)
I'm 'bout to ride, I'll add her name in my tats
I'm too good up to ever disguise, I get fed up after runnin' 'round, yeah
I gotta try it, I done pulled her panties to the side
Got four closets for my child, I got even more for my wife

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, this on God, right
This on God, oh
DY Krazy
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's on God
DY Krazy
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
That's on God, that's on God
That's on God, that's on God, that's on

Brand new Chanels
Don't look at the tag, baby

Had to upgrade to a Mercedes (ayy)

I made a bag, baby (yeah)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I made a bag, baby (on God)
I'm in my bag (on God)
I drive it real fast, baby (on God)
Mercedes Benz (on God)
I'm in my bag, baby
