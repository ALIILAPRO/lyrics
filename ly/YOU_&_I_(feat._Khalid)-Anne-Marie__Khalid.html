		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These days you've been so quiet
But you pretend that you're alright
You don't have to say you're sorry
I can see it in your eyes

Put your PJ's on, switch off your phone
And we'll watch ten movies in a row
The dark days are better when we're together
I hope you know you're not alone

So why don't we stay here?
Hold onto each other
Underneath these covers
Together, you and I
Yeah, why don't we lay here?
Not get up 'til Monday
We can be strong one day, but not tonight

I can see those dark clouds over the both of us
But I know how to make you smile
So why don't we stay here?
Hold onto each other
Underneath these covers
Together, you and I
Together, you and I

And for a moment 
I see my life flash before me
Just another sad story we never write
But we're not broken (not broken)
We may be a little weary
I beg to have you near me for the night

Let's put our PJ's on, switch off our phones
And we'll watch ten movies in a row
The dark days are better when we're together
And now I know I'm not alone

So why don't we stay here?
Hold onto each other
Underneath these covers
Together, you and I
Yeah, why don't we lay here?
Not get up 'til Monday
We can be strong one day, but not tonight

I can see those dark clouds over the both of us
But I know how to make you smile
So why don't we stay here?
Hold onto each other
Underneath these covers
Together, you and I
Together, you and I

Together, you and I
I, I, I

So why don't we stay here?
Hold onto each other
Underneath these covers
Together, you and I
Yeah, why don't we lay here?
Not get up 'til Monday
We can be strong one day, but not tonight
