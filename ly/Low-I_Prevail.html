		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm so damn low
I'm so damn low
I'm so damn low

I can't lie, I'm fallin'
The floor gave out again
The walls are cavin' in
I've got these voices in my head
I don't know why, I'm broken
My world is sinkin' in

I've got these voices in my head
I've got these voices in my head
They tell me that I'm not enough
Is it my time? Is it my time?

Even when I'm high I still feel low
Voices in my head won't leave me alone
I keep fallin', fallin'
Over the edge
In over my head again
I'm so damn low

I'm on my own, I know it
The lights all start to fade
The colors turn to grey
I think I'm too far gone to save
I can't let go, I'm holdin'
I feel it slip away
I think I'm too far gone to save
I think I'm too far gone to save

They tell me that I'm not enough
The more they say the more they cut
Is it my time? I've gotta let it go
Is it my time? Is it my time?

Even when I'm high I still feel low
Voices in my head won't leave me alone
I keep fallin', fallin'
Over the edge
In over my head again
Even when I'm high I still feel low
I'm hangin' by a thread, don't know if I'll let go
'Cause I keep fallin', fallin'
Over the edge
In over my head again
I'm so damn low

I'm doing everything I can to try and fix the problem
This is how it feels when you hit rock bottom
Yeah, when you hit rock bottom

Even when I'm high I still feel low
Voices in my head won't leave me alone
I keep fallin', fallin'
I keep fallin'

Even when I'm high I still feel low
I'm hangin' by a thread, don't know if I let go
'Cause I keep fallin', fallin'
Over the edge
In over my head
I'm so damn low (I'm so damn low)
I'm so damn low (So damn low)
(I'm so damn low)
