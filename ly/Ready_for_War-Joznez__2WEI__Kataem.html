		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t ask why they call on me
Can’t do no wrong when it’s all on me
Armour over my heart full of scars on me
Globe in my palm as it falls on me

Peace, my brother
I need more than a piece my brother
If you rolling with me my brother
Just know we going pass the peak my brother
And I keep my eyes on the prize so I could never see defeat my brother
Walking the finest line between a shining knight and royalty my brother
I ain’t playing but they see 
I levelled up
They fed up, I don’t act like I’m fed enough
Hate the game but I’m sure you can bet it’s us
Can’t complain but I’m sure you attempted brother ‘fess it up
Everything that you estimate’s and underate
You could say this the latest of the greats
I always kept the statement up to date
By the way that I elevate above the ranks

On the way with the fleet
Take a seat or stay out the reach
World is mine I ain’t claiming a piece
Throne is mine but I stay on my feet

Locked and loaded I pray that you get low
If you rolling I pray you don’t get cold

Is you ready for war my brother
Is you ready for war my brother

(Ey, yeah)
Don’t ask if you thinking we differ 
You trash and I’m pick of the litter
Imma spend the whole bag I’m still getting richer
Really it figures, life’s a bitch but I’m intimate with her
Got hunger but I’m skipping a dinner
To give ‘em the picture
Give the mic gold, then give ’em the silver
They ain’t really the winners
Long as we still in the mixture
That’s a real bad look...
... Brother
Now I got ’em all shook, brother
I ain’t playing by the book, brother
They’ll be reading it took brother
Soon enough we’ll be understood brother
Started doing everything I could
Now I’m doing what you can’t, in case you mistook
I’m placed with grace but I can’t stay put
I’m made to be self made 

And make way with the fleet
Take a seat or stay out the reach
World is mine I ain’t claiming a piece
Throne is mine but I stay on my feet

Locked and loaded I pray that you get low
If you rolling I pray you don’t get cold

Is you ready for war my brother
Is you ready for war my brother

Is you ready for war my brother
Is you ready for war my brother
Is you ready for war my brother
Is you ready for war
