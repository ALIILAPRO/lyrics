		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't want to be lonely
And I'm missing you badly, my baby
Tell me are you happy?
Cause I can't be without you, no more
Let me tell you before you
Try to get me out of your life
I don't want it to be over
And I wanna be together forever, ever

Let me love you
Let me love you one more time
Come baby, come baby, come come
Cause I need you by my side let me love you
Let me love you right this time
Come baby, come baby, come come
Cause I need you by my side
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time

Can't believe that it's over
Can't believe you're no longer my baby
My world's going under
And nothing gon' matter no more
It's like you killing me when
You try to get me out of your life
I don't want it to be over
And I wanna be together forever, ever

Let me love you
Let me love you one more time
Come baby, come baby, come come
Cause I need you by my side let me love you
Let me love you right this time
Come baby, come baby, come come
Cause I need you by my side
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time

Come, come baby, I got the love for ya
All that you need and more
Come, come baby, I got the love for ya
Anything that you want is yours
Come, come baby, I got the love for ya
All that you need and more
Come, come baby, I got the love for ya
Anything that you want is yours
When you give it to me, don't hold back
Bring your body, come girl, let me hold that
Tick tock, wind up like an old clock
When your back arches
I let her roll to her ass
Mohombi saying one more time
Telling you your body colder, summer shine
Here's a tip, hit me on the line
I'm like an AKA to a crime

Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
Let me love you one more time
