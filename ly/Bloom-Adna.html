		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  you put hearts ahead of yours 
ending up with breaking your own 
painting shadows realizing 
what is hurting goes beyond you

when you see the light 
believe that it can shine 
dance among its roots 
let it see you bloom

light will find you just like sadness did
light will find you just like sadness did

release the last breath
of what it is that’s holding you 
there is more to this
there is more to this for you to see

don’t put hearts ahead of yours 
don’t end up with breaking your own

when you see the light 
believe that it can shine 
dance among its roots 
let it see you bloom

when you see the light 
believe that it can shine 
dance among its roots 
let it see you bloom

light will find you just like sadness did
light will find you just like sadness did

light will find you just like sadness did
light will find you just like sadness did
