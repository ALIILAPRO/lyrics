		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brr (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Ayo 
Brr (boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Ayo (brr, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)

Ayo, on the cover of Vogue, just me and my stove (just me and my stove, ah)
Same nigga in the pic, on rest in the hole (on rest in the hole)
We never spoke on that, we was talkin' Os (we was talkin' Os, ah)
Starin' at a George Condo, I can get 'em whole (I can get 'em whole)
Get out of line, I'ma up this pole 
(I'ma up this pole, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom)
Cop the 2020 Rolls, I ain't even drove (skrt, I ain't even drove)
Them shits was cheaper in the A, we had to hit the road (we had to hit the road, ah)
The way my fuckin' neck look, they think I sold my soul (they think I sold my soul)
Front row, Virgil Abloh show, this nigga G.O.A.T (this nigga G.O.A.T)
Had a nigga tap dancin' on the blow (tap dancin' on the blow, ah)

(Griselda, Griselda, by Fashion Rebels)
