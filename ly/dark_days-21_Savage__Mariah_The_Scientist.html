		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I finally got the fame and fortune that I prayed for
Who would have thought I would emerge from all that gun smoke?
This for all the teenagers that wanna gun tote
'Cause they cheaper in the hood than in the gun store (on God)
You gon' lose a lot of your friends and that's what hurt the most
You can't do nothin' but reminisce about y'all crackin' jokes
You feelin' like nobody love you, I know how that go
You gotta love yourself, lil' nigga, that's gon' help you glow (on God)
I know it might sound lame, but just stay in school (21)
They got a place that they put people who don't follow rules (yeah)
You probably got your mama scared, don't wanna watch the news
Ready to risk your life and freedom for a pair of shoes
Yeah, you say you love your switch, but they don't love you back
You can hug that block all night, it ain't gon' hug you back (facts)
Some of your friends gon' reincarnate and come back as rats (pussy)
And after your candlelight, they ain't gon' give your mama jack
Now your brother kids askin' where they daddy at
So you gotta lie and tell 'em he just took a nap (damn)
You done failed in the streets, so now you tryna rap
But that ain't really workin' for you, so it's back to trap, damn

When it's all said and done
There's some things you can't run from
It's hard to decide
Either live or you die
I, I ask myself was it all worth the risk
'Cause I can't pretend (yeah)
I can't stand the thought of losing you

I know how it feel to see your dawgs stretched out (on God)
And watch him struggle tryna let his last breath out (damn)
You don't wanna do it, but you lost some real niggas that you gotta step out
One more seat left in the car, you gotta help out (yeah)
Niggas stressed out (yeah, yeah)
Probably why I tell the kids to put the guns down (oh, facts)
Gangsta but I still cry when nobody around
Tryna numb the pain, drinkin' bottles 'til I drown ('til I drown, 21)
Never do no suicide
But I'd be lyin' if I said it hadn't crossed my mind
I hurt on the inside and I still act like I'm fine
Why the judge give my nigga Paul all that time? (Free Paul, hey)
Heard they lockin' niggas up for what they put in rhymes
Standin' on this shit (oh), fuck it, I'm still writin' mine (fuck 'em, oh)
This what growth look like, no more committin' crimes (21)
I stayed out the way and made a way for us to grind (21, 21)

When it's all said and done (all said and done)
There's some things you can't run from
It's hard to decide
Either live or you die (live)
I, I ask myself (ask myself) was it all worth the risk (was it all?)
'Cause I can't pretend (yeah)
I can't stand the thought of losing you
All my dawgs too

Forever-ever Eastside (Eastside)
This shit 'posed to be for life (supposed to be for life, 4L)
Jumpin' shit since we was five (21, five)
We got that fire, we was nine, nine
Even though I'm up, up
You can see the pain in my eyes
I mean like fuck love (on God)
But either way, I'm still gon' try
Got me fucked up (21)
Seein' my twin on Channel 5
I, 'cause even gangsters cry
I, I, I
Gangsters cry
Even gangsters cry
I, I, I
Even gangsters cry
(I, I, I)
21, 21

My son, this is your time
I know your heart
And I've watched you rise above many challenges
And you have made me so proud
I pray for many more fulfilling experiences 
As you elevate to new levels of growth, purpose, and success
Dreams really do come true
By the grace of the source of life, so be it
