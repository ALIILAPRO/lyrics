		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say the words and I try to comprehend 
Is it true was that really what you meant
I love you I love you I love you I love you I do 
I want you I want you I want you I want only you 
I'm not used to those words without pretend

When did you go from 
Anyone into someone 
Someone I have to lean on 
So good it breaks my heart 

You fall in love and I fall apart
You fall in love and I fall apart

Don't recognize myself, what have I become 
Lose it in your eyes and now I can't come down 
I love you I love you I love you I love you I do 
I want you I want you I want you I want only you 
On a high so why do I feel like drowning 

When did you go from 
Anyone into someone 
Someone I have to lean on 
So good it breaks my heart 

You fall in love and I fall apart
You fall in love and I fall apart

The fall in love is far to deep
I never seem to land on my feet
And if I do it's killing me 
The fall in love is far to deep

You fall in love and I fall apart
You fall in love
And I fall apart
