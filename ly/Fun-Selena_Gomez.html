		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is just what the doctor ordered (yeah)
Put a gold star on my disorder
Yeah, we've talked around every corner
If I'm looking at you and me, we're on kind of symmetry

I'm a sensitive situation (mm)
You're a hot and cold combination
Oh, we both know we got complications (mm)
If I'm looking at you and me, we're on kind of symmetry, oh

I try not to bother, not to bother you (ah-ah-ah)
But my kind of trouble, likes your trouble too (ah)

Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got something in this room, can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh

But you look like fun (uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun (ooh fun, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)

Can we keep it on a first name basis? (Ah)
We could overcrowd each others spaces
You get me higher than the medication
Take me to different places, let's face it, I'm getting impatient (ah)

I try not to bother, not to bother you (ah-ah-ah)
But my kind of trouble, likes your trouble too (ah)

Can't stop myself, it's true
I like the way you move, uh-huh
Oh, we got something in this room, can't make that up
You may not be the one, uh-huh

But you look like fun (mmm, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun (ooh, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)

You look like you don't, but you know how
Like a beautiful breakdown, and it's just not right
But you like you don't, but you know how
Make me wanna slow down, and it's just not right

That you like fun (yeah, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun (ooh fun, uh-uh-oh, ah, uh-uh-oh)
You look like fun
