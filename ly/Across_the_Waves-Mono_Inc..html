		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We came across the waves
To land on safer land
We came across the waves
To stand on sacred sand

Hello, hello, is there
Someone there who cares
For godforsaken souls and godforsaken men?
Is there someone there who cares?

We came across the waves
And kissed the soil of the shore
We came across the waves
Fled from a land at war

Oh, hello, hello, is there
Someone there who cares
For godforsaken souls and godforsaken men?
Is there someone there who cares?

We came across the waves
Driven by fright and hope
We came across the waves
To find a place to call home

Hello, hello, is there
Someone there who cares
For godforsaken souls and godforsaken men?

Oh, hello, hello, is there
Someone there who cares
For godforsaken souls and godforsaken men?
Is there someone there who cares?
