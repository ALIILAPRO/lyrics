		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart, my heart's an empty canvas
I never could've planned this
The way you look tonight
When the moonlight hits your eyes
And the moment they meet mine

It's photographic
And your smile, your smile is like the stars
Illuminates the dark, and when I need you most
Right here is where you are
Even if we're worlds apart
It's cinematic

I sit here painting perfect pictures
Of every moment with you
I've known it from the start
Darling, you're my work of art

Our bodies, our bodies interlaced
So delicately placed and your angelic face
Heaven never makes mistakes
And the beauty it creates is overwhelming
'Cause you're everything to me (me, me, me, me)

I sit here, painting perfect pictures
Of every moment with you
I've known it from the start
Darling, you're my work of art

My work of art 
My work of art 
I knew it from the start 
Darling, you're my work of art 

I sit here, painting perfect pictures
Of every moment with you
I've known it from the start
Darling, you're my work of art
