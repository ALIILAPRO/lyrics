		  Okay
Mm-mm, I

I didn't change my number
I only changed who I reply to
Laura said I should be nicer
But not to you
I love a, "You mad at me?" text
Should've guessed
That you would think I was upset
You're obsessed

Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean

I didn't change my number
I only changed who I believe in
You were easy on the eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
But looks can be deceivin'
I gotta work, I go to work
You don't deserve to feel so hurt
You got a lot of fuckin' nerve
I don't deserve, so

Don't take it out on me
I'm out of sympathy for you
Maybe you should leave
Before I get too mean
And take it out on you
And your best friend too
I should've left when Drew
Said you were bad news

Mm, mm
Mm
(Mm, mm)
(Mm)
