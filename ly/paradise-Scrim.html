		  (You did good, $lick)
Everything that happens
This is paradise

I been up grinding for years doin' whatever it take (whatever it take)
I got bags under my eyes, they say I need me a break (this is paradise, need me a break)
Woke up to bags up in the bank, woke up to being alone (being alone)
Couldn't tell you where I'm at, just know that I wanna be home (this is paradise, wanna be home)
It's late and I'm callin' my girl, hopin' she pick up the phone (hopin' she pick up the phone)
Another night under the lights, yeah
It's just me and the foam (this is paradise, just me and the foam)
Another day up on the earth, somewhere that I don't belong (that I don't belong)
Just me and my own
Just me and my own (this is paradise)

Lookin' for my getaway, tryin' a drug everyday (drug everyday)
Told her, "I cannot stay", cry to myself as I walk away (this is paradise)
Put my love on a shelf incase I come back from walking through hell (from walking through hell)
I say that I'm fine, they look in my eyes, say, "I cannot tell" (yeah, I cannot tell)
Can't help but look back and realize that it won't be long (be long)
Making peace with the fact that one day I'ma be gone (be gone)
Stuck somewhere beyond some help on the right side of wrong (right side of wrong)
I keep overtaking my meds hopin' it help, but it don't (it don't)
Excuse me for sippin' too much, I'm just tryna feel the same (everything that happens)
Forgive me for swerving too much, I'm just tryna find my lane
I'm duckin' these hoes and lames tryna come up off my name (my name)
I'm poppin' on perc after perc, tryna overcome my pain (this is paradise, my pain)
Yeah, fucking bitches, gettin' money, yeah, I been goin' insane (goin' insane)
No, your prayers cannot save me, sorry, but it's too late (this is, too late)
Smokin' out in a Cullinan, outta body separate
Deep breath, meditate
Chrome pressed to the brain (this is paradise)
I got motherfuckers with their hands out actin' like a fuckin' owe 'em (actin' like I fuckin' owe 'em)
Bitches talking like I'm they man, I don't even fuckin' know 'em (the fuck?)
Weight of the world on my shoulder, neck and my heart gettin' colder
Mom and pops gettin' older, and I just wanna take it slow (this is paradise)

I just want this shit to be over
I just want my dad to be closer
I just want my bro to be sober
I just want my mom to-
I just want my mom to be fine
I just want my girl to be mine
Want my tolerance to decline
All these dollars make 'em see signs

I been up grinding for years doin' whatever it takes (whatever it take)
I got bags under my eyes, they say I need me a break (this is paradise, need me a break)
Woke up to bags up in the bank, woke up to being alone (being alone)
Couldn't tell you where I'm at, just know that I wanna be home (this is paradise, wanna be home)
It's late, I'm callin' my girl, hopin' she pick up the phone (hopin' she pick up the phone)
Another night under the lights, yeah, it's just me and the foam (this is paradise, just me and the foam)
Another day up on the earth, somewhere that I don't belong (that I don't belong)
Just me and my own
Just me and my own (this is paradise)

(It's a smash)
This is paradise
