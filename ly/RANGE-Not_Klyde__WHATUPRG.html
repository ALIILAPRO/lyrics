		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They said "How you do that?" Baby
I got range
Step back, flick the wrist and let it hang
How'd I do this? Baby, I got range
Load the clip, let it pop-pop 'til it bang

Pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop

Yee, yee, baby, I'm on the wave (Yeah)
Tryna show all the receipts
I'm tryna take my place (Whew)
Tryna pop out like I'm
Planted in the industry (Pop, pop, pop)
I'm tryna lead the souls
Tryna get my brothers saved
Swear we tell 'em slow 'em
(Slow 'em, slow 'em, slow 'em)
Every time I'm in the rut (Rut, rut)
Grab me by the collar, wake me up (Up, up)
Filled up with the Spirit, pull thе cup
Watch it drip, yeah, watch Him take control
Uh oh (Yee, yee)
Baby, I'm NK the baе, you know me (Huh?)
If you ain't know me yet, that's lowly
(Yee, yee)
I'm through the scope right to the dome
It's holy (Phew)
And that's the homie

They said "How you do that?" Baby
I got range (Whew, whew)
Step back, flick the wrist and let it hang
(Swish)
How'd I do this? Baby, I got range (Huh)
Load the clip, let it pop-pop 'til it bang

Pop, pop, pop, pop

Cut the talkin', I need action
You was next up
Now they mention you in past tense
Only way they box me in is
When I'm in my casket
Now they wanna know how I go ghost
And then come back wit' it
Okay, yeah, we back wit' it
Gotta get it, go, Uh
International, we took the tour de México, uh
(Woah) yo soy mi, yo soy, uh (Woah)
Shawty want a one, I cut
The ring and then elope, Yeah
(Woah) took her to the coast

They said "How you do that?" Baby
I got range (Whew, whew)
Step back, flick the wrist and let it hang
(Swish)
How'd I do this? Baby, I got range (Huh)
Load the clip, let it pop-pop 'til it bang

Pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop
