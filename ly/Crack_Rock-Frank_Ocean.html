		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
'Cause she was, and you are madly involved, madly involved

Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You're hittin' stones and broke your home
Ooh-ah, ooh-ooh
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixin' that you're itchin' for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't tryin' to sleep with cracky

(Hittin' stones)
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot
Three-hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds, ooh, sound
Don't no one hear the shells, ooh, shells
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high

Crack rock, ooh
Crack rock, ooh
Crack rock
How you feeling, girl? Ooh
How's the gutter doin'?
Crack rock
