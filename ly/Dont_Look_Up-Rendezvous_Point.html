		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a time 
Time to self-evaluate the things we've done We have time 
Time to make things right and to get up again 

Warning signs 
Screaming out the fact that we're the ones to blame Draw the line 
Listen to the voices deep inside your brain 

When the trees fall  
Will you come for me 
I suggest you look out for yourself 

You can scream all you want but  
No one's listening anyway 
There's no facts  
Everyone's entitled to a breakaway 

When the trees fall  
Will you call  
For someone to come 
I suggest you look out for yourself 
There's a fire raging storm  
Building larger than life 
Don't look up you might understand why 

When the trees fall  
Will you call  
For someone to come 
I suggest you look out for yourself 
There's a fire raging storm 
Building larger than life 
Don't look up then you might understand Why the trees fall 

Why we call for someone to come 
Will you come
