		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh

Fuck the frail shit, uh, 'cause when my coke come in 
They gotta use the scale that they weigh the whales with
Carlssons on the jeep (c'mon), Bugatti made the prototype (uh-huh)
Hoped you'd get the picture but you just can't photo life (uh-huh)
Determined niggas make it (yeah)
Kickin' down the door and we burnin' niggas naked
The house costs a million (uh), sittin' on the beach
And the only thing I know (uh-huh), if it's furnished I'ma take it 
My bathtub lift up (woo), my walls do a three-sixty
We got the shit that the government got
Talkin' money then you rubbin' the spot
Real niggas say that they be wildin' (yeah)
We on the Cayman Islands (uh-huh)
On a yacht with our favorite albums
A bad ho and a plate of salmon, smokin' and drinkin'
Nigga is you thinkin' that our fate is violent? 
I love my nigga for the fact that he real
And nobody on the faculty squeal (what?)
And if you facin' capital pun', pass me a gun
And I'ma give you time to run while I rapidly peel, uh

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it

I learned the game quickly, and I don't like to rent
So when I fly now, I bring my cars on the plane with me
In this case who's the loser?
Ran through enough coke for Castro to build schools in Cuba
Teach your kids how to read and write and use the Ruger
Motherfuckin' niggas is back, Jada and P
We got water, X, haze, plus weight of the D
And I'm tired of hearin' about old niggas that had it (word)
And be the same old niggas that ratted (who cares?)
Let's talk about how we hawk niggas in they fuckin' back
Gun work's official but niggas don't be wantin' that (why?)
'Cause they puss' and they mans is lame
We soul for real in the hood, we make candy rain
I could easily send you to God
But come and see me at the Plaza Hotel I might give you a job
If you can't remember the name
All you gotta do is ask the dame for the niggas that deliver it hard

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it

Jada-mwah, I'll kiss you, you bitch-ass nigga
Bet the hood won't miss you, you bitch-ass nigga
Might find your man dead in the ocean (he be aight though)
You know dead rappers get better promotion
Why we don't laugh at death and cry at birth?
Never say you can't do it 'til you try it first
Be the young niggas eager to pull it
But it's a message in everything, trust me, even a bullet
Go to war with the Eight and the Pound
Think you got your ear to the street now
Put your face in the ground 'cause my shells is expensive
You'll know exactly why when you yellin' in intensive
My fellas is offensive
Lucky 'cause I got guns that crack your back
But that's not what I prefer, I manufacture crack
And niggas turn bitch when you show 'em the steel
But we know how to bid so y'all go 'head and squeal
I'm comfortable far from home
Eatin' right, gettin' good rest either on the bar or the phone
I'm the reason niggas got deals the past few years
"Sound anything like Kiss? Then sign right here"
And, y'all just talkin', I'm doin' it well
Jadakiss, motherfucker, I'ma see you in hell

We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
We gon' make it, we gon' make it
We gon' make it
