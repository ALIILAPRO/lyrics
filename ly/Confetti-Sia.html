		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We had love so strong my heart couldn't take it
You took it in your hands and resuscitate it
You said "Me and you against the world"
You said "You and me forever girl"
I felt every cell fall in love with you but

I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, you're locked up in your Playstation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later

No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

You don't wanna hurt my pride but I'm here dyin', but all of that's ego
And the house we lived in had no doors, and you had no windows
You said, "I'm hangin' with the boys", you said "Workin' late to pay our bills"
But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color

I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, you're locked up in your Playstation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later

No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti

I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
