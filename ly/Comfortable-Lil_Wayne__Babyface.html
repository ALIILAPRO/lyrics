		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I'm not sayin' this to shake you up (sayin') 
I'm just sayin' this to wake you up (sayin') (woo)
It's all good when we makin' love
All I ask is don't take our love 
For granted, 'cause, granted (that's all I ask, baby)
My love for you is real (oh) (yeah)
If you don't love me
Somebody else will (somebody else)
Baby girl don't you, ever, get too, comfortable 
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable) yeah

Yeah, to the left, to the left
If you wanna leave, be my guest, you can step
Feelin' irreplaceable, listenin' to Beyoncé 
Well, okay, I'll put you out on your b-day
Hey, now if you rockin' with Weezy
Bedroom in the bank, baby, we safe
I got game like EA
But I wanna let you play
And don't I treat you like soufflé? 
Don't I look at you like I see a new day?
And don't I do what I do say?
I'm through talkin' so I'ma let you, 'Face

I'm not sayin' this to shake you up (and let 'Ye do 'Ye) (sayin')
I'm just sayin' this to wake you up (yeah) (sayin') 
It's all good when we makin' love
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, 'cause, granted (yeah)
My love for you is real (ooh)
If you don't love me
Somebody else will (tried to tell her)
Baby girl, don't you ever get too comfortable
Yeah (comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

Yeah, let me catch my breath
Talkin' 'bout leavin' and you ain't gone yet
And if you leave, leave correct
And I'ma send a jet to pick up the next
And if you leave, you leavin' the best
So you will have to settle for less
And I am no Elliott Ness
I don't handcuff, I don't arrest
I do confess to the murder scene
'Cause under them sheets, I am a mess
Yes, baby, you're blessed
Now just don't jump your nest, come on, yeah

I'm not sayin' this to shake you up (sayin') (haha)
I'm just sayin' this to wake you up (sayin') (wake up)
It's all good when we makin' love 
All I ask is don't take our love
For granted, 'cause, granted
My love for you is real (oh)
If you don't love me
Somebody else will
Baby girl, don't you, ever get too comfortable (yeah)
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable)

Yeah, it's no sweat, no sweat
I would never one-two-three-forget about you
Your love, your sex
You know I work you out like bowflex
Haha, all jokes, no stress
Love, live life, proceed, progress
Make sure the neighbors get no rest
We can get together, never disconnect
Yeah, your back, your neck
Funny how that song haven't got old yet
To us, so let's project
You stay in, never incorrect, 'Face

I'm not sayin' this to shake you up (sayin') (yeah)
I'm just sayin' this to wake you up (sayin') (I got one) 
It's all good when we makin' love
All I ask is don't take our love (yeah)
For granted, 'cause, granted (hahaha)
My love for you is real (oh)
If you don't love me
Somebody else will (irreplaceable, huh?)
Baby girl, don't you (yeah)
Ever (ha) get too comfortable
Don't get too comfortable
(Comfortable, comfortable, comfortable) ayy

Yeah
Word to God, my mama gon' like this one
Yeah
Yo, I think everybody gonna like this one
Yeah, I got one
Thank you, Mr. West
