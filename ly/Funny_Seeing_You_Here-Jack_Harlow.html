		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you hate the way we drifted
But we both decide this party and we lived it
So what's up?

I'ma sip my drink and crack a big smile
Just to see if I can still get you 'cause it's been a while, yeah
It's been a minute now
Your friend just started listening to my music but I been in style
You say that I play too much but we both know I been a child
Asked you when you got to town
You say that you been in town, it's fucked up
So you just wasn't gon' hit me?
Lookin' like this, she thought it wasn't gon' tempt me
I'm sorry but you ain't gotta Barbie up
You should come and step into my world just like Narnia
I wouldn't do no harm to you
Come on, let's find a quiet spot
How's your sister and your niece? Does she still cry a lot?
Who you talkin' to now? Are y'all 'bout to tie a knot?
Hope not, speak now, hold yo' peace, I will make that show stop
Remember back when I would come and spend the night at yo' house
Wake up by myself in bed 'cause you be at the stove top
Walk inside the kitchen put my hands up, let me stop
Please excuse me, I know these are heavy thoughts
A man's greed can't see the things that he's already got
Fucked it up between us 'cause I wanted you and every thot
Things would only worsen when you left me rock
Your bestie tried to warn you but you told her that, "He said he stopped"
He used to say her man was trash and tell me 'bout the way he'd act
I would shake my head until I realized I'm the same as that
Now I wonder, did she tell her man that I'm a trash dude?
And would he shake his head until he realized he was trash too?
I know this reunion's unexpected, but it's past due
At least if you ask me, I won't ask you
So what you 'bout to do?

I know you hate the way we drifted
But we both decide this party and we lived it
So what's up?
