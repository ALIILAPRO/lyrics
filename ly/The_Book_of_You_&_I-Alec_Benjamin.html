		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, it all began in the back of her car
I was just sixteen, but I fell so hard
Well, the years went by and she held my heart
But her love ran dry and we fell apart

I felt her growing distant
I knew her love was shifting
And all that I could say was

Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night

I remember where we started
I remember how you looked 
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You didn't give a reason, I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I

Well, I bought a pen and I turned the page
Then I wrote about how I wish you'd stayed
I said all the things that I never got to say
Maybe when it's done, I will feel okay

That she had grown so distant
And that her love had shifted
I wish she felt the same

Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night

I remember where we started
I remember how you looked
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You never gave a reason, I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I

Don't tell me
Tell me that you're leaving me
My belly hurts and my heart is hardly beating right
I hate to beg, but I'll try one last time

Don't tell me that it's over, the book of you and I
Now you've scribbled out my name
And you've erased my favorite lines
There were so many chapters that we never got to write
Like cereal for dinner and staying up all night

I remember where we started
I remember how you looked
But now I'm missing bits and pieces from the pages that you took
You never gave a reason, I'll forever wonder why
We never got to finish the book of you and I
