		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh shit, caught that nigga alone
Ain't that a bitch
Hey, uh, this one here is, uh
For them niggas that be Johnny Dangerous

When they be fuckin' fifty deep
But they be fuckin' cowards when they by they selves
You know who I'm talkin' about
(You know who I'm talkin' about)

That's right, you ain't shit without your homeboyz
You ain't shit without your homeboyz
You ain't shit without your homeboyz

Now, now every time I see you cats is rollin' in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
Out on the streets you don't hear a peep

Nigga it's a goddamn shame, somebody explain
Why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that ass out the frame, completely get that ass kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin' in the casket

How long will it last, nigga don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin' to be the first to see some cash
My shit's classic, like my nigga Nate, go get the tape
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break

Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
Niggas aimin' at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a fuck motherfuckers I'm LOC
They all duckin' when my gun smoke
'Cause you ain't shit without your homeboyz

You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a fuck, you niggas is punks
Without your homeboyz
You be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary niggas is punks

You ain't shit without your homeboyz
Nigga, punk ass motherfucker
You ain't shit without your homeboyz
Throw your hands up
You little trick, coward motherfucker

Like Yak said, ?How the fuck you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac shittin' ya box?
You was lookin' real weak walkin' down the street
Now a nigga thirty deep, oh you wanna beef

Talk cheap, shoot a nigga the fair one
Your homies like fuck it
What's this you the only scared one
(Fagot ass)

Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw nigga played you out
We could have took it to the fifth

I would I have laid you out
Niggas be actin' all different
When they dogs come around
Watch 'em act like bitches
When Outlawz draw down

They all clown, better yet they all stunned
You the type to have a gun
And never blased it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel

Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin' these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboyz, homeboy?

You ain't shit without your homeboyz
My thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboyz, the only thing a nigga got left

I love my niggas to death, we ain't shit without our homeboyz
You know what time it is
I ain't shit without my homeboyz
Hey, tell 'em the story how you came up, nigga

Now I was born alone
Took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw nigga, I never die alone
Me and my niggas is so close, it's complicated

One nigga smokin' and drinkin' and yet we all faded
My nigga Edi had a son we all happy
'Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride

To rectify the problem, motherfuckers they all die
Been tryin' to make a million, by hustlin' since my adolescence
From crack dealin' to rap villain, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, fuck 3D
You coward ass motherfuckers'll never see me

Bustin' with automatic straps
My raw raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin', I got 'em comin' back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together

Ain't shit without your homeboyz
Thug niggas, I love niggas
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboyz

The only thing a nigga got left
I love my niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboyz
(Without our homeboyz)

Love my niggas to death
We ain't shit without our homeboyz
Love you niggas to death
