		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She want to move to California
She must've fucking lost her mind
She want to move to California
That's how they get you every time

She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying, "How, how you do it, you did it?"
I'ma show you what it done, but enough for a finish
Pay attention, you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit but looking like a Vine?

But they no pay for no privilege, now she broke in Korea Town
In the condo you rented, better get your percentage

In California, oh
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

All the people all around and the follower people
I go watching "ha ha" make girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official, make it Serena Vista
Supernova, new residual, making money a little
Make smoker illegal, make living illegal
Make laughing illegal, make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now, know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind 'fore me finish the sentence
So go pimp a like on Vine, but don't pay for the privilege

Now you broke in Korea Town, in the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh, you broke in Korea Town in that condo you rented
Better get your percentage

In California
She must've fucking lost her mind, yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly
