		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Comfort, pulls me back inside
Self worth, has a place to hide
Push us back in corners and, make us fight you for our lives
Turn us into martyrs and, sneak up from behind
Bid farewell, human kind, time will tell if we can make it right again
Bid farewell, I won't mind, time will tell us how to make it right again
Distance, seems to blur the lines
Penance, wipes their blood stained minds
Push us back in corners and, make us fight you for our lives
Turn us into martyrs and, sneak up from behind
Bid farewell, human kind, time will tell if we can make it right again
Bid farewell, I won't mind, time will tell us how to make it right again
Circle of life goes 'round again, leave me behind
Circle of life goes 'round again, leave me behind
Push us back in corners and, make us fight you for our lives
Turn us into martyrs and, sneak up from behind
Bid farewell, human kind, time will tell if we can make it right again
Bid farewell, I won't mind, time will tell us how to make it right again
