		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So there was this DJ who was like kicking off
I don't know what he was doing but it was sick man
Like he was like "Hands in the air"

And then this cat walked in you know
Not like a cat like a feline cat
Like a real like you know like
You know what I'm saying dog
Like cats and dogs
It was raining it wasn't raining, we were raving
And I don't know whether he was really saying it
And all he kept saying was

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Are you ready

Are you ready

Are you ready
Repeat!

Suddenly I think I'm on the phone
Suddenly I think I'm telling a story
But I'm not
I'm just dancing
I'm just dancing
I'm just dancing
I'm just sleeping
I'm just raving
I'm just repeating

And on and on and on and on

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Raise your hands up in the air

Raise your hands up in the air

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat

Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat
