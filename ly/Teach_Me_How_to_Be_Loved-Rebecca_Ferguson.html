		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One foot onto the ice
I hold my breath
And try to believe
Can I look at you with different eyes?
Like the girl that I was, when I was 17

The fallen empires,
The shattered glass
The wicked echos of my past.
I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking.

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me,
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide.
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved
Teach me how to be loved

I got caught up in a daze
Of the wine and roses
Such a sweet escape
But I watched it all slip away
Like running water from my hands
Raining on this picture land

The fallen empires,
The shattered glass
The wicked echos of my past.
I've seen it all before, that's why I'm asking.

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me,
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide.
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved

Can I give myself just one more second chance?
And put my trust in love,
Please don't hurt me.
If I make myself like a feather in you hand
And put my trust in love,
Please don't hurt me.

Will you still be here tomorrow
Or will you leave in the dead of the night?
So your waves don't crash around me,
I'm staying one step ahead of the tide.
Will you leave me lost in my shadows
Or will you pull me into your light?
Teach me how to be loved
Teach me how to be loved
