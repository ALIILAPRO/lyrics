		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Raise your horns into the air
There is plenty ale to share
All are welcome, take a chair
And sing a song loud and strong

Men of war and men of care
Maidens fierce and maidens fair
Raise your horns into the air
And sing a song loud and proud and strong

SKAL!
SKAL!
Sing loud and strong
SKAL!
SKAL!
A toast and a thundering song

At the end of the eve
We'll be welcome and warm
By a great roaring fire
Our voices a storm

In the warm timber halls
We will keep out the cold
As we bellow and belt out
These tunes full of soul

Raise your horns into the air
There is plenty ale to share
All are welcome, take a chair
And sing a song loud and strong

Men of war and men of care
Maidens fierce and maidens fair
Raise your horns into the air
And sing a song loud and proud and strong

SKAL!
SKAL!
Sing loud and strong
SKAL!
SKAL!
A toast and a thundering song

We're welcome and warm
Our voices a storm
Our voices, our voices a storm

Raise your horns into the air
There is plenty ale to share
All are welcome, take a chair
And sing a song loud and strong

Men of war and men of care
Maidens fierce and maidens fair
Raise your horns into the air
And sing a song loud and proud and strong

SKAL!
SKAL!
Sing loud and strong
SKAL!
SKAL!
A toast and a thundering song
