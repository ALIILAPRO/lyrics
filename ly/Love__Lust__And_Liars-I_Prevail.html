		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now I'm gone

I've told you once, I've told you twice
Stab me in the back and you're gonna pay the price

You want me back now right? Well let's rewind to that night
That night where lust trumped love, and love got sacrificed
And now you beg for forgiveness, acting just like a witness
You expect me to lie down and act like it's not my business?

Now I realize, your fingerprints were at the crime

You think you know someone, and then it comes undone
They take the heart and run, funny how things end up now that you're gone
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh. Was your ten minutes of fun worth this song?
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh. Funny how things end up, now I'm gone

Alright get it through your head, I'm done with you so go ahead and get back in his bed
You whore
This time it's different it's time that I settle the score

Now I realize, your fingerprints were at the crime

You think you know someone, and then it comes undone
They take the heart and run, funny how things end up now that you're gone
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh. Was your ten minutes of fun worth this song?
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh. Funny how things end up, now I'm gone

I gave you my life, I gave you my word
I gave everything to get nothing in return
I told you once, I told you twice
Stab me in the back, now pay the fucking price Bitch
Stay the hell out of my life

Stay the hell out of, 
Stay the hell out of, 
Stay the hell out of my life
