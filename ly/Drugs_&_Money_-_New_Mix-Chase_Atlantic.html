		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm God and some other shit, yeah
You know how I get when I'm in my head, yeah
Pink shadows in the basement, whoa
What's that pink shadow in the base-

Mama, I'm sorry, reality's boring
I cut it up, wash it all down with a forty
I probably won't snort it
My head is discarded
I try to ignore it, I try to ignore it
I'm searching for a drag, girl, you know the story
Girl, you know the story

Drugs and fucking money
I can hear the birds sing
Drugs and fucking money
Fucking up this whole thing
Drugs and fucking money
Only thing that I need
Drugs and fucking money, yeah

Yeah, drugs and fucking money
I can hear the birds sing
Drugs and fucking money
Fucking up this whole thing
Drugs and fucking money
Only thing that I need
Drugs and fucking money, yeah
Drugs and fuck-

Gold plated chain in my pocket
I could make it rain if I wanted to
She said, "You got drugs 'cause I want 'em", hell no
I told you that I ain't, got to stop it

Mama, I'm sorry, reality's boring
I cut it up, wash it all down with a forty
I probably won't snort it
My head is discarded
I try to ignore it, I try to ignore it
I'm searching for a drag, girl, you know the story
Girl, you know the story

Drugs and fucking money
I can hear the birds sing
Drugs and fucking money
Fucking up this whole thing
Drugs and fucking money
Only thing that I need
Drugs and fucking money

Yeah, drugs and fucking money
I can hear the birds sing
Drugs and fucking money
Fucking up this whole thing
Drugs and fucking money
Only thing that I need
Drugs and fucking money, yeah

Drugs and fucking
Damn, I love it
Maybe I should drop it, pick a different subject
Maybe it's deliberate if it's lacking substance
Baby, you still listen so I know you love it
I know you love it

Oh, I guess I could say some nice things
Or write about how good my life's been
I'm sure your parents wouldn't like me
These circumstances can be frightening
Guess I managed all your time, please
Balance addiction on a tight string
Money and drugs are all I think about
So I'ma drop this song and let the birds sing

Damn, I love it
Maybe I should drop it, pick a different subject
Maybe it's deliberate if it's lacking substance
Baby, you still listen so I know you love it
I know you love it
