		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me and Mrs. Jones, we got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We meet every day at the same cafe
6:30 and no one knows she'll be there
Holding hands, making all kinds of plans
While the jukebox plays our favorite song

Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones
We got a thing going on
We both know that it's wrong
But it's much too strong to let it go now

We gotta be extra careful
That we don't build our hopes up too high
'Cause she's got her own obligations and so do I
Me and Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones

Well, it's time for us to be leaving
And it hurts so much, it hurts so much inside
And now she'll go her way and I'll go mine
But tomorrow we'll meet at the same place, the same time
Me and Mrs., Mrs., Mrs., Mrs. Jones
(Same place)
We both know that it's wrong
(Same time)
Everyday at the same cafe
(Same place)
We got a thing going on, you know it's wrong
(Same time)
But it's much too strong
(Same place)
Me and Mrs. Jones
