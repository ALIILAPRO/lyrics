		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry seems to be (yeah)
The hardest word

What I gotta do to make you love me?
What I gotta do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And awake to find that you're not there? (Yeah)

What I gotta do to make you want me?
What I gotta do to be heard? (Oh, oh-oh-oh)
What do I say when it's all over? (Babe)
Sorry seems to be the hardest word (that's right)

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's gettin' more and more absurd (uh, uh-uh, yeah)
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me
That sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you want me?
What I gotta do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad (so sad), so sad (it's so)
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's gettin' more and more absurd (ooh, ooh)
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh, it seems to me (yo, yo)
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

Yeah, yeah
(Oh yeah)
Ooh(ooh)
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Sorry

What do I do to make you love me? (Oh)
What I gotta do to be heard? (Hmm)
What do I do when lightning strikes me? (Yeah)
What've I gotta do?
What've I gotta do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word?
