		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been hard breakin up
Wakin up to the truth
I've been so blindcouldn't see for love, no
Tried my best to ignore it
Wish the pain away (away)
But just like tomorrow
It's coming round again

So darling please don't treat
Me like a fooool
Its been hard enough for meee
Getting over you
So darling please don't treat
Me like you doooo
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let ya
Damned if I don't forget ya
So please, don't treat me like a fool


Thought I gave you the best
But it wasn't enough you took advantage
Of my trusting heart
Tried my best to forgive
(ohh) you did my best to forget
I'm done with the tears
And there ain't no regrets

So darling please don't treat me like a fool
It's been hard enough for meee
Getting over you
So darling please don't treat me like you do
(listen to me baby)
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let ya
(ohh let ya)
Damned if I don't forget ya, (forget ya)

I know I'll be reaching out
To touch you in the night
Holding on to the memories
Coz you're not here to hold me tight
You lied when you told
Me it hurt to be apart
When all the lying you're doing
Is in someone else's

Please don't treat me like a fooool
(don't treat me like a fool)
(no no) it's been hard enough for
Meee (hard enough) getting over you
So darling please don't treat me like you do
(don't you treat me like a fool)
I'll be damned if I'm gonna let ya
(ohh let ya)
Damned if I don't forget ya (forget ya)
So please don't treat melike a fool
