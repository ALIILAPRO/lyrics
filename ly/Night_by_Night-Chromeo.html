		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know, inside of me
Sooner or later, we gon' be free
Come on girl, don't make a fuss
Let's have a conversation that's not just about us
When we don't know which way to go
And it doesn't really matter what we do
There's gotta be one good way to know
If all this is worth it we can work it night by night

She says I'm not romantic
I say she's too dramatic
I tell her while we're at it we can work it night by night
She says I'm not romantic
I say she's too dramatic
I tell her while we're at it we can work it night by night

Night by night
Night by night
Night by night

I know, inside of me
If we wait a bit longer, we'll see what's meant to be
Come on girl, we can't be apart
The special kind of lovin' reaches right to my heart

When you don't know which way to go
And it doesn't really matter what we do
There's gotta be one good way to know
If all this is worth it we can work it night by night

She says I'm not romantic
I say she's too dramatic
I tell her while we're at it we can work it night by night
She says I'm not romantic
I say she's too dramatic
I tell her while we're at it we can work it night by night

Night by night
Night by night
Night by night
Night by night

Not romantic, too dramatic
We can work it night by night
Not romantic, too dramatic
We can work it night by night
Not romantic, too dramatic
We can work it night by night
Not romantic, too dramatic
We can work it night by night

She says I'm not romantic
I say she's too dramatic
I tell her while we're at it we can work it night by night
She says I'm not romantic
I say she's too dramatic
I tell her while we're at it we can work it night by night
