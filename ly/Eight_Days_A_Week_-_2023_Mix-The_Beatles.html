		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week

Love you every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say, girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, girl
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Ooh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love, babe
Just like I need you, oh

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week

Eight days a week
I love you
Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care

Love you every day, girl
Always on my mind
One thing I can say, girl
Love you all the time

Hold me, love me
Hold me, love me
I ain't got nothin' but love, babe
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
Eight days a week
