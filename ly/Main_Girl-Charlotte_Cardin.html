		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm the call at one, that you just wanna visit
I'm a call for some kinda like an exit to your main girl
To your main girl, to your main girl
I'm the call at two, but I know, you never ask
'Cause I've been the one you assume will last past your main girl
Past your main girl, past your main girl

Now I'm just a pretty face, who can help you
Just a pretty face, who can help you
Get your shit together at your own pace

Don't leave me hangin' on, you misunderstood me all along
High risk and no gain, and I'm a fool to love the pain
Don't leave me hangin' on, you mis-, you misunderstood me all along
A fool to love ya, a fool to love ya
I'm a fool to love the pain

I'm the call at three, but I guess you thought I'd say
"Hey, there baby, come on walk my way"
Who's your main girl? Who's your main girl? Who's your main girl?
When it comes to four, I'm not there anymore
I'm in technicolor painting like before, your main girl
Your main girl, this insane world

So now I'm just a pretty face who can help you
Just a pretty face who can help you
Get your shit together at your own pace

Don't leave me hangin' on, you misunderstood me all along
High risk and no gain and I'm a fool to love the pain
Don't leave me hangin' on, you mis-, you misunderstood me all along
A fool to love ya, a fool to love ya
I'm a fool to love the pain

I, I, I, I, I
Don't leave me hangin' on, boy
You misunderstood me all along, boy
I was a fool to love you, a fool to love you
A fool to love the pain

Don't leave me hangin' on
You misunderstood me
You misunderstood me, yeah
Don't leave me hangin' on, you mis- you misunderstood me all along
And I'm a fool to love the pain

Now I'm just a pretty face, who can help you
Just a pretty face, who can help you
You misunderstood me, yeah
Now I'm just a pretty face, who can help you
Just a pretty face

(A fool to love ya, a fool to love ya, a fool to love the pain)
(Don't leave me hanging on boy, you misunderstood me all along, boy)
