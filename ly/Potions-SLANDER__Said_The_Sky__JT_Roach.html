		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember when I saw you at the end of that night
I was lookin' for some trouble, you were lookin' alright
Every time you said a word, I was starin' at your lips
I don't think I've ever been so close to a love like this

I never met someone, met someone like you
I never felt this way, felt this way, ooh

For ya love
I would take potions
For ya love
I would cross oceans
All the hurt
And the pain
You could take it all away
For ya love, ooh
I would take potions

I would take potions
I would take potions

Sippin' on a little somethin', I been sippin' too much
I just poured myself a double and I'm thinkin' 'bout us
Every time I see your face, I think of what I lost
How could all the little moments that we had be so far gone?

I never met someone, met someone like you
I never felt this way, felt this way, ooh

For ya love
I would take potions
For ya love
I would cross oceans
All the hurt
And the pain
You could take it all away
For ya love, ooh
I would take potions

I would take potions
All the hurt
And the pain
You could take it all away
For ya love, ooh
I would take potions
