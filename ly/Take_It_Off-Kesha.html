		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
When they

When the dark of the night comes around
That's the time, that the animal comes alive
Looking for something wild
And now we lookin' like pimps
In my gold Trans-Am
Got a water bottle full of whiskey in my handbag
Got my drunk text on
I'll regret it in the mornin'
But tonight, I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on 
When they take it off
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off

Lose your mind, lose it now
Lose your clothes, in the crowd
We're delirious, tear it down
'Til the sun comes back around
N-now we're getting so smashed
Knocking over trash cans
Everybody breakin' bottles
It's a filthy hot mess
And I'm down to get faded
I'm not the designated driver
So I don't give a, I don't give a, I don't give a

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on 
When they take it off
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
(Everybody take it off)
Right now (take if off)
Right now (take if off)
Right now (take if off), oh-oh
Right now (take if off)
Right now (take if off)
Right now (take if off, everybody take it off), oh-oh

There's a place downtown
Where the freaks all come around
It's a hole in the wall, it's a dirty free for all
And they turn me on
When they take it off
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off

There's a place I know if you're looking for a show
Where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor
And they turn me on 
When they take it off
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off
