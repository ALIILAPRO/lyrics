		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got back out back off the forefront
I never said or got to say bye to my boy
But it's often I try I think about how I'd be screaming
And the times would be bumping

All our minds would be flowing
Taking care of shit like hey 'holmes'
What you needing sometimes life will be coming off whack
And will open your eyes

This has begun
You seen to have some doubt 
I feel you next to me, feeling it
Getting spacey with the common love of music

Think of this as the sun and the mind as a tool 
But we could bounce back from this one
With attitude will and some spirit
With attitude will and your spirit
We'll shove it aside

Soulfly
Fly high
Soulfly
Fly free

Shut your shit please say what you will
I can't think side step around
I'm bound to the freestyle
Push it down to the ground with a nova dash but they watch you

Now climb up, super slide
The spirit's so low it's coming over you

Soulfly
Fly High
Soulfly
Fly free

You walk into this world

Walk into this world with your head up high
Walk into this world with your head up high
Walk into this world with your head up high
Walk into this world with your head up high
(Headup)
