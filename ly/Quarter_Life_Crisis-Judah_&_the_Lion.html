		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This whole record might be a quarter-life crisis
I need my family to come and help me fight this
Oh, I can't do this all alone
I used to feel so strong, now I feel like a loser
These voices in my head got me backed up into a corner
Oh, I can't do this all alone

So will you come, come, come, come help me through?
Will you come, come, come, come help me through this?

All these stories probably should be just for my therapist
I've been fightin', hidin', tryin' my best not to let you in
I can't do this all alone
I used to feel so strong, now I feel like a loser
This truth is hard to speak, but I could use the freedom
Oh, I can't do this all alone

So will you come, come, come, come help me through?
Would you come, come, come, come help me through this

Say yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
I need a pep talk
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
I need a pep talk
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
I need a pep talk
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, oh

So would you come, come, come, come help me through?
Would you come, come, come, come help me through?
'Cause I'm find-find-find-find-finding help
In you, in you
In you, in you (Woo)

Say yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
I need a pep talk
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah, oh
Yeah yeah yeah, oh
I need a pep talk now
