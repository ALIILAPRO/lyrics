		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got the swag, Prada them
Shawty havin' drip, proud of them (proud of them)
Boarded on the jet, out of here (out of here)
2024 our year (our year)
Call paramedics, I'm killin' 'em (killin' 'em)
Steppin' on they necks, I'm really him (I'm really him)
Louis leather vest, nigga trim (nigga trim)
Running up a check, stackin' M's (stackin' M's)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on

I crop the top, Balenciaga (Balenciaga)
Put it in they face, Benihana (Benihana)
Fly to Abu Dhabi, spend a hundred (spend a hundred)
Shittin' like a potty, I ain't goin' under (I ain't goin' under)
Protected by sticks, I feel better (feel better)
I see these boys got a vendetta (Vendetta)
Better cuff your bitch, I'm gettin' at her (uh)
You ain't seein' Wunna 'cause the pen better (nah)
I'm smokin' on the 'Scott, Coretta (Coretta)
Pop a Percocet, help you feel better (mmm)
I set the trend, I'm a trendsetter (yeah)
I'm not a rat, still gettin' cheddar (gettin' cheddar)
Audemars wrist, timeless (timeless)
Certified factory diamonds (factory diamonds)
I'm the young nigga goin' diamond (diamond)
Prince, they call me your highness (highness)
Flip a nigga bitch, she tag-team shit (hold on)
I'm passin' that ho, Matt Ryan (Matt Ryan)
Cook up a hit like I'm whippin' a brick (uh)
I'm whippin' that shit like a Cayenne (whip it up)

I got the swag, Prada them
Shawty havin' drip, proud of them (proud of them)
Boarded on the jet, out of here (out of here)
2024 our year (our year)
Call paramedics, I'm killin' 'em (killin' 'em)
Steppin' on they necks, I'm really him (I'm really him)
Louis leather vest, nigga trim (nigga trim)
Running up a check, stackin' M's (stackin' M's)
Yeah (hey, yeah), hold on

Turning up your bitch, Cinderella (Cinderella)
2024 Margiela (Kobe year)
Money in the wall, cartelin' (cartelin')
Mansion in the hills, mall in it (mall)
Cold in a Saint Laurent chinchilla (woo)
Million when I walk, I can spend bigger (spend bigger)
Lookin' in her eyes, see the sin in her (sinner)
Fuck it, baby, go on bring your friend with her (come on)
Young rich bastard, I got ten figures (ten figures)
Run a nigga pockets, I ain't friends with him (uh-uh)
Ten years in and I'm still winnin' (still winnin')
Pillow talk to bitches 'cause you been tender (been tender)
Boardin' the dock (yeah), we in Skyami ('Yami)
Look at the clock (yeah), gold like a Grammy (gold)
Whip out the lot (whip), know they can't stand me (yeah)
Kids at the house, hundred to a nanny (hundred)
Stood on my ten, ain't nobody behind (hey)
I don't see the cap, I go Ray Charles blind (Ray)
I went Ferrari and took out the spine (woo)
M on M, millions on mind (hey)

I got the swag, Prada them
Shawty havin' drip, proud of them (proud of them)
Boarded on the jet, out of here (out of here)
2024 our year (our year)
Call paramedics, I'm killin' 'em (killin' 'em)
Steppin' on they necks, I'm really him (I'm really him)
Louis leather vest, nigga trim (nigga trim)
Running up a check, stackin' M's (stackin' M's)
