		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could breathe, I'd be free
And I'd get high, I'd turn water to wine
If I could be, I'd breathe free at last
And I'd get high, I'd get so high
I'd get so high if I could breathe

Factors of nine, reduced over time
Chasing them primes, and counting rhymes
Facing the east, bread without yeast
Blind faith in the priests, and fear of some beast

Breaking of bread, eating the dead
Bowing my head, gold out of lead
Wearing the veil, seeking the grail
Wall where you wail, and musical scales

Candles are burned, incantations are learned
Ashes in urns, and prophets return
Adam and Eve, three days to grieve
Stoned if you don't believe, only fuck to conceive

But it’s so hard to sign my own surrender
So hard to do what I’ve intended
So hard to leave what I've defended
So hard to separate what's blended

So hard to sign my own surrender
So hard to do what I’ve intended
So hard to leave what I've defended
So hard to separate what's blended

If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I'd get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I'd get high, I’d get so high
I'd get so high
If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I'd get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I'd get high, I’d get so high
I'd get so high, if I could breathe

Five sided stars, buried or burnt to a char
Fashion is law, and nailing trinkets to doors
One hundred and eight, commanded to procreate
Fasting for forty days, and death if you desecrate

Two Thousand and Twelve, ringing bells
Nine circles of hell, division by three
And seven, you see
Repeat, repeat after me, repetition is key
Repeat after me, repetition is key
Repeat after me, repetition is key
Repeat after me, repetition is key
Repeat after me, repetition

It’s so hard to sign my own surrender
So hard to do what I’ve intended
So hard to leave what I've defended
So hard to separate what's blended

So hard to sign my own surrender
So hard to do what I’ve intended
So hard to leave what I've defended
So hard to separate what's blended

If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I'd get high, I’d get so high
I'd get so high
If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I'd get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I'd get high, I’d get so high
I'd get so high
If I could breathe, I’d be free
And I'd get high, I’d turn water to wine
If I could be, I’d breathe free at last
And I'd get high, I’d get so high
I'd get so high if I could breathe
