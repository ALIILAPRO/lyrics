		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything I do, I be ten steps ahead (ten)
My youngin' got them bodies, he still piss in the bed
Keep the code of silence, don't repeat what I said (21)
Keep all the baloney, I just came for the bread (on God)
My hood known for wildin' and I don't promote the violence
I done been through all the trials and tribulations, now I'm smilin' (21)
Say he wanted smoke, we at the table doin' the plottin'
We gon' slide, wet your shit up, make it home 'fore you hear a siren (big facts)

I'ma let 'em spin like a spiral (straight up)
I don't got no love for no rival (straight up)
Put him on the news, he went viral (pussy)
I took a number two with my rifle (pussy)
Every car I'm in, I got the title (on God)
Slaughter Gang, I turn a model to a hiker (big facts)
I know they want me dead, I got a Kel-Tec in this Viper (21)
I hit all the vibes on the low 'cause I'm a sniper (21)

He don't want no problems and it's obvious
Call me soft 'cause I laugh when I body shit (on God)
We play hot potato with the opps, we be droppin' shit (21)
Givin' out free smoke 'cause we got a lot of it (21)
Tryna feed the fam, I was trappin' in the cold (21)
Dropped a mixtape, turned around, I was on the road (on God)
You can't give me no amount of money for my soul (21)
He weren't really no robber, he got killed 'cause it wasn't his role (facts)
MAC .90 pokin' out my Goyard (Goyard)
Diamond bag pokin' out my Louie V (LV)
Nigga, fuck your Glock, we shoot big chops (big split)
Seven-six, .308 and .223 (21, 21)

I'ma let 'em spin like a spiral (21)
I don't got no love for no rival (pussy)
Put him on the news, he went viral (pussy)
I took a number two with my rifle (21, 21)
Every car I'm in, I got the title (straight up)
Slaughter Gang, I turn a model to a hiker (straight up)
I know they want me dead, I got a Kel-Tec in this Viper (straight up)
I hit all the vibes on the low 'cause I'm a sniper (straight up)

I make sure the beef get Swiss cheese (21)
I'm from 20-East where they killin' thieves (big facts)
Stones got my ears feelin' like Christmas Eve (big facts)
Before you bend over, baby, get on your knees (big facts)
Drive by, jump out then we tie-dye (21, 21)
Say a nigga' touch me, that's a lie, lie (big cap)
She fried, she fucked the gang, we call her five guys (five guys)
I'm so high, I almost thought I skydived (skydived)

I'ma let 'em spin like a spiral (straight up)
I don't got no love for no rival (straight up)
Put him on the news, he went viral (pussy)
I took a number two with my rifle (pussy)
Every car I'm in, I got the title (on God)
Slaughter Gang, I turn a model to a hiker (big facts)
I know they want me dead, I got a Kel-Tec in this Viper (21)
I hit all the vibes on the low 'cause I'm a sniper (21)
