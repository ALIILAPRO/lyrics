		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass-

When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasing and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play love by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad, and I could be her
All I can do is stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try to stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasin' my tail like a doggy
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdy's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn, and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I proved to be a better man

She keeps on passing me by (passing me by)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again) (passing me by)
She keeps on passing me

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion
Whenever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you very well
Now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you
When I try, or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so
And if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you
Then I signed sincerely the one who loves you dearly, PS love me tender
But the letter came back three days later, return to sender
Damn, damn, damn

She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
Passing me by (say it again)
(But nevertheless)
(But nevertheless)
(But nevertheless, I'll say it again)

She keeps passing me by
She keeps passing me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passing me by
She keeps passing me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passing me by
She keeps passing me by (I'll say it again)
She keeps passing me by
She keeps passing me by (I'll say it again)
