		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me say that since
Since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever
Is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue, oh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

I'm, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
You make me feel so brand new
I want to spend my whole life with you

Let me say that since, baby
Since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever
Is all I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue, oh baby

Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Good or bad, happy or sad

Why, oh tell me, why do people break up
Oh, then turn around and make up?
I just, can't you see
You'd never do that to me, would you, baby?
'Cause being around you is all I see

So baby let's, we oughta stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Let's, woo, (let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
Ever need to chase after me, oh baby
Let's (let's stay together) stay together
Loving you whether, whether
Good or bad, happy or sad (oh baby, let's)
Good or bad, happy or sad
Let's 
Try to stay together (let's stay together)
Loving you whether, whether, huh
Good or bad, happy or sad
