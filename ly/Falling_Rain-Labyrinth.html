		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in my heart I would like find
A place for love 
It's not so easy as I'd like 

And all this time, all this time we lost
Just to follow a dream 
Nothing will remain 

The rain is falling down onto me
Falling down as a silent cry

Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my heart
I can find my inner soul 
Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my eyes
Nothing but a little tear 

It's not our way and I think
You gotta find one
(A little angel starts to cry

This falling rain is telling now
A love is dying
But it will live into your heart

The rain is falling down to me
Falling down as a silent cry
Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my heart
I can find my inner soul 
Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my eyes
Nothing but a little tear 

Deep in my heart I would like find
A place for love 
And all this time
All the time we lost
Just to follow a dream 

Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my heart
I can find my inner soul 
Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my eyes
Nothing but a little tear 

Now I'm staring at the mirror and
Inside my heart
I can find my inner soul 
Now I'm staring in the mirror and
All around
Nothing but falling rain
