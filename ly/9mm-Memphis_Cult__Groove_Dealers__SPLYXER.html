		  Ah yeah, testin' one two, one two, hahaha
This a lil' something for you, you lil' biatch

Watch my 9mm goes bang
Wanana bang, wananana, bang
Watch my 9mm goes bang
Wanana bang, wananana, bang

Player haters, masturbators, bitches all up in my shit
Living scared, you know you dead, walking around with a crippled leg
That bitch boy try to test my shit, fucking with the rizzo click
M A G N O L I A, that is where yo ass will lay
You player haters on my dick, trying to put me in a click
I'll buck you twice, I'll buck one more, all you cowards hit the floor
These jealous fellas in a gang, knowing that they ass is lame
Big ass smile, but still as lame
You got a Glock so buck me, bitch
When that smoke is in my nose, I be wanting kidnap hoes
Talking shit about Da Click, you gon' get yo ass kicked
I hop out my fucking ride, and put my Glock to yo side
Lock you in the fucking truck, and then I'll hit that blunt
Nah

Watch my 9mm goes bang
Wanana bang, wananana, bang
Watch my 9mm goes bang
Wanana bang, wananana, bang

This a lil' something for you, you lil' biatch
