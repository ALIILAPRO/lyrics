		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love is in league with the freeway
Its passion will rise as the cities fly by
And the tail lights dissolve in the coming of night
And the questions and thousands take flight

My love is miles in awaiting
The eyes that just stare and the glance at the clock
In the secret that burns and the pain that won't stop
And it's fueled with the years

Leading me on (leading me on)
Leading me down the road
Driving me on (driving me on)
Driving me down the road

My love is exceeding the limit
Red eyed and fevered with the hum of the miles
Distance and longing, my thoughts do collide
Should I rest for a while at the side?

Your love is cradled in knowing
Eyes in the mirror still expecting their prey
Sensing too well when the journey is done
There is no turning back, no
There is no turning back on the run

My love is in the league
With the freeway
Oh, with the freeway
And the coming of the night time
My love
My love is in the league with the freeway
