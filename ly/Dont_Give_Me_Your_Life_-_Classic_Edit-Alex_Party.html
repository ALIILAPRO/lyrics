		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You treated me bad
Now what can I say?
You told me you loved me
But it never felt that way

I tried so hard to carry on
But you left me, left me there alone
Now you're trying to say don't treat you this way
But don't you know I don't need, I don't need your life

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

That doesn't mean nothing to you (Nothing to you)
Cheating and flirting is all you're fit to do

I tried so hard to carry on
But you left me, left me there alone
Now you're trying to say don't treat you this way
But don't you know I don't need, I don't need your life

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me, don't give me, don't give me, don't give me
Don't give me your life
Don't give me, don't give me, don't give me, don't give me
Don't give me your life
Oh, no

I tried so hard to carry on
But you left me, left me there alone
Now you're trying to say don't treat you this way
But don't you know I don't need, I don't need your life

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho

Don't give me your life, your life
Give me your lie
Hey, yeah, oho
