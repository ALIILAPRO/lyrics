		  Dick, dick
Dick, dick
Dick, dick
Dick

She done made some plans with my dick, ayy
She goin' ham on my dick, ayy
Sittin' on, stand on my dick, ayy
She goin' ham on my, she goin' ham on my
She goin' ham on my dick, ayy
She made some plans with my dick, ayy
Sittin' on, stand on my dick, ayy
Using no hands on my dick, ayy

She made some plans on my dick tonight
She not with him tonight 
She not with Jim tonight
She in the gym tonight
Workout in that pussy (ayy)
I'm gettin' ripped tonight
R.I.P. that pussy (ayy)
I'm goin' in tonight

She like to sit on the cock, ayy
She like to do it a lot, ayy
I make her scream for her mom, ayy
I make her scream for her pop, uh
And she got the ice, ice, baby
Suck the cock, cock
Got me like, "I like it, like it"
Baby, please don't stop, stop
Shawty gettin' freaky, goin' on a pickie
Shawty seen the icin' and the chillin' of the pinky
And I got that ice, ice, baby on my pinky
Shawty say she like, like ready 'cause she freaky

Made some plans with my dick
She goin' ham on my dick
Sittin' on, stand on my dick
She goin' ham on my, she goin' ham on my
She goin' ham on my dick
Sittin' on, stand on my dick
Usin' no hands on my dick

She goin' ham on my, she goin' ham on my
She goin' ham on my dick tonight
She not with him tonight 
She not with Jim tonight
She in the gym tonight
Workout in that pussy (ayy)
I'm gettin' ripped tonight
R.I.P. that pussy (ayy)
I'm goin' in tonight

She actin' like an addict, uh
Thicker than Andy Richter
I met the boy in the Six, but
Measurements wasn't a six, uh
I'd like a side of the pickle
I just got Morty & Rick'd, uh
He got me horny and ripped, uh
Like I just walked out the gym
And them bitches just gotta 'cause I took they Jim
Give him a job and he gave me a rim
It was too long so he gave me a min'
How was that possible? Give me a Kim
I can't describe it, just give me a pen
And why he in your tummy, bye-bye to my ribs
Turn him into a dummy, 'cause I got him stiff
And watch, you think it's funny 'til y'all get the dick
And turn into a zombie and swallow your clit

She goin' ham on my dick (dick)
Sittin' on, stand on my dick (yeah, yeah, yeah)
She goin' ham on my, she goin' ham on my (yeah, yeah)
She goin' ham on my dick (dick, yuh)
Sittin' on, stand on my dick
Usin' no hands on my dick

She goin' ham on my, she goin' ham on my
She goin' ham on my dick tonight
She not with him tonight 
She not with Jim tonight
She in the gym tonight
Workout in that pussy (ayy)
I'm gettin' ripped tonight
R.I.P. that pussy (ayy)
I'm goin' in tonight
