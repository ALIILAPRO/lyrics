		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't sleep, can't eat
Damn stress
Can't see the old me
What a mess

I hit the ground, yeah, I'm going down
I hit the ground, think I'm going down
Yeah, I hit the ground, I think I'm going down
I hit the ground, think I'm going down

Then suddenly I feel the breeze
It's left in me, now it can be
A new someone, so here I come
Towards the sun, towards the sun
Towards the sun

Back up, I feel the love
And it's the best
Clouds pass, 'cause nothing lasts
Then happiness

I hit the ground, yeah, I'm going down
I hit the ground, think I'm going down
Yeah, I hit the ground, I think I'm going down
I hit the ground, think I'm going down

Then suddenly I feel the breeze
It's left in me, now it can be
A new someone, so here I come
Towards the sun, towards the sun
Towards the sun
A new someone, so here I come
Towards the sun, towards the sun
Towards the sun
