		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haters, sadists
Mad because mc chris is the greatest
(What the fuck?)
You're cancelled you're banned, son
Take a break from grabbin' straws
And hold your grandson (Fuck you, asshole)
AS played it, mc made it
Kids, they craved it, lined the pavement
Sold out venues, waffle menus
Can't continue? What's your issue?
Mc's older, mc's balder
Scored mom's digit's and he called her
Fucked her sideways, now he might stay
Mow the lawn or it's the highway
I am awesome, I am flawless
On the mic because I bought it
I am awesome, out the closet
Please buy merch or there's no profit

Mc chris is good music
Lifts your spirit's why so serious?
You need to get over it
You need some point of experience
Mc chris is good music
Lifts your spirit's why so serious?
You need to get over it
You need some point of experience

Trumpies, grumpies
Please get off my page, enjoy your hellscape
Dickholes, pickle
Juice is on my plate now I am pissed off
(Oh, come on, man)
A great artist, a great daddy
A great husband, lets wear jammies
Bleeding liberal, democratic
Loves his country, kinda panicked
Loves Latinos, wants them freed
Wants to bring in refugees
No more hatred, no more drama
Turn our cities to Wakanda
I am kind and I am gracious
Slam your body to the pavement
You get off to garbage gossip
I get off to your mom braless

Mc chris is good music
Lifts your spirit's why so serious?
You need to get over it
You need some point of experience
Mc chris is good music
Lifts your spirit's why so serious?
You need to get over it
You need some point of experience

Assholes call my bluff
Say my music is a joke
But they still follow my page 'cause
They know my shit is dope
They think my voice is pitched up
Now they gettin' stitched up
They need to switch the picture
Someone get this kid a remote
