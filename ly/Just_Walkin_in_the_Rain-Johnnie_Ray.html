		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just walking in the rain
Getting soaking wet
Torturing my heart by trying to forget

Just walking in the rain
So alone and blue
All because my heart still remembers you

People come to windows
They always stare at me
Shake their heads in sorrow
Saying, who can that fool be

Just walking in the rain
Thinking how we met
Knowing things could change
Somehow I can't forget

(Just walking in the rain)
(Walking in the rain)
(Walking in the rain)
(Just walking in the rain, all day I)

People come to the windows
They always stare at me
Their shaking their heads in sorrow
Saying, who can that fool be
(Now who can he be)

Just walking in the rain
(Walking in the rain)
Thinking how we met
(Walking in the rain)
Knowing things have changed
(Walking in the rain)
Somehow I can't forget
(Walking in the rain)
