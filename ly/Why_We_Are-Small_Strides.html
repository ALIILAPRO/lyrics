		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whitened scars on our faith
Hidden marks of mistakes
Are all we've built
Are all we've kept
When you call out my name
We run out of our frames
I always will
Hold on again
And all the streetlights in the water
Like a window to the stars
Why we are
Why we are
And oh the night air's getting warmer
As we wander in the dark
Why we are
Why we are
Whitened scars on our faith
We can mend our mistakes
With all we build
With all we save
And all the streetlights in the water
Like a window to the stars
Why we are
Why we are
And oh the night air's getting warmer
As we wander in the dark
Why we are
Why we are
Why we are
Why we are
Why we are
Why we are
Tomorrow awakes
When you call out my name
I always will
I always will
