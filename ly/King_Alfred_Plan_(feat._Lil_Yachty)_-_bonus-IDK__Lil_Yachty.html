		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should there at any time become a clear and present danger
Initiated by the radical elements
Threatening the operation of the government
Of the United States of America
Members of this radical element shall be
Transported to detention centers
Until such time as their threat has been eliminated
Code King Alfred.

Uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Bring Obama back, tell 'em bring Obama back (back, back)
Got the Uzi and a cannon, where the drama at? (rat, rat)
Oh, they askin' for a favor, where the commas at?

Uno, dos, tres, ayy, cuatro, cinco, seis, ayy

We shall overcome (ayy)
And if we don't, bitch, you better run (ayy)
They comin' with the sticks and the drums (ayy)
The money make the band sound great, buh-buh-buh-buh

What's your rate? (What's your rate?)
I'd rather do the flight than wear a cape (phew)
RIP To SEP the Great (RIP)
SMG, we got it out the crate (SMG here)
Ring a bell and make a nigga late
Like, what it do Bob?
This a warzone, send 'em to the gulag
They was talkin' shit, now they talk to 2Pac
Now they JFK With the roof off

Like, we shall overcome (ayy)
And if we don't, bitch, you better run (ayy)
They comin' with the sticks and the drums (ayy)
The money make the band sound great, buh-buh-buh-buh

Ayy, she know I'm daddy so she goin' to Baghdad
Like a militant, I make the law, bitch, calm down, I'm a Ritalin
Talk behind my back but you actin' like you innocent
We no longer cool, why you actin' like we friends again?
When bass up, make the check hit
I buy commercial real estate, not a necklace
Someone throw a brick at my stepfather Lexus
11106, that's the address, bitch
Ayy, boo in Maryland, just to be exact
He stole my momma house, ain't no G in that
Countin' up my own money, now I'm free at last

Uno, dos, tres, ayy, cuatro, cinco, seis, ayy

We shall overcome (ayy)
And if we don't, bitch, you better run (ayy)
They comin' with the sticks and the drums (ayy)
The money make the band sound, shh

Bring Obama back, tell 'em bring Obama back (back)
Got the Uzi and a cannon, where the drama at? (rat, rat)
Oh, they askin' for a favor, where the commas at?

Uno, dos, tres, ayy, cuatro, cinco, seis, ayy

Um, it's 1972, an election year and
Once again, black people are running for their lives
