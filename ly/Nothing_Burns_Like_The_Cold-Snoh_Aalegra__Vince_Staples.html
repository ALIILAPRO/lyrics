		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can we talk about us
Like we care about us?
Can we talk about love
Like we care about love?

You say let it breathe
But this pain in my heart can't let it be
If we both can't agree
Then tell me what is the point of

Nothing burns like the cold (ay, ay)

Can we talk about us
Like we care about us?
Can we talk about love
Like we care about love?

We can't let it be
'Cause we live in a time of make-believe
We both can agree
That we're reachin' the point of

Nothing burns like the cold (ay, ay)

Good mornin', darlin'
I see you fallin'
In and out of love
Is it because you're cold and heartless?
Or is it our withdrawals?
Forgotten how to be a part of
That final scene in Casablanca
I guess the heart is like a time bomb
No white horse for you to ride on
Bygones be bygones
My God, you're beautiful
If it was two of you
Prolly break the first one's heart in two
But second time's a charm
I had a dream you locked your father's arm
And moseyed down the aisleway
I know you prolly had a wild day
So you should make your way to my place
And we can talk about the things you wanna talk about

You know, I know
You know, yeah you
You know, I know
You know

Nothing burns like the cold (ay, ay)
Nothing burns like the cold (ay, ay)
Nothing burns like the cold (ay, ay)
They say nothing burns like the cold

I get, get, get
Get, I get
