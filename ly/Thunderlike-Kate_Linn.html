		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Feel so under
You're my thunder
I'm fallin', I'm crawlin'
You don't care
 
Torn to pieces
Like a disease
Can't fight you
I want me, beside you
 
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
 
Every summer
Same old drama
The sky is too close, I can't breathe now
 
Feel so empty
Tears are plenty
I find it so hard to move on now
 
Ever wondered
Did you bother
To see what's left of me, behind you?
 
Now you're with her
It's just like we were
But maybe this time won't be bitter
 
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo
Thunderlike ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
 
Ever wondered
Did you bother
To see what's left of me, behind you?
 
Now you're with her
It's just like we were
But maybe this time won't be bitter
 
Na na na ooh-ooh-hoo
Na na na ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Na na na ooh-ooh-hoo
Na na na ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo

Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
