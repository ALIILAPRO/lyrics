		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For sure

There's no one else here around me
Sinking my feet in the sand
I'll be right here on this island
I hope that you understand

Ooh yeah
I'm feeling it I'm feeling it
Ooh yeah
Come to me quick come to me quick

I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
Love is alive love is alive

Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
So I'm gonna do that

I just wanna go where love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive

All of the chaos surrenders
Changing the currents and tide
The water can keep getting deeper
Cause I'll be right here staying dry

Ooh yeah
I'm feeling it I'm feeling it
Ooh yeah
Come to me quick come to me quick

I just wanna go where love is alive, 
love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive, 
love is alive, love is alive

Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
So I'm gonna do that

I just wanna go where love is alive, 
love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive, 
love is alive, love is alive

Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh I just wanna go where love is alive

I just wanna go where love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive
So I'm gonna do that

Ooh yeah
I'm feeling it, I'm feeling it
Ooh yeah
Come to me quick, come to me quick
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

(Ooh yeah) I just wanna go where love is alive, 
love is alive, love is alive
I just wanna go where love is alive, 
love is alive, love is alive

Love is alive when you don't have to prove it
Unafraid, there's no way to lose it
Oh I just wanna go where love is alive
So I'm gonna do that
