		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love and your heart are falling
Our skin and our scars are rotting

Your blood, my blood
Your blood, my blood
We bleed it
Your blood, my blood
Your blood, my blood
We bleed it

Smoke me like a cigarette
Burn me 'til you're wheezing
Tell me that you love me
Even if you don't mean it
Your blood, my blood, we bleed it
Your bones, my bones, break even
Smoke me like a cigarette
Burn me 'til you're wheezing
Tell me that you love me
Even if you don't mean it

Used to think I loved you
But now it's over
Scars along my skin and on my body I don't know you
Tell me that you love me
Do you still need me
Rising my blood rest so my hearts beating

Lord, protect me
I don't know where I went wrong
Where did I go?
I'm flesh and blood, flesh and blood, flesh and blood

Don't wanna leave you behind
So baby, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave

Smoke me like a cigarette
Burn me 'til you're wheezing
Tell me that you love me
Even if you don't mean it
Your blood, my blood, we bleed it
Your bones, my bones, break even
Smoke me like a cigarette
Burn me 'til you're wheezing
Tell me that you love me
Even if you don't mean it

Used to think I loved you
But now it's over
Scars along my skin and on my body I don't know you
Tell me that you love me
Do you still need me
Rising my blood rest so my hearts beating

Lord, protect me
I don't know where I went wrong
Where did I go?
I'm flesh and blood, flesh and blood, flesh and blood
