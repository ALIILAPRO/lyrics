		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went back to Ohio 
But my city was gone 
There was no train station 
There was no downtown 
South Howard had disappeared 
All my favorite places 
My city had been pulled down 
Reduced to parking spaces 
A, o, way to go Ohio

Well I went back to Ohio 
But my family was gone 
I stood on the back porch 
There was nobody home 
I was stunned and amazed 
My childhood memories 
Slowly swirled past 
Like the wind through the trees 
A, o, oh way to go Ohio

I went back to Ohio 
But my pretty countryside 
Had been paved down the middle 
By a government that had no pride 
The farms of Ohio 
Had been replaced by shopping malls 
And Muzak filled the air 
From Seneca to Cuyahoga falls 
Said, a, o, oh way to go Ohio
