		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
But fuck it I can't help it
It keep a nigga restless
You really fucking reckless
But really hoe you selfish
Could careless bout the next bitch
The fuck you mean you saw a pic of your bestie
The fuck you stressing who I fuck or who I rest with
You looking at me like I'm dumb but you pathetic
I seen you selling pussy over there on Craigslist
Don't even worry bout the fact that I was there bitch
I told you that I ain't no pimp I'm just a mack's baby
I told you if yo ass ain't listen you would go crazy
I told you if you just would listen you would find peace
You didn't listen now you claiming that you love me
I'm from out east so ain't no patience for your bullshit
You lie a lot and that's a truth that you seem cool with
So out your way I move
I ain't got time to lose
The little bit I got
Tho I do have a lot
Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
Like I give a fuck bout what you do
Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
Like I give a fuck bout who you screw
Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
But who are you
But fuck that shit it's up on me
I'm happy cause I got my peace
And I can't think of shit I need
But please believe
I use to stress about my blessings but that times over
Me and LOET just tryna grow until our times over
I needed space to many times oh that was fake oh well
You chose ya fate I'm out your way hoe you can grow in hell
My atoms split when you ain't stay see hoe I loved you
You let go just as quick as I do
That shit was cute but ain't no way that you still love me
Want to love me hoe trust me
But you don't trust me its fuck me
Yeah it's fuck me right
And tho I miss them days you'd fuck me right
Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
Like I give a fuck bout what you do
Shit got me thinking that I'm losing my mind
Like I give a fuck bout who you screw
