		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wasted years, gave you my life
And I think that’s the biggest crime 
You said forever but my trust in you was severed 
When you left my faith to die 

Nothing quite inspires like a broken heart
Glad ya really hit me hard 
You said forever, yeah my sanity was severed
And now I’m the new monarch 

It’s not quite how we rehearsed 
But I wanna hear it from you first (from you first) 

Call me King
I don’t need - need a thing from you now that I’m King
So call me King 
And I might yeah I might show a little mercy 
(nah, fuck it)

We made a promise in the light 
We swore to set the kingdom right 
We could be heroes but ya blew that all to zero 
And this whole thing ends tonight

I’ll show you what happens when you mess with god 
Come on, baby take your shot, 
We could be heroes, yeah ya blew that all to zero 
And now I’m the new monarch 

It’s not quite how we rehearsed 
But I wanna hear it from you first (from you first) 

Call me King
I don’t need - need a thing from you now that I’m King
So call me King 
And I might yeah I might show a little mercy 
So call me King
And I might yeah I might show a little mercy 
So call me King
And I might yeah I might show a little mercy
So call me King

You messed with the wrong bitch but somehow you're still alive 
Bossed up respect myself I accept this villain vibe 
The monster that you made had you diggin your own grave
I drank your light, rose from embers, metamorphosis 
You messed with the wrong bitch but somehow you're still alive 
Bossed up respect myself I accept this villain vibe 
The monster that you made had you diggin your own grave
I drank your light, rose from embers, so you can call me King
