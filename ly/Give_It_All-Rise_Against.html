		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Break through the undertow
Your hands I can't seem to find
Pollution burns my tongue
Cough words I can't speak so I stall myself again, then I fall to the surface
Fill my lungs with air
Then let it out

I give it all
This is the reason that I sing
So give it all
Cause it's these reasons that belong to me

Rock bottom's where we live
And still we dig these trenches
Bury ourselves in them
Backs breaking on the tension

For far too long these voices
Muffled by distances
It's time to come to our senses
And from the dark

We give it all
This is the reason why I sing
So give it all
It's these reasons that belong to me

Breathe, the air we give
The life we live
Our voices raising distances
So when my tongue
Break into song
You seize a competition

So please believe your eyes
Of sacrifice
Is not what we had in our minds
I'm coming home tonight, home tonight

We give it all
This is the reason why I sing
So give it all
It's these reasons that belong to me

Today I offer up myself to this I'm living for my dying wish
I give it all
Now there's a reason, there's a reason
To give it all
