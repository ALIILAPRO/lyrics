		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

So lift your eyes if you feel you can (feel you can)
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan (show you a plan)
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me (oh, oh-oh)

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long (I've been loving you too long)
It started so easy
You want to carry on (carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

You know you can't fool me
I've been loving you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (on, carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinking aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted

Now I'm lost (lost in love and I don't know much)
Lost in love (was thinking aloud and fell out of touch)
Lost in love (but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted)
Lost in love
Now I'm lost (lost in love and I don't know much)
I'm lost in love (was thinking aloud and fell out of touch)
I'm lost in love (but I'm back on my feet and eager to be what you wanted)
Lost in love
