		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you
(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you now

Sunday night's been and gone (gone, gone)
Like a cool breeze
'Til Monday morning comes along (comes along, comes along)

But the weight of the world can't hold me down
It's mind over matter, baby, you're the one I found
Playing on my mind, so I wanna take the time
To tell you how I feel for you, you know that

(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you
(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you now

Well maybe I've been a fool (a fool, a fool)
I was afraid of what I'd lose (I'd lose, I'd lose)

But the weight of the world can't hold me down
It's mind over matter, baby, you're the one I found
Playing on my mind, so I wanna take the time
To tell you how I feel for you, you know that

(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you
(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you now

(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you
(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you now

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you
(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you now

(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you
(I've waited for a lifetime)
To tell you I love you now

(I've waited for a lifetime)
(I've waited for a lifetime)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
