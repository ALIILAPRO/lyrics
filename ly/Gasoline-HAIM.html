		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault
If I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughing up
Like I never smoked a pack

Gasoline
Pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys
Back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

I get sad
You know I get sad
And I can't look past
What I'm sad about
You did me bad
And I did it back
You needed ass
Well, what's wrong with that?

Gasoline
Pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys
Back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

We're watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
When you're lyin' between my legs it doesn't matter
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Faster and faster

Gasoline
Pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease
