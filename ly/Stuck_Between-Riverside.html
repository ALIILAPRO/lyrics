		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stuck between myself and me
Pretty sure at this time
The more I see the less I feel
But I don't want it to stop 

Read my fortune
Now I can
Know you forever will be there
I'm arising
I will stay for you
And I know I will
Care

Please tell me why I still recall
Know it has to be good
It wouldn't be so hard if I
Were not so frightened for you

Read my fortune
Now I can
Know you forever will be there
I'm arising
I will stay for you
And I know I will
Care
