		<p>
		  Underneath the bridge
Tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

Something in the way
Mm
Something in the way, yeah
Mm
Something in the way
Mm
Something in the way, yeah
Mm
Something in the way
Mm
Something in the way, yeah
Mm
