		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck wrong with this nigga
Think I give a fuck about a damn rental
Like, bitch, I'm rich, give a fuck about no damn rental (woah, woah)
An M and countin', bout to be two M's up after I drop GC3, dumb ass niggas (yeah)

Run up an M, had this shit, kept on scamming
Fentanyl diamonds, they crazy, they dancin' (ayy)
Fucking this bitch, gave her back 'cause she canceled
44 Bull-D on my side, that's a hammer
Barker on me, named that bitch Alabama
Throat like a chimney, she calling me Santa (ha)
White on White 'Tayga, that's Hannah Montana
If she play her part, she get new Gucci Sandals (woah)
Can't wife these hoes, they burnt out like a candle
Yellow and fake, that bitch look like a scramble
Straight out the swamp, now I camp in a mansion
I need a new roster, it's time for expansion
If her friend look better, then I might just chance it
Mansory kit, that's my type of enhancements
I don't do leases, I only finance it
The label wan' send me two mill' for advancement

Blowin' this money do that with a passion
Done rent the Track', raced the bitch and I crashed it
Ain't pay for shit, by my own, I'm a savage
Ain't tryna beef 'less you droppin' the addy
Hit from the side, now she callin' me daddy
Hit second time, now she think I'm romantic
Won't hit again, send a bitch in her panties
Skyami the Yacht, same size as Titanic (yeah)
I ain't no killer, but please do not push me
Plastic Glock next to the P90 chopper
Think she upgraded, that nigga a rookie (yeah)
Brown on my Jeep, that's a chocolate chip cookie
Schoolin' these niggas, now they playin' hookie
He say he humble, but I say he pussy
Ain't got at least a ten piece, you can't book me
I still remember when HPD booked me
They took my fire but I went, got a new one
She ain't seen this one before, its the new one (woo)
He tried to sample One Way, had to sue 'em
I post a picture, these hoes get to spammin'
Money and power my favorite advantage
V12 the Aston, the Martin, the Vantage
My UK niggas still ATM jammin'
MSR on the backseat when we scannin'

Run up an M, had this shit, kept on scammin'
Fentanyl diamonds, they crazy, they dancin' (aye)
Fucking this bitch, gave her back and she canceled
44 Bull-D on my side, that's a hammer (woah)
Barker on me, named that bitch Alabama
Throat like a chimney, she calling me Santa
White on White 'Tayga, that's Hannah Montana (wah)
If she play her part, she get new Gucci Sandals
Can't wife these hoes, they burnt out like a candle
Yellow and fake, that bitch look like a scramble (wah)
Straight out the swamp, now I camp in a mansion
I need a new roster, it's time for expansion
If her friend look better, then I just might chance it
Mansory kit, these my type of enhancements (wah)
I don't do leases, I only finance it
The label wan' send me two mill' for advancement
