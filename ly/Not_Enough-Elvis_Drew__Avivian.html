		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How you play by the rules?
The rules are made by fools
Ignition start
Let me drive
Let's ride to a place
Where everybody hides
Why you still complain?
I gave even my brain
Isn't it enough?
Why you don't love?
How could you put
Someone above?
Am I not enough?

You told your mama
That you don't feel good
But we both know
That it's not the truth
You make your stories
Your lies I can't stand
I left you to have
Something to regret
Why you still complain?
I gave even my brain
Isn't it enough?
Why you don't love?
How could you put
Someone above?
Am I not enough?
