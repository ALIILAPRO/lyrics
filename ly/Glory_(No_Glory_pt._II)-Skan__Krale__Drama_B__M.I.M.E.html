		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had to follow my dreams, tell 'em
My story, found now, I'm flying
I'm soaring
Skipped over, took risks bolder
I'ma take mine, gimme that glory
Gimme that moment I've always been
Wanting, I been doing me
I ain't saying no sorrys
MIME, put the pedal down flooring
Bullets gon'
Fly, I ain't giving out warnings, like
I used to vision how my life
Would look from way up top paid to drop
I been out here missioning while haters talk
Another bop, 'nother hund'ed Milly
Ain't gon' ever stop
Did it for the glory, for my fans
For my day ones flopped
I been sharpening my sword
My team all going hard
Battle in myself and bet I'm winning
Y'all can check the charts
Never ever going out for nothing
No onе got the heart
That's a fact, family over еverything
My team is stacked uh, yeah
That's the reason that I'm breathing
Bitch I'm cold in every season, falling
Leaves and that be treason, like
Glory for everyone of my people
Who been holding down hold the crown
I've been fighting demons now
A hundred rounds

Found the glory on the way, I tried, my pride
Oh it got up in the way
Saw the signs my drive
Had me on the getaway, had to find my mind
They been tryna box it in
But you can't block my shine
Way too much anger, you can tell
Well now the glory's all mine
I've climbed all the way through hell
They'll never cross my line
So many cries, I know
You can see it in the eyes
So many tries, I know
Through my grind you saw my rise

Got the glory on the way
Got the glory on the way
Got the glory on the way

A couple years back I really
Felt I had no glory but look at us now, they
Proud, look at the crowd, they smile
Look at them hands going up
We handled all them rounds
Came out bruised up, cut
But we ain't make no sound
Sometimes it's hard to get away
From the window pane
The ones that try to help
We seem to send away
No more excuses, I had to get up on my game
If I wanted change then I had to go change
I seen the glory beside of my name
Still not running away, nah
We found a way up
From the dirt, levitate to the sky
That glory way up
'Member them nights I stayed up
I was failing bad, had to get that grade up
Every night I prayed up
Felt like nobody heard me but I kept on going
Didn't want my time to come up too late
Fighting all them demons, I was down
Though it was my true fate
But I held my ground, I didn't give up
They would kick me when I sit up
They made the passion just get bigger
It was my soul they couldn't get rid of

Found the glory on the way, I tried, my pride
Oh it got up in the way
Saw the signs my drive
Had me on the getaway, had to find my mind
They been tryna box it in
But you can't block my shine
Way too much anger, you can tell
Well now the glory's all mine
I've climbed all the way through hell
They'll never cross my line
So many cries, I know
You can see it in the eyes
So many tries, I know
Through my grind you saw my rise

Got the glory on the way
Got the glory on the way
Got the glory on the way
Got the glory on the way
Got the glory on the way
