		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Break the law, nigga)
(Break the l)- DJ Paul
Twhy, you did it, you heard?
(B-B-B-B-B-Break the law)
(Break the law)
(Break the law)
(Break the law)
(Break the law)
(Break the law) ayy
(Break the law)
(Break the law) ayy, ayy

Ayy, I'm quick to break the law and quick to break a nigga jaw
And you know I'm quick to break a ho, walk a bitch like a dog
No, a bitch can't get shit from me, but hard dick 'til it's soft
And a nigga can't get shit from me but a tomb and a coffin
Stomp 'em, stomp 'em, stomp 'em, stomp 'em
Stomp 'em, stomp 'em out
Jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em
Jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em out
Threw the wrong shit up in the club, so we had to put him down
Told 'em if he get up his next move gon' be beneath the ground

I can't do a show if my gun can't walk in that bitch first
Some niggas buy tickets just to come and put you on a shirt
Soon as a nigga start trippin' he gon' leave out in a hearse
Seen him muggin' while I'm performing he got shot during the verse
Niggas know we banging purple
Ayy, where my C's at
Got a few bloods in my circle
Ayy, how you bleedin'?
My uncle he a big gangsta he said they let the G's in
RIP Von if you disrespect you'll be on BDN
Exotic Glock its matte black
We sticked up in this Cadillac
Hit his block, go ratatat
Double back, now he in a pack

Ayy
I don't even smoke no more, but say, "Lil' brother, pass me that"

Quick to break the law and quick to break a nigga jaw
And you know I'm quick to break a ho, walk a bitch like a dog
No, a bitch can't get shit from me, but hard dick 'til it's soft
And a nigga can't get shit from me but a tomb and a coffin
Stomp 'em, stomp 'em, stomp 'em, stomp 'em
Stomp 'em, stomp 'em out
Jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em
Jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em out
Threw the wrong shit up in the club, so we had to put him down
Told 'em if he get up his next move gon' be beneath the ground

S-O-S we stomp him out, on site we sent that boy to Christ
Biggest G ain't gotta throw the set, they know I'm all for life
If anything got done to me, just know we got 'em back alright
Thuggin' it, thuggin' it out of control
Crackin' it, banging it, starting a fight
Fuck you thought it's Deucifer, say, 'Fuck me' feeling's mutual
I don't go to church but if I do I'ma keep that tool la tool
Bitches different races with a asian, get my noodle sucked
Ain't nothin' they can do with us
Oh, now they wanna be cool with us
Triple M, the big Mobb, fuck you thought we big step
Quality music takeover, fuck you thought I been repping
K-I-N-G bitches, me and I been standing
Fuck you mean, I'm growin' on you sleepin' ass I been slammin' (what the fuck?)

Quick to break the law and quick to break a nigga jaw
And you know I'm quick to break a ho, walk a bitch like a dog
No, a bitch can't get shit from me, but hard dick 'til it's soft
And a nigga can't get shit from me but a tomb and a coffin
Stomp 'em, stomp 'em, stomp 'em, stomp 'em
Stomp 'em, stomp 'em out
Jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em
Jump 'em, jump 'em, jump 'em out
Threw the wrong shit up in the club, so we had to put him down
Told 'em if he get up his next move gon' be beneath the ground
