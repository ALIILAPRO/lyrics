		  High school graduation
Last family vacation
Trip to Michigan last year
My yearbook from seventh grade
I tore out every page
With me and threw it all away

I know there were more good times than bad
But it's easy to forget when I start looking back

So I know you wanna keep this memory
Can you keep it in the back of your head?
'Cause when I see it in a week
I'll wish I was dead
I'll wish I took the picture of you instead

Future holidays
The beach like summer break
I don't need proof that I was there
My big brother's wedding
Hope I'm not regretting
The dress that I decide to wear

So I know you wanna keep this memory
Can you keep it in the back of your head?
'Cause when I see it in a week
I'll wish I was dead
I'll wish I took the picture of you instead
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll wish I took the picture of you instead
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I know there were more good times than bad
But they keep on getting ruined by these photographs

So I know you wanna keep this memory
Can you keep it in the back of your head?
'Cause when I see it in a week
I'll wish I was dead
I'll wish I took the picture of you instead
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I'll wish I took the picture of you instead
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
