		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ought to know that
I think we're one and the same
I don't think we could help it
No, I don't think we could help it
We don't talk much
Guess 'cause nothing has changed
And I'm not sure I like it
And I'm so tired of fighting

If I told you, you know how to
Go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me
That you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take

I know you hate it
When there's nothing to say
I'm not quite sure we'd fix it
Guess we're so used to it
Wish I had known this
From the beginning
We find it hard to work out
Why we have all this doubt

If I told you, you know how to
Go and break my heart in two
'Cause I would anyways
We'd end up like always
You know me, you better show me
That you could say it to my face
'Cause you know we're the same
There's worse things I can take
