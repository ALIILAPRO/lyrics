		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you like drugs?
Have you ever felt alone?
Do you still believe in love?

Well do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too, me too (me too babe) me too, me too
Do you like love, do you like love?
Yeah well me too, me too
It’s what we gonna do

What about matinee movies, morning secrets
Midnight summers, swim private beaches
Rock, paper, scissors, wait best out of 3
My mama said the greatest things in life are free
What about lust, what about trust
What about love? She said, you know that I do
Oh you do baby, hope you do now
You do, do, do, do

Do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too, me too, me too, me too
Do you like love, do you like love?
Yeah well me too, me too
It’s what we gonna do

Tonight, so let’s dance a little harder
'Till I feel like I know ('Till I feel like I know) all the things

Do you like drugs, do you like drugs
Yeah, well me too, me too, me too, me too
Do you like hugs, do you like love? (Feel like we have so much in common now)
Yeah well me too, me too (Right about now baby)
It’s what we gonna do

It’s you and me yeah tonight
You and me tonight (You and me tonight)
You and me tonight (You and me tonight)
You and me tonight (You and me tonight)
You and me yeah, tonight (You and me tonight)
You and me tonight (You and me tonight)
Oh feel like I’ve known you for so long right about now baby
Yeah, yeah, I wanna do you like drugs tonight
Wanna do you like drugs
