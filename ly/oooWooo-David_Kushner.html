		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If this were make-believe, I'd have you right here next to me
Living the memory with your birthday on the third next week

Mm-mm
I'm tryna find a way that I can run
Even if it's in a place without your love
I'm tired of the things that we've become
I'll tell you something, you won't love it

Ooh-ooh, I think it's time we say goodbye
Ooh-ooh, it's only right to let you fly
Ooh-ooh, I feel the tears rush to your eyes
Ooh-ooh, it's only right to let you fly

I'd count one to three, it's like we're playing hide-and-seek
Post-loved and now you're grieved has me frozen by the fear

Mm-mm
I'm tryna find a way that I can run
Even if it's in a place without your love
I'm tired of the things that we've become
I'll tell you something, you won't love it

Ooh-ooh, I think it's time we say goodbye
Ooh-ooh, it's only right to let you fly
Ooh-ooh, I feel the tears rush to your eyes
Ooh-ooh, it's only right to let you fly

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Ooh-ooh, I think it's time we say goodbye
