		  YET - Lyrics 
Verse 1
God, don't give up on me yet
I know I'm not Your best bet
But I'm trying
So don't give up on me yet

Verse 2
And God, don't leave me here alone
I know I need to grow, still
And I'm trying
But don't leave me here alone

Chorus
I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So don't give up on me yet

Verse 3
God, I know it makes no sense
You lovе me time and time again
But I still need rеminding
Yeah, I know it makes no sense

Chorus
I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So don't give up on me yet

Tag
His Grace will never Run Out 
There's enough to go round and round
His loves an ocean where your shame is drowned 
If you what he knows , then you know! 
He wont give up on you

Don't give up on me (Oh)
Don't give up on me (Ooh)
Don't give up on me (Oh) (Don't give up)
Don't give up on me

Bridge
Don't give up (Don't give up on me)
Don't give up on me
Don't give up (Oh) (Don't give up on me)
Don't give up on me
Don't give up (Don't give up)
Don't give up on me
Don't give up (Don't give up on me)

Verse 4
God, I know I'm not the same
But You knew that I would change
And I think that You're trying
To tell me it's okay

Chorus
I know I've come so far
But got so far to go
And with these brand-new scars
And this broken heart
It's hard to really know
If there's a reason
And if I'll ever see it
But I wanna believe it
So don't give up on me yet
Don't give up on me yet
Don't give up on me yet
