		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’ve been wanting to go down
This road with you a long time now
And I’ve been hoping that you’ll find
A way to swallow your pride and let go of the time now

Let’s go underground where we can’t be found
And forget the world around us
Darling can’t you see there’s just you and me
So take off your cool then your blues then your shoes
Ahaaahaaa…

So now we’re drifting towards each other
And an ocean of emotion is thundering in my blood
So uplifting when you shower me
With your warmth and your thoughts and all the love you’ve got
And it’s not to far from my shore to your shore
not to far from my door to your door
not to far from my heart to your heart
darling you know
that this place is safe darling let go – let’s go


Let’s go underground where we can’t be found
And forget the world around us
Darling can’t you see there’s just you and me
So take off your cool then your blues then your shoes
Ahaaahaaa…

Let’s go underground where we can’t be found
And forget the world around us
Darling can’t you see there’s just you and me
So take off your cool then your blues then your shoes
Ahaaa.
