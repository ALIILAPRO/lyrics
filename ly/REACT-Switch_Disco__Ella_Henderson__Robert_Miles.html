		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  24/7, on my mind, day and night, all the time
You ain't even by my side, yeah
24/7, fascinated, you got me infatuated
Feel the power in your eyes, eyes

Must be voodoo you're doin', it's pullin' me back
Just a sip of your potion and my body reacts
Feel the chemicals movin', it's a matter of fact
Every time that you touch me
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts

Must be voodoo you're doin', it's pullin' me back
Just a sip of your potion and my body reacts
Feel the chemicals movin', it's a matter of fact
Every time that you touch me
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts

24/7, on my mind, day and night, all the time
Glad my body's hypnotized, yeah
24/7, dominated by the spell that you created
You take me to paradise

There's somethin' 'bout you, love that magic
Makes me come alive, makes me come alive
Head on fire, red hot flashes
Brings me back to life, life

Must be voodoo you're doin', it's pullin' me back
Just a sip of your potion and my body reacts
Feel the chemicals movin', it's a matter of fact
Every time that you touch me
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts (one sip of your potion, oh)
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts (oh)

Think it's time that I share my confession
You been stuck in my head, my obsession, ooh
If I'm the fire, you're gasoline
So pour it over me, ooh, yeah

Must be voodoo you're doin', it's pullin' me back
Just a sip of your potion and my body reacts
Feel the chemicals movin', it's a matter of fact
Every time that you touch me
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts (one sip of your potion, oh)
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts, reacts, reacts
My body reacts

Oh, whoa, oh
