		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I see is your love (hey)
Why don't you give it to me sugar? Sugar I
Won't live without your love

Yeah, whoa
Talk to me sweetie, speak how how you feel (how you feel)
And I need for you to keep it real with me 'cause I'ma keep it real
Girl, I'm yours still, I gave you love galore (yours still)
Still I'm always tryna keep the peace with you, we at war still
I swear to God I'm at my peak with you, me I'm torn still
'Cause I still wanna be with ya, don't agree with ya but
Come with me for the week, we can be in the cut

Pourin' up Chardonnay, I'll turn you up (I'll turn you up then I)
Get you at your max, baby, turn you up
Kick back and relax with me, burn it up (burn it up then)
We fight again (fight)
But I'm tired of doin' this again and again
Then you go missin', ventin' to all your friends and
Then again, you should call your friends and leave
But talk to me (yeah, whoa)

Talk to me sweetie, speak how how you feel (how you feel)
And I need for you to keep it real with me 'cause I'ma keep it real
Girl, I'm yours still, I gave you love galore (yours still)
Still I'm always tryna keep the peace with you, we at war still
I swear to God I'm at my peak with you, me I'm torn still (torn still)
'Cause I still wanna be with ya, don't agree with ya but (forreal)
Come with me for the week, we can be in the cut (whoa, whoa, yeah, whoa)

Hol' up, who gon' leave who? (Hol' up, who)
At this point, friends stopped listenin'
Tease you, don't believe you (they don't)
Feel so out of character to play your role
Sometimes you gotta break your heart to save your soul, yeah, I know (yeah)
But I saw so and so the other day and, shit
I got a weird feeling about it (whoa)
He say he talk to you, but you tell me everything (uh-huh)
So even if it's innocent, it's still something guilty about it ('bout it)
Don't come down on me, that's just real nigga logic (whoa)
If I can't win it with you, I still want you to win it
You more on that revenge shit
Goals to everybody outside that's lookin' isn't it? (Look)
But all they care about is surface
And all I care about is everything's that's under and in it (straight up)
At the point where love gets replaced with resentment
I know time heals all, so just give me a minute (God)
You question my commitment, I'm still yours
Just come with me for the week, we can be in the cut (whoa)

Yeah, tell me what's goin' on
Tell me what you want
'Cause I don't wanna be the one thing holding you
Back from, back from things you desire (you desire, yeah)
Ooh, baby, you light my fire
We can keep it burning
All you need to do is

Talk to me sweetie, speak how how you feel (how you feel)
And I need for you to keep it real with me 'cause I'ma keep it real (forreal)
Girl, I'm yours still, I gave you love galore (yours still)
Still I'm always tryna keep the peace with you, we at war still
I swear to God I'm at my peak with you, me, I'm torn still (torn still)
'Cause I still wanna be with ya, don't agree with ya but (forreal)
I stay with you 'cause

All I see is your love
All I see is your love
All I see is your love
All I see is your love
