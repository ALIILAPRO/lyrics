		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember everything, the picnic in the park
How the rain played on the roof that night
And movies in the dark
I know you're so afraid to sing
But baby, that's my favorite sound
I love all these little things that make you who you are

And I know that we're so far apart
I see a face when I look to the stars
Oh, I

I'm so far from perfect, I get so insecure
But you pour holy water over all of my flaws
And I'll always be heartless, it'll always be yours
And on your coldest of nights, babe
I'll be there keeping you warm
I'll be there keeping you warm

I notice how your top lip shakes whenever you're mad
I can tell just when that smile is fake
I know that's when you're sad
And all these little memories, they play me like a melody
But I don't want this song to end
It belongs to you and me

Oh, I'm so far from perfect, I get so insecure (so far from perfect)
But you pour holy water over all of my flaws (pour holy water)
And I'll always be heartless, it'll always be yours (always be heartless)
On your coldest of nights, babe (coldest of nights, babe)
I'll be there keeping you warm (warm)
I'll be there keeping you warm (warm)

Woah oh 
Woah oh, oh
Woah oh 
Woah oh, oh
Woah oh (woah oh)
Woah oh, oh (woah oh, oh)
Woah oh (woah oh)
Woah oh, oh (woah oh, oh)

I'm so far from perfect, I get so insecure
But you pour holy water over all of my flaws
And I'll always be heartless, it'll always be yours
On your coldest of nights, babe
I'll be there keeping you warm (woah oh) (warm)
I'll be there keeping you warm (woah oh, oh) (warm)

I'll be there keeping you warm
I'll be there keeping you warm
