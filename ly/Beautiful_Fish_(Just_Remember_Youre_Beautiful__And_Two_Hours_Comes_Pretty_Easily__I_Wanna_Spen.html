		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the most beautiful fish in the ocean
I am the luckiest fish in the world
I'll give you all of my glittering scales
Give you my love so I'll never be safe
I was the loneliest fish in the ocean
Now I'm the happiest fish in the world
I'll give you all of my glittering scales
Give you my love so I'll never be safe
Why did we meet it feels too good to last?
It doesn't match the bad things in my past!
Look at my angel, she tells me continue
The raven lady says stay on the path
Roll my eyes, face the angel (the blue abyss)
Know this life is a fable (just the two of us)
But I gave it my love yeah I gave you my love yeah I gave you my love yeah I gave you my love
Life is so precious and I am afraid to love it
You are so precious and I am afraid to love u
I have talked myself out of this one million times
Still I keep reaching the same old conclusion
You're the most beautiful fish in the ocean
I am the luckiest fish in the world
I'll give you all of my glittering scales
Give you my love so I'll never be safe
