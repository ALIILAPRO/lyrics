		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I live on the bottom of the seven seas 
I live for the coulors and the indian breeze
No pictures aloud dont make a sound 
In my garden you swing from a tree
You say its time its all up to me
Baby dont frown
There's no one around

Above the surface i Will end up the same. Stand in line aint that a shame. I Will play the game and wait for my name. 

Not a thing in this world can get between what we share. 
Some days are pretty bad i know it makes u sad. No ones got your back like i do. 
I'll be around. I'll be around. 

I wait for the winter to cover my roof
I wait for the silence and the summer to loose
No pictures aloud
Dont make a sound. 

In my mind im chillin with u
You say its time, its all up to me
Baby dont frown
Theres no one around


Not a thing in this world can get between what we share. 
Some days are pretty bad i know it makes u sad. No ones got your back like i do. 

When i fly u fly, zippin every night 
U and i can share the silence. 
Hear me out we're gonna be alrite 
Hey listen 

I'll be around x3
Dont make a sound 

LOVE, LOVE LOVE

Fall in, fall in Love with u
There aint nothing that rather do. 
Baby, baby wanna talk to u
