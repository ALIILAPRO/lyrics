		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another sun sets down behind me, another day comes crashing in
There's a whispering wind that's blowing, there's a storm that's closing in
I can hear the trains they're rolling to a place I've never been
And I can feel her breath beside me with an empty glass of gin
As the darkness settles in, I can hear her voice again
I can hear your voice again

Waiting for someone to save me but everyone just runs away
Waiting for someone to change me but no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me but nothing ever falls in place
Waiting for the end to take me, blinded by the sun

All the ghosts that live inside me always waiting in the wind
I can see through my reflection, what I've become and what I've been
You see, your Heaven doesn't want me and your Hell won't let me in
It's like I'm holding all the aces but I know I'll never win

Waiting for someone to save me but everyone just runs away
Waiting for someone to change me but no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me but nothing ever falls in place
Waiting for the end to take me, blinded by the sun

You can take it away, tear it all down
Spit in my face, pushed to the ground
Look what I've become
I've fallen from grace, bloodied and bound
Taking up space, lost and I'm found
Look what I've become

I can hear the snakes they're winding
Singing songs of pain and sin
There's an anger overflowing
From this empty glass of gin
As the darkness settles in
And the darkness settles in

Waiting for someone to save me but everyone just runs away
Waiting for someone to change me but no one ever comes
I'm breaking down the walls that cage me but nothing ever falls in place
Waiting for the end to take me, blinded by the sun
(You can take it away) And the darkness settled in
(You can take it away) And the darkness settled in

(You can take it away) As the darkness settles in
