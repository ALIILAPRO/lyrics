		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and gone

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

When you are the ostracized
Selfish ridden dead goodbyes
Twisting on the tourniquet
When the pieces never fit

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down, sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down, surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist the Judas kiss

When the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flame

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Venom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile veins
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicate

So what now?
Where go I?
When you think it's all said and done

Bow down, sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down, surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist the Judas kiss

Judas lives, recite this vow
I've become your new god now

Follow you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured your children, never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown

In the heart of evil man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all, so

Bow down, sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down, surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons

Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist the Judas kiss (ah, Judas)
