		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis

So far apart, I check that the coast was clear,
I feel like a post card,
I wish you were here
Subway through the dark, tearing through the park
Taxi down the street, the avenue's at my feet
Don't matter much to me
What it is that I do
As long as I'm coming home With you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see,
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a high jacked plane,
Or a runaway train,
Or a speeding bullet,
There's no stopping this!
I left my heart in Metropolis!

A thousand miles feels like a million years,
Like hundreds of postcards
That say I wish you were here!
Airplane through the sky, grey all racing by,
Air bike on the beach, sailboat on the sea,
Don't matter much to me
What it is that I do,
As long as I'm coming home with you

Oh oh oh, as far as I can see,
You're the only one, the only one who can get to me
Like a high jacked plane,
Or a runaway train,
Or a speeding bullet,
There's no stopping this!
I left my heart in Metropolis!
I left my heart in Metropolis!

Like a high jacked plane,
Or a runaway train,
Or a speeding bullet,
There's no stopping this!
I left my heart in Metropolis!
I left my heart in Metropolis!
I left my heart in Metropolis!
I left my heart in Metropolis!

Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I can't even take it in
Oh oh, I left my heart in Metropolis
