		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Babe, baby, baby, I'm Gonna Leave You. 
I said baby, you know I'm gonna leave you. 
I'll leave you when the summertime, 
Leave you when the summer comes a-rollin' 
Leave you when the summer comes along. 

Baby, baby, I don't wanna leave you, 
I ain't jokin' woman, I got to ramble. 
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believin', 
We really got to ramble. 
I can hear it callin' me the way it used to do, 
I can hear it callin' me back home! 

Babe, I'm gonna leave you 
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you 
Oh I can hear it callin 'me 
I said don't you hear it callin' me the way it used to do? 

I know I never never never gonna leave your babe 
But I got to go away from this place, 
I've got to quit you, yeah 
Baby, ooh don't you hear it callin' me? 
Woman, woman, I know, I know 
It feels good to have you back again 
And I know that one day baby, it's really gonna grow, yes it is. 
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day. 
Come what may, every day 

It was really, really good. 
You made me happy every single day. 
But now, I've got to go away! 

Baby, baby, baby, baby 
That's when it's callin' me 
I said that's when it's callin' me back home
