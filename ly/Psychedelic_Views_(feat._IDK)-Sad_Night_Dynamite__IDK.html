		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream in psychedelic view
Country house, no food
Neck shimmering in June
Kick it back on my roof (woo)
Saw her naked in the lake (ha ha ha)
Now she's coming up to my room
Just bought a new sports car and filled it up with some fumes
Dream in psychedelic ways
I fall apart every day
I sit outside with the paper
Cocaine on my face
I dream of psychedelic views, uh

Checked in the hotel 'round about eight
Weary-eyed, I fell asleep at the desk, drool on my face
Dreamin' of my home state (ah)
Somewhere far from this place (woo)

Can't remember the day that I touched down at the plane
I got brought straight to these gates (wow)
Revolving doors blow in the heat
Waking me up right in front of me (yeah)

Staff at the hotel wanna meet me like 
I'm one of those celebrities that go on the TV
Just to see if they start having sex, then suddenly
They'll wake up with a personality, come on

Which one's gonna kill themselves next? (yeah)
Woke up from an iPhone text
Then go back to sleep in Egyptian cotton sheets
I feel so blessed

Every day come back to my room and have been well-pressed
Walk 'round this paradise on this hilltop, so depressed
Went up to the highest floor
Run down like an El Matador

No breath left, look between the boards
Came in on the rock
Came up here to see the sun
May as well have just brought my gun
And head straight down to the garage and

Dream in psychedelic view
Country house, no food
Neck shimmering in June
Kick it back on my roof (woo)
Saw her naked in the lake 
Now she's coming up to my room (ha ha ha)
Just bought a new sports car and filled it up with some fumes
Dream in psychedelic ways
I fall apart every day
I sit outside with the paper
Cocaine on my face
I dream of psychedelic views, uh

She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood

(Uh huh)
Purple hill, yellow hill, green hill, red hill, blue hill, windmill (uh huh)
Town where they move real slow but they still got time to sit still
Centaur, avatar, bad lil light skin girl in a leotard (leotard)
Imagine if we had a way to think what we want
If we did could meet at Mars (meet in Mars)

Look up, can you see the stars? (Yeah)
Look ahead, you can see a scar
You'll be lucky if you see tomorrow 
But I'm lucky, I've done seen it all (seen it all)

I done seen the money flow, I done seen the money come
I done seen the money go, I done seen everything under the sun
That hit my face, the odds is a hundred to one
It slipped my faith, the odds got me wanting to run

I chipped the plate, I'm scrubbing too hard with the sponge
It's evident that I'm heaven-sent, I should've been done
But it's never over, I'm taking over pedal and pump
Like big beats 'til I lose speech, every night I lose sleep

Too much on my mind 'cause my mind like a loose leaf
People like, "Who he?", I'm like, "I unno"
Look into the mirror, see my face with a blindfold
See the old me die slow

Move like a giant, fe, fi, fo
Keep my life like a centerfold
Making gratitude an antidote

Dream in psychedelic view
Country house, no food (woo)
Neck shimmering in June 
Kick it back on my roof 
Saw her naked in the lake 
Now she's coming up to my room (ha ha ha)
Just bought a new sports car and filled it up with some fumes
Dream in psychedelic ways
I fall apart every day
I sit outside with the paper
Cocaine on my face
I dream of psychedelic views, uh

She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood
