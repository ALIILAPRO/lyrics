		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blacked out pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silence

Tapped out, doused in the gasoline
The high times going timeless
Decadence, death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiral

Infamy all for publicity
Destruction going viral

Light it up ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Twisted backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolution

Perjurer, fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruin

Light it up ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Burn

Guarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do, that fistful will

Death scene black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seduction

Vaccine, fame does the murdering
She builds up for destruction

So light it up ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High again

Sold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown away

Same rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame

Addicted to the fame
