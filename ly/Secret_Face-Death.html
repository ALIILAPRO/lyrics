		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a mask
That covers up one's true intentions
Once removed, things become very clear
Analyze behavior patterns to see beneath

The person that is presented to you
Vulnerable through trust
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face

What's on the outside
Is not always all that is real
Live by caution, what I feel
When things are reversed

People are shown for what they are
The truth is revealed
Banish the false
Pacifying moments with an acquired disguise to obtain

The things they want
By the anguish of someone else
Materialistic motives are fulfilled
Cherish the true

Vulnerable through trust
Life is a twisted maze of obstacles
Presented by people with a secret face
