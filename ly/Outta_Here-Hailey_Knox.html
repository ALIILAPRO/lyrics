		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you leave me up out of here
Everything's difficult
I know but don't forget to tell me how you feel
You see love through one eye
Mama said I could of told ya
Play nice get your soul tugged
Wonder when I'ma see you again

Don't you leave me up out of here
Don't you leave me up out of here

Everything's difficult
I try and stay smiling for my friends
Fake how I'm feeling
I don't know what I'ma do with myself

No no baby don't lie to me
Tell me you love me
It's more complicated than that
Words carry meaning
Until you don't mean it
And then you can't take them back
Holy water couldn't save your soul
I shouldn't take it so personal
But it's hard to let go
When you were all over my

My background
My screensaver
All that shit had your face up on it
Gave me your attention
But you waste the moment
Now I pop bottles
Just to waste the Moet
Summer nights
Top down
AC blowin'

If you don't like me now
That's good news

I liked me less
When I was with you

I don't want an onomato
Giving up a free ride
I don't wanna gotta play along
Just to seem nice
I don't want to have to ask a motherfucker
What he doing
Something ain't right
It's so typical of you
To act like you care

No no baby don't lie
Is there somebody else
All of my chances on you
But that's not what you needed
Don't lie is there somebody else
There better not be someone else

My background
My screensaver
All that shit had your face up on it
Gave me your attention
But you waste the moment
Now I pop bottles
Just to waste the Moet
Summer nights
Top down
AC blowin'

If you don't like me now
That's good news

I liked me less
When I was with you

Don't you leave me up out of here
Don't you leave me up out of here
Don't you leave me up out of here
Don't you leave me up out of here
