		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me the truth
Baby girl, who else been with you
It's gon' come to my attention either way, yeah (uh, yeah)
And I understand
Baby girl, we all have a past
I'd much rather hear the truth come straight from you (yeah)

So if I love you (if I love you)
It'd be just for you (it'd be just for you)
So when I'm touching you (touching you)
Can I trust in you (trust in you)
Can I trust in you (trust in you), oh baby

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors

What's done is done
Now that I'm the only one
If you tell me I'll accept what you've been through, oh yeah
And I don't believe all this inconsistency
I've been hearing different stories about you

So if I love you (if I love you)
It'd be just for you (it'd be just for you)
So when I'm touching you (touching you)
Can I trust in you (trust in you)
Can I trust in you (trust in you), oh baby

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors (true)
Paint me a picture with your true colors (true)
These are confessions of a new lover (true)
True colors

Baby, show me you're a keeper
It's been hard for me to keep up
You've been tryna keep me in the dark
But baby girl, I see you
Baby, show me you're a keeper (show me you're a keeper)
It's been hard for me to keep up (hard for me to keep up)
You've been tryna keep me in the dark (yeah, yeah, yeah)
But baby girl, I see you (yeah)

Girl, come show me your true colors
Paint me a picture with your true colors
These are the questions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
Girl, come show me your true colors (true)
Paint me a picture with your true colors (true)
These are confessions of a new lover
True colors, true colors
