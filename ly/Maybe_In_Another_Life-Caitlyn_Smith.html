		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We were fireworks in the rain
Cigarettes and gasoline
I could see through the smoke, it was beautiful

And the way that you looked at me
Made our love feel evergreen
We wondered off to a place I had never known

Oh, everything was real
From the way you kissed me to the way you made me feel
Oh, we burned out of control
And I'll love you forever with the fire in my soul
Maybe I could be your girl and we don't ever say goodbye
Maybe in another life

Well, there's a place where the grass is blue
Up high with a purple moon
And there's a room in a house where you're holding me close

And we talk for a million years
And we only cry happy tears
But then I wake up and I'm talking to a ghost

Oh, everything was real
From the way you kissed me to the way you made me feel
Oh, we burned out of control
And I'll love you forever with the fire in my soul
Maybe I could be your girl and we don't ever say goodbye
Maybe in another life
Maybe in another life, yeah yeah

Oh, everything was real
From the way you kissed me to the way you made me feel
Oh, we burned out of control
And I'll love you forever with the fire in my soul
Maybe I could be your girl and we don't ever say goodbye
Maybe in another life
Maybe I could be your girl and we don't ever say goodbye
Maybe in another life
Maybe in another life
