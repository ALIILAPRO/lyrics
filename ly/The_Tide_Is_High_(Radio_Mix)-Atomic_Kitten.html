		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never give up, never give up
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not that kinda girl
Who gives up just like that
Oh, no

Its not the things you do to try to hurt me so
But it's the way you do the things you do, for me
I'm not that kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one
Number one

Every girl wants you to be her boy
But I'll wait right here, 'til it's my turn
I'm not that kinda girl mwho gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
Number one
Number one
Number one

Every time that I get the feelin'
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen some how
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments pain for a life time's pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her boy
But I'll wait right here, 'til it's my turn
I'm not that kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh, no

The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holdin' on
I'm gonna be your number one

Every time that I get the feelin'
You give me something to believe in
Every time that I got you near me
I know the way that I want it to be
But you know I'm gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen some how
And you know I can take the pressure
A moments pain for a life time's pleasure
