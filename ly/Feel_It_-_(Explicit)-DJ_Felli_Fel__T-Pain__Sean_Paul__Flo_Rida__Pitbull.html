		  Hey!
Won't you yank on some of this Cali?
Sip on some of this platinum!?
If you want some of daddy
All you gotta do is ask for some
I'm pimping up on your booty, shawty
Please don't try to move me, shawty
I'm trying to be in the life of the party
Shawty, shawty

Can you feel it? I want to know! [Repeat: x4]
Can you feel it?

Gal, me a know you a top class
A go an shake that fat ass, gimme the wind and stop fast
Me a the top boss, come gimme that quick cast
the whole night and I stop floss
In a the tight charts
Me wanna touching all the right parts
Make ya get tight ass
See your body from afar, just like a night hawk
My girl a fi in Nascar

Run with the boy, then a just now I give you
With trife coming now see ya sitting well tight
And you know see me just now credit
All night long me a wet it and set it
I'll be the man that giving it to you
All night gal know by the gate men a fight

Sean Paul, Felli, Pit, T-Pain
Mommy over there off the chain
Ass gorgeous, lips insane
Hips like boom and a ass like bang
One tie for them boys on the block
All pushing that ying and that yang, you know
That D, that rock, that cane
Aww, yeah man!
Now she moving like she can't stop
She can be from the Thailand that way that she bang cock
I'm telling, your mommy do anything
And she throwing it back like a b-b-boomerang
I went a little bit below her belly ring
Like a belly ring, badabing, hmm, badaboom
Now dim the lights down in the room
While I slide in you like, oh can you feel it naughty?

Hey!
Won't you yank on some of this Cali?
Sip on some of this platinum!?
If you want some of daddy
All you gotta do is ask for some
I'm pimping up on your booty, shawty
Please don't try to move me, shawty
I'm trying to be in the life of the party
Shawty, shawty

Hey!
Lil' momma Cali, get married
Crack up, try to get to know daddy
West coast for me baby, start that fatty
Let it go below your waist like you at Bally's
This Total Fitness, can you feel it?
Break it up or yeah you will get the business
Lil' momma asking, I'm writing your wishes
I got it bad I'm addicted to thickness
I'm trying to be your connect, fool round might get you wet
Like when you turn on the jets, hello I'm in the caress
Look there's a sport on your neck, for sure your bottom is next
Just know I'm all on ya chest, I know I'm making you sweat
She trippin', shawty look at my set
We trippin', I know you gotta collect
Keep dippin', pop up my collar, the best
We limpin', the money flippin'

Hey!
Won't you yank on some of this Cali?
