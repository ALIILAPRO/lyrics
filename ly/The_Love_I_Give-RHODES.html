		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know sometimes
Sometimes we cry
I think about love in a lot of ways
And if it didn't hurt would it feel the same?

Oh, what a life
What beautiful life it is
I'm tryna keep hold of the love you gave
And give a little back in a better way

'Cause I see blue skies
The colours look amazing
Reminds me of the day we met
You know I'd never change it
Never change it

No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I live, I live for you

No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I give, I give to you

Darling, there's a dark side to every street
And sometimes in the strangers that we meet
I gotta keep hold of the love you gave
And give a little back in a better way

'Cause I see blue skies
The colours look amazing
Reminds me of the day we met
You know I'd never change it
I'd never change

No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I live, I live for you

No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I give, I give to you

This love, this life (it's alright)
This love I give, is yours and mine (it's alright)
Alone

This love, this life (it's alright)
This love I give, is yours and mine (it's alright, it's alright)
Alone (it's alright)

No, leave you, I won't (it's alright)
No, leave you, I won't (it's alright)
The love I live, I live for you (it's alright, it's alright)

No, leave you, I won't (it's alright)
No, leave you, I won't (it's alright)
The love I give, I give to you (it's alright, it's alright)

No, leave you, I won't (it's alright)
No, leave you, I won't (it's alright)
The love I live, I live for you (it's alright, it's alright)

No, leave you, I won't
No, leave you, I won't
The love I give, I give to you
