		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t need any
More friends already
Have like two
I just called
To say
That I don’t love you
Isn’t it amazing
How I can feel so bad
And still look so good
Life is like a game of Chess
And I don’t know
How to play chess
Ya everything is fine but I wish I
Was dead
I’m ok no I’m not
I’m sobbing in the car with the radio on
What a perfect day for crying
What a perfect day for crying
I’m ok no I’m not
I’m sobbing in the car with the radio on
What a perfect day for crying
What a perfect day for crying
Roses are red
I’m going to bed
Maybe one day
The sadness will end
This morning was good
But then I got up
I need attention
If you’re happy and you know it
Don’t get used to it
The best way to
A mans heart is
Through the fourth
And fifth rib
I love
Inside jokes
Would love to be
A part of one someday
Everything is fine but I wish I
Was dead
I’m ok no I’m not
I’m sobbing in the car with the radio on
What a perfect day for crying
What a perfect day for crying
I’m ok no I’m not
I’m sobbing in the car with the radio on
What a perfect day for crying
What a perfect day for crying
Sometimes I feel like a total loser
Then I remember that I am
No matter how
Fast I run
I cannot run
Away from the pain
Now thats what I call sad
I’m ok no I’m not
I’m sobbing in the car with the radio on
What a perfect day for crying
What a perfect day for crying
That's What I Call Sad
I’m ok no I’m not
I’m sobbing in the car with the radio on
What a perfect day for crying
What a perfect day for crying
