		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know you're fooling the people
When you tell your lies.
Corrupting innocent children,
Through your thin disguise.
You use their ignorance
To try and gain some trust.
How clean are your hands?
Your methods are unjust.

Another day, another dollar,
Another brain dead who will follow you.
Do you know what we represent?
No questions asked it;'s heaven cent.

Inflicting your terror,
Your victimising all.
No one is safe now,
From your downfall.
The indecent hypocrisy
Inflecting all mankind.
Do they choose not to see,
Or are they just blind?
Another day...

Green after crying out
For authenticity.
Sacrifice the one you love
For your false purity.
Bleeding the people,
Breaking down their will.
Performing the Lord's work
With a deadly skill.

Another day...
