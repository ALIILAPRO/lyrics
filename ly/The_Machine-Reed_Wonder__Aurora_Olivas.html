		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fell in love with the machine
Fell in love with you
I made something
That'll love me
Even when im wrong
I made something that'll love me
Even with my faults
My Faults
Fell in love with a machine
Fell in love with you
Baby when we touch
Feels like you were made to take all my love
Something about you I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Fell in love with a machine
Fell in love with you
Baby when we touch
when we touch
Feels like you were meant to take all my love
All of my love
Something about you I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Fell in love with The machine
Fell in love with you
I designed you
With a mind to
Understand my thoughts
I designed you
I refined you
To be what I want
And I want you
Baby when we touch
Feels like you were meant to take all my love
Something about you I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Fell in love with a machine
Fell in love with you
Baby when we touch
when we touch
Feels like you were meant to take all my love
All of my love
Something about you I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Fell in love with the machine
Fell in love with you
Baby when we touch
Feels like you were meant to take all my love
All my love
Something about you I can't get enough
I can't get enough
Fell in love with a machine
Fell in love with you
