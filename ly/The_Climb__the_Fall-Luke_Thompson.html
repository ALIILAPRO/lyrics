		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miley, I can understand why
You'd wanna be somebody else for awhile
You've been so many people for so many years
All things ruin, crack and mold
New things grow then we call them old
But we're all looking for a
Lie that we can share

Did you feel the limelight
Slipping away from your hold
Did you feel the darkness
Sinking into your soul
Glowing isn't easy and nobody wants
To feel forgotten, to be forgot
Amy died running through the night
Trying to hide from the quiet inside
But you never can, you never will
It's yours
Takes it's toll all that rock n roll
It takes another little piece of
Your heart and soul
But we're all climb but not the fall

Did you feel the limelight
Slipping away from your hold
Did you feel the darkness
Sinking into your soul
Glowing isn't easy and nobody wants
To feel forgotten, to be forgot

Can you see the names
In the flickering lights they're gonna fade
Cos' we are all the same
With the voices in our heads lingering
We just want to be
Someone somebody else wants to be
Did you believe Hollywood was
Gonna set you free

Did you feel the limelight
Slipping away from your hold
Did you feel the darkness sinking
Down into your soul
Glowing isn't easy and nobody wants
To feel forgotten, to be forgot
