		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Count down to thunder
I think we're too close for comfort
So now don't rock the boat, don't calm the storm
God already gave you his answer
Blink, I'm sorry, it's over
The whistle has been blown now
Think you got the wrong number
I'm breaking up
Wanna make a connection
Can't get no reception
Leave a message after the tone

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Everybody's full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

Don't move a muscle
No, we can't have a struggle
But the situation is in control
So play pretend that it's all good
You could tell the Messiah
His pants are on fire, I'll politely decline, ah
I gotta go, I gotta stick my head in the sand
Then block out all the sadness

La la la la la la

'Cause it's got my head running 24/7
I don't know if can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Yeah, everybody's full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Sugar, honey, ice, and tea

And it's got my head running 24/7
I don't reckon I can figure it out
It's all messed up, only one thing I know for sure
We're so fucked
And we all march on like we know the way to Heaven
Who the hell died and made you the king
We don't know what we want, but we know that we want it
Yeah, we want it, yeah, we want it right now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Fuck you
Everybody, everybody is full of

Sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Oh, and now everybody full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Every, every, everybody full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Oh, everybody full of sugar, honey, ice, and tea
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
