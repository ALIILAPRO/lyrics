		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don’t need a sword
I don’t need advisors
to tell me which of us
is proven to be wiser
He is the king
and I his loyal subject,
none of us could do what he does
He leads his men
while I mop the floors
I clean the stains of their fallen blood
I don’t need a sword
I don’t need advisors
to tell me which of us
is proven to be wiser
while he sits above
his thoughts veil his view
he cannot see the world
from below like I do
It’s just a whisper
I breathe in his ear
I fear there are traitors in our midst
I watch his eyes
as they roam through the crowd
grow wary as he wonders who it is
Not noticing my hands on his crown
bringing it all down
I don’t need a sword
I don’t need advisors
to tell me which of us
is proven to be wiser
while he sits above
his thoughts veil his view
he cannot see the world
from below like I do
And then it is too late
the cannons have rolled in
from the highest tower
we watch the fight begin
a blade cuts through the air
and at once does he know
that the one that stands before him
is the one who stole his throne
I don’t need a sword
I don’t need advisors
to tell me which of us
is proven to be wiser
while he sits above
his thoughts veil his view
he cannot see the world
from below like-
I am the king
and you my loyal subjects
bow down and swear servility
I sit above while the peasants bow below
unaware of their hostility
and the rest is history
