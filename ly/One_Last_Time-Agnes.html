		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beat. Drum. I'm gonna lose him
Just like water through my hands
Light hits your face and you look at me like I'm a stranger
So far away, but still so near

And you can blame it on my crazy heart.
I got lost, you got torn apart
I wish you would let me hold you
Let me hold you
One last time

If this is over, if this is the end
If you don't wanna see my face again
Please just let me hold you
Let me hold you, one last time

Last night when you were sleeping
I danced away, I flew so high
I let you down and then I woke up next to a stranger
I can't believe, what have I done

And you can blame it on my crazy heart.
I got lost, you got torn apart
I wish you would let me hold you
Let me hold you
One last time

If this is over, if this is the end
If you don't wanna see my face again
Please just let me hold you
Let me hold you, one last time

I don't know what to say anymore
I don't want it to end up this way
If you would only give me the chance
I know I could do so much better

And you can blame it on my crazy heart.
I got lost, you got torn apart
I wish you would let me hold you
Let me hold you
One last time

If this is over, if this is the end
If you don't wanna see my face again
Please just let me hold you
Let me hold you, one last time

One last time
One last time
One last time
One last time
