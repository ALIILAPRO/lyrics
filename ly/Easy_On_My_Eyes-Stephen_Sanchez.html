		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was all that I could see, she was all that was in front of me
Try to climb the mountain peaks, what if I only ever reach the sea?
Would you stay awake and wait for me?

Hold me under until I see her light
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes
Sit and wonder now if I'm doing fine
Hold me close and it'll be alright
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes

She was tired, I could see
Too late receiving love that slipped from me
Tried to find the words to speak, what if I only needed time to be?
Would you have stayed awake to wait for me?

Hold me under until I see her light
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes
Sit and wonder now if I'm doing fine
Hold me close and it'll be alright
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes

Hey, hey
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

Hold me under until I see her light
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes
Sit and wonder now if I'm doing fine
Hold me close and it'll be alright
Take it easy on my eyes
Take it easy on my eyes
