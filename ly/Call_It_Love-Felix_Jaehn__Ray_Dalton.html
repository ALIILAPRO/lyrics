		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

Two hearts in a billion
Wanna fall into ya
Make me wanna shout it out
Like a hallelujah

'Cause times like these, times like these don't come and go
We're two hearts in a billion
Singing hallelujah

Hey, there's somethin' in the air tonight
Way up in the blaze of gold
Hey, there's somethin' in the air tonight (uh, uh, uh)
Say I feel it in the sky above
And way down in the waves below
Hey, I feel it in the sky above

Why don't we call it love? (Yeah)
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now (yeah)
Why don't we call it love, call it love? (Yeah)
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now (yeah) (yeah)
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

No sleep, runnin' on a dream
Down the golden coastline
You give me all I need
I'm like, oh-my, oh-my

'Cause times like these, times like these don't come and go
No sleep, runnin' on a dream
I'm like, oh-my, oh-my

Hey, there's somethin' in the air tonight
Way up in the blaze of gold
Hey, there's somethin' in the air tonight (uh, uh, uh)
Say I feel it in the sky above
And way down in the waves below
Hey, I feel it in the sky above

Why don't we call it love? (Yeah)
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now (yeah)
Why don't we call it love, call it love? (Yeah)
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now (yeah) (yeah)
Why don't we call it love, call it love?

Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
Sing it back to me, sing it back to me now
Why don't we call it love, call it love?
