		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another year goes by
Spinning as I drive
I felt like I would leave this life I knew forever
I didn't see it change
But I know it's not the same
I'd bring it back, if I could
But I know, I'm not that clever

Life's so short
And it goes by fast
And we can't get it back

The world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
Though it would never end
Oh, what I wouldn't do
To get back to
The world we knew

Something bring me back
Yeah I remember that
And nothing wrong
The days were long and the sun was warmer

Life's so short
And it goes by fast
We'll never get it back

The world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
Though it would never end
Oh, what I wouldn't do
To get back to
The world we knew

I remember nights
Baby, you and I
Taking what were given
And I remember days
Standing in the rain
That's what I can't leave there
Not a worry, not a care
Everything was different
But we're still here

In the world we knew
It was so simple then
Me and you
It was so simple then
The world we knew
Hey, oh yeah
Oh the world we knew

Oh, the world we knew
