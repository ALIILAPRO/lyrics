		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you ate I saw your eyelashes
Saw them shake like wind on rushes
In the corn field when she called me
Moths surround me, thought they'd drown me

And I miss your precious heart
And I miss your precious heart

Dried rose petal, red brown circles
Framed your eyes and stained your knuckles
Dried rose petals, red brown circles
Framed your eyes and stained your knuckles

And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water, water in
But though I tried so hard my little darling
I couldn't keep the night from coming in

And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water by the kith and the kin
Now in the quiet hour when I am sleepin'
I cannot keep the night from coming in

Why've you gone away? Gone away again
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
If you've gone away again
I'll sleep through the rest of my days
And I will sleep through the rest of my days
And I'll sleep through the rest of my days

Why've you gone away?
Seven suns, seven suns
Away, away, away, away

Can you hear me? Will you listen?
Don't come near me, don't go missing
And in the lissome light of evening
Help me Cosmia, I'm grieving

And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water, water in
But though I tried so hard my little darling
I couldn't keep the night from coming in

And all those lonely nights down by the river
Brought me bread and water in the kith and the kin
Now in the quiet hour when I am sleepin'
I cannot keep the night from comin' in

Beneath the porch light we've all been circling
Beat our dust hearts, singe our flour wings
But in the corner, something is happening
Wild Cosmia, what have you seen?

Water were your limbs, and the fire was your hair
And then the moonlight caught your eye
And you rose through the air
Well, if you've seen true light, then this is my prayer
Will you call me when you get there?

And I miss your precious heart
And I miss your precious heart
And miss, and miss, and miss
And miss, and miss, and miss, and miss, and miss your heart

But release your precious heart
To it's feast for precious hearts
