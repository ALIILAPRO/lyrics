		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where's the money for the darkskin queens
For all the darkskin queens
They always want a dark skinned queen
Where's the money for all the darkskin queens 

Big
Big bandit
But I still pose 
For the candid 
Hurry put the money 
In my bag bitch
Body outstanding 
And that nigga screamed
When I banged him 
Deep in and out
like I shanked him 
My name killa
Weather it's fashion 
Or dinner 
On a bitches mind 
Like filler 
I'm so charged up
And I'm good for connects 
Get your bars up!
And Das a brand new whip
For the master
I heard they got a new kid
On the roster 
And I ain't tryna settle down
That was last month 
They really can't keep up
Cah I'm faster 
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
I think that bitch ready
Wid the car
Let's roll
On the road 
Never on my 
Ten toes
I put it in the fee
Or my ex nigga drove 
I know you gotta leave the past
In the past but
I don't like these fucking hoes
Wrist feel a little colder than last month
Has anybody got the time it froze?
Tell that bitch that I came for the O's

Where's the money for the darkskin queens

Where's the money for the darkskin queens
For all the darkskin queens
They always want a dark skinned queen
Where's the money for all the darkskin queens 

Where's all the love and respect at?
All that talent over flex chat?
Cah when you look like this 
They'll be happy to receive 
God forbid they gotta send back,
But I'm a real one you know this!
Can't believe they really thought I wouldn't notice
Goons for the money if they hold it
I'm so fucking hard better mind where I poke it


Where's the money for the darkskin queens

Where's the money for the darkskin queens

Where's the money for the darkskin queens


Where's the money for the darkskin queens
For all the darkskin queens
They always want a dark skinned queen
Where's the money for all the darkskin queens 

Where's the money for the darkskin queens
For all the darkskin queens
They always want a dark skinned queen
Where's the money for all the darkskin queens 

Where's the money for the darkskin queens

Where's the money for the darkskin queens
