Oh

Looks like we made it
There goes another Christmas Day
We've been too busy hosting, champagne toasting
No time for you and me, mm

Ooh, there ain't no Christmas party like the one we throw
But in the midst of it all, I didn't get to let you know
That dress you got on, baby, what can I say?
It blew me away

Baby, the kids are finally sleeping and your parents are gone
Let's turn the TV off and put that old record on
And dance in the dark, put your head on my heart
You're all I need
Oh, it's a quarter to midnight so all those dishes can wait
We can't let, just can't let that mistletoe go to waste
Oh, darling, just kiss me, it's Christmas
Oh, oh

Something romantic
'Bout standing there and beat the crowds
Ooh, you still make me laugh, all the years gone past
Ooh, you still know

Baby, the day is steady dying (it is)
I don't want it to stop (don't stop)
There's one thing that I'm wanting 
That I still haven't got (no)
Let's dance in the dark (put your head on my heart)
You're all I need (yeah)
'Cause when the party is over, we'll put those presents away
Ooh, we can't let, just can't let that mistletoe go to waste
Oh, darling, just kiss me, it's Christmas
Yeah

Oh, baby, the kids are finally sleeping and your parents are gone (parents are gone)
Let's turn the TV off and put that old record on (let it play)
And dance in the dark, put your head on my heart (oh)
You're all I need
Yeah
'Cause it's a quarter to midnight so all those dishes can wait
We can't let, just can't let that mistletoe go to waste
Oh, darling, oh, darling 
Just kiss me, kiss me, it's Christmas
So, darling, just kiss me, it's Christmas
