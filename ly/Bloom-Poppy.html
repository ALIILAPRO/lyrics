		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under the ashes of disaster
Were nothing more than living matter
We're all the same, cut at the center
Uncertainty I cannot even measure
Can't measure at all
Why did I try to grow up faster?
'Cause now I feel untimely pressure
Still every day trying to be better
Uncertainty I cannot even measure
Can't even measure
Can't measure at all

Bloom like a flower
I bloom like a flower and
You took what I gave to you
I took it back from you
Now like a flower, I'll bloom

What will I turn into after? (Who will I be?)
When dark comes to take me under (go, go, go)
Could I be great or be remembered? (Envision me)
Uncertainty I cannot even measure
Can't even measure
Can't measure at all

Bloom like a flower
I bloom like a flower and
You took what I gave to you
I took it back from you
Now like a flower, I
Bloom like a flower
I bloom like a flower
And you took what I gave to you
I took it back from you
Now like a flower, I
Bloom like a flower 
I bloom like a flower
And you took what I gave to you
I took it back from you
Now like a flower, I
Bloom like a flower
I bloom like a flower
And you took what I gave to you
I took it back from you
Now like a flower, I'll bloom
