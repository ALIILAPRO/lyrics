		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's that creeping through my window?
Before you come outside I got the M4
Took her to the endzone from the ends, though
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more
Wanna hit the Jack then what you call for?
All that out-your-name shit that ain't called for, um

Who that creepin'? Know the tint is dark (five percent)
All that fall in love shit, gotta Kevin Hart (yeah, yeah)
All that speed and fly shit, we might teleport (skrr, skrr)
All that cop harass shit, I might clip a sarge (12)
Keep bouncin' that ass you just might get award (yeah)
If she bad, she get a pass into the tour (passes yeah)
I pick through the family, grab the bad sister like Janet
Opps outside, don't panic
Got a switch, gotta change up transit
Still jumpin' 'round move antsy
And I still don't like shit fancy
Up late feelin' real chancy
They outside really tryna end me (yeah)

Who's that creeping through my window? (my window)
Before you come outside I got the M4 (M4)
Took her to the endzone from the ends, though (yeah)
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more (yeah)
Wanna hit the Jack then what you call for? (yeah)
All that out-your-name shit that ain't called for (yeah)

Who the fuck is this?
Met somebody baby mama inside of the Benz
While I'm tryna tip
Shawty said she holding got a razor in her lip
Mix my cup and twist one up, I love that ratchet shit
She like "I-I-I-I-Iced out wrist, iced out, iced out wrist" (iced out wrist)
Fuck don't kiss, fuck she fuck don't kiss (muwah)
Look like friends, but she say they twins (twins)
Jump right in, there's leg room in this Benz (leg room in this Benz)
Ten miles to the crib you know that's deep (yeah)
I think it's someone out there watching me, yeah

Who's that creeping through my window? (my window, who?)
Before you come outside I got the M4 (M4)
Took her to the end zone from the ends, though (yeah)
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more (lick)
Wanna hit the Jack then what you call for? (Yeah, Jack)
All that out-your-name shit that ain't called for

Who's that creeping through my window? (who?)
Before you come outside I got the M4 (M4)
Took her to the end zone from the ends, though (yeah)
Know I love to smoke, you love to lick more (lick)
