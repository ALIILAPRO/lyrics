		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now the lobster don't even have
A price next to it, it just says "Seasonal"
So you know what that means
A brother gotta pay 28 dollars

Uh, house at the top
(Top) , party at my spot (Spot)
Rottweilers out
(Ah) , gotta secure the lot (Lot)
Fake niggas out
(Bah) , bring the burners out (Bah)
And it's word of mouth
(yeah) , you always run your mouth (yeah)
Breathin' in the loud, blowin' clouds
Hunnid thou' (yeah) , time is now (Now)
We just fuckin', in and out (Phew)
I can't love you (Nah) , I'm too wild
Same time
Who gon' be the one to turn you out?
Wanna do it 'cause I do it? Oh, you funny now
Bitch gettin' on my nerves
I just leave the house
Now I'm sleepin' at my other bitch house (Ha)
Uh, Louis bags on the couch
Camouflage with the hunnids
Now I'm cummin' in her mouth (yeah)
And if she catch feelings
Got a feelin' I'll be out but she cool
So I'm likin' how this shit is turnin' out
(yeah)

Yeah, she know it's on the low
And we both keep it low
She got crack, I got dope, she the ex
I'm the smoke it's like murder on the rope
And we on death row
And the sex so good, it's so hard sayin' no

If your nigga found out then
My girl'll kill us both
And we both love to fuck
Yeah, we both love to fuck
Yeah, we both love when
Good ain't good enough

And, hey if I get you
Some lobster and some Moet
You know what's happenin' after that
We both love to fuck no, what does happen?
We both love to fuck
I'm goin' deep-sea diving, haha

Uh, take you out the shower
(Shower) , yeah, I call the shots (Shots)
I'm the fuckin' boss
(Boss) , put you in a loft (Loft)
You can get a lot
(yeah) if you play your role (What?)
Got you comin' over
(What?) cookin' on the stove
These bitches is bold, they gon' hate
(Fuck 'em) money talk (yeah) , bullshit walk
They gon' try to fuck it up
Tell you I ain't shit
Judgin' by my outfit, yeah, I'm the shit
Icicle wrist, caught a milli on the lick
Same bitches that I hit still on your list
Yeah, I'm God's gift
Givin' like I'm Saint Nick (Pew)
I'm the ghetto Bill Gates, give me ten years
(yeah) uh, chop-chop when I switch gears
Thrustin' make her pussy wet
Comin' in the V12 i ain't even put it in
Bustin' in your seatbelt
Squirtin' on that interior of the 812 (Go)
Seashell (Uh) , Maybach ill (Go)
And it came with the luggage
That is too trill (Trill)
Boy, you not a big deal 'til you makin' deals
(Deals)
And I'm kind of big deal, to keep it real
(Ha) keep your picture in my phone, man
Them times is real
If you happy with the throne
Then just let me live
I ain't hidin', I ain't runnin'
The way I'm movin' got you wonderin'
When good ain't good enough

Yeah, you know you right 'cause my
Dick is only two inches from the ground
We both love to fuck isn't he grand?

Yeah, she know it's on the low
And we both keep it low
She got crack, I got dope, she the ex
I'm the smoke it's like murder on the rope
And we on death row
And the sex so good, it's so hard sayin' no
