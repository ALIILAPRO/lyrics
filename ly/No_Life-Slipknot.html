		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My freedom is best
Whole country's on house arrest
And everyone's a suspect
You can't feel the flow because you died
Face down on a "suicide"
The motherfucker's on self destruct
Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front
Save this, my rage is bliss
I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed

Where's Chuck D when ya need him?
You ain't shit just a puddle on the bed spread
The maniac psycho, Cool J screamed the shit
But I still can't believe it
Man, it's funny that you scare me so
Just enough to fuck me up again and again
Hard life is hard as hell
Better back the fuck on up
'Cause this is

No kind of life, this is no kind of life
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life
(You can't blame me)

Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
Savor every flavor you want 'cause it's not your own
Bad-ass at bat, man
Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
Breathe Amer-cult, breathe one more, seethe
Freak like you gotta pair
Won't be my fault, when you're painted in the corner of a no-good life
This is

No kind of life, this is no kind of life
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life
(You can't blame me)

I can't remember, I don't understand,
Is it malice that makes you this way?
Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you
I laugh 'cause there's nothing to say
You can't begin to consider the
Palpable hate in the air when you're here
None of us wonder what weather you're under
You're making it perfectly clear

Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
Never had peace but I gotta fight
Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
You're all reality and sound bites
And the freedom is never in plain sight
The feelings, the question, the price is too
Human, for fucking sake, this is

No kind of life, this is no kind of life
(I've got to get out)
It's no kind of life, this is no kind of life
(You can't blame me)

I can't be, I can't
I can't be blamed
