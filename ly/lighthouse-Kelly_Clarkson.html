		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need a do-over, how did we end up this way?
I'm so confused lover did I mistake love and pain
Ain't got no shine left I couldn't hide it
I almost lost all my light, and

I didn't choose sober but my eyes can't look away
I see our true colors lately, we've been lookin' grey
I can't turn back now 
'Cause you'd take me back down 
That road that always seems to come right back around

(Remember when) we had dreams to fly away
(But that was then) and now our story's just a page

Like a wave you're always crashing into me, crashing into me
And these days are harder than they used to be, and they used to be
No shooting stars can, fix what we aren't and
What good's a lighthouse when the light is burning out?

It's such a shame when your wants and needs they don't align
Which road to take cause your hand's no longer holdin' mine
I guess that's life and sometimes you fight and
Sometimes you walk away in order to survive

(Remember when) there was nowhere to throw blame
(But that was then) and now it's when you use my name

Like a chill in my bones when you say to me, what you say to me
I thought I found home, but hidden underneath we were crumbling
No shooting stars can fix what we are and
What good's a lighthouse when the light is burning out?

And I feel what we were washing over me, questioning everything, all that time (i feel)
And I keep all the ways that you wanted me to be different fresh in my mind (i keep)
What you loved, what you wanted, what you held so high when we first met in hindsight (ooh)
Were the things that you tried and asked me to change
As if I could do that (ooh)

Like a wave you're always crashing into me, crashing into me
And these days are harder than they used to be, and they used to be
No shooting stars can fix what we are and
What good's a lighthouse when the light is burning out?
