		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love
Is free
In time
In peace
And now
Is here
This life
This dream

You know how it feels but
Is it all in your mind?
When you know how it feels to be
Pushed and pulled through your life
And sometimes it seems like
There is life in your eyes
And all that I know is I love you
Yes I love you

And it feels like we're already flying
But the air is too thin and we're dying
The clouds all around take us higher
The world far below is on fire
I hold out my hand just to touch you
And all that I know is I love you
A vision, a promise of heaven
A reason for being forever

You're just a whisper away

We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand
And face it
This is who we are
One step closer
Into thin air
We will go there
We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand and face it
I feel you breathe
And you're just a whisper away

We've come too far to turn back
This is where we stand
And face it
This is who we are
One step closer
Into thin air
We will go there
We've come too far
This is where we stand
