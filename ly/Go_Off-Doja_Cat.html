		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go off
And choke
'Boutins
Ice on

Lil' mama, go off, let them gag and choke
With your Louboutins, put your new ice on
Get your bag, don't stop 'cause they won't shut up
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off
'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog
She gon' fuck shit up if your ass get smart
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off (yeah, yeah)

She mixed the Fendi with the Shein, she don't slide in no DM
She don't let no one win, she see 'em when she see 'em
She fuck me and my friends, she like a big expense
Men are means to an end, so she don't let them in
She never been in love, don't tell her that you are
'Cause she gon' turn her cheek and she gon' tell you, "Tuh"
She like it from the back 'cause she don't ever front
But when she hit the gas, the trunk is in the front
Lil' mama, go off

Lil' mama, go off, let them gag and choke
With your Louboutins, put your new ice on
Get your bag, don't stop 'cause they won't shut up
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off
'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog
She gon' fuck shit up if your ass get smart
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off

Then she ride, yeah
Then she go now
Yeah, she ride, yeah
Girl, let 'em know now (yeah)

And they all call her Mommy, she don't mess with her body
She never need to judge me, she love to do Pilates
But she ain't always happy, but she know where to find me
She snap just like a Pocky, I put that all behind me
'Cause they get so inspired, she show up when she tired
She don't care if you famous, don't play or you get fired
Her taste is all acquired, she sing just like a choir
These bitches all admire, she building her empire
Lil' mama, go off

Go off
And choke
'Boutins
Ice on
Don't stop
Shut up
Go off
Go off

'Cause she might just pop, do not get it messed up
She that bitch in charge, she the real top dog
She gon' fuck shit up if your ass get smart
Lil' mama, go off, lil' mama, go off
