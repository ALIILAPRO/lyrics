		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Used to be the one that you would wait on
All the nights I couldn't find my way home
I was at the bottom, I was all gone
So I know what it's like to be where you are

You keep on fightin' through your fears, your demons
Holdin' back your tears, I see it
You don't wanna show your weakness
I already know your secrets
Every single time you wake up in the night
You'll find me next to you

When it all falls down and no one is around
'Til my breath runs out, six feet underground
I'ma be there, this will never end
I'll always be there, forever and again
When you lose all hope and darkness takin' hold
'Til my blood runs cold, I won't let you go
I'ma be there, this will never end
I'll always be there, forever and again

Lost in your pain, too drunk to feel a thing 
Glass in your veins, can't fly with broken wings
Anger will fade, don't run away from me
Nothin'll change (it won't), don't run away from me

Fightin' through your fears, your demons
Holdin' back your tears, I see it
You don't wanna show your weakness
I already know your secret
Every single time you wake up in the night
You'll find me next to you (next to you)

When it all falls down and no one is around
'Til my breath runs out, six feet underground
I'ma be there, this will never end
I'll always be there, forever and again
When you lose all hope and darkness takin' hold
'Til my blood runs cold, I won't let you go
I'ma be there, this will never end
I'll always be there, forever and again

I'll always be there, this will never end
I'll always be there, forever and again
