		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We can boogie down, down up on down
The boogie sound, down up on down
The boogie sound, down up on down
The boogie sound, down up on down

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby, slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove get you to move
It's alright (alright), alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright

Gonna tell what you can do with my love
Alright
Let you know, girl
You're looking good, you're out of sight
Alright
Just move yourself
And glide like a 747
And lose yourself in the sky
Among the clouds in the Heavens 'cause

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright), alright, ooh-oh
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright

Let me tell you what you can do with my love
Alright
Gotta let you know, girl
You're looking good you're out of sight
Alright
Just tell the D.J. to play your favorite tune
Then you know it's okay
What you found is happening now (ooh-oh)

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright), alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (stand up, alright), alright

Let this groove get you to move
It's alright (alright), alright (yeah)
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright

You will find piece of mind
On the floor, take a little time
Come and see, you and me
Give a little sign
I'll be there after a while
If you want my love
We can boogie on down
Down, boogie on down
Down, we boogie on down
Down, we boogie on down
On down (hey)

Let's groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright), alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright

Let this groove get you to move
It's alright (alright), alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright (you just move)

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright), alright (you just move)
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright

Groove tonight
Share the spice of life
Baby slice it right
We're gonna groove tonight (you just move)

Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright), alright (you just move)
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright

Yeah, alright
Let this groove light up your fuse
It's alright (alright), alright
Let this groove set in your shoes
So stand up (alright), alright
