		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a lot weighing heavy all on my conscience 
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em
Bitch I'm going all in 
Ball like spawlding yeah 
cnd she steady on my Johnson 
Your bitch always calling
She don't wanna leave me alone
To be honest 
I might call her back 
Tell her put that pussy on me 
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em
Mhm, mhm
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em yeah
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em
Mhm, mhm
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em yeah

She count my money fast 
I just made 100 bands
You see the blood on my rubber bands
If you take one of us we taking all your mans
Trap money all I need
I pour the lean in my cup
Money and I get along 
I know how to level up 

She got that tummy tuck 
This is not no regular 
We way ahead of ya
You need to catch up 
My problems play catch up 
But that's what this liquor for
You should just shut up
Don't know what you speaking on
I'm not with the antics 
But nigga to each is own
To be honest 
Why she calling at 6 in the morning 

Got a lot weighing heavy all on my conscience 
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em
Bitch I'm going all in 
Ball like spawldin yeah 
cnd she steady on my Johnson 
Your bitch always calling
She don't wanna leave me alone
To be honest 
I might call her back 
Tell her put that pussy on me 
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em
Mhm, mhm
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em yeah
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em
Mhm, mhm
99 problems but a nigga can't solve em yeah
