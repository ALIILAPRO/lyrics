		  Let's go

I must have worms for my eye balls
Roaches crawling on my legs
Do I need to stack up on my adderall
Is it so wrong when I do it my way
I've been getting fed up
It ain't my fault that you're so damn brainless
I don't need a check up
I'm the best me when I really don't give a fuck

Don't look at me like this
Don't look at me like that
Is it hard to stomach I'm what you made
Turn my back
Kiss my ass
Oh Oh
How the fuck do I taste

Did I step out with my dick out
Do I got something on my face
They don't like me when I wanna be me
That just ain't a thing in this place
I've been getting fed up
It ain't my fault that you're so damn brainless
I don't need a check up
I'm the best me when I really don't give a fuck

Don't look at me like this
Don't look at me like that
Is it hard to stomach I'm what you made
Turn my back
Kiss my ass
Oh Oh
How the fuck do I taste

How the fuck do I taste
Don't look at me like this
Don't look at my like that
You hate me because you hate yourself
I guess that's too damn bad
Don't look at me like this
Don't look at my like that
And I know that you can't help it
So if you want a taste
Suck it

Don't look at me like this
Don't look at me like that
Is it hard to stomach I'm what you made
Turn my back
Kiss my ass
Oh Oh
How the fuck do I taste

Oh Oh
How the fuck do I taste
Turn my back
Kiss my ass
Oh Oh
How the fuck do I taste
