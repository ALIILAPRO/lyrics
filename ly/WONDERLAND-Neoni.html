		  Wonderland

Verse
Hello come in
Welcome to the freak show
Take your seat but
Don’t look out the windows
The monsters like to jump out of the dark
Buckle up cause this is just the start
Smoke and mirrors
Never trust what you see
They feast on your fears
Be careful what you believe
Best to just never let down your guard
This ride can be enough to stop your heart

Pre Chorus
Higher and higher we go
Up to the top
Better look out below
Higher and higher we go
Up to the top
Better look out

Chorus
So this is wonderland
Where all your dreams come true
You gotta go get yours
Before they come get you
So this is wonderland
Where nothing’s as it seems
They toss you up and smash you down to smithereens
So this is wonderland
So this is wonderland

Verse
Wasting your time
Trying just to get through
Don’t wait in line
Oh that’s how they get you
All the daisies that you picked are dead
You’re better off just picking fights instead

Chorus
So this is wonderland
Where all your dreams come true
You gotta go get yours
Before they come get you
So this is wonderland
Where nothing’s as it seems
They toss you up and smash you down to smithereens
So this is wonderland
So this is wonderland

Bridge
Wonder wonder wonderland
Is this really
Wonderland
Wonder wonder wonderland
Is this really it

Chorus
So this is wonderland
Where all your dreams come true
You gotta go get yours
Before they come get you
So this is wonderland
Where nothing’s as it seems
They toss you up and smash you down to
Yeah

Chorus
So this is wonderland
Where all your dreams come true
You gotta go get yours
Before they come get you
So this is wonderland
Where nothing’s as it seems
They toss you up and smash you down to smithereens
So this is wonderland
So this is wonderland
