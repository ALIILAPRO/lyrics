		  Obsessed With You

I've got your picture on my wall.
I dream about you when I sleep.
I go out of my way, everyday, just hoping that
I'll catch you walking down your street.
I know just where you went to school.
I know the names of all your friends.
Oh God I've got it bad again,
an O-B-S-E-S-S-I-O-N.
I know your middle name.
I've got a lock of your hair.
I'm just a little bit insane, 
cause I think I see you everywhere.
My friends, they just don't understand.
They cannot see my point of view.
They say it's gotten out of hand,
That I'm obsessed with you.

I want to get next to you.
Yeah I love all the things you do.
I want to get close to you.
You are my dream come true.
I want to have sex with you.
Your sweet caress won't do.
Cause I'm obsessed with you.
Yeah I'm obsessed with you.

Your smile sets my heart aflame.
Electrocute me with your eyes.
The very mention of your name,
My stomach fills with butterflies.
Your love is better than cocaine
I need you more than oxygen.
Oh God I've got it bad again,
an O-B-S-E-S-S-I-O-N.
I know your middle name.
I've got a lock of your hair.
I'm just a little bit insane, 
cause I think I see you everywhere.
My friends, they just don't understand.
They cannot see my point of view.
They say it's gotten out of hand,
and I'm obsessed with you.

I want to get next to you.
Yeah I love all the things you do.
I want to get close to you.
You are my dream come true.
I want to have sex with you.
Your sweet caress won't do.
Cause I'm obsessed with you.
Yeah I'm obsessed with you.

You and me, we were meant to be.
We live happily in my fantasy.
We go walking down the aisle,
Yeah you look at me and smile.
My alarm clock rings, I wake up in denial.

I want to get next to you.
Yeah I love all the things you do.
I want to get close to you.
You are my dream come true.
I want to have sex with you.
Your sweet caress won't do.
Cause I'm obsessed with you.
Yeah I'm obsessed with you.
