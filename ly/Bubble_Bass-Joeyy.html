		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sparrow

Ching the pilly 'cus I only need half
Get my way when I talk with the Gift of Gab
If you're 2 then I'll take a hard pass
I heard your song, it's a goof and a gaffe

Cup full of mud with a 30 on my lap
Transactions, I turned the Copelow
To the trap
Goody Two Shoes, drop the deuce in a glass
Green pills under my tongue, I'm Bubble Bass

CEO, I'm the one you run it past
(I'm the one you run it past)
I'll spend it all
Can't keep my grubby paws out my bag (Frrl)
Night school, I'm in the halls without a pass
(P-Pew) in the pageant
I'm the one walking 'round with the sash
(I'm the one walking 'round)

If they all switch then I
Count it all the same (I count it all the)
I put on this jacket, I put on my frames
Put a smile on my facе
Then I charge it to the gamе
(I charge it to the game)
I lace up these GATs then I go about my day
(Phew)

Smile's authentic if the drank is
(If the drank is)
Pop this, baby, I don't understand 'anxious'
They point and stare like I'm famous
DTA keep one eye open, I'm Plankton

Ching the pilly 'cus I only need half
Get my way when I talk with the Gift of Gab
If you're 2 then I'll take a hard pass
I heard your song, it's a goof and a gaffe

Cup full of mud with a 30 on my lap
Transactions, I turned the Copelow
To the trap
Goody Two Shoes, drop the deuce in a glass
Green pills under my tongue, I'm Bubble Bass
