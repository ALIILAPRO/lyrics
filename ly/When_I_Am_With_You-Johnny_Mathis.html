		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I am with you any dream that I may dream comes true
Any star in the sky I can buy with a sigh when I am with you
Whenever we meet, whatever the sweet occasion
Where angels won't go, I go with no persuasion.

When I am with you I am nothing I was before
I am everything I ever wished I could be and more
So it's not just for what you are yourself that I love you as I do
But for what I am when I am with you.

So it's not just for what you are yourself that I love you as I do
But for what I am when I am with you.
