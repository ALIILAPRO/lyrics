		  INTRO:
We'll be undefeated!


VERSE 1:
My hands stable
I feel able
To turn the tables
I can do this
Just keep moving
Keep your hands up stupid
I feel lucid
c new view and
I can see the end
I can see my future, I can view it
It's right there for the taking
Everything I've ever wanted
Dreams are just waiting
I just gotta fight for it
Willing to die for it
Willing to like soreness
I just need to hike forward

PRE:
I'm standing up cause I've had enough
I won't give up, I'm a champion
cs long as I'm breathing
I'm not retreating
I could be bleeding
I'll take a beating
cnd keep on proceeding
I'm not fatiguing
Cause once I enter the ring

HOOK:
I'll be undefeated
I'll be undefeated
Cause once I enter the ring
I'll be undefeated

VERSE 2:
I don't lose, I succeed
I will die before defeat
I got everything I need
To be the greatest I can be
Watch out, I'm here now
Big mood, no doubts
Big moves, big mouth
Hit hard, knockout
I come from a different pedigree
Destiny don't mean anything
I make everything
In my life, come to life
Manifest, see the light
Intuition be my guide
This is how I have survived

PRE:
I'm standing up cause I've had enough
I won't give up, I'm a champion
cs long as I'm breathing
I'm not retreating
I could be bleeding
I'll take a beating
cnd keep on proceeding
I'm not fatiguing
Cause once I enter the ring

HOOK:
I'll be undefeated
I'll be undefeated
Cause once I enter the ring
I'll be undefeated
