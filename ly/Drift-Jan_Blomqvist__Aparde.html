		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me chemicals, give me chemicals
I need more chemicals, more chemicals

Graffiti for the wisdom, written on the wall
Code of the decade on the bathroom stall
You gonna let me forget who we are
You're gonna get me back to the start
Over the music time talks fast
Can he who count it to hold on at last
Retina contracts, steps stop in their tracks
White wine like water, our false relax
Moving like chemicals on the floor
Almost mechanical, we're after more
Stay disconnected the same as before
Feeling defected, revolving doors
So please give me something to sleep at night
And some for later to kill the light
Then give me something to feel the same
And some more chemicals to not feel ashamed

Give me chemicals, give me chemicals
I need more chemicals, more chemicals

Give me chemicals, give me chemicals
I need more chemicals, more chemicals
Please give me something to kill my pain
Then give me chemicals to feel again
Every new story writing the same vague
Back international, cold black ink
Prescribe me some glasses to block the sight
And ripe up some killers, and let them just fight
Now throw in the chemicals into the fires
Those fucking fanatics, chronical lies
And walk through that forest they burning down
Can't breathe anymore from our dusty ground
'Cause we're killing everything to feed the towns
Word on the streets: we've lost what we found
So what is an animal waiting in line
Filled up with chemicals doing hard time
They see what they're in for, it's crystalline
Habitual killers, so genuine
So who are the villains or who should be
Don't know anymore what I should believe
I'm losing a line through reality
They are changing the words just to match the scene
Give me chemicals, give me chemicals
I need more chemicals, more chemicals
