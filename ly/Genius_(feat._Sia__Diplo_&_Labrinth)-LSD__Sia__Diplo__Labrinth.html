Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm bat shit crazy, having you on my mind
Do you think I'm helpless?
My algebra gon' equal you every time
Do you think I'm calling?
Do you think I'm calling out your name every night
Girl, I have fallen for you

What, what you say?

Oh my god, baby baby don't you see-e-e
I got everythin' you ne-e-ed
O-only a genius could love a woman like she
Oh my god, baby baby don't you see-e-e
I got everythin' you ne-e-ed
O-o-only a genius could love a woman like she

I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you

Sia

Oh!
You'll be my Einstein, my Newton, my Galileo, and my Hawking
Boy, put that pep in my step
Put your arm on my neck while I'm walking
Please understand, I have fallen for you, you

What, what you say?

Oh my god, baby baby don't you see-e-e
I got everythin' you ne-e-ed
O-only a genius could love a woman like me
Sayin' oh my god, baby baby don't you see-e-e
I got everything you ne-e-ed
O-o-only a genius could love a woman like me

I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
I'm a ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
A ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-genius
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you

Oh my god
Dot the I's and cross the T's
I got everything you ne-e-ed
Well, only a genius could love a woman like me
Oh my god
You're the lock and I'm the key-e-e
I got everything you ne-e-ed
Well, only a genius could love a woman like me

Oh, oh
'Cause I love a woman like you
He's a genius
'Cause I love a woman like you
