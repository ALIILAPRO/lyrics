		  Yeah, yeah, uh
Uh, uhh-uh
Yeah, yeah

Well, what brings you to church this evenin'?
Fightin' love, fightin' hate or you're fightin' your demons?
Mama tried to talk to you, wouldn't kee-keep it
Sad story, if I had to shoot 'em bet it's Robert Horry
I know you can get comfortable with it
I hit the road and had to double up my digits (whoa)
My car is push-to-start, like, can you dig it?
Put it in the driveway, my key in your ignition
I know it get hot as hell
But you'll be a bad one, I wanna smoke some
I know it get hotter, yeah
I wanna smoke some (I wanna smoke some)

(Yeah)
Ooh, yeah
I wanna smoke some (I wanna smoke some)
Take me to your house and let me pour some (ooh)
Type of shit I gotta focus on

Heaven or Hell? It be a story to tell (yeah)
Sellin' the work, I had to push out the bales (whoa)
Me and my niggas, we steady dodgin' the 12 (uh-huh)
Dodgin' the jail, don't talk on the cell (yeah)
Lean in my orange soda, I'm Kenan and Kel (whoa)
Been in my own corners, I trap out the mail (uh-huh)
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout? And fuck your lil' scale
I bet it's gon' sell, I bet it's gon' sell

It's whatever with the don, you know I'm leadin' the pack (uh)
You play around, I'll bet you won't get it back (uh)
I hit your bitch, I guess you won't get it back, uh 
I wanna smoke some (I wanna smoke some)

(Yeah)
Ooh, yeah
I wanna smoke some 
Take me to your house and let me pour some (ooh)
Type of shit I gotta focus on
