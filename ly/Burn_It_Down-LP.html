		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do I turn back? Oh, 'cause you want me?
Turn back, oh, 'cause you love me?
Come back, you say you need me
Know that, that's when you got me
Turning 'round, I just keep turning 'round
I got to burn it down
I got to burn it down

Girl, it's so bad the way you come at me
So mad, that's how you attract me
Cold fact, your beauty's my back beat
Own that, that's when you got me
Turning 'round, I just keep turning 'round
I got to burn it down
I got to burn it down

But we go on
Yeah, we go on
Yeah, we go on and on and on and on and on
Yeah, we go on
That's how you got me

So let's go back, back when you lost me
Go back, all that it cost me
Throwback, oh, you're so lovely
Know that, that's when you got me
Turning 'round, I feel it turning 'round
I got to burn it down
I got to burn it down

But we go on
Yeah, we go on
Yeah, we go on and on and on and on and on
Yeah, we go on
That's how you got me

That's how you got me
