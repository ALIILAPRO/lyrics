		<p>
		  (I'm just tryna get my paper straight)
(I'm just tryna get my paper straight)
(I'm just tryna get my paper straight)
(I'm just tryna get my paper straight)

I know I've been away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
Don't give my shit away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
I know I've been away (mm)
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl (yeah)
Don't give my shit away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl

They just wanna fuck with you
'Cause they know I fuck with you
If I put my trust in you
What would you do?
Would you just step out? (Step out)
Would you thug it out? (Thug it out)
Would you be here to the end?
I just wanna know it's you, my friend
I just wanna know if you pretending

I know I've been away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
Don't give my shit away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
I know I've been away (yeah, yeah, mm)
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
(Yeah) Don't give my shit away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Don't let me down (don't let me down)
Don't do me wrong (don't do me wrong)
'Cause I ain't got no one at all
This penthouse view ain't as beautiful as you
Won't ever have time but I can make time for you
Know I used to tell lies but I would never lie to you
Shopping spree on my dime looking all kinds of new
Do you know what I like? What would you like to do?
Tell me, tell me, I tend to you

I know I've been (yeah, yeah)
I know I've been away (away)
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
Don't give my shit away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl
I know I've been away (I've been away)
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl (been away)
Don't give my shit away
I'm just tryna get my paper straight, girl

(Keep me out your head)
(I'm for real)
(Keep me out your head)
(I'm for real)
(Baby, keep me out your head)
(Oh, oh)
(Keep me out your head)
