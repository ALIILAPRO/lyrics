		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loretta
I see you walking now and then
Loretta
I see you coming near

Why's it oh so hard
To turn back and finally whisper
How are we supposed to carry on?

Well I've got to for now

Forget her
cnd everything she said, she lied
I met her
Morning noon and night

Well I'd say
I fooled ya
So Loretta
You never won the fight

Why's it oh so hard
To turn back and finally whisper
How are we supposed to carry on?

Well I've got to for now

Loretta (I've got to for now)
Loretta (I've got to for now)
Loretta (I've got to for now)
Loretta
