		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walking through fields of gold
In the distance, bombs can fall
Boy we're running free
Facing light in the flow
And in the cherry trees
We're hiding from the world
But the golden age is over
But the golden age is over

Boy, we're dancing through the snow
Waters freeze, the wind blows
Did you ever feel
We're falling as we grow
No I would not believe
The light could ever go
But the golden age is over
But the golden age is over

Listen, I can hear the call
As I'm walking through the door

Did you ever dream we'd miss
The mornings in the sun
The playgrounds in the streets
The bliss of slumber land
Boy, we're family
No matter what they say
But boys are made to flee
And run away one day

When the golden age is over
Oh the golden age is over
But the golden age is over
The golden age is over
