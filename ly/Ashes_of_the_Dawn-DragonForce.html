		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trapped in this maze of existence and doomed by misery
I was blinded by my fears
Lost in the dark through the shadows I heard you scream my name
Oh help me, please, out of this nightmare

All my life I've been playing with fire
Set me free that's my only desire

The time has come for me
The time to overcome and do what is right
For the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise
The time has come for me
The time to overcome and do what is right
For the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise

Fear deep inside, is it madness that fuel my ecstasy?
Now I'm drowning in my sorrows
Lord answer my prayers, lost in despair, is this the end?
Breaking the silence so real, we'll make it together

All my dreams have been torn into pieces
Hear the screams of my eternal pain

The time has come for me
The time to overcome and do what is right
For the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise
The time has come for me
The time to overcome and do what is right
For the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise

Yeah

I have seen a sorrow in your eyes
How I wish I'd make things better
Find the strength to leave the past behind
Just one more time, we'll live again

The time has come for me
The time to overcome and do what is right
For the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise
The time has come for me
The time to overcome and do what is right
For the world to see
And from the ashes of the dawn I arise

From the fire
