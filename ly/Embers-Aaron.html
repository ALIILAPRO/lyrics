		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the end of the world
Is there a path for my words
For you to reach them
 
I’m seeking another you 
In every eye I’m running through
See me, I’m standing
 
Do you see me burning
Nothing has a name
Everyone is allaying
And I’m still on the train 
 

On the edge of our wound
Dawn has given me a room
Where I can crumble
 
Foolish scenes of the night, 
I saw your face in the light 
There you were smiling
 
I hope you don't fear the dark 
Now that no beats rule your heart
Anymore
 
Please don't you fear the dark
Just embrace the stars 
Now you're part of the night,
You’ll be safe in their light 
 

The red clouds in the evening 
When the sun meets the moon 
Birds waltzing in the morning 
I know it’s all from you

The red clouds of the evening
When the sun meets the moon 
Birds waltzing in the morning 
I know it’s all from you 
 
I guess you've tried
I know you've tried
