		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was low on pesos
No shoes on my feet, you knew I got you
I was all out of clean clothes
Evicted from the house but you knew I got you
Picked you up in my ride (ride)
Purple handlebars with the glitter tassels
Matching lights on the side
Magic card in the wheel, so they heard us passing through, uh

Put your hands in the air if you know I still got you
Leave 'em there in the air if you know that I'll come through

We're in tandem like bikes, why don't you take a seat?
You'll be riding all night, I'll be rocking in sync
We might fuss, we may fight, never lose chemistry
We're in tandem like bikes, why don't you take a seat?
So in tandem like bikes

(A one, two, a one, two)
(A one, two, a one, two)
(A one, two, a one, two)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put your hands in the air if you know I still got you
Leave 'em there in the air if you know that I'll come through

We're in tandem like bikes, why don't you take a seat?
You'll be riding all night, I'll be rocking in sync
We might fuss, we may fight, never lose chemistry
We're in tandem like bikes, why don't you take a seat?
So in tandem like bikes (now we're moving it)
Why don't you take a seat? (Now we're moving it)
You'll be riding all night (now it's sinking in)
I'll be rocking in sync (keep on pushing it)
We might fuss, we may fight (now we're moving it)
Never lose chemistry (now we're moving it)
We're in tandem like bikes (now it's sinking in)
Why don't you take a seat? (Keep on pushing it)
So in tandem like bikes
