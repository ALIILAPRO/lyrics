		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wait

King of my city, king of my country, king of my homeland
King of the filthy, king of the fallen, we living again
King of the shooters, looters, boosters, and ghettos poppin'
King of the past, present, future, my ancestors watching
King of the culture, king of the soldiers, king of the bloodshed
King of the wisdom, king of the ocean, king of the respect
King of the otimistic and dreamers that go and get it
King of the winners, district, and geniuses with conviction
King of the fighters, king of the fathers, king of the belated
King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken
King of the empathy, you resent me, king of remorse
King of my enemies, may they father feed, I rejoice
King of the skyscrapers, dodging haters, broke religion
Nine faces, go against 'em, I erased 'em with precision
I embrace them with collision
Kings did it, king vision, Black Panther, King Kendrick
All hail the king, I dropped a million tears
I know several responsibilities put me here
I don't pedal backwards but I live old-fashioned
The lens that I'm looking through
Won't prescribe me the right glasses, masses are now free
Ashes I'm dumping out, 'bout to spread all 'cross seas
Sisters and brother in unison, not because of me
Because we don't glue with the opposition, we glue with peace
But still'a fuck up your organization if any beef
What do you stand for?
Are you an activist? What are your city plans for?
Are you an accident, are you just in the way?
Your native tongue contradicting what your body language say
Are you a king or you joking, are you a king or you posing?
Are you a king or you smoking bud rocks to keep you open?
Because the king don't cry, king don't die
King don't lie, king give heart, king get by, king don't fall
Kingdom come, when I come, you know why
King, king, king, king
I am T'Challa!
