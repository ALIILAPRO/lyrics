		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time, it needs time
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love, only love
Can bring back your love someday
I will be there
I will be there

Fight, babe, I'll fight
To win back your love again
I will be there
I will be there
Love
Only love
Can break down the wall someday
I will be there
I will be there

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
Things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again
I'm loving you

Try
Baby try
To trust in my love again
I will be there
I will be there

Love, our love
Shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there
I will be there

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
Things that killed our love
Your pride has built a wall, so strong
That I can't get through
Is there really no chance
To start once again

If we'd go again
All the way from the start
I would try to change
Things that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride, and I know
What you've been through
You should give me a chance
This can't be the end

I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
Still loving you baby

I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
I need your love

Still loving you
I need your love

I need your love
