		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard you were getting sober
Hope that you're doing great
Haven't spoken since last October
Even then didn't have too much to say

Now that the party's over
Life gets in the way
Kinda hate that we're getting older
Never thought that we'd live to see the day

We're too busy
For closing down the bar
To hit the city
For sleeping in my car
Such a pity
Good things always end
I'd love to see you now and then

Wish we were friends
Wish I could call you
See you again
I wish we were friends
Thinking of all you
I wish we were friends

Heard that you left New Jersey
Hope you love LA
Can't believe you're turning 30
Where did all that time go, anyway
You gotta be up early
Can't stay out too late
Good to see you and don't you worry
If you need me, I'm a call away

We're too busy
For closing down the bar
To hit the city
For sleeping in my car
Such a pity
Good things always end
I'd love to see you now and then

Wish we were friends
Wish I could call you
See you again
I wish we were friends
Thinking of all you
I wish we were friends

Wish we were friends
Wish I could call you
See you again
I wish we were friends
Wish I could call you
See you again
I wish we were friends
