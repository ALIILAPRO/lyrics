		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Came to the sunset scene
To find out who's inside of me
Some lies I've never seen
But this one lies on the silver screen
In between real and dream
Like a scream

Hollywood black
I'm caught in the middle
Hollywood black

Same story, different eyes
Here's where the hero never, never dies
Can't you tell
That all the wishes you've made
Have filled up the well

Hollywood black
Caught in the middle
Hollywood black
Right in the middle
Too late to little

Back to the street again
Or was that yesterday
Another yesterday's gone, gone

Back in the jungle
Running with the animals
Howling at the sign of the spotlight
Those dreams are made of glass

You throw just one stone
And then there goes your last window
Can't you tell
That every wish that you made
Filled up the well

Hollywood black
Caught in the middle
Hollywood black

Hollywood black
Right in the middle
Ah, Hollywood black
Hollywood black

Caught in the middle
Too late to little
And only the fools come back
'Cause Hollywood is black
