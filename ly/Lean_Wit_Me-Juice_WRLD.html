		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drugs got me sweatin', but the room gettin' colder
Lookin' at the devil and the angel on my shoulder
Will I die tonight? I don't know, is it over?
Lookin' for my next high, I'm lookin' for closure

Lean wit' me, pop wit' me
Get high wit' me if you rock wit' me
Smoke wit' me, drink wit' me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean wit' me, pop wit' me
Get high wit' me if you rock wit' me
Smoke wit' me, drink wit' me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Told her if I die, I'ma die young
Every day I've been gettin' fucked up
Finally know the difference between love and drugs
Shorty tell me I should really sober up
This shit ain't fiction, it's too real, too real
Fuck one dose, I need two pills, two pills
I'm lookin' for trouble so I know I'm gonna find it
Ring, ring, plug hit my phone, perfect timin'
I know I'm not right
But I'm not wrong, no, I'm not wrong
Girl, you hate it when I'm too high
But that's where I belong, where I belong

Lean wit' me, pop wit' me
Get high wit' me if you rock wit' me
Smoke wit' me, drink wit' me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean wit' me, pop wit' me
Get high wit' me if you rock wit' me
Smoke wit' me, drink wit' me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys

Eyes red, no Visine
Crashed the Mustang, no Saleen
Yeah, I love beans, yeah, I love lean
I laugh when they ask if my piss clean
Huh, smoke wit' me, huh, pop wit' me, huh
Ayy, Gucci store, come and shop wit' me
If I overdose, bae, are you gon' drop wit' me?
I don't even wanna think about that right now
Let's get too high, reach a new height
Take the shrooms and the pills at the same time
Went to Hollywood thrills from the street life
Took too many drugs, now I don't feel right

Lean wit' me, pop wit' me
Get high wit' me if you rock wit' me
Smoke wit' me, drink wit' me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys
Lean wit' me, pop wit' me
Get high wit' me if you rock wit' me
Smoke wit' me, drink wit' me
Fucked up liver with some bad kidneys (bad kidneys)

Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
