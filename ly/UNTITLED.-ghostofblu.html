		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tryna die

Ready or not, here I come
Time to have a little fun
Run and hide for your life
Though you won't escape tonight
Bored of the pain that I'm dealing with
But the healing process is peeling skin to pass time
My favourite part will be you bleeding into the ceiling
Of underneath us, you'll blow the lights
If you live, I'll have you pleading, begging for freedom
But what you believe in is all just a lie
At this point, I'm just a bully
Taking pain out on everybody else
That sees straight through me
My intentions are transparent
I need help, it's quite apparent
Have I got it yet? I haven't
Yeah, you bet I fucking haven't
Sweeping the puddles up of blood on the floor
It never tastes better than straight from the source
I'll keep this night in mind forever more
'Cause I see bleeding and weeping like never before
