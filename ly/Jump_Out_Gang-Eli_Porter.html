		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If we pull up to your block on a ride
It's jump out gang we ain't thinking twice
Got thugs on my left and thugs on my right
That'll aim at your head when we slap that 9
Beating off shots at the other side
Invest in a vest or it's homicide
Jakes in the rear view see the red and blue lights
But they can't keep up the whip's modified
If we pull up to your block on a ride
It's jump out gang we ain't thinking twice
Got thugs on my left and thugs on my right
That'll aim at your head when we slap that 9
Beating off shots at the other side
Invest in a vest or it's homicide
Jakes in the rear view see the red and blue lights
But they can't keep up the whip's modified
Said I was tryna make a change but I was up still in the trap
Had the c*** bringing in racks
I got signed now I'm chasing plaques
If it ain't about money we don't need to chat
Young boy tryna live his life to the max
And I wanna get a crib up in Vinewood fast
May see me in the hills with a ski mask
Only snow around is the white in the pack
Listen to the bars I'm delivering
Flow too cold bro it's way too sickening
Switchblade ready when it's beef imma stick it in
Finish him hide out call Ronnie Pickering
Got stripes and stars no Michelin
High grade food in the pot that I'm whipping in
Ghost life I ain't got time for a prison wing
Get mag dumped if you wanna try take down the king
You won't see a lambo in my music vids
Until I can buy one of those with cash
If it's war my team's swooping in
Let it bang have your whole team gone in a flash
People talk the talk never walk the walk
When it's beef they're doing the dash
I just bought a machine with a red light beam
That'll put two straight through your back
If we pull up to your block on a ride
It's jump out gang we ain't thinking twice
Got thugs on my left and thugs on my right
That'll aim at your head when we slap that 9
Beating off shots at the other side
Invest in a vest or it's homicide
Jakes in the rear view see the red and blue lights
But they can't keep up the whip's modified
If we pull up to your block on a ride
It's jump out gang we ain't thinking twice
Got thugs on my left and thugs on my right
That'll aim at your head when we slap that 9
Beating off shots at the other side
Invest in a vest or it's homicide
Jakes in the rear view see the red and blue lights
But they can't keep up the whip's modified
Might drown cause the drip's too crazy
Got an iced out time piece that's AP
All the gyaldem call the mandem wavy
You can get a beat but my name ain't Tay Kieth
Rise and tan if a man move snakey
Might lose my cool like I just broke the AC
Tryna fill up so many accounts in the banks
They start thinking my name was James Avery
Know a man can get slice like Kimbo
Feds at the door then I'm out of the window
Beef with my team better know that I'm involved
Better 2 5 when we pull up like bingo
A and E trip when he drop like plinko
With my G and he's on job no crypto
Bro took chase when he let that ting go
He buss that case and he gave no info
