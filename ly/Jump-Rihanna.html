		  Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

Tell me that you love me when you know you don't love
But I guess I guess I guess is all good
You can play the game, I'mma still do my thang
Ain't no better way for it to be put
When you fuck them other girls I bet they be wondering why you always call my name
You think I'm gonna wait around
I ain't got all day

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered, let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony, my saddle
Is waitin', come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony, my saddle
Is waitin', come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

Think I give a damn boy don't you know who I am
I ain't runnin' 'round kissing no dude
Think somebody else like me gon' come around
Boy you got it misunderstood
Put it in your face but you wreckin' us yet
Like you can't recognize a good thing

Now that you got a chance
Tell me what it's gon' be?

You don't need another lover
Don't you let it go
I already got it covered, let the others know

If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony, my saddle
Is waitin', come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony, my saddle
Is waitin', come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump

You say it's my fault, OK I get it
You ain't pick up your calls, I'm like forget it
See you put up your wall
You know you did it, the rise and the fall, just admit it
You say it's my fault, okay I get it
You ain't answer your calls, I'm like forget it
It's the the rise and the fall
It's the the rise and the fall
And you could have had it all

If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony, my saddle
Is waitin', come and, jump on it
If you want it let's do it
Ride it, my pony, my saddle
Is waitin', come and, jump on it

Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump on it, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump, jump, jump on it
Jump on it, jump on it
