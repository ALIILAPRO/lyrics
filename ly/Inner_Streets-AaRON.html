		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might be crazy
But don't be scared
No one really gets into my head
There's a whole world in there
No one cares way too many things to share

Lost in the desert
Feeling incomplete
I want to go
Somewhere home
Hiding the best part
Showing the cheap
Side of myself
Anytime you're here

I may be crazy but don't be scared
No one really gets into my head
And in my world, I never fall
In my world, I never fall

Lost in the desert
I feel incomplete
I wanted to go
Somewhere home
Hiding the best part
Showing the cheap
Side of myself
Anytime you're here
