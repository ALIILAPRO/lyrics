		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Riding strikers
Hotbox shit, it's that hotbox shit (Pluto)
I'm gonna cut 'em (you got somethin' to bring)

Riding strikers good, yeah
Riding strikers in the hood, nigga
Riding strikers through your hood (ridin' strikers through), yeah
Ridin' strikers through your hood, yeah
Fuck a title, you got that rifle, you need to ride striker
Go for the Ferrari, a Spider, man, I had to ride striker
I taught my young niggas how to slide, go and get a striker
I put my young bitch in a G-Wag' she ridin' strikers

I go to Jamaica then tag 'em with a hundred snipers
I dip the ice and go (woo), I step out icy, frozen (woo)
I hit professional (woo), I have deja vu, I know (woo)
I'm gettin' my decimals (woo), I'm going digital
Spazzin' in Jimmy Choo, bagged up plentiful
Tell me how I'm supposed to be sober in my interview? (Sober)
Last night I was growing up (I was in Fendi too)
Took flight, I've been going up (that's a ritual)
Passport and we going up like some animals
Addied up and I'm gassed up, change the temperature
Triple rows, tall hoes, they identical
Minute Maid, Hi-Tech splash (goin' crazy)
Drug raids got me cold, got me cocky (ah)
Can't stand it, won't enjoy life if it ain't toxic
Cuban links, walkin' on ice, I don't play hockey
I was trained standin' on Front Street and I'm saucy
High profile superstar, codeine coughing
Cop a Porsche, cop a Range Rover, it's King Jaffe
Kick a door, smokin' sherm sticks, take Oxys
Piss poor, we sticking together like (gang)
King Kong, I'm taking drugs out my body
Insane, inside my brain and my posse

Riding strikers good, yeah
Riding strikers in the hood, nigga
Riding strikers good, yeah
Ridin' strikers in the hood, nigga
Fuck a title, you got that rifle, you need to ride striker (striker)
Go for the Ferrari, a Spider, man, I had to ride striker (striker)
I taught my young niggas how to slide, go and get a striker
I put my young bitch in a G-Wag she ridin' strikers (strike)

Riding strikers good
(Riding strikers through your hood, yeah)
(Riding strikers through)
(Riding strikers through the hood, nigga)
(Yeah, riding strikers through your hood, yeah)

The police need your help in tracking down a suspect
In a bank robbery this morning on the city's north side
According to police, the suspect walked into the bank about nine this morning
Went straight to one of the tellers, handed over a note that said
"Put money in bag"

Huh, pouring up drank
Huh, now I'm robbin' me a bank
Huh, fucking on foreign
Huh, that bitch with you ain't
Huh, whippin' up foreign
Huh, drive it like a tank
Huh, pouring up drank
Huh, 'bout to rob me a bank
Huh, smokin' on pressure
Huh, straight out a pound
Huh, crazy-ass shooter (crazy-ass shooter)
Huh, sprayin' in the crowd (sprayin' in the crowd)
Huh, kill 'em on sight
Huh, still go to trial
Huh, nigga get life
Huh, been scarred as a child
Huh (rob me a bank)
(Rob me a bank)
(Huh)
