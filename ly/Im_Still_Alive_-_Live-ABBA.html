		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We have a
Another song to play for you
Which is not written by Bjorn or me
But by, uh, Bjorn's old friend
Agnetha the little blonde girl you know
For a change (woo)
And, uh, she's also gonna play the piano for the first time tonight
So give her a hand because I think she'd like that

I was a loser then
But I'm a winner now
I'll do it all again
'Cause now I know how
How everything in life comes down to this, at last
Surviving and living
Determined not to give in

And I'm still alive
My life is rolling on
Gently, from day to day
Memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive
The agony is gone
My mind is slowly waking
And my heart has ceased its aching
I'm still alive

(I took so many blows)
I took so many blows
I cried a sea of tears
(And only heaven knows)
And only heaven knows
How I could stand the fears
I think of all the nights I lay alone, and scared
All shattered, and crying
And thinking I was dying

But I'm still alive
My life is rolling on
Gently, from day to day
Memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive
The agony is gone
My mind is slowly waking
And my heart has ceased its aching
I'm still alive

Yes, I'm still alive
My life is rolling on
Gently, from day to day
Memories will fade away
Yes, I'm still alive
The agony is gone
And my mind is slowly waking
And my heart has ceased its aching
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
I'm still alive
