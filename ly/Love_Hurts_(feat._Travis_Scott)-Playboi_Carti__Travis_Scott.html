		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt
Woah, woah, woah, slatt

Uh-okay, shawty know what's up, shawty want a rockstar
Shawty want a wokstar, okay, shawty want a rockstar
Uh-okay, shawty know what's up, shawty want a rockstar
Shawty want a wokstar, okay, shawty want a rockstar

Walk in that bitch with my toolie, walk in that bitch with Lil Uzi
These bitches they bitin' they lip, they chosin', lookin' like groupies
Fuckin' that bitch in my coupe, okay
Fuckin' that bitch in the lot, fucking that bitch in the spot (ooh)
Uh, polka dot, all of these hoes, they mine (ooh)
All of this jewelry, it mine (ooh), all of these bitches, they mine
Feel like Big Sean, yeah, ooh, feel like a don, yeah, ooh
Fuckin' this bitch, I swear she be lying (what, what?)
White on rice, diamonds ice, came through with the ice
I'm Lil Boat with the Sprite (Lil Boat)
Dynamite, she gon' blow tonight (Carti)

Uh-okay, shawty know what's up, shawty want a rockstar
Shawty want wokstar, okay, shawty want a rockstar
Uh-okay, shawty know what's up, shawty want a rockstar
Shawty want a wokstar, okay, shawty want a rockstar

All of these flows is mine, all of these hoes is mine
Shawty want a rockstar, okay, shawty want a rockstar, La Flame
Out there spendin' it loosely, bigger the diamonds, I'm juicy
Fuck with the jeans, it's Gucci, I been out livin' unruly
Yuh, board the jet, all of the hoes is wet
Yuh, private flex, never dip on the set
Drank, don't do wine, got two hoes in a bind, yuh
Ass on rewind, put the cash on her spine, yuh
Fill me up, double cup, yuh, okay, shawty know what's up
Shawty want a rockstar, shawty want a rockstar, okay
Shawty want a rockstar, okay, okay, shawty know what's up
