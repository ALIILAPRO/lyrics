		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Know this isn't right 
But it feels so good to us
When we're in our own minds
Pretending it's all fine, mhm-mhm

Blending it all out
But it hits us every time
When we're not together
We're hurting each other

I can't hide
I can't get enough (get enough)
And I want us to collide
We can finally be one (we can finally be one)

We're wasting time
While we know what we want
But it's impossible to try
'Till we're committing to us

I can't stop the world from falling
I can't stop the world
But when your skin is so close to mine
Then we can stop the world

I can't hide
I can't get enough (get enough)
And I want us to collide
We can finally be one (we can finally be one)

You and I
Are running on love (ay, ay, ay)
Wish that we could stop the time
'Cause I can't get enough (oh, ay)

We're wasting time
While we know what we want
But it's impossible to try
'Till we're committing to us

(I can't hide)

(I can't hide)
