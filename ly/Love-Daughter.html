		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't forget it, though I've tried
I know you regret it, love,
You told me so many times.

But I still wonder,
Why
You left with her
And left me behind

Take your hands off him
'Cause he's the only one that I 
Have ever loved
And please don't find her skin
When you turn the lights out

I can't erase it
From my mind
I just replay it, over,
Think of it all the time.
But I don't want to imagine
Words you spoke to her that night.
Naked bodies look like porcelain,
You both knew I'd be bleeding inside

Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Did she make your heart beat faster than I could?
Did she give you what you hoped for?
Oh, nights of loveless love, I hope it made you feel good,
Knowing how much I adored you
Knowing how much I adored you
