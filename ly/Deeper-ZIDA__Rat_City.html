		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know why you call me
You wanna come lay by me
Don't even wanna get to know my mind
Just wanna get to know my body
You think you got me
Just cause you say you want me
Doesn't mean i'll give in every time
But if I'm drunk i just might

Hit you up and try to get your love
Try to get your love
Try to get your love deeper, deeper yea
Might tell you come over
So I can get your love i can get your love
Try to get your love deeper, deeper yea

Deeper, deeper yea deeper, deeper yеa

I know you hate talking
Afraid i'll tell you i'm falling
But if i was would you evеn care?
Cause it feels like you ain't there
I want the real thing
And you could give me that feeling
All I need is for you to try

Imma hit you up and try to get your love
Try to get your love
Try to get your love deeper, deeper yea
Might tell you come over
So i can get your love i can get your love
Try to get your love deeper, deeper yea

Deeper, deeper yea try to get your love
Might tell you come over
So i can get your love i can get your love
Try to get your love deeper, deeper yea
Might tell you come over
So i can get your love i can get your love
Try to get your love deeper, deeper yea
