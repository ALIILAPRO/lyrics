		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another human cloud to bring you down
When you blew the last away
Bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown
But for me, they look the same
Sometimes it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, ayy-ayy

Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the gray clouds come over again
Tryna find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another "I, me, mine" to blur the lines
Between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinking you're right
And always shifting blame
Every time it's getting more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned
Throw the match in gasoline, ayy-ayy

Don't let them tell you keep it all inside
I know the winds have got to change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the gray clouds come over again
Tryna find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And it seems like time
Can be so much more than a wakeup call to live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over
Read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the gray clouds come over again
Tryna find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holding an umbrella when the gray clouds come over again
Tryna find something real
But it's not the game they play
Pretending that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Can't stop the rain, yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain, yeah
Can't stop the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can't stop the rain
Can't stop the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, can't stop the rain (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
