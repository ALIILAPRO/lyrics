		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
"Merry Christmas," I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note sayin', "I love you," I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

'Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hidin' from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl undercover, but you tore her apart
Maybe this year, maybe this year
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
'Cause last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas
Last Christmas
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Hey
I'll give it to someone special
