		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got it on smash
Hitmaka!
Yeah

Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Wake up in the morning
I can't fuck you like I used to, yeah
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Lay my top back, throw my problems on my new coupe

I know everything but they don't
I've been on a wave they ain't on, no
Swerving lane to lane and it's paid for
I murder everything, nigga case closed, yeah
Bitch I got my own cash
I do what I want to
I might do the whole dash
Drive it like I want to
This shit too easy like a free throw, yeah
This shit might blow up like some C-4, yeah

I had to let go
I'm in my bag bro
If it ain't about the cash flow
I'm sorry got to pass on
I got to pass on you, yeah

Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Wake up in the morning
I can't fuck you like I used to, yeah
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah
Lay my top back, throw my problems on my new coupe

Ridin' down Hollywood I'm cruisin' (cruisin')
Can't be standing, gotta keep it movin' (movin')
I gave up all my love but you abused it (abused it, ooh)
Now you're just something I checked off my to-do list
Yeah you got your own bag, that ain't why I want you
I can pop my own tags, I can buy my own coupe
This shit too easy like a free throw, yeah
This shit might blow up like some C-4, yeah

I had to let go
I'm in my bag bro
If it ain't about the cash flow
I'm sorry got to pass on
I got to pass on you, yeah (pass on you, no, oh)

Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to (oh, like I used to, no)
Wake up in the morning
I can't fuck you like I used to, yeah (like I used to)
Never be the same
Won't trust you like I used to, yeah (never be the same, no, no)
Lay my top back, throw my problems on my new coupe

I had to let go
Never touch you like I used to
I got to pass on you
Oh, never be the same
It's such a shame, oh oh oh oh
