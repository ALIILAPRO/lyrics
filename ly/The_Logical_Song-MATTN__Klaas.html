		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully watching me

Oh, playfully watching me

(When I was young)

When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle, oh, it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
So joyfully, oh, playfully watching me

Beautiful, magical
Beautiful, magical

(When I was young)

(When I was young)
