		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father father did you trick or treat?
My bucket is empty but words on the streets
Had me had me in the guillotine
So I just keep on keep on breathing
Father father will I make it home
And carry my soul now my mind is alone?
Will you will you make it disappear
That voice underneath I refuse to hear?

When I get low
My my my my melodies change
And I I I
Feel the whole world
Coming down on me
I really wanna save it but actuality
Shoots me down
Bang bang bang
Getting out of bed
Coz this boomerang
Always comes back
Harder than I thought
A different kind of blues has infected my heart

Father father did you trick or treat
Did it come from your hands when they gave me the sweet
Sugar, sugar did I lose my mind?
Will I just keep on keep on dreaming 
Father father will you be around
When my wings they collapse and I fall towards the ground?
Will you will you make it disappear
That voice underneath I refuse to hear?

When I get low
My my my melodies change
And I I I 
Feel the whole world
Coming down on me
I really wanna save it but actuality 
Shoots me down
Bang bang bang
Getting out of bed
Coz this boomerang
Always comes back
Harder than I thought
A different kind of blues has infected my heart

And it keeps on coming back
And leaves without fulfilling my desires
When you got nothing left to lose
There is nothing left to choose
It's a different kind of blues
And I ain't givin' up
No I ain't givin' up
Coz if the stars can shine a light
Then the sun must be bright somewhere else
When I get low
My my my melodies change
And I I I
Feel the whole world
Coming down on me
I really wanna save it but actuality
Shoots me down
Bang bang bang
Getting out of bed
Coz this boomerang
Always comes back
Harder than I thought
A different kind of blues has infected my heart

When I get low
My my my melodies change
And I I I
Feel the whole world
Coming down on me
I really wanna save it but actuality
Shoots me down
Bang bang bang
Getting out of bed
Coz this boomerang
Always comes back
Harder than I thought
A different kind of blues has infected my heart
