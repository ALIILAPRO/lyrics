		  Hey boy
Whatcha got for me, whatcha got in store?
Hey boy
Damn you're so sexy, got me wanting more (yeah)

Not going to be single, not tonight
Am I going to be single all my life?
I want you to stop and come on by
'Cause you know what us single women like (oh)

Hey boy, won't you come, come around town?
Hey, hey boy (oh)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say "Hey boy" (oh)
Come and pull up, pull up, pull up
In your hoopty ride boy, ok boy (oh)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say "Hey boy" (hey boy)

Hey boy, when I get with you
My heart is satisfied
Oh yeah boy, when I get with you
All I need is one night, yea

Not going to be single, not tonight
Am I going to be single all my life?
I want you to stop and come on by
'Cause you know what us single women like (oh)

Hey boy, won't you come, come around town?
Hey, hey boy (oh)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I say "Hey boy" (oh)
Come and pull up, pull up, pull up
In your hoopty ride, ok boy (oh)
Hey boy, better run, better run now
I said "Hey boy" (oh)

Hey boy whatcha got for me, whatcha got in store?
(Oh, oh)
Hey boy whatcha got for me, whatcha got in store?
Hey boy
