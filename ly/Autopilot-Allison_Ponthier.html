		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shaking awake from my nightly fever
I shouldn't have watched Christine alone
If my stepmom got me in that old beater
Then I would have stayed sixteen years old

And I can't drive it if I can't focus
And I can't grow up
If I'm not ready to die

Unless I wake up in 2100 on autopilot
I can't stay between the lines
But not for lack of trying
I'm just stuck on autopilot autopilot

I've never been a nightly reader
Studying late for a test the next day
I'm old enough to be their teacher
So why am I worried to make mistakes?

And I'm not passing if I can't focus
And I can't grow up
If I'm not ready to die

Unlеss I wake up in 2100 on autopilot
I can't stay between the linеs
But not for lack of trying
I'm just stuck on autopilot autopilot
Autopilot autopilot

And I can't drive it if I can't focus
And I can't grow up
If I'm not ready to die

Unless I wake up in 2100 on autopilot
I can't stay between the lines
But not for lack of trying
I'm just stuck on autopilot autopilot
Autopilot
