		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I can be so sad when I'm not
Life can be lonely and I'm stuck up in these thoughts
Everything I'm wanting I can have it at the top
But I'm at the bottom, I'm surrounded by these rocks
If I had love would I still feel this lonely?
I was by myself and nobody had to show me
Never gave a fuck, nobody tried to know me
Handing out these guns but nobody tried blow me

I don't wanna be here, I just wanna go
Wanna leave my family, everybody that I know
Suicidal thoughts, will they miss me when I go?
Tryna get high, I been riding all the lows
Finally getting sober and it bringing back the pain
Sunny for a minute now it's cloudy with the rain
Shit falling down and it bringing back mistakes
Future looking blurry, I don't see it in my fate (in my fate, in my fate)

Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad and I'll never be alright
Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad and I'll never be alright

Please come and save me, I really need saving
These are not just lyrics, I'm really not playing
This life that I'm living, I feel like I'm faking
If I can't be real then it's time for the taking
Come take my life and my soul
When I'm not even old

I been searching for a heart 'cause my heart is so cold
Say I don't listen, not doing I'm told
Don't fit the system I'll never be gold
If I hit escape would I just fall and go to hell?
Moses say I would but who is he to go and tell?
Wanna judge me now but not gon' hear me when I yell
I been crying out, steady asking for some help
Nobody wanna talk, nobody picking up the vibes
Smile on my face but they can't tell that it's a lie
Cover for the sorrow that I'm feeling deep inside
Hit 'em with the shock when they hear I wanna die

Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be, here I just wanna die
Always been sad and I'll never be alright
Why, oh why?
I don't wanna be here, I just wanna die
Always been sad and I'll never be alright
