		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faded away in the dark
And you're never comin' back
No comin' back
And I saw the look on your face
When it changed and you weren't lookin' back
No comin' back

Numb today, but tomorrow I'll feel it
Truth is worse every time that I hear it
Know you're gone but tell me, where did your spirit go? (Oh)
Run away from the way that I'm feeling
Maybe that's just the way that I'm healing
Know you're gone but tell me, where did your spirit go?
I just don't get it

All the things I wish I would've said before you took your last breath
How'd you build me up just to leave me now? (Oh)
And I just don't know where to go
Tell me where we go?
No, I just don't know

Call you whenever I'm drunk
Then I remember you're gone
Wish I could hear what you'd say
Hope that I'm all that you saw
I'm takin' all that you taught
Blood comin' up when you cough
Coldest December I saw
Tryna hold onto your soul
Fuck all that letting you go
I'll never let you go

Numb today, but tomorrow I'll feel it
Truth is worse every time that I hear it
Know you're gone but tell me, where did your spirit go? (Oh)
Run away from the way that I'm feeling
Maybe that's just the way that I'm healing
Know you're gone but tell me, where did your spirit go?
I just don't get it

All the things I wish I would've said before you took your last breath
How'd you build me up just to leave me now? (Oh)
And I just don't know where to go
Tell me where we go?
No, I just don't know
