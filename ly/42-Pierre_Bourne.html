		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Bending corners in the-
(Oh yeah, uh, whoa, whoa, oh yeah)
(Mh, bending corners)
(Whoa, whoa, oh yeah) Yeah
(Whoa, oh yeah, whoa, oh, yeah)

Bending corners in the Rover, hope I don't crash the rental
Ice make her drop to her knees, we at the temple (mh, bending corners)
Boone off the Xan, sleeping at the drive thru menu
She addicted to the sossboy, was all in you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you

She's afraid of the sossboy, what's stalling you?
Ball like I'm Jackie Robinson, I'm 42
She gon' pull up thirty minutes like I ordered food
Stacking all this paper like I'm getting bored in school
Ain't gon' be no drama, baby, I got whores that's cool
She wan' be my baby mama, yeah, of course you do
Man, you know I'm on a mission can't abort too soon
Man, you know I got to get it, that's what I'm born to do

Bending corners in the Rover, hope I don't crash the rental
Ice make her drop to her knees, we at the temple (mh, bending corners)
Boone off the Xan, sleeping at the drive thru menu
She addicted to the sossboy, was all in you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you (mh, bending corners)
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
(I'm calling you)

Ain't no cap in my rap but these niggas lie
Yeah, my cousin in the trap, he say this his life (mh, bending corners)
See that crackhead across the street, we really outside
See that yellow tape on the road do to gun fire
It's hard to wake up some days but at least I try
When I wake up every day, man, some nigga died (mh, bending corners)
You gon' lie to my face, look me in my eyes (in my eyes)
Swear when a nigga keep it real
I be looking so surprised, yeah (so surprised)

Bending corners in the Rover, hope I don't crash the rental
Ice make her drop to her knees, we at the temple (mh, bending corners)
Boone off the Xan, sleeping at the drive thru menu
She addicted to the sossboy, was all in you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you (mh, bending corners)
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
I don't want that ho, baby girl, I'm calling you
(Mh, bending corners)

(Mh, bending corners)
(What he say?)
