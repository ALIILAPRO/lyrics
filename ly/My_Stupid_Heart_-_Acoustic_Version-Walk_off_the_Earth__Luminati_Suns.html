		<p>
		  My stupid heart
Don't know, I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid

Can't believe that I haven't figured out by now
Every time I call you up
All you do is let me down
Should have known there was nothing about us I could change
Every time we try to be friends it always ends the same

But when I try to remember
All the pain that we've been through
Something in me says "Whatever"
And it brings me back to you

My stupid heart
Don't know, I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door

My stupid heart
Too late, already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart (oh shit, okay)

You can blame my stupid heart (oh shit, okay)
You can blame my stupid

Every now and then I get inside of my head
Try to leave your text on read
But I wind up here instead
I should have bit my tongue while we were still ahead
I always had to be right
'Til we had nothing left

But when I try to remember
All the pain that we've been through
Something in me says "Whatever"
And it brings me back to you

My stupid heart
Don't know, I've tried to let you go
So many times before
Then wound up at your door
My stupid heart
Too late, already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart (oh shit, okay)
You can blame my stupid heart

I've tried to let you go (oh shit)
So many times before (okay)
You can blame my stupid
Too late, already on my way (oh shit)
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart

Too late, already on my way
If we go down in flames
Again then you can blame my stupid heart
