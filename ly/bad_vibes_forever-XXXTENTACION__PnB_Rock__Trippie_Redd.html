		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh-ooh, got you grindin' all on that
Ridin' on that thang, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do-ooh-ooh? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe with me, get the feel with me, vibe with me
Ooh-ooh-ooh, got you grindin' all on that
Ridin' on that thang, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do-ooh-ooh? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe with me, get the feel with me, vibe with me

I said, "Hey, put your pride right to the side"
I can waste your time
Or I can change your life, I said now
"Oh, shawty, where you goin'?
I just need one moment
So baby, keep your focus"
I said, "Stay, stay, babe
Stay, stay with me
Stay, stay, babe
Please don't run away
Please don't stray away"

Ooh-ooh-ooh, got you grindin' all on that
Ridin' on that thang, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do-ooh-ooh? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe with me, get the feel with me, vibe with me (oh yeah)

Ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah), I can barely keep control (control)
When you're grindin' all on me, bitin' all on me
Girl, you take my soul, yeah (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, you look like the girl of my dreams (dreams)
My heart is on lock and the key (key)
It's right in your pocket, you see
All sex, no stress (stress)
I ain't tryna hold you back (back)
Ice on, who bought you that? (Ice)
Don't want you to go out sad (sad)
Girl, you know I'm fallin' for you (yeah)
And girl, you know I'm all in for you (yeah)
And I'm in love with you-ooh-ooh, everything you do-ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, got you grindin' all on that
Ridin' on that thang, make a young nigga eyes roll in my brain
What we gon' do-ooh-ooh? I can barely keep control
Catch the vibe with me, get the feel with me, vibe with me
