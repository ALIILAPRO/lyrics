		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell

You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell

You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell

You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell

Think about you all the time
If you kiss then I won't tell
Think about you all the time
If you kiss then I won't tell

(You stay on my mind)
(Think about you all the time)
(Got to get to know you well)
(If you kiss then I won't tell)
(You stay on my mind)
(Think about you all the time)
(Got to get to know you well)
(If you kiss then-)

On my mind (mind)
On my mind (mind)

You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
You stay on my mind
Think about you all the time
Got to get to know you well
If you kiss then I won't tell
