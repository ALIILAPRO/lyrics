		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been optimistic, drownin' with the light and make my demons hit the block
And now I spend it all, I make it back, I'm losin' all my thoughts
And young niggas  ridin' with me, they be down to lose it all
He's Emotional, He's unstable, he's just more or less a mock

I can feel it, I can save him, that's the plan, that's my dawg
I'ma need some more drugs tonight, so call the plug supply
I don't know who's gonna stay tonight, so please do not attack
So my knuckle bleedin', hope she pays tonight

Till my niggas hit the bank and all my knights ably
Fuck them niggas all them crazy nights have seen
Just another day the lazy nights have seen
Got one lazy eye, got the laser lights on me

Keep it blazin' like a G, so you noticed the power
Made me sin, I'm comin' home speeding make you feel a way
I'll make a ghost dance with me and make you feel a way, that's why
I only make her dance with me and make you fade away, that's why

And I've been caught up in my head, look at me i'll make you feel away, that's why
Demons feel attached I'll make you feel away, get the fuck out my head
In a minute, ill make you feel away, that's why
She don't wanna love me, hope you feel the same, hope you come back

In a minute, make you hit the brakes, that's why
Pirates run the world, hope you feel the same, that's why

I wanna make you dance over me, the battlefield make you feel alive
Them niggas hit the spot and make you switch the lights

I know I'll make you split the bag of peas
I don't mean to die, the  northern light, losing up on me
Urgently tonight, you know my niggas raising up their fees
I don't mean to die, the niggas talk about me and that's on me
I'm Immortal
