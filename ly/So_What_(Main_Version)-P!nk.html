		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

I guess I just lost my husband
I don't know where he went
So I'm gonna drink my money
I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope)
I got a brand new attitude
And I'm gonna wear it tonight
I wanna get in trouble
I wanna start a fight

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, I wanna start a fight
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, I wanna start a fight

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

Uh, check my flow, uh
The waiter just took my table
And gave to Jessica Simps (shit)
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy
At least he'll know how to hit (oops)
What if this song's on the radio?
Then somebody's gonna die
I'm gonna get in trouble
My ex will start a fight

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, he's gonna start a fight (huh)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, we're all gonna get in a fight

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't need you
And guess what?
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright, I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight

You weren't there
You never were
You want it all
But that's not fair
I gave you love
I gave my all
You weren't there
You let me fall

So, so what?
I'm still a rock star
I got my rock moves (moves)
And I don't need you
And guess what
I'm having more fun
And now that we're done (we're done)
I'm gonna show you tonight
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine (I'm just fine)
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star (oh)
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight)

No, no
No, no, oh
I don't want you tonight
You weren't there
I'm gonna show you tonight (I'm gonna show you tonight)
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine
And you're a tool
So, so what?
I am a rock star
I got my rock moves
And I don't want you tonight (I don't want you tonight)

Woohoo
Ba, da, da, da, da, da
