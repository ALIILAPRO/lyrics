		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the girls on go getting money on your own
Lemmi see you get low on the floor

I got on my dress, I plan on going in tonight, oh
I'mma give you my best, I was waitin' on you, oh
'Cause when I drop drop drop it down
Everybody gon' see
Are you li li liking now?
All eyes on me
'Cause the way this thing rollin'
And the smoke that you're smokin' feels good, uh-huh

At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun, fun
Hair swinging in the air
Show 'em, show 'em what you working with
At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun, fun
'Cause we don't really care
We don't really care
Girls just wanna have fun

Now see, I got your attention
I'mma play upon it!
Oh
In the club and I'm choosin'
You gon' be that one tonight, oh
'Cause when I drop drop drop it down
Everybody gon' see
Are you li li liking now?
All eyes on me
'Cause the way this thing rollin'
And the smoke that you're smokin' feels good, uh-huh

At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun, fun
Hair swinging in the air
Show 'em, show 'em what you working with
At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun, fun
'Cause we don't really care
We don't really care
Girls just wanna have fun
Girls just wanna have fun

All the girls on go getting money on your own
Lemmi see you get low on the floor
'Cause you got a one-night pass, need more, my glass
Pull me up baby this your song
And if you do it up real big
Ain't worry about
Turnt up, we'll be all night long
Give it to 'em
Give it to 'em

At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun, fun
Hair swinging in the air (swinging in the air)
Show 'em, show 'em what you working with
At the end of the night
Girls just wanna have fun, fun
'Cause we don't really care
We don't really care
Girls just wanna have fun
Girls just wanna have, fun
