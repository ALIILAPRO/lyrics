		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come and take me down
The dark beyond
And take me there
Where I come from

Take me down
To the place where I'll kneel
And let me lay my shadow down
In though the eyes
Of a child's inner me
No pain to heal my bloodied brow

There is no rain
To save this silent town
There is no rain to save at all
There is no place
To save this silent ground
There is no place to save at all

Oh father take me
Unto where I'll lay me down
Oh Hallowed Ground

Oh the sky is falling
And I don't know where my home is now
My Hallowed Ground

Oh and can you take me
For I have tasted Hallowed Ground
Oh all around

Father - oh do you hear me
This pain I will not cry aloud

Father - I know you hear me
My head is bludgeoned but unbowed
