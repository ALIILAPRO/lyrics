		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

Shoppin' in Paris
We gon' go shoppin' in Paris, nigga
They can't even compare us
They can't even compare us, we're rarer niggas
Rarer niggas
I never'd 'magine this shit comin'
This shit comin'
We swimmin' in money, we drownin' in hundreds
I keep a duffle bag on me like Tity Boi and Dolla
Bruh we ain't takin' that weed, oh no
And if they don't love me, fuck whatcha talkin' 'bout
I'm in love with the cash, I put that on my mama and father

Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

Goin' to France
We gon' vacation in France, nigga
Advanced niggas
Can't nobody stop me, I'm past niggas
I'm past my limit
I'm drunk and I'm blowin' a whole lot of gas, nigga
Ten million in cash
Put up in a stash, it's under my mattress
I put the money in the ground like my nigga Frank Luke
Got a turbo Porsche and I don't even move it
I'm back on the green, it's so hard not to use it
I'm continuously winnin', my nigga, I can't see me losin'

Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit certain, ain't none of this certain
Ain't none of us perfect, I hope it was worth it

Ain't none of this promised, ain't none of this promised
Ain't nothin' in life guaranteed, put that on my mama
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this certain, not even one of us perfect
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of this promised
Ain't none of this shit promised, ain't none of this
Ain't none of it promised
Ain't none of this shit, none of this shit, none of this
Ain't none of it promised
I love you, money, I love you, money
I'mma never put a nigga above this money
I'mma wake up and just hug this money
Yeah, yeah
