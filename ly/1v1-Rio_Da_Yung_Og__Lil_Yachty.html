		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Enrgy made this one) what up, Enrgy?
What up, Lil Boat? Shit, alright

I got long money, bitch
Ain't nobody give me shit, I
Got my own money, bitch
Yachty pulled up in the 'Rari
With the chrome on him, bitch
Been spendin' money since the day I
Got ahold of the shit chrome Hearts shirts
AMIRI jeans with the rips in 'em
Gen 5 Glocks, extended clips
Shit'll get ignant
"Rio, why your pop look like that?"
It's a six in it don't be steppin' 'round my
Kitchen by the oven, it's a brick in it
Plain AP on my wrist, it's a brick on me
Damn, she cute and she thick
I'll trick on it
Walkin' through the Valley with
My stick on me
Baby girl, these is not McQueens
These Rick Owens
Wait 'til my bitch daddy go to sleep
Hit a lick on him he soft
Back in the day my daddy took
A half a brick from him
Movin' 'round six cars deep like
It's a hit on me
Hundred round drum on the AR
I'm tryna hit somethin'

I'll march to Flint for a pint of Act'
And as long as it prints
We gon' get the racks
Grindhard E put up them hoes
Call him Midget Mac
I'll really get a nigga gone
This ain't this or that
I ain't tryna argue on no phone
Goin' tit-for tat
My old bitch bad, I love her body
It's tats on her tit used to tote ARs
Now a nigga tote the Sig now
Downtown Detroit, my phone trippin'
Ain't no signal
Used to be a jit but I grew up, yeah
I'm big now my brother bust a wig down
My first crib was a penthouse
On my own, I was eighteen
Boat and Rio, goddamn, we the A-team
And I love this lil' bitch, this bitch Asian
And she never gon' get old, never aging
Puttin' numbers on his head
Like I'm Nick Saban
Like it's 2030, pull up with a ray beam

Opps say they want cancer
Let's have a smoke out
The pop kinda taste nasty
Shoulda poured some more out
Today I got on so much ice
I could've brought my coat out
They like, "Rio the goat
This nigga really brought Lil Boat out"
Told Yachty we might have to run
I got some dope on me
Took him on a high speed in Flint
That shit be fun to me
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you
It's a gun on me
You better have two hundred shots and one
Chop if you come for me
In the crib by myself
Hundred racks keep me company
Bitch, if your credit score ain't high
You ain't touchin' me
Just hit this bitch raw and hit it in her
Now she stuck with me
Niggas bringin' tens and twenties out
I got a buck with me
Bitch, your baby daddy still
Can't fuck with me
Made eighty racks yesterday
But I put up fifty
Yachty pulled up with the hoes
He got a whole tour bus with him
Bitch, I ain't got crabs
Percs and Lortabs got my nuts itchin'

I'm a big tripper no I ain't your BD
I don't wear jeans with several zippers
Twenty-three chains 'round my neck
It's the Big Dipper
VS1 diamonds everywhere, wet like Flipper
Fucked my white bitch so good
She almost said n
Right then and there we almost put
A hole in her liver two up
I seen my brother hit some hoes off Tinder
Fucked up
Pour a six of Wock' in someone else's blender
Bro'nem will serve anybody, no matter gender
Pray I make it up to Heaven
Know I'm a sinner
Pray they never catch me lackin'
You gon' have to hit me where I stand
Ain't no jackin'
Fifty-five hundred dollars cash on my jacket
Fourteen forty-nine charge for my ratchet
