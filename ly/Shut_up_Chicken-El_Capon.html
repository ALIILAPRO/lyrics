		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drinks to the left (uh-huh)
Drinks to the right (what?)
I fall for a girl
And I fall for a guy (yeah)
I like to go in (in)
I like to go out
When I get up (uh)
You better go down

You're leavin' me (what?)
You cheated on me (why?)
Baby, believe in me (come on)
I'm falling for everything
Don't go to sleep
No, I won't let you leave
No-no, no-no need to speak
Shut up, chicken

Shut up, chicken
Hey

Mm-hm, yeah, yeah, uh
Lick those lips
Move those hips
I like chicks with hips
Man, I love all that shit
I don't wanna have to choose
I wanna share my bed with you

So you're leaving me
You cheated on me
Believe in me
I'm falling for everything
Shut up, chicken

Hey
Hey

Yeah
Uh-huh, okay
You know I love them chicks
I wanna hold your hips
Gonna give you a good, good lickin'
Give me the mama of this chicken
Chicken, chicken, chicken, of this chicken

When I get up
You better go down
Up, down, up, down
Up, down, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down
Shut up, chicken

Drinks to the left (uh-huh)
Drinks to the right (what?)
I fall for a girl
And I fall for a guy (yeah)
Drinks to the left (uh-huh)
Drinks to the right (what?)
I fall for a girl
And I fall for a guy
Shut up, chicken
