		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're a black crow in the shadows
Bleak eyes, far too clever
I'm a fly-high, sharp mind
Birds of a feather

You carry yourself like an old man
Your pockets are filled with knives
Any fool wouldn't notice
'Til they're begging for their lives

I won't resist the temptation
I'd fall with you through the dark
Turn my back for a second just to feel
A stab through the heart

You're a black crow in the shadows
Bleak eyes, far too clever
I'm a fly-high, sharp mind
Birds of a feather
You've got a mean grin, all teeth
Stealing every treasure
I've got soft hands, a quick blade
Birds of a feather (feather)

Feather

The alleyways are your playground
And money is your god
Can't count on my fingers
All the churches you've burned

I won't resist the temptation
I'd bloody my hands for you
And if I stay long enough
You might bloody yours too

You're a black crow in the shadows
Bleak eyes, far too clever
I'm a fly-high, sharp mind
Birds of a feather
You've got a mean grin, all teeth
Stealing every treasure
I've got soft hands, a quick blade
Birds of a feather

And even when they catch us
Cornered on all sides
We'll slip through the cracks
Up to the sky, up to the sky
They can throw us in the water
Tie stones to our feet
We'll come crashing up
Let our wings set us free

You're a black crow in the shadows
Bleak eyes, far too clever
I'm a fly-high, sharp mind
Birds of a feather
You've got a mean grin, all teeth
Stealing every treasure
I've got soft hands, a quick blade
Birds of a feather (feather)

Feather
Feather
Ah-ah
Feather
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Feather
