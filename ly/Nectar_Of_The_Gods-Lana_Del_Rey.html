		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

What cruel world is this? Nectar of the Gods
Heroin gold in my veins, you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million
And I just can't stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone
Call again, I wanna talk

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

What sweet world is this? Honey on the vine
School kid dreams came true then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you, now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Ooh, ooh
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like the color blue, ooh-ooh

Californ-i-a, homeland of the Gods
Once I found my way but now I am lost
