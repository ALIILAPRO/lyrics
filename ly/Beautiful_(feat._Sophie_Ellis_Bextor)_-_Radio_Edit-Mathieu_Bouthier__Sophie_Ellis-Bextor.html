		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trust the night is my friend
Repair machine is set in my hand
Escape and show me wonders undefined
Because I need to feel the heat
Here come the better version of me
It's all bout here and now not what's gone by
So come on take my hand let's run towards the light
Something real, something good, something beautiful's inside
And when I feel this way, I know I need to find
Something real, something good, something beautiful and it is hidden in the night
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
It's not enough to wait on the door
It's in the shadows I am reborn
I know I'll find my freedom in the crowd
And my heaven underground
Come with me and run towards the light
Something beautiful must be inside
Show me something wonderful tonight
Some kind of beautiful
To see the light,
(See the light, the light, the light, the light, the light...)
So come on take my hand let's run towards the light
Something real, something good, something beautiful is inside
And when I feel this way, I know I need to find
Something real, something good, something beautiful and it is hidden in the night
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
Lalalalala
