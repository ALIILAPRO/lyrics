		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in a hurry, always late
Haven't been early since '88
Texas is hot, I can be cold
Grandma cried when I pierced my nose
Good in a glass, good on green
Good when you're puttin' your hands all over me

I'm alright with a slow burn
Takin' my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn, yeah

In Tennessee, the sun's goin' down
But in Beijing, they're headin' out to work
You know the bar down the street don't close for an hour
We should take a walk and look at all the flowers

'Cause I'm alright with a slow burn
Takin' my time, let the world turn
I'm gonna do it my way, it'll be alright
If we burn it down and it takes all night
It's a slow burn

Mm, whatever feels good

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Mm

Old soul, waitin' my turn
I know a few things, but I still got a lot to learn

So I'm alright with a slow burn
Slow burn
Slow burn
Mm, I'm alright with a slow burn
