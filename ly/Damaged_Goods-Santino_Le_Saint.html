		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They don't wanna see the beauty in the broken
But I believe there's beauty in the broken
Put that on a tee that's a slogan
Blood on my hands they cut me open
And these scars don't heal like I'm Logan
Put that on a tee that's a slogan

And you saw all of my wrongs and recognized
So you took all of your flaws and married mine
Kintsugi with the pieces, we're gold inside, now
If they wanna call us something
It's misunderstood
They say that it's worthless
We say damaged goods

Under the wire they got the clock up against us
Ticking time bomb
Fuel on the fire we lit the city till it's embers
So they remember
They don't see pleasure in pain
They see the scars
They don't see the picture we painted
'Cause love is art
They don't see the beautiful disaster
They see broken hearts

And you saw all of my wrongs and recognized
So you took all of your flaws and married mine
Kintsugi with the pieces, we're gold inside, now
If they wanna call us something
It's misunderstood
They say that it's worthless
We say damaged goods
