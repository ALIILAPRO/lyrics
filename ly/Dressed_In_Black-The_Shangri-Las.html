		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dressed in black
He walks alone, a shadow in the night
Each time he walks by my window
Can't hold the tears from my eyes
We're so much in love
Why can't they realize

That every time he looks at me
I long to feel his lips on mine
I live on just the memory of him caressing me
So soft, so warm
So soft, so warm

They said he was much to wild for me
They said I didn't know what I was getting myself into
They said a whole lot of things
But there are some things they could never understand
That a girl can tell by the way a boy holds her hand
Or maybe they thought we were too young to be in love this way
Well, I don't care what people say
This girl's love is getting stronger with each passing day

That every time he looks at me
I long to feel his lips on mine
I live on just the memory of him caressing me
So soft, so warm
So soft, so warm

But now he's gone
But now he's gone

I climbed the stairs
I shut the door
I turned the lock
Alone once more
And no one can hear me cry
No one
