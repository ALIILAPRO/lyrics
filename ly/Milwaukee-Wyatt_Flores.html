		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somewhere in Milwaukee
There's snow covering concrete
And I still see you walking away
And I tried to say I'm sorry
That frozen rain kept falling
And I couldn't find the words make you stay

You can hate my eyes for watching you leave
Hate my should have chased you down feet
And not trying to keep you wrapped in my arms
You can hate my hands for letting you go
Hate my lips for kissing yours cold
And hiding all my feelings in the dark
Please don't hate my heart

And I was choked up on that freezing wind
I bit my tongue until it bled
Pulling back the words till my lungs turned blue
And I still see your finger prints
Running 'cross my frost bit skin
All I'm breathing in is the truth

You can hate my eyes for watching you leave
Hate my should have chased you down feet
And not trying to keep you wrapped in my arms
You can hate my hands for letting you go
Hate my lips for kissing yours cold
And hiding all my feelings in the dark
Please don't hate my heart
Please don't hate my heart

You can hate my eyes for watching you leave
Hate my should have chased you down feet
And not trying to keep you wrapped in my arms
You can hate my hands for letting you go
Hate my lips for kissing yours cold
And hiding all my feelings in the dark
Please don't hate my heart
