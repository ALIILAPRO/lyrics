		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I believe in, I believe in love
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah (watch me heal)

Statues in the next room
Billions in escrow (ah)
Bulletproof the whole thing
Ignore the dress code
Step into the ballroom
So hard to let go (ah)
Things that never give life
I can see the echoes

Ridin' through the thunder
Tryna see the summer (it's the echoes that I wait for)
(It's the echoes that I'm made for)
Recognize the restaurant
Reckon gotta let go
Breakin' through the echoes (made for)
Breathin' through the echo (walk)

It's only echoes I escape for (walk, walk)
Only echoes on the return (walk, walk)
Walkin' on the numbers (walk, walk)
Stay the night

It's the let go (walk)
The let go (walk)
The let go (walk)
The let go (walk)
That I wait for (walk)
I'll wait for (walk)
I'll wait for (walk)
I'll wait for you (walk)

Watch you, watch you, watch you get the medical
Listen at your waist to stay hospitable
Infected with your vaccine, they stay critical
Let me vibe with the green eyes (-dom-dom-dom-dom)

The starry nights, they start to fade (come on)
At times, for miles I see your face, yeah
I drive, I drive alone, you wait
Your time, your time, your time, you take
You take

Drivin' reckless through a storm and
'Cause you a breakfast in the mornin'
My nights is abnormal, advice ain't informal
I didn't try to warn before they went and swarmed you
The height we made is paranormal
We shake and wake up to paranoia
Won't let it destroy you, won't let it annoy you
I'm tryna enjoy you in front of the foyer

We can't seem to break through out the logical (ah)
To see it in the day, you gotta free your soul (I'm breakin' through the echoes)
You wanna reign supreme and never let them go
We filmin' live from the kingdom-dom-dom-dom (ah)

Only echoes that I wait for (ah)
Only echo on the return
Walkin' on the numbers (walk, walk)
I find (walk, walk)
It's the echoes that I wait for (walk, walk)
It's the echoes on the return (walk, walk)
Stay the night

It's the let go (walk)
The let go (walk)
The let go (walk)
The let go (walk)
That I wait for (walk)
I'll wait for (walk)
I'll wait for (walk)
I'll wait for you (walk)

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Hey, now, you will report to me
Hey, now, you will report to me
Hey, now
Hey, now, you will report to me (hey, now, you will report to me)
Hey, now
Hey, now, you will report to me
