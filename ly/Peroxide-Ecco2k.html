		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the bus stop, crushing rocks
(Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush)
They all stare at me, I don't care at all
(Oh my God, fuck you)
Everywhere I go, they look at me wrong
(What, what the fuck are you looking at?)
Every day go the same, got to stay strong
(Trust, trust, trust, trust me it gets so much worse)

Something feels so wrong
(Something feels so wrong)
It's the way I look or the way I walk
Why are you scared of me when I'm not so hard?
No peroxide, I stay dark
Don't go around him, you might get robbed
Chop off your body parts (chop, chop, chop)
Chop his arm off and take his watch

(At the bus stop, crushing rocks)
(They all stare at me, I don't care at all)

At the bus stop, crushing rocks
(Crush, crush, crush, crush, crush, crush)
They all stare at me, I don't care at all
(Oh my God, fuck you)
Everywhere I go, they look at me wrong
(What, what the fuck are you looking at?)
Every day go the same, got to stay strong
(Trust, trust, trust, trust me it gets so much worse)

Something feels so wrong
(Something feels so wrong)
It's the way I look or the way I walk
Why are you scared of me when I'm not so hard?
No peroxide, I stay dark
Don't go around him, you might get robbed
Chop off your body parts (chop, chop, chop)
Chop his arm off and take his watch

(At the bus stop, crushing rocks)
(They all stare at me, I don't care at all
