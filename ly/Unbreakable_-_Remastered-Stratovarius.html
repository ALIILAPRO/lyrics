		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reckless wheel of time
We follow how it flies by
We still keep believing
In white and comforting lies

When it's our turn
Together we stay stronger
We lay still and silent
And watch how our world burns for eternity

You carry me away
'Til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait

Reckless wheel of life
We see how years keep flying by
I never really cared
Until I opened my eyes

The final day awaits
And the firestorm's getting closer
Under falling stars
We will seal our fate for eternity

You carry me away
'Til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait 'til the end
Until 'morrow we're unbreakable

You carry me away
'Til 'morrow we're unbreakable
I hold my breath and wait
This moment is unbreakable
I can feel it deep within my heart and my soul
You make me whole
I want to live this second forever
Always together, forevermore

We are stronger than ever
Always together, forevermore
We are stronger than ever
Always together, forevermore
I hold my breath and wait 'til the end
Until 'morrow we're unbreakable
