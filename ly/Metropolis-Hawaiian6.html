		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the seed of
wisdom has picked
Exile from the paradise
And we landed on the history
made of sin
We brought hope and desires
On this world which
the God has made
Countless creation
And the endless destruction
In the end, we build a
metropolis for our glory
Just so easily disconnected
from the chain of Providence
There's a universe inside of us
The life and death
Future and past
Happiness and sadness
It's all there
When I was born,
the small sphere,
it was shining bright and clear
Safely covered with black
veil to save from scars
Only as for it...........
Wall for defense
Wisdom for blame
Castle made just for fame
Lies for weakness
I build my own metropolis
Right on the frock of my heart
On the frock of life
Before I know
With a chain all around

The heart pushed in to the dark
Disconneted chain
Nature is in rage
The sun will shine on madly
the heart is withering
by the sun
A cry quakes the ground
we are standing
Anger of the gods
destroys everything
Wisdom for blame
Castle made just for fame
Lies for weakness
I build my own metropolis
Right on the frock of my heart
On the frock of life
Before I know
With a chain around me
around me
The surface of the ground
Rise to divide my world
The things we have bullt
The roads we have made
They all slowly
crumble with a roar
Collapsing metropolis
Collapsing my metropolis
The earth is now
Raising a grievous wall of pain
Raising a grievous wall of pain
My sphere is now
Rasing a grievous of pain
