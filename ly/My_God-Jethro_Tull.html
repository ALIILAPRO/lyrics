		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People, what have you done
Locked Him in His golden cage
Golden cage
Made Him bend to your religion
Him resurrected from the grave
From the grave

He is the God of nothing 
If that's all that you can see
You are the God of everything
He's inside you and me

So lean upon Him gently
And don't call on Him to save you
From your social graces
And the sins you used waive
You used to waive

The bloody Church of England
In chains of history 
Requests your earthly presence at
The vicarage for tea

And the graven image you know
With His plastic crucifix 
He's got him fixed 
Confuses me as to who and where and why 

As to how he gets his kicks
He gets his kicks
Confessing to the endless sin 
The endless whining sounds
You'll be praying 'til next Thursday to

All the Gods that you can count
