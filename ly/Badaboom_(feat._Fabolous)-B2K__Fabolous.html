		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah 
B2K 
Its B2K ya'll 
Welcome ladies and gentleman (yes) 
To the you got served soundtrack (yeah) 
We bout to do this 
You know how we get down 
Oh yeah, you know that 
Come on, Omarion, hit it 

Like woah 
You know 
Girl you're the star of my show 
In this club 
Poppin bub 
The way you shakin 
Deservin' some dubs 
Turn Around (Turn Around) 
Make it bounce (Make it bounce) 
Shake it like you've come from out of town (Town) 
What's your name (name) 
What's your sign (sign) 
Girl you leavin with me tonight 

[Chorus:]
Mami shake it like you can for me 
You know I like it when you do that little dance for me 
Mami I'm just trying to get you in my room 
And see that big 
Bada bing boom bada boom 
Mami shake it like you can for me 
You know I like it when you do that little dance for me 
Mami I'm just trying to get you in my room 
And see that big 
Bada bing boom bada boom 

This one 
I've seen 
Couldn't believe the ass in them jeans 
To myself (self) 
Had to think (think) 
Any room for me up in them jeans 
Ghetto star (ghetto star) 
You are (you are) 
Eat you up like a chocolate bar (bar) 
What's your name (name) 
What's your sign (sign) 
Damn you got me

[Chorus]

I want to see your bada bing 
Go baba boom 
And my house got a wing with a lotta rooms 
I could do a lot of things 
Get you hot as June 
I want to watch your body swing to the hottest tunes 
I'm tryin to slide behind it 
When you throw it round 
So I can ride and grind it when you slow it down 
Bring it from the top then take it to the bottom 
I'm clingin to your top tryin to make it to your bottom 
The way you move is fabulosa 
It makes me want to grab you closer 
You know I like it when you bounce bounce 
Throw ya hands up when you bounce bounce 
I don't back down 
When I'm pressin ya 
I finna lay you smack down 
Like a wrestler 
But nobody get it to poppin like this man can 
Had them girls get to poppin on handstands 
Ghetto 

[Chorus x2]

B2K...Fab...T Scott...Oh yeah...
Chris Stokes...I see you boy...
Oh yeah, Dave Mack...Lets do this again...TUG
