		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whatever you want, whatever you need
Anything you want done, baby
I'll do it naturally
'Cause I'm every woman (every woman)
It's all in me, it's all in me, yeah!

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally

I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z (whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa)

I can cast a spell, see, but you can't tell
Mix a special brew, put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly I will appear 'cause

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally
(Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa)

I can sense your needs
Like rain unto the seeds
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old-fashioned love
I've got it, I've got it, I've got it, got it, baby baby

I'm every woman, it's all in me
Anything you want done, baby, I'll do it naturally

I'm every woman, it's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one from A to Z (whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa)

I ain't braggin' 'cause I'm the one
You just ask me, ooh, it shall be done
And don't bother to compare, I've got it
(Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa)
(Whoa whoa whoa)

I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
I'm every woman (Chaka Khan), I'm every woman (Chaka Khan)
I'm every woman, I'm every woman
