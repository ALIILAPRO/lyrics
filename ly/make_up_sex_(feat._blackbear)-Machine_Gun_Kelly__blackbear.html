		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay

Screaming when we fuck, screaming when we fight, yeah
Even when I'm drunk, you're my only type, yeah
Please don't break my heart, I know that you might, yeah
(Tell me, tell me now) are you 'bout that life? Yeah

Bonnie and Clyde, ready to die
(Two) gravesites, later tonight
(You) told me to stop waiting
I can feel your back breaking
Face down, laid pipe
(Ooh) waterworks, swim your pool
Backstroke, we both naked
I can see that ass shaking (damn)

Yeah, break up just to make up
You're gone when I wake up
Yeah, break up just to make up
You're gone when I wake up

Yeah
I love chaos, I love toxic
I love wreckage, I love falling
Picture taking, picture cropping
It's hard lately, I'm exhausted
You hate my guts, then you love me
You made me feel so disgusting
Can't stop a runner from running
So, go, go, go
You're my only drug, you're my only vice, yeah
Fight and then we fuck, you're my only type, yeah
Mixin' bad decisions up with one night stands and Hennessy
All I got's this broken heart but you could have the rest of me

Yeah, break up just to make up
You're gone when I wake up
Yeah, break up just to make up
You're gone when I wake up

When you come back, I'll be waiting (I'm missing you)
There's something you're not saying
When you come back, I'll be waiting (is it someone new?)
There's something you're not saying

I'm missing you
Is it someone new?
