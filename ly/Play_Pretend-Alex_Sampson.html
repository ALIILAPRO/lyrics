		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you 'bout someone special 
She's kinda perfect and I wish she knew
Told me that she thinks she has to settle
But I know that ain't true
She used to laugh at all the trouble we got in
Always finding ways to break the rules 
Lately I don't see her smile as often 
I think you know it's you

Don't take this the wrong way 
I want you to be happy 
But it's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 
Spending all of my time
Dancing on this fine line
It's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 

I know you like the back of my hand
I want you more every day and
It's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 

We can talk until three in the morning
The sun'll rise, I never want it to
Feelings for you came without warning
Ever since we met it's only you 

Don't take this the wrong way 
I want you to be happy 
But it's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 
Spending all of my time
Dancing on this fine line
It's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 

I know you like the back of my hand
I want you more every day and
It's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 
All you gotta do is let me be your man
Got a hold on me like quick sand 
It's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend 

Don't take this the wrong way 
I want you to be happy 
But it's hard to watch you fall again 
'Cause now I gotta play pretend
