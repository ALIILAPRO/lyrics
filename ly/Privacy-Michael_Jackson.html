		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't the pictures enough? Why do you go through so much
To get the story you need, so you can bury me?
You've got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose the man I really am
You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be?
'Cause you cameras can't control, the minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get your story sold

I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
So paparazzi (yeah yeah)
Get away from me (yeah yeah), just get away from me

Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die
To get the message across, that yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away
She get no second chance, she's ridiculed and harassed
Please tell me why
Now there's a lesson to learn
Respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
So paparazzi (yeah yeah)
Just get away from me (yeah yeah)
Just get away from me, Slash!

Now there's a lesson to learn
Stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity

I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
So paparazzi (yeah yeah)
Get away from me (yeah yeah)

I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
I need my privacy (yeah yeah)
So paparazzi (yeah yeah)
Just get away from me (yeah yeah)

Privacy, I need my privacy
Privacy, paparazzi
Privacy, I need my privacy
Privacy, get away from me
Privacy, yeah

Why'd you do it?
Please don't do it
Why'd you do it?
Can you just let it?
Please don't do it
Why'd you do it?
'Cause you just let it, hah
