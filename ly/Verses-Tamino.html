		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday I was a word, left with no voice to speak it
Now I am a happy song, placed on the lips of a woman
In her presence I light up, as the earth under the sun
By her sound my verses flow, please don't you ever stop singing

Now she has me under her skirt
Lies down with me into our world
Where all I have heard sounds anew
And all I am worth depends on you

Come babe, let love have this evening
Come babe, let love have this evening

Life was not aware of me and I wasn't aware of life
Now its flames, they warm my heart
They light the path towards her

Where she has me under her skirt
Where she tells me

Come babe, let love have this evening
Come babe, let love have this evening
Come babe, let love have this evening
Come babe, let love have this evening
