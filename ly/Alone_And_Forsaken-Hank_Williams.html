		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We met in the springtime when blossoms unfold
The pastures were green and the meadows were gold
Our love was in flower as summer grew on
Her love, like the leaves, now have withered and gone

The roses have faded, there's frost at my door
The birds in the morning don't sing anymore
The grass in the valley is starting to die
And out in the darkness the whippoorwills cry

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me, please hold a my hand
Oh, please understand

Oh, where has she gone to? Oh, where can she be?
She may have forsaken some other like me
She promised to honor, to love and obey
Each vow was a plaything that she threw away

The darkness is falling, the sky has turned gray
A hound in the distance is starting to bay
I wonder, I wonder, what she's thinking of
Forsaken, forgotten, without any love

Alone and forsaken by fate and by man
Oh, Lord, if You hear me, please hold a my hand
Oh, please understand
