		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Still that loner 
Scared kid peaking glances 
Dazed on a shady Street 
And now they’re coming near me 

And I’m paranoid I'll get murdered and die forever and ever 
My heart pounds 
You’re just bored and hostile too 
If we’re eccentric you’re the Radar 

Save
I'm all alone always have been 
All I have’s this hope 
Save
I could be so much more than just 
Just a Number Baby 
Get away and get these icky feelings off of me 
Save
I'm all alone always have been 
All I have’s this hope 

Not gonna lie 
I’m border-lining Psychosis 
It's a brutal Neurosis 
Facing laughing crying Voices 

And I’m paranoid that you’ll see me for what I am underneath 
I feel like there’s a set of invisible Eyes 
Always staring always watching 

Save
I'm all alone always have been 
All I have’s this hope 
Save
I could be so much more than just 
Just a Number Baby 
Get away and get these icky Feelings off of me 
Save
I'm all alone always have been 
All I have’s this hope 

After so many letdowns 
I just keep to myself now
They’re always watching me they’re always watching me 
They WATCH 

Save
I'm all alone always have been 
All I have’s this hope 
Save
I could be so much more than just 
Just a Number Baby 
Get away and get these icky feelings off of me 
(I'm all alone always I'm all alone always)
Save
I'm all alone always have been 
(Save me now)
All I have’s this hope
