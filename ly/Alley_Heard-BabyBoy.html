		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright speed it up
Alright slow it down
Alright let me out
I got like fifty rounds (like fifty)
Like wtf is that?!?
Boy that's that choppa sound (clap clap clap clap clap)
Alley heard was (clap clap clap clap clap)
Hop out and we (clap clap clap clap clap)
Hand around her throat and i just (clap clap clap clap clap)
All they heard was (clap clap clap clap clap)
Hop out wit chop n bully gang
Trackhawk n chops make bullets rain
I feel like lud i let off foe (four)
See he play crazy, i'm insane
Can't leave the house without my blick
Like a vamp without vangs
That's like a angel without wings
Like saying bully without gang
I just hit a hoe
Went to the bathroom threw the gang up
All on ig like you that, bitch you done let the gang fuck
I swear my opps ain't got no aim
They hit straight legs it's never up
Got my heart broke in 8th grade
Can't give you that but we can fuck
Chain hit like tyson behind tint she hit me
What's the move tonight?
Need that drop, you send it through
Then we got shit to do tonight
Alright,
Ain't shit to prove that's right
But they got shit to lose tonight
Kiss on yo neck, i'm in yo ear
You like you finna lose it, right?
I know your ex ain't do it right
You been fucked up since I dropped pipe
You tell your friends I fuck you crazy
Neighbors must know my name at night
Hand around yo throat I break yo back
Like that's your favorite treatment
Right?
We switch positions you on top
You ride me like a motorbike
Alright speed it up
Alright slow it down
Alright let me out
I got like fifty rounds (like fifty)
Like wtf is that?!?
Boy that's that choppa sound (clow clow clow clow clow)
Alley heard was (clap clap clap clap clap)
Hop out and we (clap clap clap clap clap)
Hand around her throat and i just (clap clap clap clap clap)
All they heard was (clap clap clap clap clap)
