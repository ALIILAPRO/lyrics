		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been tryin' hard to find the words to say (find the words to say)
If we tried again, we'd make the same mistakes (ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah)

Asphyxiated (asphyxiated) 
I'll never make it (I'll never make it)
Without my baby, ooh-oh, ooh-oh
So I fill the void, I know you do the same 
Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

Nothing compares to the emptiness we both share 
And nobody cares like you do (ooh yeah)
You ask for my heart, but I didn't know where to start (oh, oh no)
But they don't think of you like I do (ooh, ooh)

I try my best to not get high again (oh baby, I can't get high again)
But I've been stuck inside this place for days on end (la-da-da-da-da-da-da)

Intoxicated (intoxicated) 
I'll never make it (I'll never make it)
Without my baby, oh, ooh-oh, ooh
So I fill the void just like I did back then 
Oh, ooh-ooh, oh, oh, oh

Nothing compares to the emptiness we both share (no, no, no)
Nobody cares like you do (like you do, ooh yeah)
You ask for my heart (heart) 
But I didn't know where to start (no, no, no, ooh, oh)
But they don't think of you like I do (ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah)

I've seen darker days, tryna keep my faith (oh)
I sin too much to pray for you (for you)
Even when it's great (oh), I still walk away (oh)
I couldn't even change for you (for you, you)
If you're the air I need, I'm dying just to breathe
I hope that you're not dying too (oh, I do)
Tryna keep my faith (oh)
I sin too much to pray for you, hey

Nothing compares to the emptiness we both share (nothing compares, baby)
Nobody cares (nobody) like you do (nobody, oh)
You ask for my heart (you ask for my heart)
But I didn't know where to start (know where to start)
But they don't think of you like I do
Oh, oh, yeah
