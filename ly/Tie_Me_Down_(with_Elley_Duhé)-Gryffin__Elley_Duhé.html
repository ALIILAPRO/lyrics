		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't lie, I know you've been thinking it
And two times, you let it slip from your lips
You've got too much pride to make any promises
Thinking that we got time, and you want to keep it in

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Prayin' to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

Nine lives until you fall at my feet
Don't hide, you're wasting your energy
You're not shy, so baby, it's useless
So don't try, 'cause you'll end up losin' it

I want you out in the pouring rain
I want you down on your knees
Prayin' to God that I feel the same
I'm right here, baby, so please

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down
And it's been eatin' me alive
You can take me home
You can never let me go
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

So wrap your arms around my chest
And I'll put my hands around your neck
'Cause nobody wins these waiting games
You push and you pull, but you should stay
Stay

Hold me up, tie me down
'Cause I never wanna leave your side
Swear to never let you down (never let you down)
And it's been eatin' me alive (oh)
You can take me home
You can never let me go (never let me go)
Hold me up, hold me up

And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down
And tie me, tie me down, down (down)
And tie me, tie me down, down

Down, down
