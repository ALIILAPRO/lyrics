		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, the party

This is that original, this has no identical
You can't hack my digital, future aboriginal
Get up off my genitals, I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals, call me verbal criminal
Send you to that clinical, subscribe use of chemicals
Audio and visual, can't see me, invisible
I'm old school like biblical, futuristic next level
Never on that typical, will I stop? Oh never, no

I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
You can't stop us now
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Even if wanna to, you can't stop us now

Don't stop the party

Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party

You could call me crazy man, everyday I'm partyin'
You could find me at the club, poppin' bottles minglin'
Ladies dancin' to the jam, actin' naughty, man oh man
Got me in the mood again, afterparty partyin'
Yeah I keep it happenin', takin shots whatever man
Party like a veteran, music is my medicine
You won't find me settlin, can't be stopped I'm steppin' in
Keep it goin 'til the end, yeah that's right here we go again

I'm that one that lights it up, we red hot like firetrucks
Burn that book cause that's whassup, tell that DJ turn it up
We droppin', that music, for people all around
Keep rockin', head knockin', cause they can't shut us down

Ain't ain't no stoppin'
We gonna keep on rockin'
Baby ain't no stoppin'
You can't a stop us now

I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it
You can't stop us now
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it
Even if wanna to, you can't stop us now

Don't stop the party

Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Stop, stop, stop
The, the, the, don't stop the party
