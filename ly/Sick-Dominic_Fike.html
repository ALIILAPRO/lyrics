		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, you get so high
If I could be there for you
And still come down
I wouldn't even try

'Cause you make me (sick)
And I make you (sick)
And we can't be (friends)
'Cause I'm still in (love)

Blame it on you
Blame it on you

Oh, the when she used to dance when the music turned up
And the place she'd take your hands just to pull her shirt down (yeah)
Okay but oh, I hate the tone that she takes when she goes out on a vacation
She goes out all of the time, oh, how did she get so high?

'Cause you make me (sick)
And I make you (sick)
And we can't be (friends)
'Cause I'm still in (love)

Blame it on you
Blame it on you

Okay, one, two, three
I know that everybody has their thing
Yours was to try to take half of me
I was heavier before I met you
Four, five, six
Blood lost, you know how to get under my skin
Love clots, I know that it went over your head
I was heavier before I

'Cause you make me (sick)
And I make you (sick)
And we can't be (friends)
'Cause I'm still in (love)

Blame it on you
Blame it on you
Blame it on you
Blame it on you

Oh, you look so tired
If I could sleep there for you
I'd leave your side
In the middle of the night
'Cause you make me
And I make you
And we can't be friends
'Cause I'm still in love with you
But I hate all your features
And I wish I didn't meet you
You make me sick
