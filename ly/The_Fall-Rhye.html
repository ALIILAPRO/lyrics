		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh make love to me
One more time
Before you go away
Why can't you stay?

Ooh, my love
Come home to me
Just for a while
I'll leave this place and you
Why can't you stay?

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't ruin this heart of mine
The sun is gone
It fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
Don't run away
Oh oh

There should be words
There should be words that explain the way
But I'm tongue tied and twisted
(Where's those words?)

Don't run away
Don't slip away my dear
