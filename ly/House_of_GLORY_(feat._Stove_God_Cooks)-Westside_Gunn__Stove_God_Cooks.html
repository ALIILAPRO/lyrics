		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why you mad? (Why you mad at me?)
Broke nigga why you mad?
Chopper out the window, chopper out the window (brrt, ba-ba, cha)

You don't know my expenses
I gotta buy bigger plates
And bigger scales
And more bags
What you mad for?
We put them digi' numbers on the dashboard
Took her to the top from the trap floor, I'm that raw
Had the feds at the front and the backdoor

Broke nigga why you mad? (Nigga, why you mad?)
Why you mad?
Chopper out the window (brrt, ba-ba-ba, brrt, ba)
Chopper out the window (ah)

Foggy glass pots and TEC beams
I'm Jesus with the recipe
I'm everything they dying to be
Half a million cash is Ecstasy
Bullet holes in the Lexus, see (brrt, ba-ba-ba)
He had some tricks up his Avirex sleeve
This shit is wrecked for me
Reach for my necklace and see (woo)
One burner don't work good but we still cooking
One bad brick don't stop no show, we still cookin' (still cookin')
My Grandaddy told me you'd get back with your puddin'
My wrist say I get back way more, and I got
20 of 'em come then and they paid for
Fuck is we playin' for? You know what you payin' for
Fuck is we waitin' for?
What would I weigh 'em for for?
It's all good and if it ain't all good, nigga, I'm all good

Baby why you leave me
I only fucked her a hunnid times
But I love you
Ayo, It was like 1989
I seen Lou wavey with the AK (ah)
He said it was the first, it was a payday
Told him peace
Seen Emillio walk across the street
He said, "Peace, lord" (peace, lord)
He 'bout to meet Prada for a drink
Denim Tears falling down my face
Word to Mugula (ah)
Crack 'cause my shit that dope, they can't fuck with us
Sent Chanel 500 dollar plates, she in the county
She pulled up on Tiffany, shot out the Audi (brrt, skrrt)
Another Palm Angel gsng new wings (new wings)
Valentino down to my shoe strings (shoe strings)
Me in Vera Wang, that's my boo thang (that's my boo thang)
She used to fuck Van Cleef
Went through, sprayed that nigga, shit, that's on me
Came through, Fendi moccasins with the big F (ah)
Fucked her one time, put Lorraine on that bitch neck (woo)
Vogue mink cover, got the Mac while I'm posing
Your third eye closed
Stupid nigga, I'm chosen
F.p.journe 'bout as wet as the ocean (woo)
Briefcase Goyard, snake on my loafers (mm)
Nigga I'm culture
Down in the A's, Gucci gloves with the poker (ah)
Had Celine have us brunch, sipping Momosas
Niggas like, "how this nigga house like the Moma?"
Long live Virgil, got the chains on the Mona (mm)
Long live Michelle when I come scoot over (I'll be)
