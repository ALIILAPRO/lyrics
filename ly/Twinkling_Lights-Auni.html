		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's frost in the air
But there's home in your eyes
And everything is still
But the twinkling lights
The shopfronts are cozy
And faces aglow
As we watch two angels kiss
In the fresh-fallen snow
A warm mug of chocolate
A sweet wagging tail
Let's carve some gingerbread men
Out of cookie dough
You've never looked so charming
With flour on your nose
Won't you join me for a dance
By the fire as it grows
Now come lay beside me
Here under the tree
And watch the colors blinking
So merrily
But make one good wish
Before you're asleep
You never know what awaits you
Tonight in your dreams
