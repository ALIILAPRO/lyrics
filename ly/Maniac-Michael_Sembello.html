		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Looking for the fight of her life
In the real time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy

Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She had danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes a fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

On the ice blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard won place of mystery
Touch it but can't hold it

You work all your life, for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push shove world
But there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night

There's a cold connective heat
Struggling stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes a fire
On the wire between will and what will be

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

She's a maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

Maniac, maniac I sure know
And she's dancing like she's
