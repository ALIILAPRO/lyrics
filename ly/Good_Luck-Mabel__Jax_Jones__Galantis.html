		  Oh, nothing
I was just saying nobody got it
Guess I'm in the wrong room

Boys are so wild
They think the grass is greener than they realize, oh
Girl, it's alright
No, you don't really need him wasting your time, your time (that's right)

Try to upgrade you, he must be out his mind
He can play his games but that don't make him wise
'Cause a woman like you, he never could replace
Kill that boy with kindness, hey girl, you should say
You should say (you should say, you should say, you should say)
Oh, you should say (you should say, you should say)

Yeah, one, two, three

(Good luck)
Going 'round the world
Chasing other girls
Thinking you'll find better, baby

(Good luck)
Looking for that touch
Can't replace real love
Thinking you'll find better, baby
(Good luck)

Boy, you've been 'round the world
Loving on other girls
But you won't ever find a love like mine, a love like (good luck)
Boy, you thought I was hurt
To see you with other girls
But I know you'll never find a love like mine, a love like (good luck)

Ah (yeah)

Hell no
You found out he was creeping on the down low (down low)
So he gon' see the back of you when you walk
That's when you know he's gotten way too comfortable, comfortable (that's right)

Tried to upgrade you, he must've bumped his head
He can play his games, but girl, did he forget
That a woman like you, he never could replace
Kill that boy with kindness, hey girl, you should say
You should say (you should say, you should say, you should say)
Oh, you should say (you should say, you should say)

Yeah, one, two, three

(Good luck)
Going 'round the world
Chasing other girls
Thinking you'll find better, baby

(Good luck)
Looking for that touch
Can't replace real love
Thinking you'll find better, baby
(Good luck)

Boy, you've been 'round the world
Loving on other girls
But you will never find a love like mine, a love like (good luck)
Boy, you thought I was hurt
To see you with other girls
But I know you'll never find a love like mine, a love like (good luck)

Ah, no, no, you'll never (good luck)
A love like mine, a love like
Ah, no, no, you'll never (good luck)
A love like mine, a love like

He ain't worth the drama (ah, ah)
In due time he'll get his karma (he'll get his karma)
You gon' found your happy ever after
But he won't find better
So wish him (good luck)
Girl, he won't find better
So wish him (good luck)

Yeah, one, two, three

(Good luck)
Going 'round the world
Chasing other girls
Thinking you'll find better, baby (better baby, oh)

(Good luck)
Looking for that touch
Can't replace real love
Thinking you'll find better, baby
(Good luck)

Ah, no, you'll never (good luck)
A love like mine, a love like
Ah, no, no, see you will never (good luck)
Thinking you'll find better, baby
(Good luck)
