		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird, 'bout it now

Words hung above, but never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me love when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

Had no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is gone with you now
Then when I met you my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is gone with you now

Dragging along, following your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn

I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now

I was housed by your warmth, thus transformed
By your grounded and giving and darkening scorn
Remember me love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn
