		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Twenty-twelve, had it made 
Famous on the web, bein' stupid, gettin' paid 
Pony on the cover, that's my money 
Cutie mark on my, everybody love me 

Took it to 30k subs 
They can't do it like I does 
Awkward but they give me love 
TikTok I stay blowing up 
Entropy, let's switch it up, go

I'm sittin' here in the sunshine 
This place is not mine 
And all is not fine 
Like, where is all my corruption? 
I need destruction to make me feel okay 

Did I get lost along the way
Playing nice like they wanted me to be? 
No, I will not smile to make your day
I just wanna cause a little entropy 
You tried so hard to make a hero out of me 
But there are some rules I don't obey 
And I just wanna cause a little entropy 

You tried so hard to make a hero out of me
But there are some rules I don't obey 
And I just wanna cause a little entropy
Well, I've got no good intention 
The fourth dimension is my own mansion 
It's all messed up, I don't care 
'Cause what fun is there in ever making sense? 

Did I get lost along the way 
Lose my mind for a new identity? 
I quite enjoy ruining your day 
And I just wanna cause a little entropy
You tried so hard to make a hero outta me 
But there are some rules I don't obey 
And I just wanna cause a little chaos and entropy

You tried so hard to make a hero out of me
But there are some rules I don't obey 
And I just wanna cause a little entropy

This old heart was never warm
Don't you know you can't reform 
What was already so real 
So you can try to change my ways for the rest of all your days 
But I can't change the way I feel... 

Did I get lost along the way 
Lose my mind for a new identity? 
I quite enjoy ruining your day 
And I just wanna cause a little entropy
You tried so hard to make a hero outta me 
But there are some rules I don't obey 
And I just wanna cause a little chaos and entropy

You tried so hard to make a hero out of me
But there are some rules I don't obey 
And I just wanna cause a little entropy
