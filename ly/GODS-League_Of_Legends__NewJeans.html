		  Go-go-go-go-go-Gods
Go-go-go-go-go-Gods

Ayy, this is what you came for
Blood on the game ball
Everybody dropping like rainfall
(Uh) this is your moment
Eyes on the pulpit, kid
Think church just opened

And they're singing your praises, la-la-la
Screaming your name out la-la-loud
One more step, you're immortal now
'Cause

Once you play God
Once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun 
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Baby, we're

Go-go-go-go-go-Gods
Yeah, we're
Go-go-go-go-go-Gods

Ayy, welcome to the big show
Next on the ladder
Is it your name in the rafter?
Brief (brief, brief) moment of silence
Bad girl woke up and chose violence

And they're singing my praises, la-la-la
Screaming my name out la-la-loud
This is why we're immortal now
'Cause

Once you play God
Once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one (crumble one by one)
Then we gon' ride right into the sun 
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Baby, we're

Go-go-go-go-go-Gods
Yeah, we're
Go-go-go-go-go-Gods

(Go-go-go-)
(Go-go-go-)
(Go-go-go-go-go-Gods)

I'm on my knees, pray for glory
Will anyone read this underdog story?
I can't lose myself again
Help me raise this heart
Heart, unbreakable

Once you play God
Once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun 
Like it's the day my kingdom come

Once you play God
Once you play God
They're gonna crumble one by one
Then we gon' ride right into the sun 
Like it's the day my kingdom come
Baby, we're

Go-go-go-go-go-Gods
Yeah, we're
Go-go-go-go-go-Gods
Go-go-go-go-go-Gods
Yeah, we're
Go-go-go-go-go-Gods

Once you play
