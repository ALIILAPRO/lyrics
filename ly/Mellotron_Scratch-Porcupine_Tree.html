		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A tiny flame inside my head
A compromise I never planned
Unravel out the finest trends

And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should have filled it up with words somehow

I whispered something in her ear
I bare my soul but she don't hear

The scratching of a mellotron
It always seemed to make her cry
Well, maybe she remembers us 
Collecting space up in the sky

The scratching of a mellotron (nothing rises from my feet of clay)
(But it's ok)
It always seemed to make her cry (red mist spreads across my fingertips)
(Ardour slips)

I lay her gently on my clove
She will leave me, yes, I know

And I'm looking at a blank page now
Should have filled it up with words somehow

The scratching of a mellotron
It always seemed to make her cry
Well, maybe she remembers us 
Collecting space up in the sky

The scratching of a mellotron (nothing rises from my feet of clay)
(But it's ok) 
It always seemed to make her cry (red mist spreads across my fingertips)
(Ardour slips)
Well, maybe she remembers us (nothing rises from my feet of clay)
(But it's ok)
Collecting space up in the sky (red mist spreads across my fingertips)
(Ardour slips)

Don't look back into black
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down
Don't look back into black
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down
Don't look back into black (to end as friends)
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down (so painful)
Don't look back into black (to end as friends)
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down (so painful)
Don't look back into black (don't look down, shut it down)
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down (don't look down, shut it down)
Don't look back into black (don't look down, shut it down)
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down (don't look down, shut it down)
Don't look back into black (don't look down, shut it down)
Don't let the memory or the sound drag you down (don't look down, shut it down)
