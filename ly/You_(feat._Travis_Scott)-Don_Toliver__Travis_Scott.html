		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's crazy

You couldn't get any better, baby (ooh, ooh)
Your lips taste like candy cane, do tell (ooh, ooh, ooh)
You're my baby (yeah)
So amazin', when I'm goin' in it
Please don't make me think of it
Like a game with a defect (yeah)
You talk to me dirty, I'm talkin' back like a reflex (oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
I know you love to play games (ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh), but it ain't no recess
Around my town, they know my name (ah, ah, ah), I put it on Jesus
I booked your plane to come my way
I gotta meet ya
Starrin' in my musical, without no feature
Do me a favor (do me a favor), and call a nigga back (a nigga)
I can't contain ya (I can't cont-)
'Cause you've been in your bag (you been in your)
And hop in your safe (hop in your)
I'll make sure that you're bad (Ooh, ooh)
You ain't different (you ain't), I'll make sure you know that you're mine
I (I), baby, don't lie (ooh, ooh)
You ain't doin' alright (I)
You ain't different, you

You ain't different, think of throwin' back
Back, back (woo)
You ain't doin' alright
Back
You ain't different, you

Before I break up out this place, take a eighth, and levitate
A lil' brown skin hurricane, a bay-bay, bring the wave
TBA for the time and the space, lock the day
Know you like to coordinate
Know it's good, see the hood in your face
Know you like to ride the wood, wanna see you do it like we in the H
Body good, body great
Below the waist, real estate
Know you like to ride the wood, wanna see you do it like we in the H

Please, don't make me think of it
Like you can't make a difference (difference, difference)
You talk to me dirty, I'm talking back like a reflex 
(Talkin' back like a-, like a-, talkin' back like a-, like a-)
I know you love to play games, but it ain't no recess (recess, recess)
Around my town, they knowin' my name, I put it on Jesus (Jesus, Jesus)
