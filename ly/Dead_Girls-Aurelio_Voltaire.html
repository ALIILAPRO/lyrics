		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have been in this line of work for a long time
And I have never seen anything so strange and so peculiar
Its all so deranged
See for yourself

Ladies and gentelmen of the jury
Step right up and see the freak
We caught him red handed down by the morgue 
Where he sleeps 

And if you think that "That's disgusting"
Wait til you hear this
I never can do it justice

Dead girls like me
Dead girls like me
Can't you see?

I don't expect you to understand me
I'm not an ordinary man
And I have seen things with these eyes 
You'd never comprehend

See for yourself now
Take those living women 
They have never shown me any kindness of any kind
Its not my fault I look this way

I try to talk to them
They look at me and walk away
So really is it so strange that

Dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls like me

Oh, dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls don't walk away from me
Sad as it seems

Have you ever tasted love like this?
Cool and smooth have you ever been accepted unconditionaly?
Have you ever loved someone who didn't hurt you, didn't harm you?

There's no pain and there's no pressure
No humiliation
There's no fear and there's no shame
There's no pulse now is it so strange?

Dead girls like me
Can't you see?
Only dead girls like me
Oh, dead girls like me

Can't you see?
Only dead girls don't walk away from me
Sad as it seems
