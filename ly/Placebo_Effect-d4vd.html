		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Days go by
So rapidly
Oh, won't you comfort me
I know what we had
It was make believe, oh
A placebo
I can't take a loss like that again
I'd rather float off in the wind
But maybe this is how it's supposed to be
I guess we'll see

On the other side
Where the grass seems to be greener
On the other side
Where my rib cage could be cleaner
On the other side
Where the light will not go out
Oh, on the other side
The other side

Take my time
Please stop rushing me
For company
I can't figure it out
I need you here but you're not near
I can't
I can't
I can't
I can't
Remember what was a dream
Or a memory
Love isn't real
Not to me

Not to me
Oh, oh, oh oh
It was make believe
Oh, a placebo
