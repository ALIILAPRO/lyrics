		  Midnight Stroll (Dead Man's Stroll)
(Thomas Coman, Michael Guerra, William Jackson)

Just got off from work, it was awful late.
I had to pass the cemetery gate.
The sky was dark, and the moon was bright.
It was a very, very cold, cold night.
I never thought I could see such a sight -
A poor soul doing the Dead Man's Stroll.

Dressed in a top hat, cane and all,
Must have been going to a dead man's ball.
May not believe it but it has to be told:
A poor soul doing the Dead Man's Stroll.

[Insane laughter]

Nodded his head, with a finger he led.
I wasn't sure there was nothing to dread.
We went on for miles and miles,
Just before I realized
The time had passed when I was cold,
I was now doing the Dead Man's Stroll.
