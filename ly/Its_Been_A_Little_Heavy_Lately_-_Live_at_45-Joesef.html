		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess you can say I'm totally fucked up

Where'd you go?
I just want to look in your eyes
Caught up in your fever dream
The hate between us making me high
Where'd you go?
All I got is you on my mind
Coming up easy
Don't care if she sees me
I need you tonight

You know I've been fucked up, crazy
It's been a little heavy lately
But you're the only one who could save me
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Why is it my heart is open
Only when the red lights glowing?
But I'll be yours until the morning
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair

Where'd you go?
I've been looking for you all night
Kissing in the alley way
Your misses is still dancing inside
Where'd you go?
Can you feel the drip in the lies?
I'm coming up easy 
Don't care if she sees me
I need you tonight

You know I've been fucked up, crazy
It's been a little heavy lately
But you're the only one who could save me
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Why is it my heart is open
Only when the red lights glowing?
But I'll be yours until the morning
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair

Wonder why you're acting surprised
'Cause when you kiss her 
You know somethings missing 
You know that it feels different with me
I guess it must be hard for a guy 
To look her in the eye 
When it's me whose giving you what you need 

You know I've been fucked up, crazy
It's been a little heavy lately
But you're the only one who could save me
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Why is it my heart is open
Only when the red lights glowing?
But I'll be yours until the morning
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
