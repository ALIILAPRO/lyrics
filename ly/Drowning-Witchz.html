		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been getting trippy thoughts
Thoughts
Thoughts
Thoughts
Thoughts
In my mind today
Is my mind ok
Suicidal thoughts
Thoughts
Thoughts
Thoughts
Thoughts
When I lie awake
But you know ill stay

Were drowning in the heartbeat of life
I been blind
And my lights been fading
Chains of time
Im your slave
In this fight were facing

Were drowning

They'll hang you on a Cross
Cross
Cross
Cross
Cross
For the way you pray
Help us God we're grey

Were drowning in the heartbeat of life
I been blind
And my lights been fading
Chains of time
Im your slave
In this fight were facing

Were drowning

Were drowning in the heartbeat of life
I been blind
And my lights been fading
Chains of time
Im your slave
In this fight were facing

Were drowning in the heart
