		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She told me that she loved me by the water fountain
She told me that she loved me and she didn't love him
And that was really lovely 'cause it was innocent
But now she's got a cup with something else in it
It's getting kind of blurry at a quarter-past-ten
And he was in a hurry to be touching her skin
She's feeling kind of dirty when she's dancing with him
Forgetting what she told me by the water fountain

Now he's grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And she knows that she shouldn't listen
And that she should be with me by the water fountain

She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone, but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love too young
I was too young

Too young, too young
Too young, young

And if she ever goes back to the water fountain
The handle will be broken and the rust set in
But my hand, it will be open and I'll try to fix it
My heart, it will be open and I'll try to give it

Now I'm grabbing her hips, and pulling her in
Kissing her lips, and whispering in her ear
And I know that it's only a wish
And that we're not standing by the water fountain

Too young, too young
Too young, young

She couldn't be at home in the night time because
It made her feel alone but at that time she was too young
I was too young
I should've built a home with a fountain for us
The moment that she told me that she was in love too young
I was too young

Too young, too young
Too young, young

(Too young) I should've built a home with a fountain for us
(Too young) the moment that she told me that she was in love
(Too young) too young
(Young) I was too young
