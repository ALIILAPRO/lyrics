		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We like to sleep all day, and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
Hands up, King-King-Kingston
Let's go

It's revolution, yeah
Ain't no time for seclusion, yeah
Come on and put a bottle in your hand, go 'til you can't stand
And just rock it, rock it, rock it, whoa

So much confusion, yeah
'Cause everybody's losing it
It's feeling like a festival tonight with them flashing lights
And we rock it, rock it, rock it, whoa

And we don't got a worry in sight and until it gets bright outside
We breakin' all the rules that we know
We outta control, we rock and we roll
Ain't nothing gonna ever stop the party, you know we go, we all

We like to sleep all day and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
So come on, come on, come on

We like to sleep all day and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
So come on, come on, come on, let's party tonight

Intoxication, yeah
The feel of liberation, yeah
We goin' like a rebel with a cause and we breakin' the laws
And we rock it, rock it, rock it, whoa

No hibernation, no
No, not until the day comes, no
We gonna paint the town red 'til God knows when
'Cause we rock it, whoa

And we don't got a worry in sight and until it gets bright outside
We breakin' all the rules that we know
We outta control, we rock and we roll
Ain't nothing gonna ever stop the party, you know we go, we all

We like to sleep all day and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
So come on, come on, come on

We like to sleep all day and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
So come on, come on, come on

We gonna rock until the night is done
We ain't gonna stop until we see the sun
And we don't ever have a problem, no need for solutions
We starting up a revolution

We like to sleep all day and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
So come on, come on, come on

We like to sleep all day and party all night
This is how we like to live our life
I got a feeling everything is gonna be alright
So come on, come on, come on

Let's party tonight, whoa
