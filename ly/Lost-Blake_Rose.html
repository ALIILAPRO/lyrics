		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Coming in off a late night
But I got no one to lay by
Yeah, what I would do just to kill the light
Telling me I've got to call
But living without you don't feel right
From the seventy five plan to day bright
To the cigarettes under the midnights
Yeah, maybe it won't hurt to call

Oh, yeah, you gotta, you gotta
You gotta admit we were so dumb, so dumb
And oh, no, baby, how did we, how did we
How did we manage to mess this up, mess this up?

I'm wide awake missing your face
Missing your taste, wishing you were lost with me
Now I'm driving your way in the middle of the rain
Wishing you were close to me
And no, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna say, "Remember what we used to be?"
'Cause I don't wanna live that way
So tell me that it's not too late

Pulling up on the 1-5
Trying to get you off my mind
Been telling myself that it's a waste of time
But maybe I'm dumb not to call
'Cause, baby, living without you ain't right
From stumbling home after midnight
To seeing the same films a hundred times
Yeah, maybe it won't hurt to call

Oh, yeah, you gotta, you gotta
You gotta admit we were so dumb, so dumb
And oh no, baby, how did we, how did we
How did we manage to mess this up, mess this up?

I'm wide awake missing your face
Missing your taste, wishing you were lost with me
Now I'm driving your way in the middle of the rain
Wishing you were close to me
No, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna say, "Remember what we used to be?"
'Cause I don't wanna live that way
So tell me that it's not too late

So lost for you, so lost for you
So lost for you, just tell me that it's not too late
So lost for you, so lost for you
So lost for you, just tell me that it's not too late

I'm wide awake missing your face
Missing your taste, wishing you were lost with me
Now I'm driving your way in the middle of the rain
Wishing you were close to me
No, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna say, "Remember what we used to be?"
'Cause I don't wanna live that way
So tell me that it's not one big mistake

Missing your face
Missing your taste, wishing you were lost with me
Now I'm driving your way in the middle of the rain
Wishing you were close to me
No, I don't wanna wait
I don't wanna say, "Remember what we used to be?"
'Cause I don't wanna live that way
So tell me that it's not too late

So lost for you, so lost for you
So lost for you, just tell me that it's not too late
So lost for you, so lost for you
So lost for you, so tell me that it's not too late
