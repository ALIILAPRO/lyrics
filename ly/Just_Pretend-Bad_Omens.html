		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not afraid of the war you've come to wage against my sins
I'm not okay, but I can try my best to just pretend

So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out? (at the bottom)

I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I can wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

I know the pain that you hide behind the smile on your face
And not a day goes by where I don't think I feel the same

So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?
So will you wait me out
Or will you drown me out?

I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I could wait for years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
Till then I'll just pretend

(Weigh down upon me, weigh)
Weigh down on me
Stay till morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me
Stay till morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?

I can wait for you at the bottom
I can stay away if you want me to
I could wait four years if I gotta
Heaven knows I ain't getting over you

We'll try again
When we're not so different
We will make amends
Till then I'll just pretend

Weigh down on me
Stay till morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
Weigh down on me
Stay till morning
Way down, would you say I'm worthy?
