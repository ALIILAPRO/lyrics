		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I find myself watching the time
I never think about all the funny things you said
I feel like it's dead
Where is it leading me now?

I turn around in the still of the room
Knowing this is when I'm gonna make my move
Can't wait any longer
And I'm feeling stronger, but oh

Just as I walk (just a little more time)
To the door 
(Can't you feel my emotion) I can feel your emotion, yeah
It's pullin' me back 
(Just a little more time) back to love you

I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark

He holds me close like a thief of the heart
He plays a melody born to tear me all apart
The silence is broken
And no words are spoken, but oh

Just as I walk (just a little more time)
To the door 
(Can't you feel my emotion) I can feel your emotion, yeah
It's pullin' me back 
(Just a little more time) back to love you

I know, caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
(In the dark)

Oh, the silence is broken
And no words are spoken, but oh

Just as I walk (just a little more time)
To the door 
(Can't you feel my emotion) I can feel your emotion
(Oh, baby) Oh, babe, hold me back 
(Just a little more time) back to love you

I know, I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
I cry, I cry

And I know, I'm caught up in the middle
I cry just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no, gave up on the riddle
I cry just a little
When he plays piano in the dark
(In the dark)

I can't let go, no, no, no, no
I can't let go
Can't let go, no, no, no
