		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, looky here, fellas
Take it from your Uncle Bootsy
Ain't no shame beggin' in the rain
Tell her how you really feel

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mm

I could pretend when I'm out with my friends
I ain't thinkin' about you
I could pretend like I ain't in my feelings 
But that ain't true, nah
When I called you out your name
That was my ego, my pride and pain
I should be a movie star, the way I play the part
Like everything's okay

Oh, now I try to be the life of the party
All night buyin' shots for everybody
But it's all just an act (yeah)
'Cause I can't have you back (yeah)
Without you, I've been going crazy

Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin'
But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' 
Tryna put on a smile, smile (put on a smile)
Ooh, out here smilin' like a fool
(When the only thing worth smilin' for)
Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was 
You (you)
You
You, you, you, you, you
You

If I could turn back the hands on my Rollie, you know I would
I would've spent all my time makin' sure that my baby good
I'm tryin' hard to hide the shame
I know I'm playin' a dangerous game
But since you've been gone, I ain't been the same
There's only so much a man can fake

Oh, now I try to be the life of the party
All night buyin' shots for everybody
But it's all just an act (yeah)
'Cause I can't have you back (yeah)
Without you, I've been going crazy

Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Tryna fight these tears from cryin'
But Lord knows I'm dyin', dyin' 
Tryna put on a smile (put on a smile), baby
Out here smilin' like a fool
(When the only thing worth smilin' for)
Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for
(When the only thing worth smilin' for)
Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for was
You
You, you

I'm tryna put on a smile (put on a smile)
Oh, whoa, whoa
Tryna fight these tears from cryin'
But Lord knows I'm dyin' 
(Put on a smile) oh
I'm smilin' like a fool
(When the only thing worth smilin' for)
Baby girl, the only thing worth smilin' for
(When the only thing worth smilin' for)
Oh, the only thing worth smilin' for was
You (you)
You
You, you, you, you, you
