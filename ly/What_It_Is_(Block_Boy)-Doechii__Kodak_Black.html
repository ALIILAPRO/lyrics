		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What it is, ho? What's up?
Every good girl needs a little thug
Every block boy needs a little love
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up

Can't you see it's just me and you?
Panoramic view, that's my point of view, babe
All about me, that's the energy
That's that lemon pepper thing, I'm a ten-piece, baby

Bedroom bully in the bando
He gon' make it flip, do it with no handles
Never switchin' sides, only switchin' angles
Ooh, we go crazy like Rambo

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

Hit 'em up, hit 'em up in a truck
Got it tucked, he get it up like it's stuck
All night, I like
You ain't gotta say when you know it's on sight

She got everything he wanted, a nice body, ass fat
Behind every gangster, a shawty solid that got his back
He know who to come to every time the world handle him bad
The one he call first, but still he always put her last (always put her last, yeah)
I'm pourin' out the glass, my body fightin' off that gas (off that gas, yeah)
On smokebox, I kill 'em, that ZaZa pack kickin' my ass (kickin' my ass, yeah)
In the studio dozin', I'm rockin' keep from fallin' asleep
I hate that for you niggas
Ain't got no bread, but tryna beef (hate that for you niggas, yeah)
Being Black in America is the hardest thing to be (to be, to be, yeah)
Every thug need a little love too, baby, how 'bout me?
Told her don't call me, "Lil' stink" 'cause I smell like money
I put it down the greatest, baby, hold this here for me
I took her from her nigga, we vibin' two weeks out the country
Said she had a little situation, but I could tell it ain't 'bout nothin'
I made her a rappin' bitch (it ain't 'bout nothin')
She say, "Don't hush me", I say, "Don't rush me"
And I can tell how much she like a nigga by the way she suckin', what it is?

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

I don't care if you run the streets
Long as you're comin' home to me
I love the way you walk and the way you speak
He gon' keep it real, that's the deal
That's the reason that I stay down, down (down, down, down, down)
I put that all on my name (all on my name)
Yeah, that's an even exchange (tell 'em what it is)
Stay on your tail, we gon' tell 'em, we gon' tell 'em what, babe?

What it is, ho? What's up? (What it is?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (needs a little thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (needs a little love, yeah)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up

What it is, ho? What's up? (Oh, what's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (needs a little thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

Back it up and do-do it like that, yeah (what it is? What's up?)
Back it up and do it like that, yeah (hey, yeah)
Back it up, back it, do it like that, yeah (yeah)
Back it up, gon' do it like that, yeah, woo (hey)

Hey, what it is? (Ay, what's up?)
J White did it (little thug)
More hits on the way, yeah (a lil' love)
We need a lil' love, you know I mean, woo (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ride out, whoa
