		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The mast of the world
Spreading the speech of hate
Compose it, thunder feeds their hunger

Hunger

The mast of the world
Controlling all debates
These words and numbers they work hard for

Hard for

I'm afraid
It accelerates
We swim in the sea of madness
They gave us all that no one asked for

The mast of the world
Spreading the speech of hate
Compose it, thunder feeds their hunger

Hunger

The mast of the world
Controlling all debates
These words and numbers they work hard for

Hard for

The master of worlds
Controlling all our fates
We know so much but almost nothing

You broadcast your world
Thinking that we'll not see
What's going on behind those closed doors

This vicious army
You thought you could lightly
Deceive with madness now

We're here to stay

We know your secrets
We know your weakness
We know that you're not safe
In this world now anymore

I'm afraid
It accelerates
We swim in the sea of madness
They gave us all that no one asked for

What's your name little girl, we are all here for you
We'll let you grow now, then we'll eat your soul out

Tell me now your name little boy, now we are all here for you
We'll let you grow now and here's the gun you'll need

Nothing will stop it cause

The mast

The mast of the world
Compose it, thunder feeds their hunger

The mast of the world
Controlling all debates
These words and numbers they work hard for

Hard for
