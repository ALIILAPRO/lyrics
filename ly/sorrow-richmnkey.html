		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Faded away in a dream phase again
Love is  gone in the wind
I can't remember the faces of people close to me
So broken inside, I've forgotten what is meant to be
Dear mother pray for me
I've been dying recently
My faith is shaking
I've been taking all these drugs
To ease the pain but it doesn't go away
I can't be saved
Faded away in a dream phase again
Love is gone in  the wind
I can't remember the faces of people close to me
So broken inside, I've forgotten what it's meant to be
