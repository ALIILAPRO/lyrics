(What ya sayin'?)
Figured I will be destitute
Guess I taught you a lesson
I look at you like (what ya sayin'?)
What's that shit you was talking?
And now you punching the air
Nobody hearing (what ya sayin'?)
You really tried to bring me down with you
The people holding up my crown (what ya sayin'?)
And I return it with love
Yeah, yeah (yeah)

I'm kinda sorry that you had to see me rise like this
And manifest the future in my mind like this
I know it must be hard to see me up with the stars 
When you was throwing the salt and wishing for me to fall
It take a lot to hate me with everything that you are
And everything that you have, I hope you get out the past
And maybe one day we could get together and laugh
And I can figure out why my being here make you mad
I hope you getting your money, I hope your setting is sunny
Only intentional shade, veggies and fruit in your tummy
Happy with who you became, little ones calling your name
Beautiful woman at home, nobody dousing your flame
You hope I'm hurting and I hope you great
I live my purpose I ain't perfect but I'm flying straight
Going through the highs and lows, learning not to run it hot
I just hope you know that all I wanted to do was to find my way

(Sayin'? What-what)
Figured I will be destitute
Guess I taught you a lesson
I look at you like (what ya sayin'?)
What's that shit you was talking?
And now you punching the air
Nobody hearing (what ya sayin'?)
You really tried to bring me down with you
The people holding up my crown (what ya sayin'?)
And I return it with love

I tell it how I live it I ain't putting on a act
I celebrate the village and that's why the people clap
I'm genuine in spirit even when I'm dead wrong
Tryna give the people hope like restoring dead lungs
I'm just sitting on my balcony and living my truth
Even when I feel ashamed I admit it to you
'Cause I don't do it for myself it's for the good of the world
I'm on a mission I feel like it's something I gotta do
That's why no matter what you saying you ain't taking my juice
Suicidal niggas stay attempting breaking my roots
I'm thanking every single person that doubted me on the way
I be thanking you every day as I'm waking up to my view
Get up to the sunrise this a struggle sometimes
I hope that you step into your power when it come time
Life is something special so you really gotta love yours
Before you finished or getting close to the runtime

(What ya sayin'?)
Figured I will be destitute
Guess I taught you a lesson
I look at you like (what ya sayin'?)
What's that shit you was talking?
And now you punching the air
Nobody hearing (what ya sayin'?)
You really tried to bring me down with you
The people holding up my crown (what ya sayin'?)
And I return it with love

(What ya sayin'?)
(What ya sayin'?)
(What ya sayin'?)
(What ya sayin'?)
