		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Flip it like that)
(Flip it like that)
(Flip it like that)
(Flip it like that)

We suffer everyday, what is it for?
These crimes of illusion are fooling us all
And now I am weary and I feel like I do

It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart

The size of our fight
It's just a dream
We've crushed everything I can see
In this mourning selfishly
How we fell and I feel like I do

It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart

(Flip it like that)
(Flip it like that)
(Flip it like that)
(Flip- like-, flip- like-, flip-)
(Flip it like that)

Now that we've chosen to take all we can
This shade of autumn, a stale bitter end
Years of frustration lay down side by side

And It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart

It's only you
Who can tell me apart
And it's only you
Who can turn my wooden heart
