		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go, girls
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Saw a poster on the corner opposite the motel
Turns out I'm going to hell
If I keep on being myself
Don't know what I did
But they seem pretty mad about it
God hates us?
Alright then
Buckle up, at dawn we're riding

Walk a mile on these coals
Busy cleansing my soul
Getting ready for the night
Damned for eternity
But you're coming with me into the afterlife

This hell is better with you
We're burning up together baby, that makes two
'Cause the devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh, ooh
(This hell is better with you)
With you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
With you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
Ohh, with you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
(This hell is better with you) (aha ha)

Flame red, caught the moment
Posing for the paparazzi
Fuck what they did to Britney
To lady di and Whitney
Don't know why we're here
But might as well get down and dirty
That Satan's looking thirsty
Not even he can hurt me

Walk a mile on these coals
Busy cleansing my soul
Getting ready for the night
Damned for eternity
But you're coming with me into the afterlife (wow, that's hot)

This hell is better with you
We're burning up together baby, that makes two
'Cause the devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh, ooh
(This hell is better with you)
With you
This life gave us nothing to lose
We're going down together
Got a ticket for two
'Cause the devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh, ooh
(This hell is better with you)
With you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
With you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
Ohh, with you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
(This hell is better with you)

Got my invitation to eternal damnation
Get in line, pass the wine, bitch
We're going straight to hell!
Got my invitation to eternal damnation
Get in line, pass the wine, bitch
We're going straight to hell

This hell is better with you
We're burning up together
Baby, that makes two
'Cause the devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh, ooh
This hell is better with you (with you)
This hell is better with you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
(I'm in this hell with you) (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
This hell is better with you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
Ohh, with you (woo ooh ooh, woo ooh ooh)
This hell is better with you (ohh, oh)
(This hell is better with you)
