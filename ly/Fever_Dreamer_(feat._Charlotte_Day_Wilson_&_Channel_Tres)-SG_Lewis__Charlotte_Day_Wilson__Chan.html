		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I dreamt it up
This kind of love
This crazy feeling I just can't make it up
Making love to you and you just ate it up
Don't let it fade, pup
Don't let it fade

Cuz even when I snap back out of it
I see us from above with clear vision
Now I can't do anything but fall in love
But fall in love 

In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love
In love, in love, in love

Every time you touch me, I
Get the fever
It's how I know that you're the one
The only one
My dreamer
The only one, yeah

Fever dreamer
Fever dreamer
Fever dreamer
Fever dreamer

Can you come over
Can we get to the business
Let me console you
Tell you everything you're missing
How did she know?
Voulez avoir these carrots
Can't move 'til you pay me (nah nigga can't play me)

Talking shit from across the club
Wrist watch nigga try your luck (try your luck)

I was feelin' comatose
Nothing makes sense
I hit the floor, then I hit the drink
Caught them all then I start to think
Gotta figure this out, figure this out

I hit the streets and they show me love
Afterparty from the club
I hit the streets and they show me love
Afterparty I'm throwing dubs

Every time you touch me, I
Get the fever
It's how I know that you're the one
The only one
My dreamer, yeah
The only one, yeah

Fever dreamer
Fever dreamer
Fever dreamer
Fever dreamer
