		  I've noticed you around, um
I find you very attractive
Would you, um
I find you very attractive
Um, would you go to bed with me?

I've noticed you around, um
I find you very attractive
Um, would you go to bed with me?

Um
I've noticed you around, um
I find you very attractive
Um
Would you, um

Um
Um, would you go to bed with me?

Um
I've noticed you around, um 
I find you very attractive
Um, would you go to bed with me?

Um, would you go to bed with me?
