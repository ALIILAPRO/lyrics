		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you don't want me anymore
By the look on your face
They say when it rains it pours
You can tell by my face

Oh and I know
And you know that we've been here before
I think I know how it should end
We got an audience calling us crazy

We ignore
Those with opinions of hate
We're not like the rest of them
Friends with insanity as of lately

Everyone comes with scars 
But you can love them away
I told you that I wasn't perfect
You told me the same

I think that's why we belong 
Together and unashamed
I told you that I wasn't perfect
No way
Way
Way
No way
No way

When I look in your eyes 
I see through to my soul
I know the core of you is good
You're my tarnished hero

Oh and I know (and I know)
And you know how our story is told (story is told)
Only we know what it is
We got an audience calling us crazy

We ignore 
Those with opinions of hate
We're not like the rest of them 
Friends with insanity as of lately

Everyone comes with scars 
But you can love them away
I told you that I wasn't perfect
You told me the same

I think that's why we belong 
Together and unashamed
I told you that I wasn't perfect
No way
Way
Way
No way
No way 
No way
