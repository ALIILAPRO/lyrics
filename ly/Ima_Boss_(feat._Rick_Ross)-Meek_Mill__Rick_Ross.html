		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look I be riding through my old hood, but I'm in my new whip
Same old attitude but I'm on that new shit
They say they gon' rob me, see me never do shit
Cause they know that's the reason that's gone end up on a news clips
Audemar on my wrist, bustdown
We poppin' bottles like I scored the winning touchdown
Remember Meek dead broke? Look at me, up now
I run my city from south Philly back to uptown
Thank god, all these bottles I popped
All this paper I been gettin, all these models I popped
I done sold a hundred thousand before my album got dropped
And I'm only 23 I'm the shit now look at me
Look at me I'm a boss like my nigga Rozay
Shawty asked me for a check, I told that bitch like no way
'Cause I made it from the bottom there was nothin' on the way
And I never had a job, you know I had to sell yay
Bitch I'm a boss
I call the shots
I'm with the murder team
Call the cops
We in the building
Y'all are not
You short on the paper, you gon' ball or not

Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (ugh) I call the calls (ugh)
We in this bitch
It's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

I plan the shots, I call the calls

Got so many shades they thought I had a lazy eye
Shorty rode me smooth as my Mercedes ride
No love cry when only babies die
And when I go that casket better cost a hundred thou
I pray to god I look my killer in his eyes
Snatch his soul up out that shirt let's take him for that ride
OG is one who standing on his own feet
A Boss is one who guarantee we gone eat
Fuck a blog dog cause one day we gon' meet
I'm a spazz on yo ass like I'm on e
Or a double stack better nigga double that
Jerry Jones money nigga you a running back
Herschel Walker, Bo Jack, Ricky Waters
Better run that dope back
Boss, and I put that on my Maybach
Fo' hundred thou' bitch you wish you saved that

Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (ugh) I call the calls (ugh)
We in this bitch
It's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

I plan the shots, I call the calls

Couple cars I don't never drive, bikes I don't never ride
Crib I ain't never been, pool I don't never swim
Fool you ain't better, I move like the president
Err thang black on black you know I be strapp'n that
Rattin' ass niggas walkin round wear'n wires fuckin up the game
Got the hood on fire bitch I'm a king call me sire
If you say I don't run my city you a muthafucking liar
Bitch I'm a boss, you a fraud, you cross the line I get you murdered for a cost
Out in Vegas, I took a loss
At the fight we watchin' Floyd we on the floor
Scared money don't make no money
If I ever go broke I'm a take yo money
I ain't never dropped a dime
You ain't take nun from me
In the hood err day I'm good what I say

Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
Bitch, I'm a boss (I'm a boss)
I plan the shots (ugh) I call the calls (ugh)
We in this bitch
It's goin' down
Yeah I'm the king
Now where my mu'fuckin' crown?

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

Bitch I'm a boss (I'm a boss)

I plan the shots, I call the calls
