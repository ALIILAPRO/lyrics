		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the bed to myself and 
I like to hammer, no helping
Don't need nobody next to me
I love the space in the shower
Hang out with me for an hour
I bring myself down to my knees

There was a time I looked into the wrong eyes
Now I realize I was here all along

You should've thought about that before you broke my heart
Now you're seeing me, I'm not missing you at all 
But you wish you could
Take it all back and damn that must be hard
Should have thought about that before you broke my heart 
My heart, my heart

Oh, did you think I'd hate dancing alone?
Oh, did you think I'd stay home?
You should've thought about that before you broke my heart
No, I won't ever look back
You should've thought about that

This body dripping like diamonds
I set 'em off like a siren
I always gotta stop and stare (stop and stare, ah)
They say no man is an island
But I do it all without trying (uh-uh)
A goddess no one can compare

There was a time I looked into the wrong eyes (wrong eyes)
Now I realize (realized) I was here all along (i was here)

You should've thought about that before you broke my heart
Now you're seeing me, I'm not missing you at all 
But you wish you could
Take it all back and damn that must be hard
Should have thought about that before you broke my heart 
My heart, my heart

Oh, did you think I'd hate dancing alone?
Oh, did you think I'd stay home?
You should've thought about that before you broke my heart
No, I won't ever look back
You should've thought about that

I'm not crying
I'm not sad that you're gone
Not trying, I can get what I want
No lying, so far past moving on
Oh-whoa

I'm out dancing
You're just a name on my phone
Won't answer
I'm better off on my own
But tonight who said that I'm sleeping alone?

You should've thought about that before you broke my heart
Now you're seeing me, I'm not missing you at all 
But you wish you could
Take it all back and damn that must be hard, oh
You should have thought about that before you broke my heart 
My heart, my heart

Oh, did you think I'd hate dancing alone?
Oh, did you think I'd stay home?
You should've thought about that before you broke my heart (my heart, my heart)
No, I won't ever look back
You should've thought about that
