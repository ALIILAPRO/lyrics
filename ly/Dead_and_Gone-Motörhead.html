		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up insane today
Dreamed I was blown away
Ten thousand called my name
Asleep at the wheel again
Turn me down, turn me down
Take my head and turn it around
Turn me on, turn me on
Everything I do is wrong

Woke up in hell today
Spoke to the devil, he turned away
All of my friends were there
They didn't have no time to spare
Turn me down, turn me down
Step back and I hit the ground
Turn me on, turn me on
Everything I do is wrong

Out of the night comes a song that I know
Twisted and ruined and black
I can remember the people they were
Nobody knows if they ever come back
Lost in the ashes of time they still sing
Echoes of romance gone bad
I can remember them better than you
I shared the darkness they had
Dead and gone, dead and gone

Woke up in my grave today
I dreamed I heard you say
All of eternity was pain
I laid my head back down again

Turn me down, turn me down
Your lips move but you make no sound
Turn me on, turn me on
Everything I do is wrong

Out of the night comes a song that I know
Twisted and ruined and black
I can remember the people they were
Nobody knows if they ever come back
Lost in the ashes of time they still sing
Echoes of romance gone bad
I can remember them better than you
I shared the nightmares they had
Dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
So long, so long, so long
Dead and gone.
