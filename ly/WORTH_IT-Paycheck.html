		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m a Carolina baby on the verge of suicide
Going California crazy
Can’t afford to make her mine
But it’s day and night she on my mind
And no one else can get me high
So I keep getting faded tryna
Read between the lines
What’s the point of feeling jaded?
Always end up asking why
Singing day and night i lost my mind
Cause love might be my kryptonite

Fuck my life and say I deserve it
Get me high to give me a purpose
Lost my pride to find I’m a burden
I need you to show me I’m worth it
Fuck my night i probably deserve it
Leave me dry and tell me I’m worthless
Lost my high to find I’m a burden
I need you to show me I’m worth it

Now I ain’t said this shit before
But this girl got an attitude
That’s lightning to my soul
(Soul, soul, soul, soul)
We all got baggage back at home
And some might say it’s bad for you
But hers still make her glow
(Glow, glow, glow, glow)
So how do you love me? (How do you love me?)
Baby how do you trust me?
(How do you trust me?)
You know that shit could get ugly
(Shit could get ugly)
If there ain’t no one above me
So tell me how do you want me?
(How do you love me?)
Baby how do you want me?
(How do you trust me?)
I know that shit could get ugly
(Shit could get ugly)
So tell me how do you want me?

Fuck my life & say I deserve it
Get me high to give me a purpose
Lost my pride to find I’m a burden
I need you to show me I’m worth it

Fuck my life and say I deserve it
Get me high to give me a purpose
Lost my pride to find I’m a burden
I need you to show me I’m worth it
Fuck my night i probably deserve it
Leave me dry and tell me I’m worthless
Lost my high to find I’m a burden
I need you to show me I’m worth it
