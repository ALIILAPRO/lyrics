		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paint your truck tread with some red dust
While you kick up the long way home
Share some bootleg with your best buds
Wear a bit of that bonfire smoke
If a back porch swing and twang in your words
And settin' that hook was a Good Book verse
I'd be doin' alright
I'd know where I's goin' when I get to the other side 'cause

Backroads and cold beer
Are my down home prayer
Can't get no closer
To the Man upstairs
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen

If "John Deere Green" was 3:16
And old barstools were back pew seats
These Friday nights would all just seem like Sunday mornin'
If them words in red were a little more read
This sinner'd be a saint instead

'Cause backroads and cold beer
Are my down home prayer
Can't get no closer
To the Man upstairs
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen

'Cause backroads and cold beer
Are my down home prayer
Can't get no closer to God's grace, I swear
Than way out there, where the river runs
Lord knows I'd be one hell of a disciple
If bein' country was in the Bible
Hallelujah, amen
Heaven blessed this life I live
Hallelujah, amen, amen
