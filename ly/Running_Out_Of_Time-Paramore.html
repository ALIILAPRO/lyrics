		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I was gonna take some flowers to my neighbor
But I ran out of time
Didn't wanna show up to the party empty-handed
But I ran out of time
Said I'll walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
The extra mile
Thought I'd send a card with my condolences
But damn, I just ran out of time

Intentions only get you so far
What if I'm just a selfish prick? No regard, ah

I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

Never mind, I hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
But I was just so tired
There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car, otherwise
Would've been here on time
Shoulda, coulda, wouldn't matter, ultimate alibi
You know it's a lie
There was a fire (metaphorically)
Be there in five (hyperbolically)

Intentions only get you so far
(It was on my list, I swear I meant to get to it)
A harsh reality to discover, ah

I'm always running out of time
She's always running out of time
I'm always running out of time

Why we gotta be in a rush?
My watch is just for decoration, mm
Look, I showed up early for once
Now that's a new sensation, mm

We're always running out of time
She's always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
She's always running out of time (out of time)
I'm always running out of time
