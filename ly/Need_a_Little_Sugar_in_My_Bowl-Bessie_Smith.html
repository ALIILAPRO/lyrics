		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tired of bein' lonely, tired of bein' blue
I wished I had some good man, to tell my troubles to
Seem like the whole world's wrong
Since my man's been gone

I need a little sugar in my bowl
I need a little hot dog on my roll
I can stand a bit of lovin', oh so bad
I feel so funny, I feel so sad

I need a little steam-heat on my floor
Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go
What's the matter hard papa
Come on and save your mama's soul
'Cause I need a little sugar, in my bowl, doggone it
I need a some sugar in my bowl

I need a little sugar in my bowl
I need a little hot dog between my rolls
You gettin' different, I've been told
Move your finger, drop something in my bowl

I need a little steam-heat on my floor
Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go
Get off your knees, I can't see what you're drivin' at
It's dark down there looks like a snake!
C'mon here and drop somethin' here in my bowl
Stop your foolin' and drop somethin' in my bowl
