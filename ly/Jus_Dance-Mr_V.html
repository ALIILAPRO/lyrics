		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel the heat
You seen the road I wanna follow, 
It takes a turn its hard to follow, 
I want your touch I want your body. I feel the heat. 

Oh heat, 
I feel the heat. Heat, 
I feel the heat. 

You seen the road I wanna follow, 
It takes a turn its hard to follow, 
I want your touch I want your body. I feel the heat. 
Oooh its you, 
Its you I want tonight, 
The heat is on I want you here tonight. Its you, 
Its you I want tonight. The heat is on tonight, 

I feel the heat
I feel the heat
I feel the heat
I feel the heat

Ohhhh

You seen the road I wanna follow, 
It takes a turn its hard to follow, 
I want your touch I want your body. I feel the heat. 
Oooh its you, 
Its you I want tonight, 
The heat is on I want you here tonight. Its you, 
Its you I want tonight. The heat is on tonight, 
Oooh its you, 
Its you I want tonight, 
The heat is on I want you here tonight. Its you, 
Its you I want tonight. The heat is on tonight, 

I feel the heat 

You seen the road I wanna follow, 
It takes a turn its hard to follow, 
I want your touch I want your body. I feel the heat. 
Oooh its you, 
Its you I want tonight, 
The heat is on I want you here tonight. Its you, 
Its you I want tonight. The heat is on tonight,
