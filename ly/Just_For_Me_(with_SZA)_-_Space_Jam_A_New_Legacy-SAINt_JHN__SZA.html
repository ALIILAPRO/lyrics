		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She beautiful, I know that she knows it
Then my heart gets involved and it's out of my control
She's too beautiful to just ignore it
So I lay my hands on her head and say, "Baby, you're mine"
This feeling's unusual
Faith and love are all I know
She's the kind you can't let go
So, so, I learn to 

Fall in love with the lows and the midnight highs
The pills and the pain and the bad advice
I swear that I'm done with it one last time
Falls in love with the fire, baby, it got cold
She's gonna set fire everything I own
She never does, I know

You're just for me
I wanna put my heart into you (she's just for me)
I wanna, wanna fall into you (you're just for me)
I wanna give my all, but you pretend that you don't
I know (you're just for me)

Is it too late for us? You're inescapable
I run away from the thought of givin' you more of my time, time, time
You try to cage a bird, you got away with murder
I grab a piece of the sky to give you more shine
He's so dangerous and he knows it
Got my heart in a headlock and I'm out of control
He's so classy and can't stay focused
Eyes told me all I need to know

Fall in love with the lows and the midnight highs
The pills with the pain and the bad advice
I swear I be done with it one last time
Falls in love with the fire, baby, it got cold
He's gonna set fire everything I own
He never does, he never does

(You're just for me)
I wanna put my heart into you (she's just for me)
I wanna, wanna fall into you (you're just for me)
(Say that you're just for me)
I wanna give my all, but you pretend that you're done (oh, baby, no)
But you know you're just for me (oh, baby)

I wanna put my heart into you (she's just for me)
I wanna, wanna fall into you (you're just for me) (on and on)
I wanna give my all, but you pretend that you're done (on and on and on)
But you know you're just for me
