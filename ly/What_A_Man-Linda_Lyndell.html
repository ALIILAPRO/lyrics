		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get lovin' (lovin')
By the hundred
And I get lovin' (lovin'), yeah
By the pint
Got me doin' the camel walk
In my sleep
Make me do the James Brown
Every time I get on my feet

Listen to me

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man 
Say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man 

Yes he is
A mighty mighty good man

Let me put it on your mind
Let me put it on your mind
He thrills me, kills me
He's a lovin' kind
Another ounce of his love
And I think I'm a gonna slip
Lose my grip
And do back over flips

Listen now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty mighty good man 
Say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man, yeah

What a man
And deep inside I know it
What a man
And I'm not ashamed to show it
Yeah

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty mighty good man 
Say it again now
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty, mighty good man

Yes he is

He can do, good god
He can do the funky broadway
Yes he can
The funky four corner
He can back up
Back up and do the tighten up

What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty, mighty good man 
Yeah, yeah yeah
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty good man 
Yes he is
What a man, what a man, what a man
What a mighty, mighty good man 
Mighty, mighty, mighty, good man
Good man, good good, oh mighty, mighty
