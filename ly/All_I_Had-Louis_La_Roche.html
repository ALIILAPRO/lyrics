		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hold me tight
You hold me tight
I needed you
I needed you
I needed you
I needed you

Gave up all I had with you my girl
Gave up all I had with you

You hold me tight
You hold me tight
I needed you
I needed you
I needed you
I needed you

Gave up all I had with you my girl
Gave up all I had with you
Gave up all I had with you

Come back home
Come back home

Gave up all I had with you my girl
Gave up all I had with you
It's all for you babe
Gave up all I had with you my girl
Gave up all I had with you
