		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gazing on the stars, lost in my mind
The gentleness of night makes it alright
I'm thinking of my past, all that I've done
Falling in a trance, creating a scene

Front seat, sat back, I don't wanna let go
Feeling like I never left home
Your touch, your smile, every moment we made
Is more important than you could know
Just me and you making trails as we go
Dancing to our hearts metronome
But right now, it's just me, dreaming what there could be
Oh, never let go

Here we go again, feeling the same
Waiting for your voice to call out my name
Unsure what else to do get back to you
Just hoping that the chance comes out of the blue

Front seat, sat back, I don't wanna let go
Feeling like I never left home
Your touch, your smile, every moment we made
Is more important than you could know
Just me and you making trails as we go
Dancing to our hearts metronome
But right now, it's just me, dreaming what there could be
Oh, never let go
Never wanna let go

Front seat, sat back, I don't wanna let go
Feeling like I never left home
Your touch, your smile, every moment we made
Is more important than you could know
Just me and you making trails as we go
Dancing to our hearts metronome
But right now, it's just me, dreaming what there could be
Oh, never let go (never let go)
