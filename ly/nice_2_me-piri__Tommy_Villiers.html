		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please be nice to me

I try not to think about the bad times
But am I just pretending that it's alright?
Yes you, treat me so different every night
And I'm stuck wishing I could read your mind, yeah

'Cause it's up in the air, I don't know how you feel
Am I kidding myself, is this actually real?
I don't know what to do, do you want me or not?
'Cause, baby, if you're feeling it, it's easy

I'm not hard to please, oh
Can you just be nice to me? Ah
Baby, I'm not hard to please, oh (I'm not hard to please, can you just be nice to me?)
Can you just be nice to me? Ah (I'm not hard to please, can you just be nice to me?)

Yeah, yo
This way, that way
I'm stuck in the middle, I've got mixed signals
I try but the outlook's dismal
I just can't read these symbols
The things you say just don't seem to match up with your actions
Want the whole, but I just get fractions and confusing interactions

Oh, how I've tried to be patient
I must be dumb 'cause I'm still waiting and waiting, oh
All of this stress you're creating
It's mashing my head, boy, it's aching

But, baby, I'm not hard to please, oh
Can you just be nice to me? Ah
Baby, I'm not hard to please, oh (I'm not hard to please, can you just be nice to me?)
Can you just be nice to me? Ah (I'm not hard to please, can you just be nice to me?)

I'm not hard to please
Can you just be nice to me? (Yeah)
I'm not hard to please
Can you just be nice to me?
I'm not hard to please
Can you just be nice to me? (Yeah)
I'm not hard to please
Can you just be nice to me?
