		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rain changes everything
Time changes the world
Seasons changes the earth
I wasn't able to
change with them
I was just watching the view
change in front of me
Couldn't even see tomorrow
Repeating grieving days
Stopped by fear of being hurt
Cried for fear of something lost
But, In fact, we have nothing
in the beginning
There's no man born
with something in his hands
Don't be afraid
Goodbye to the me who was weak
Make your tomorrow
I don't need a future
without hopes and dreams
I don't need tomorrows
without meaning
We make the future
and tomorrow with our hands
Even if we are powerless

Your hands, your arms,
your feet, your eyes,
your tears, what are they for?
War, society and justice
Why need reasons anymore?
Don't want to pray
only for happiness
Don't want the words
with only gentlenss
Don't want no perfection
Don't want eternity
I don't need any kind of answer
Don't need no hesitation
Don't need the me
who lived in yesterday
Thank you until now
I'll never forget you
We make the future
and tomorrow with our hands
Goodbye to me who was weak
And I say
Goodbye to my yesterday
Goodbye my yesterday
