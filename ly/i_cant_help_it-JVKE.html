		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause I can't help falling in love with
You

Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-ba, ba-da-da-da

I've been vibin' with you heavy
Yeah, I'm falling, can you catch me?
Dreamin' all day and dreamin' all night
I could do this the rest of my life
I hit these stages like I'm Freddie (Freddie)
'Cause you my queen, I know you ready
To grow with me the rest of your life
Startin' tonight

'Cause I can't help falling in love with
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, no, I can't help but fall in love with
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, no, I can't help but fall

It's happening and I can't stop it
It's happening and I can't stop it, no
It's happening and I can't stop it
Oh, it's happening and I can't stop it
Whoa

'Cause I can't help falling in love with
You

Oh, no, I can't help but fall in love with
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, no, I can't help but fall in love with
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, no, I can't help but fall in love with
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
You-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Oh, no, I can't help but fall in love with
