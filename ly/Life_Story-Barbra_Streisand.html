		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want to stay here 
Not very nice 
You boiled me over 
Now you're cold as ice 
From what you gave me 
To what you made me 
I should be homeward bound 
Why am I hanging 'round knowing 

You're life story began with somebody else 
Find your glory out there with somebody else 
I'll be where you find me 
I'll be somebody else 
Somebody else 

Dog in the manger 
Teller of lies 
I see a stranger laughing in your eyes 
Though I don't know how 
I'm in the way now 
No matter what you do 
I go on loving you knowing 

Your life story began with somebody else 
Find your glory out there with somebody else 
I'll be where you find me 
I'll be somebody else 
Somebody else 
Somebody else 

Deeper than your valleys 
Longer than your memory 
I got to your story's end 

Your life story began with somebody else 
Find your glory out there with somebody else 
I'll be where you find me 
I'll be somebody else
Somebody else 
Somebody else 
Somebody else 
Somebody else 
Somebody else 
Somebody else 
Somebody else 
I'll be somebody else
I'll be somebody else
