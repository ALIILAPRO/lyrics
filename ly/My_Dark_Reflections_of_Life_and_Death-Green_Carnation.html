		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pain is self-inflicted, cause is not
I long for my time, long before its due
Tired of resting in despair
Judge me for who I am
Relieve me for what I am
Remember me for what I was
Forgive me for what I became
Where shadows speak of memories
I stand alone in my dark and lonely world
Surrounded by this cold embrace of temptation
White bewinged angel of light
Tempts me to change my life
Come, come to me, she whispers
Longing eyes, she stares through my soul and mind
Wants me to become one of the light
Ah, serpent of lust and lie, where will my path go?
Should I be tempted by the light or should I remain in darkness
All alone, all alone.....
Why all this sorrow, why all this confusion?
I was one of thee, why am I left behind?
Hate - fills my mind
Sorrow - breeds my life
But of those I choose, no one is sent out from you
My way will be long, my road will be unknown
Path to eternity, eternity lasts forever
Light of day, day of darkness
I will never be trustfull again....
I am not for you, I am not for those
Not for light, not for life
Farewell to sunlit world
On the dark side we will meet
We will meet again after life...
Time passes slowly
I fade away, life drained
What used to be, what could have been now
I feel no pleasure, only pain
I feed upon my fear of life
Trapped in agony and despair
Anguish of the night
I will meet you again
On the other side...
