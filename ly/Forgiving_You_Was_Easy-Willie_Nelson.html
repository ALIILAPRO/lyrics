		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgiving you was easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
I just keep thinking and your memory is forever on my mind
You know I'll always love you and I can't forget the days when you were mine
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
The bitter fruit of anger growing from the seeds of jealousy
Oh what a heartache but I forgive the things you said to me
Cause I believe forgiving is the only way that I'll find peace of mind
And forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time

The years have passed so quickly as once again fate steals a young man's dreams
Of all the golden years and growing old together you and me
You asked me to forgive you you said there was another on your mind
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
Forgiving you is easy but forgetting seems to take the longest time
