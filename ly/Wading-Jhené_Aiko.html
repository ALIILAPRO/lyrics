		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Picture me rolling
Out in the open, baby I know
That you would notice
You have been hoping I wouldn't go

Should I be wading?
Should I be wading for you?
Don't keep me waiting
I will turn blue

Picture me rolling
Out in the open
With some other man I know
That you would notice
And you were hoping
Feelings wouldn't start to grow

All of the wading
All I was, wading
Wading for you
I have been waiting
I will be waiting
Till I turn blue

I am not perfect
I would never let
You think I was more than this
As good as it gets
I'll have one regret
You're something I cannot miss

I will be wading
I will be wading
For you
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
Till I turn blue

I am not perfect
I would never let
You think I was more than this
As good as it gets
I'll have one regret
You're something I cannot miss

I will be wading
I will be wading
For you
I will be waiting
I will be waiting
Till I turn blue
