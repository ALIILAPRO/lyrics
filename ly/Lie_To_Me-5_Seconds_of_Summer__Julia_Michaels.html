		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you looking brand new overnight
I caught you looking, too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy
You look happy

Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you'd stay with me
Remember thinking that I got this right

Now I wish we'd never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleaning up your mess
I know he's taking off your dress
And I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you li-li-li-lie
Lie to me

It's three A.M. and the moonlight's testing me (oh)
I know that you've been holding on to someone else
And now I can't sleep
I ain't happy, oh
I ain't too happy, oh

Flashing back to New York City
I was dumb, but you undid me
Clash at me, don't run when it feels right

Now I wish we'd never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While he's taking off my dress
I know she's laying on your chest
And I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you li-li-li-lie
Lie to me

Singin'
Li-li-li-lie, li-li-li-li-li-lie
Li-li-li-li-li-lie, li-li-li-li-li-lie

And I know that you don't
But if I ask you if you love me
I hope you li-li-li-lie
Lie to me
