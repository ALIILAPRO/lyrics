		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This world doesn't need no opera, we're here for the operation
We don't need a bigga knife (a bigga knife)
'Cause they got guns, we got guns, we got guns (we got guns)
We got guns, you betta run (ya betta run, ya betta run, ya betta run)

We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers so we don't kill the ones that we love
We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers so we don't kill the ones that we love

Love
Love
Love

We pack demolition
We can't pack emotion
Dynamite, we just might
So blow us a kiss, blow us a kiss
Blow us a kiss and we'll blow you to pieces

We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers so we don't kill the ones that we love

Love
Love
Love

And we got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better, better, better run
'Cause we got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better run

We got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better, better, better run
'Cause we got guns, we got guns
Motherfuckers better

We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers
We're killin' strangers so we don't kill the ones that we love (better run)
We're killin' strangers ('cause we got guns)
We're killin' strangers ('cause we got guns)
We're killin' strangers so we don't kill the ones that we love (we got guns)

Love
Love
Love
Love
Love
Love

You better run
'Cause we got guns
'Cause we got guns
We got guns
