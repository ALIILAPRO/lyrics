		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The flames lick at my feet
Their hearts full of hate
What they don't understand, they condemn
What they can't comprehend must meet it's end

But I won't scream, won't give them that satisfaction
I won't confess my false interaction
As I breathe deep and prepare for my passing
I hear them chant, burn the witch

I stand accused of being in league with satan
No proof for their false accusation
Tied to the stake, no hope of escape
I stand alone and embrace my fiery fate

But I won't scream, won't give them that satisfaction
I won't confess my false interaction
As I breathe deep and prepare for my passing
I hear them chant, burn the witch
