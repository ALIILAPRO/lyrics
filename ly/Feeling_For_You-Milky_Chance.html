		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time since I've seen the colors
Of the sunrise breakin' at the dawn
It's been a long night on the road to nowhere
But you found me somewhere in the dark

You caught me in the moonlight, pulled me up from under
Now I'm left to wonder, lookin' for your love
Fallin' through the hours, stuck inside my blue mind
Never wanna lose time, never get enough

I don't what it means
But I know you're the only reason
I can't escape the feeling
I'm feeling for you
Never fell so in deep
And now I'm starting to believe it
I can't escape the feeling
I'm feeling for you

I'm feeling for you

I talk to streetlights down on every corner
But they don't know where I have to go
So I listen to your voice in a world so full of noise
One thing I hear, please don't disappear

You caught me in the moonlight, pulled me up to wonder
How you pulled me under, lookin' for your love
Fallin' through the hours, stuck inside my blue mind
Never wanna lose time, never get enough

I don't what it means
But I know you're the only reason
I can't escape the feeling
I'm feeling for you
Never fell so in deep
And now I'm starting to believe it
I can't escape the feeling
I'm feeling for you

I'm feeling for you

I'm feeling for you

I don't what it means
But I know you're the only reason
I can't escape the feeling
I'm feeling for you
Never fell so in deep
And now I'm starting to believe it
I can't escape the feeling
I'm feeling for you

I'm feeling for you

I'm feeling for you
