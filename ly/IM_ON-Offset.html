		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm on, I can meet a bitch the same day and take her home (home)
They know that I'm gifted, I'm the one that's on my own (own)
Nigga, start to switchin', cleared my vision, now, we grown (grown)
I been on one mission, run my digits, then, I'm gone (gone on 'em)
Wanna go back home (gone on 'em)
Man, I feel like I be so alone (phew)
Mama say, "Be strong" (strong)
When you is the king of the throne (hey)

Niggas come and stab you in the back with a smile
Niggas turn to rats when it's time for the trial (trial)
I'ma get it back every time, every time
I'm a mastermind, I'ma grind 'til I'm dyin' (grind)
I'ma get the money, I'ma find it even blind
Felt it in my stomach, he was hatin', I was shinin'
Knew I was the one when I was sellin' nicks and dimes (knew I was the one, yeah)
When it all falls, don't be blamin' nobody (falls)
Had to stand tall on my own and keep it solid (solid)
Contradicting, right, I bought myself a body (body)
Man, I think it's time for me to go and go Bugatti (skrrt) 
Throwin' money on your body (yeah)
Pop the G6 and it feel like molly
VIP list, this ain't for everybody (VIP list)

I'm on, I can meet a bitch the same day and take her home (home)
They know that I'm gifted, I'm the one that's on my own (own)
Nigga, start to switchin', cleared my vision, now, we grown (grown)
I been on one mission, run my digits, then, I'm gone (I'm gone on 'em)
Wanna go back home (gone on 'em)
Man, I feel like I be so alone (phew)
Mama say, "Be strong" (strong)
When you is the king of the throne

Runnin' to the racks 'til my legs 'bout to fall off (fall off)
I been doin' this shit for a minute, I won't fall off (fall off)
Granddaddy seventy, he still sleepin' with his sawed-off (bah)
Then, I bought Ferrari, I decided take the top off (skrrt)
I decided knock a opp off (bah)
I can't go to sleep, I pop a Xan' just to nod off (Xan')
Shawty fine as hell, but she a fan, can't get knocked off (fan)
Know I'm walkin' 'round with all these bands, don't get popped off (bands)
Yeah, and you know I'm walkin' 'round this bitch with them blues (blues)
Diamonds on her wrist and I done blew the bitch cool (ha)
She can't believe who she fuckin', she don't know how to move
I ain't got no time, and I ain't tryna teach her how to wine it and dine it (dine it)
Just because she shinin' don't mean she a diamond (diamond)
I ain't blinded, I know what goin' on

I'm on, I can meet a bitch the same day and take her home (home)
They know that I'm gifted, I'm the one that's on my own (yeah)
Nigga, stop the switchin', cleared my vision, now, we grown (grown)
I been on one mission, run my digits, then, I'm gone (gone on 'em)
Wanna go back home (gone on 'em)
Man, I feel like I be so alone (gone on 'em)
Mama say, "Be strong" (strong)
When you is the king of the throne 

I can meet a bitch the same day and take her home
Nigga, start to switchin', cleared my vision, now, we grown
They know that I'm gifted, I'm the one that's on my own
I been on one mission, run my digits, then, I'm gone
