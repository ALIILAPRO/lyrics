		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found (hey ya)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground (hey ya)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around (hey ya)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me!

I won't deny I've got in my mind now all the things we'd do
So I'll try to talk refined for fear that you find out how I'm imaginin' you

I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love (hey ya)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of (hey ya)
That's found in the last witness
Before the wave hits
Marvelling at God (hey ya)
Before he feels alone
One final time 
And marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me

I won't deny I've got in my mind now all the things I would do
So I'll try to talk refined for fear that you find out how I'm imaginin' you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now all the things we could do
So I'll try to talk refined for fear that you find out how I'm imaginin' you
