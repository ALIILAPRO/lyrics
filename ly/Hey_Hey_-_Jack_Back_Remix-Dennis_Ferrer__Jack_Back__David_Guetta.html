		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
I had my feet on the ground
So much for that

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
And now my life's upside down
Imagine that

And it's all because I heard you say
And it's all because I heard you say
And it's all because I walked your way

I heard you say

And I heard you say
Hey hey

Oh just right
You got to sit tight
Close your eyes
And let your head go down
Let your feet up off the ground

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
I had my head straight and sound
They've told me that

Just an ordinary day
Till you came around
And now my life is on the bounce
Just like that

And it's all because I walked your way
And it's all because I heard you say
And I should've known to stay away

But I heard you say

I heard you say

And I heard you say
Hey hey
