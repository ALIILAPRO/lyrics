		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just understand me, player
Left side, jump, right side, jump
We gon' set this thing off right
East side, jump, West side, jump
We gon' set this thing off right
North side, jump, South side, jump
We gon' set this thing off right
I said North side, jump, South side, jump
We gon' set this thing off right, ow

If you want it, I got all the flavors you need
Get up on it, come apply that pressure on me
You've been waiting, saying what you gon' do, we gon' see
That's right, we gon' see what it do, ah, ah
Tell me something, you came all this way, slow down
Boy, stop frontin', right now ain't the time to back down
Just enjoy it, I got all this candy, so sweat
This candy so sweat, baby, ooh

Turn down the lights
I can turn it on, yeah, to turn you on, baby
Tonight's the night
You see me perform, yeah, we taking off, baby (ow)

You like it when I make that thang jump
You go wild when I make that thang jump
It get loud when I make that thang jump
It's a party when I make that thang jump, jump
You like it when I make that thang jump
You go wild when I make that thang jump
It get loud when I make that thang jump
It's a party when I make that thang jump, jump, jump (ow)

You can't believe it, baby, I ain't playing no games
Can you feel it? You'll be yelling out my whole name
It's an experience, to get the boy it's only one way
It's only one way, it's all on you, ah
I know what you want from me
Get it, get it, get it, get it
You wanna have fun with me
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Wanna be on the winning team
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Well, baby, you should roll with me
Get it, get it, get it (ow)

Turn down the light
I can turn it on, yeah, to turn you on, baby
Tonight's the night
You see me perform, yeah, we taking off, baby (ow)

You like it when I make that thang jump
You go wild when I make that thang jump
It get loud when I make that thang jump
It's a party when I make that thang jump, jump, jump

I like the way you make it jump for me, jump
Hood chick, she ain't even get you jump for me, get jump
C'mon, so be careful when you come for me
I got only real ones in my company, whoa, whoa, whoa
Now come and have fun with me (city)
Acaba con una fiesta pero empieza aqui
(From the streets, c'mon, to the club, let's go)
(One, one, two, two, three, ladies)
Now stop (ah), let it breathe (ah)
Get low (ah), to your knees (ah)
Let's stomp (ah) in the streets (ah)
Now jump, now jump, now jump, now jump
Now stop (ah), let it breathe (ah)
Get low (ah), to your knees (ah)
Let's stomp (ah) in the streets (ah)
Now jump, now jump, now jump, now jump

You like it when I make that thang jump
You go wild when I make that thang jump
It get loud when I make that thang jump
It's a party when I make that thang jump, jump, jump
You like it when I make that thang jump
You go wild when I make that thang jump
It get loud when I make that thang jump
It's a party when I make that thang jump, jump, jump (ow)

Left side, jump, right side, jump
We gon' set this thing off right
East side (ay), jump, West side (ay), jump
We gon' set this thing off right (ay)
North side (ay), jump, South side (ay), jump
We gon' set this thing off right (ay)
I said North side (ay), jump, South side (ay), jump
We gon' set this thing off right, jump
