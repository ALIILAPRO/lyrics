		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Way out in the way out
Stars keep on trying to shine
And there's a lonely heartbeat
Beating like mine
Wondering why

Some moments are magic
Some are only tripping the line
And every word we're hearing
Sounds like goodbye
But we got the night

Baby, what are we holding on to?
Baby, where do we wanna run to?
Oh, we'll figure it out somehow-ow-ow
Keep holding on to now-now

Dreaming we'll be dancing forever
Floating on this feeling together
Yeah, we'll figure it out somehow-ow-ow
Keep holding on to now-now-now-now

Can you just imagine
Magic taking control?
And every second's yours to
Have and to hold
Shining like gold

Baby, what are we holding on to?
Baby, where do we wanna run to?
Oh, we'll figure it out somehow-ow-ow
Keep holding on to now-now

Dreaming we'll be dancing forever
Floating on this feeling together
Yeah, we'll figure it out somehow-ow-ow
Keep holding on to now-now-now-now

Hold on to now
Hold on to now

Baby, what are we holding on to?
Baby, where do we wanna run to?
Oh, we'll figure it out somehow-ow-ow
Keep holding on to now-now

Dreaming we'll be dancing forever
Floating on this feeling together
Yeah, we'll figure it out somehow-ow-ow
Keep holding on to now-now-now-now

And we're all just going, going 'round
So where we going, going now? (Hold on to now)
The world could all be falling down (hold on to now)
But we'll be holding on to now

And we're all just going, going 'round
So where we going, going now? (Hold on to now)
The world could all be falling down (hold on to now)
But we'll be holding on to now
