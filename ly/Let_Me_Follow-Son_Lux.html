		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can break, throw yourself away
Leave it behind, become undone
And, if you need to, you can break me too
You can disappear

Please, just take me with you when you go
Or let me follow let me follow

Take me with you, take me with you
Or let me follow
Take me with you, take me with you
Or let me follow after you

We can run, forget ourselves
Leave them behind, we can make believe
Tell our story and live another life
And so reappear

Take me with you, take me with you
Or let me follow
Take me with you, take me with you
Or let me follow
Take me with you, take me with you
Or let me follow
Take me with you, take me with you
Or let me follow after you

We can disappear
