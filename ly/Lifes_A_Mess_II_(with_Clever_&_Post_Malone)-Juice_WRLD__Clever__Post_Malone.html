		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody?
Not just somebody
No, no
(Rex, you did it again)

Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world? Um
I really hope they held you down, I really hope it was no lying
'Cause when heart breaks it feel like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towel, I know it feels like you're the only one trying
You just gotta learn to live and love on

I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screamin' out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free

Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, and I found it

Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
There's one that won't never leave you cold or place nothin' above you
That will love a heart that hurts, don't hurt the heart that loves you
Sometimes they just want what they can't have, forbidden fruit
But the one that deserves your love will never pick and choose
There was once a hole in my heart, that hole was hurtin'
'Til I took a peek inside, lately, I've been soul searchin'
When I used to cry I turned to medication
Then I found me somethin' real and forgot all the imitations
Just tell me that you'll never leave, and when there's nothin' left to say
Tell me that you'll love me anyway, ah

Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, and I found it

Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
And I swear I would never leave you cold, there ain't no one above you
You were way too high to touch, I was high enough to pass out
When you were so alone, I was a stone's throw away
I remember those lips, I remember how they taste
I been starin' at the wall doin' nothin' all day
I remember everything, put the bottle to my face
Dom PÃ©
If you gave up on me now, I would seriously be so fucked up
I'm doin' everything I can just to keep myself from throwin' up
Never gave a fuck what they say 'bout us
Fuck all of you muhfuckers slowed me up
And fuck everything that ruined us
I'm three seconds away from pullin' out my gun
