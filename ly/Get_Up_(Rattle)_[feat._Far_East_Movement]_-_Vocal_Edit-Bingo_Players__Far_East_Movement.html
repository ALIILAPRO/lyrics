		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo
This house party is crazy,
My crew is hella wavy
Yo, flip the cut, then say what's up, then slide out with your lady
No ifs or buts about it,
My style is technotronic
Got grips and models so spin the bottle, girl I'm just getting started

Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the base
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get
Get up!

Yeah
We be raging round the clock, feel that base around the block
Fill that red cup to the top, birthday shots
Doesn't matter, who you are, look around, we in the stars
Round the world, we party all, we go all night strong until we drop

Get up, get up, get up
Pump the volume, feel the base
Get up, get up, get up
Turn me on and let me do my thang
Get up, get up, get up
We in the house and we here to stay
Get up, get up, get
Get up

Get up, get up, get up
Pump up the base (party time)

Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your, put your hands up
Put your hands, put your hands up (Get up)

Yo we ain't going home,
It's 6 in the morn'
This house is bumping,
Grind and get the friction on (get the friction on)
We ain't going home,
Even when the lights come on
This house is bumping,
Base still goin strong (get up!)
