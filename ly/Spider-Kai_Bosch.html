		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love is a spider
I keep it inside my fist
Non the wiser
Its not designed to live
without air space 
I keep it in a jar watch it suffocate 
Such a damn waste
With its crushed little legs out of the fire escape
Weaving words beside ya
When did you decide 
My love is a spider to be stepped
Creeping up behind ya
Stuck in strings it binds on
Love is inside ya
Its crawling up your ribs
trying to find a
Exit in your lips
Without air space 
I can't keep it in a jar watch it suffocate 
Such a damn waste
With its crushed little feet under body weight
Leaving words beside ya
When did you deicide 
Love is a spider to be stepped
Creeping up behind ya
Stuck in strings it binds on
Love is a spider and you stepped on it
Love is a spider and you stepped on it
