		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, we be on it, we be on it
We be on it, yeah, we be on it
Yeah, we be on it, yeah, we be on it
Getting to the money, getting to the money

Yeah, we be on it, we be on it
We be on it, yeah, we be on it
Yeah, we be on it, yeah, we be on it
Getting to the money, getting to the money

I woke up like this
Tell these super lame bitches to boss up like this
Shit deep, they ain't know that I was cut like this
Yeah, all my niggas cut like this
Yeah, I get a rush from this

I woke up like this
Tell these super lame bitches to boss up like this
Shit deep, they ain't know that I was cut like this
Yeah, all my niggas cut like this
Yeah, I get a rush from this

They be like, "who that?"
She a little thug, she be rapping like she 2Pac
All I need is gold teeth to go with this toothpick
Tryna pull up in the Ghost on these bitches like boo-yeah
I don't gang bang but I put your whole crew wacked
Strip a nigga naked, I'm like how you wanna do that?
Bitches they be tripping, we better keep a shoe strap
Hating ass niggas in the way, I tell them move back, cause

We be on it while y'all yawning
Yeah, we be on it while y'all yawning
Getting to the money, early in the morning
While y'all yawning

I woke up like this
Tell these super lame bitches to boss up like this
Shit deep, they ain't know that I was cut like this
Yeah, all my niggas cut like this
Yeah, I get a rush from this

I woke up like this
Tell these super lame bitches to boss up like this
Shit deep, they ain't know that I was cut like this
Yeah, all my niggas cut like this
Yeah, I get a rush from this

I be jiggin' doing the Dej dance
7-Mile all over, might boss up and do the Blade dance
I just wanna make bands, I don't wanna make friends
I just wanna pull up on my ex and be a hater
If you ain't getting money, I'm like, "get the fuck from way here"
I ain't with that welfare, I be making sales, yeah
I can't do free features cause my niggas need that bail fare
All white coat, bitch I'm looking like I smell good
Sweep the whole block, we gon' even get the mailman
Oh shit, drive by, black on black Caravan
Man down, hands down, don't nobody say shit
Ay, we be on it

We be on it while y'all yawning
Yeah, we be on it while y'all yawning
Getting to the money, early in the morning
While y'all yawning

I woke up like this
Tell these super lame bitches to boss up like this
Shit deep, they ain't know that I was cut like this
Yeah, all my niggas cut like this
Yeah, I get a rush from this

I woke up like this
Tell these super lame bitches to boss up like this
Shit deep, they ain't know that I was cut like this
Yeah, all my niggas cut like this
Yeah, I get a rush from this
