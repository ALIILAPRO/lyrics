		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you ever wonder what's inside that keeps us together?
Did you ever want to take that knife and discover?
Like cutting into a sack of grain
Going to watch our love run away
And look at each other
Sometimes it seems we're joined at our sides
It keeps us together
I like to think we're not along for the ride
But sometimes I wonder
So go and cut into that sack again
See if we're worth it anyway
And look at each other

Did you ever wonder what's inside that keeps us together?
Did you ever want to take that knife and discover?
So go and cut into that sack again
See if we're worth it anyway
And we're on different sides of the line
And we look at each other
There's trains approaching from either side
Going to jump over those tracks for you
Go anywhere you're going to
I'm going with you
