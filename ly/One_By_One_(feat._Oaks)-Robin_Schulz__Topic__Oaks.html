		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come keep me up, this one's for us
Pour up the memories one by one

Late night in the city
Lucid fever dream
Neon lights all up and down the street

Young love in the backseat
We got all we need
Dancin' in the dark to your heartbeat, heartbeat

Come keep me up, our night is young
Pour up the memories one by one
Come keep me up, this one's for us
Pour up the memories one by one
Come keep me up

Come keep me up

Late night in the city
Americana dream
Stay right here forever, never leave (don't leave)

Young love in the backseat
We got all we need
Dancin' in the dark to your heartbeat, heartbeat

Come keep me up
Come keep me up

Come keep me up, our night is young
Pour up the memories one by one
Come keep me up, this one's for us
Pour up the memories one by one
Come keep me up

Come keep me up

Come keep me up, our night is young
Pour up the memories one by one
Come keep me up, this one's for us
Pour up the memories one by one
