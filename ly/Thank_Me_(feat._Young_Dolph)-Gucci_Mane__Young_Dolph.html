		  (Okay, Kori says, "Rollin'")
Mwah
If you smokin' good here, make some motherfuckin' noise (yeah)
(It's Gucci)
Uh-huh

In the strip club, throwin' up these fives
When I walk in, them bitches they get live (they get live)
Say she fuck me, she a motherfuckin' lie (bitch)
She just gave me some good head while I drive 
Yeah, looked her in her eye and told her, "You should thank me" (you should thank me)
Just 'cause you eatin' it up, don't mean that you could drink me (uh-uh)
I made her stop and roll me up a blunt of stanky (ayy, roll that)
She got a nigga at home she love, but, he ain't me (damn)
I turned a quiet fine bitch into my little porno star
Got a pocket full of trap money, so I just bought the bar
Sprayin' champagne on these bitches, and I'm pourin' up that raw
Ayy, if I want it, I go get it, I don't care what it cost, nah
Told her, "Bring a friend, well, girl, let's go have some fun" (let's do it)
What's that on my backseat? That's a hundred-round drum (a hundred)
I'm something like a pimp, walked in with five hoes on my arm (woo)
I smashed her, then I told her, "Bitch, that pussy bomb" (hey)

I got a pocket full of blue cheese, blue cheese (haha)
So many hundreds that is bustin' out my blue jeans
I got that blue cheese, I got that new cheese
Who wanna come get some of this motherfuckin' money?
Yes, you should thank, th-thank, th-th-th-thank me (uh-uh)
And, you should thank, th-thank, yeah, you should thank me (you should thank me)
And, you should thank me, you should thank me (it's Gucci, huh)
And, you should thank, th-thank, man, you should thank me

She wanna date me, she wanna rape me
I'm Gucci Mane, and I know these niggas hate me
Sucker so hateful, ho so ungrateful
But, I keep throwin' up the money, that's what it's made for
Plus, all this jewelry on my neck, it disrespect a nigga
All this blue cheese in my pocket, it protect a nigga
I got my check poked out so far 'cause I'm successful, nigga
Got too much money on me, man, I need an extra, nigga
I'm runnin' crazy, somebody, help me
When I went broke, I swear to God, them niggas left me
I move to South Beach, who want a jetski? (Wow)
These bitches lyin' on they pussy, they never met me (Wop)

I got a pocket full of blue cheese, blue cheese
So many hundreds that is bustin' out my blue jeans
I got that blue cheese, I got that new cheese
Who wanna come get some of this motherfuckin' money?
Yes, you should thank, th-thank, th-th-th-thank me (uh-uh)
And, you should thank, th-thank, yeah, you should thank me (you should thank me)
And, you should thank me, you should thank me
And, you should thank, th-thank, man, you should thank me (huh)
