		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

One, two, three, four
We're separated by a margin of a greater degree
The same flesh and blood but in a different lane
I read the remedy too, but my words
They still sounded the same

When we were young
We thought we had the whole world figured out (figured out)
Now all we do is speak in tongues (speak in tongues)
We play a losing game
Only now we hear the shouts fading out
We flew into the sun

Oh
We flew into the sun

I'm dedicated to the shadow that's been following me
It caught me counting the cards, I guess the rules remain
Oh, it was heavenly then
But the devil's were calling my name

When we were young
We thought we had the whole world figured out (figured out)
Now all we do is speak in tongues (speak in tongues)
We play a losing game
Only now we hear the shouts fading out
We flew into the sun

Is there something in your eye?
Did you fall or were you just on a high?
Everybody's so afraid they could die
But they never once said
Thank god we're alive, oh

Is there something in your eye?
Did you fall or were you just on a high?
Everybody's so afraid they could die
But they never once said
Thank god we're alive

When we were young
We thought we had the whole world figured out (figured out)
We flew into the sun
We thought we had the whole world figured out (figured out)
Now all we do is speak in tongues (speak in tongues)
We play a losing game
Only now we hear the shouts fading out
We flew into the sun
