		  Son of a bitch 
God likes me
I am the best
Fuck everybody else
Suck on my dick
I'm perfect
I am the best
Fuck everybody else
(God likes me)

I need a witness to my life
It wasn't this way all the time
Got money, got girls, get high
Can you fuckin' believe it?

I need a witness to my life
It wasn't this way all the time
No money, no girls, denied

Can you fuckin' believe it? No 
Can you fuckin' believe it? No 
Can you fuckin' believe it? No 
Can you fuckin' believe it? No

I am born again hard
I am born again hard

Got money, got girls, get high

It wasn't this way all the time
No money, no girls, denied
Can you fuckin' believe it?

Got money, got girls, get high
Everybody everybody everybody everybody
Got money, got girls, get high

Got money, got girls, get high 
Got money, got girls, get high 
Can you fuckin' believe it?

I need a witness to my life
It wasn't this way all the time
No money, no girls, denied
Can you fuckin' believe it?
