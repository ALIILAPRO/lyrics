		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And my eyes get low in that all white truck
I can barely see shit
And my eyes get low in that all white truck
I can barely see
(Girl, I might be)

And I overflow like mercury
Glowing with uncertainty (glowing with uncertainty)
Circles at the Chevron (girl, I might be)
Huh, I might be forever gone (bitch, I might be gone)
And my eyes get low in that all white truck
I can barely see shit
Hit the gas like you wouldn't believe it
Thank God I was always healing
In a time so slow I was thinking 'bout us rearranging pieces
Speeding up on that all black Demon
Going West, I don't got no reasons
I was throwing stones at Hercules
Throwing them so perfectly
Circles at the Chevron
I can't be forever young

Empty choir, operated from above
My voice will be their voice until I'm free (free, free, free)
My hands will be their hands until I'm free (free, free, free)
