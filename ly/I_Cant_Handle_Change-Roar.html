		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hangin' out where I don't belong is nothing new to me
I get tired and I get sick and then I lose the strength to leave

I can't handle change
I can't handle change

Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good

Nothing I do is ever good
Nothing I do is ever good enough
Nothing I do is ever good

Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
(I wanna go home now)

I can't help but repeat myself
I know it's not your fault
Still lately I begin to shake
For no reason at all

For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
For no reason at all
