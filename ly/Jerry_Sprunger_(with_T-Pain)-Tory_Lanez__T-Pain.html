		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do, you do
You do, you do
You do, you do
You do

She used to work at King of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every week, you shoulda seen her
The way she did it, nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit for my birthday
And I can tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil mama getting it in all on her worst day
Lil mama getting it in, she fit the school and the gym 
Into her workday
I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you not his chick
She wanted a nigga and got the right one
I wanted to bag she lookin' like fun
Pull up on me baby and spend the night, ah
They sayin' I'm sprung, they right

I can't let you go without me
Shawty got me (ooh)
Wait, now lil mama tryna lock me (ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
I can't let you go without me
Shawty got me
Wait, now lil mama tryna lock me (ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
You, you, do, do, do
You sprung me, baby, I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You unknot me, baby, I'ma undo
You, you, do, do, do
I'm like a faucet, baby, I'ma buss' you too
You do too, too, too
I'm sprung and it's true, 'cause

Ooh, you did it, ooh, did it ooh
I already know what it takes to get into you
Ooh, bring it back, she put that pussy on me
She know how to make it clap, make it clap
I make it clap yo, I make it clap yo
I had them haters asking how you up in that Rolls
And how them umbrellas coming out of locked doors
How the front doors open up like the back doors
I'll be like, "You ain't rich enough
You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini, on the beach sittin' up"
Now you pitching up, now your bitch wit' us
She said that champagne nasty, spit it up
Tory took one line and made a hot song
Now the chicks want tapes I am not gone
But it's been five times, you ain't catch on
Maybe on the next song

I can't let you go without me
Shawty got me (ooh)
Wait, now lil mama tryna lock me (ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
I can't let you go without me
Shawty got me
Wait, now lil mama tryna lock me (ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
You, you, do, do, do
You sprung me, baby, I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You unknot me, baby, I'ma undo
You, you, do, do, do
I'm like a faucet, baby, I'ma buss' you too
You do too, too, too
I'm sprung and it's true, 'cause

I'm sprung, dawg she got me
Got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you
I'm sprung, dawg she got me
Got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you

You're so sexy to me
Sexy to me
Give a damn who your ex be
I be flyin' to you jet speed (fly)
You sexy
Make me wanna get messy
Make me wanna give it to you all day, all night
In the broad light, give a damn who catch me
You sexy
Sprung, girl, you get me
Got me doing things I never do
And it's true
