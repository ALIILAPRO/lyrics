		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been countless times
That I've told myself
I didn't feel a thing for you
When I was sitting all alone
On my bed, thinking about you
And how you made me feel
In a way I've never felt before
Sometimes I felt like we were
The only ones in the world
It's really easy to get stuck
When it's only me and you
I would've stayed just for you
Over and over and over and over again
I tell myself
I won't run back to you
You don't understand how much it hurts
To see you with someone new
To see that you have moved on
Everything falls into place when you are close to me
I'm trying to erase off my mind, all these memories
Sometimes I'd cry over you
And blame it on something else
I'd want to go and step outside
And scream out your name
I don't know what I'm going to do
Without you here, oh no
Over and over and over and over again
I tell myself
I won't run back to you
You don't understand how much it hurts
To see you with someone new
To see that you have moved on
Everything falls into place when you are close to me
I'm trying to erase off my mind all these memories
