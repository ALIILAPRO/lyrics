		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry 
Is all that you can say 
Years gone by and still 
Words don't come easily 
Like sorry, like sorry

Forgive me
Is all that you can't say 
Years gone by and still 
Words don't come easily 
Like forgive me, forgive me 

But you can say baby 
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Maybe if I told you the right words 
Ooh, at the right time you'd be mine 

I love you 
Is all that you can't say 
Years gone by and still
Words don't come easily 
Like I love you, I love you

But you can say baby 
Baby, can I hold you tonight?
Maybe if I told you the right words 
Ooh, at the right time you'd be mine 

Baby, can I hold you tonight? 
Maybe if I told you the right words 
Ooh, at the right time you'd be mine
You'd be mine
You'd be mine
