		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

May, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may, may, may, may (so)
May, may, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may, may, may, may, (oh)
May, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may, may, may, may (so)
May, may, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

May, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may, may, may, may (so)
May, may, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may, may, may, may, (oh)
May, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may, may, may, may (so)
May, may, may, may, may, may, may
May, may, may

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
