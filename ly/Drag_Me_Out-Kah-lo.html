		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't like none y'all hoes, I'm bored
What, what
What, what

Doesn't anyone dance in this town no more?
Why am I the only one on the dance floor?
The DJ's killin' it, drinks is poured
I don't like none of y'all hoes, I'm bored
I'm tryna get loose with it
Shake a little somethin', get the whole crew with it
Shots to the head got the whole room spinnin'
'Cause it can all end in a New York minute

I like to party, I like to get it started (hey, hey, hey)
I'm spendin' all my money, I'm not leavin' till mornin' (hey, hey, hey)
I like to party, I like to get it started
I'm spendin' all my money, I'm not leavin' till mornin'

Drag me out (hey, hey, hey)
These hoes better drag me out (hey, hey, hey)
'Cause imma make it do what it do (hey, hey, hey)
'Cause I'm in a whole different mood from you (hey, hey, hey)
Drag me out (hey, hey, hey)

Take a pic, it'll last long
Gotta go cause they playing my song
If I don't get down that'll be wrong
Let it go on, imma need a rewind, ooh
This drink is too strong
There's two of you, so I know I'm on one
There's no more words for this song
Dadadadadadadadadada, aye

I like to party, I like to get it started (hey, hey, hey)
I'm spendin' all my money, I'm not leavin' till mornin', aye (hey, hey, hey)
I like to party, I like to get it started
I'm spendin' all my money, I'm not leavin' till mornin'

Drag me out, hahaha
These hoes better drag me out, oh, shit
'Cause imma make it do what it do (hey, hey, hey)
'Cause I'm in a whole different mood from you (hey, hey, hey)
Drag me out, oh, damn (hey, hey, hey)

I like to party, I like to get it started (what, what)
I'm spendin' all my money, I'm not leavin' till mornin', aye (what, what)

I don't like none of y'all hoes, I'm bored (bored, bored)
Doesn't anyone dance in this town no more? (more, more)
(More, more, more)
I don't like none of y'all hoes, I'm bored
