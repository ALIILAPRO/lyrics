		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let 'em have their time
Sit back and let 'em shine
Let 'em rise and rise
'Cause one day they're gonna fall

Let 'em soak in the sun
Sit back and let 'em have their fun
Let 'em spill their guts
'Cause one day they're gonna slip on 'em

Well, I could be angry but you're not worth a fight
And besides, I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and I'm feeling alright
And besides, I'm moving on

Let 'em play their songs
Let 'em say what's right and wrong
Let 'em do their thing
'Cause it'll never be you and me

We got our own style
We got a way of living life
If they can't get down
Well, we don't need them around

Well, I could be angry but you're not worth a fight
And besides, I'm moving on
I've counted to ten and I'm feeling alright
And besides, I'm moving
Yes, I'm moving
Besides, I'm moving on
