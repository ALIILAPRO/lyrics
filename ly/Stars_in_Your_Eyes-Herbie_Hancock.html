		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black days
You've changed
Oh have you left me here to rot?
I kid you not
I miss you girl
You're all that makes me true

Your breath, your scent
Follows drifting on the vapor
I can't escape her
She was my love now she's pushing me away

The night that we met
The back of the show
My favorite band
But you wouldn't know
From looking at me
All wrapped up in you
But where can you be now
And what can I do for you?

Just say "Maxim, I love you
I need you. And no one will do but you"
"Maxim, I love you
I miss you. And no one will do but you"

No one will do but you
No one will do but you
No one will do but you
No one will do

Black days
Black days, oh
Black days
Black days
