		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The image in your eyes
Reflecting the pain that has taken you
I hear it in your voice, so ridden with shame
From what's ailing you

I won't give up so don't give in
You've fallen down but you can rise again
So don't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Lost in your world of lies
I find it so hard to believe in you
Can it be real this time?
Or just a part of this game that we're playing through

I won't give up so don't give in
You've fallen down but you will rise again
I won't give up

When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight

Don't let it take your soul
Look at me take control
When knowing to fight this war
This is nothing worth dying for

Are you ready to begin?
This is a battle that we are gonna win

When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason
When the demon that's inside you is ready to begin
And it feels like it's a battle that you will never win
When you're aching for the fire and begging for your sin
When there's nothing left inside, there's still a reason to fight
I'll be your reason to fight
Give you a reason to fight
