		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's so simple to look at every little thing I do wrong
It's so simple to overlook every little thing I do right, right?

I think too much, I feed too much
I'm gone too much, I skate too much
I snore too much, I'm blowin' too much
I ate too much I'm way too much too stuck up

You're probably right
This time, but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time, but I don't even care

I dream too much I think too much
I step too much, those things too much
I am too much, I'm pissed too much
I need too much, I'm not one to trust

You're probably right
This time, but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time, but I don't even care
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't speak

I'm blowin' too much I think too much
I eat too much my face too much

I feed too much, I piss too much
I sleep too much, I snap too often

You're probably right
This time, but I don't want to listen
You're probably right
This time, but I don't even care

And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't say it
And if it was mine to say
I wouldn't speak
