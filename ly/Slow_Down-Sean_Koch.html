		  Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
  
Looks like you got something thing to tell me
I can see it in your eyes
Your body language seems uneasy
Someplace else in your mind.
  
Are you in the fast lane trying to find your balance, 
Ive heard so much about it but nobody has it. 
Maybe its time to take a little  trip away, 
a time to rest and disconnect from all these daily ways.  

Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah

Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Everybody take a breather

I hope you take a break when its needed, 
I hope you find some space to breath.
I know it can feel suffocating,
in this modern age and everybody's expectations.

I hope you take some time to daydream, 
close your eyes, drift away and disappear completely.
I hope you take some time alone,
to feel what is real with nobody to please. 

Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah

Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah

Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah

Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Slow Down yeah
Everybody take a breather
