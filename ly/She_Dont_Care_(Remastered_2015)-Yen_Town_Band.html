		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She don't care
Taking what you give her
She don't care
About the way you dress
She don't care
Talk to you about nothing
She don't care
Thank you for your time

Don't be a sick-boy
Stick to what you felt the way you want
You wanna tell her how you miss her everyday
Don't be a looser
Kicking and shouting all the way home
And when they get you there
You're left with nothing to say

Sweet as sugar
Took so much, you nearly lost your mind
And then you turned around and left when you could stay
Don't be a jerk 
Pretending that you're the only one
You try to look but never see and that's okay

She don't care
Taking what you give her
She don't care
About the way you dress
She don't care
Talk to you about nothing
She don't care
Thank you for your time

Sit by the telephone today in case you call
(But I don't want to)
Watching the telephone again, it gets me down
I don't need this affair
Call on me today, ah, ah

You try to look but never see and that's okay

She don't care
Taking what you give her
She don't care
About the way you dress
She don't care
Talk to you about nothing
She don't care
Thank you for your time

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Love me again, love me again, love me again
