		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's go girls 
Come on

I'm going out tonight, I'm feelin' alright
Gonna let it all hang out
Want to make some noise, really raise my voice
Yeah, I want to scream and shout, ah

No inhibitions, make no conditions
Get a little outta line
I ain't gonna act politically correct
I only want to have a good time

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and

Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I want to be free yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman! Woo

The girls need a break tonight we're gonna take
The chance to get out on the town
We don't need romance, we only want to dance
We're gonna let our hair hang down

The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun and

Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild, yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I want to be free yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman! Ow ow uh huh

Oh oh yeah
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun (fun, fun)

Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy, forget I'm a lady
Men's shirts, short skirts
Oh, oh, oh, really go wild yeah, doin' it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action, feel the attraction
Color my hair, do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I want to be free yeah, to feel the way I feel (feel the way I feel)
Man! I feel like a woman!

Woo, oh, oh
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah
I get totally crazy
Can you feel it?
Come, come, come on baby
Woo, woo, woo
I feel like a woman
