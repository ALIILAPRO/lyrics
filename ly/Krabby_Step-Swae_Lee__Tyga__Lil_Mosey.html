		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me guess, tiny, a small salad?
I'll take a double triple party deluxe on a raft
Four by four, animal style
Ayy, big racks, I need that
Well done, where the cheese at?
Ayy, big flex, believe that
My friends got my back, sheesh

To the left, to the left, to the left (yay)
To the right, to the right, you're the best (yay)
Stand up, stand up, hands up (yay)
You're the best, you're the best, never give up (yay)

I'm flipping them patties, I'm chillin' with Patrick
Then both pull up backwards and they full of laughter
See Sandy Cheeks, I'm burstin' her bubble
A jellyfish lover, I'll catch me a couple (yeah)
A magical world, the F is for fun
I'd run to the sun if only I could
Now turn to your neighbor to make sure they're swell
I probably will be forever be young
I'm feeling a little bit krabby
How can I be happy when people are spending me money
The barnacles blue in the morning, I'm skipping outside
And yeah, I hope that it's sunny
Aye, aye, captain, gettin' the check and I'm gettin' the plunder
Aye, aye, captain, spark like a dolphin, I'm duckin' the Dutchman

To the left, to the left, to the left (yay)
To the right, to the right, you're the best (yay)
Stand up, stand up, hands up (yay)
You're the best, you're the best, never give up (yay)

Never wastin' my time
Young, still in my prime
I got fun on my mind
Pineapple on the side
Starfish, and I shine (yeah)
Friends coming outside, real friends, I got five
Sandy, Patrick, it's a vibe
Mrs. Puff let me drive
Whippin' the boat, I'm fine (you good?)

(Hello, Mrs. Puff)
Riding, drop the top in Bikini Bottom (drop it)
Krabby patties you know I got 'em (I got 'em)
In the ocean, you know I'm poppin' (I'm poppin)
And my pet Gary, can't leave without him (yay)

To the left, to the left, to the left (yay)
To the right, to the right, you're the best (yay)
Stand up, stand up, hands up (yay)
You're the best, you're the best, never give up (yay)

Are you ready? (Aye, aye captain)
I can't hear you (aye, aye captain)
Oh, I hop in the boat and I ride 'round the sun
No license, but Mrs. Puff, she givin' it to me
A beautiful day, what it's looking to be
So jellyfish, yeah, we just caught like three
But hold on (hold on)
We on a mission right now to find Gary, he long gone
All of my friends, and we never get scared
It's me and (Spongebob Squarepants)
Squidward and Patrick and Sandy and (Spongebob Squarepants)
Whole family like, oh

To the left, to the left, to the left (yay)
To the right, to the right, you're the best (yay)
Stand up, stand up, hands up (yay)
You're the best, you're the best, never give up (yay)
