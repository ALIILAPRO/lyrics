		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is a waltz, thinking about our bodies
What they mean for our salvation
With only the clothes that we stand up in
Just the ground on which we stand
Is the darkness ours to take?
Bathed in lightness, bathed in heat

All is well, as long as we keep spinning
Here and now, dancing behind a wall
Hear the old songs and laughter within
All forgiven, always and never been true

Oh, when I arrive, will you come and find me?
Or in a crowd, be one of them?
Mother wants us back beside her
No tomorrows, at peace
