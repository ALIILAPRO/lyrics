		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got some shit for you to come and get
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks
Hit me when you done your shift
Woo, I see you doin' well, baby
Oh, you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby (oh yeah)
Is you single or what?
I need a girl from the country
I need a girl from Kentucky
I need a shawty from Houston
I need a girl who gon' love me
I need a girl who gon' trust me
Someone to fuck me
Someone to make me feel lucky
Someone that's so proud to be with me
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that
You ain't got the juice like that"
That's cold, ice cold, girl, you ain't have to do him like that (like that)
Why you had to do him like that? (Like that)
Gotta come through quick, quick
Oh, you at the club cashin' out with Eric
Then hit me when you done your shift
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9 AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-these-strippers?" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh
Oh, me
I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know)
She's just a little too perfect
She's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no, not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer
Hit me when you're done your shift, yeah

I need some company, I need some company
I need you to take my mind off being in my prime
Some company

I'm a dog, I'm in heat, baby, heat, baby
I'm a dog, I'm in heat, baby
I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm in heat, baby
I'm in heat, baby

Motor City trip, Motor City trip right now
Yeah, I'm on a Motor City trip, I'm on a Motor City trip right now
Ayy, ayy, a Motor City trip right now
We on a Motor City trip, we on a Motor City trip right now, mmm

It's a couple faces in here that a nigga piped down
So let's go find a place that we can sip right now
Tour around the city, it's the shit right now
It's kinda lit right now that you're here right now
Pop a couple Percs, let's get it in right now
Saturday nights, off in my bed right now
Call up your girl to put them heels on
It's gettin' rowdy, rowdy right now, yeah
I'm on a Motor City trip
I'm a dog
I'm a dog, I'm in heat, baby, heat, baby
I'm a dog
I go ham, I'm a hog
Bitch so bad, coulda thought I owed her somethin'
By the way I broke her off (broke her off)
When she get too on, we take it off (take it off)
Drink so long, for a year I didn't cough (cough)
Fantasizin' and fistin' and switchin' up positions (straight up)
Do you mind if we just m√©nage just a little? (La Flame)
Yeah

Motor City trip right now, Motor City trip right now
Motor City trip right now
