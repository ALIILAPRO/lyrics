		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, hello, baby
You called, I can't hear a thing
I have got no service
In the club, you see, see
Wha-wha-what did you say?
Oh, you're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy

K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy

Just a second
It's my favorite song they're gonna play
And I cannot text you with
A drink in my hand, eh
You shoulda made some plans with me
You knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me
I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think any more
I left my head and heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk anymore
I got my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want, but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
Out in the club, and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster
I shoulda left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

Not that I don't like you
I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired
Of my phone ringin'
Sometimes I feel like
I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'

'Cause I'll be dancin'
'Cause I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'

Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think any more
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk any more
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna think any more
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin'
I don't wanna talk any more
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
I'm busy, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
Stop telephonin' me
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Can call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want but there's no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone
M-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone
M-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bub
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

We're sorry the number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number, or try your call again
