		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You-u-u
don't walk around town
just tryna function
you get down
the city don't stop
I know you been lost before
but now you're found

walking by like you got that money
you got no time for the bullshit honey
everybody's freaking out about the brand new you
you you you
and when they see you move they say
alright ok
alright ok
ok alright
ok alright I see you
ok alright I see you
oh-oh one thing about you
ain't nobody gonna get in your way
ok alright I see you
ok alright I see you

polluting your soul
ain't good for nothing
but you let go
it's out of control
the way you're running
and i think you know

walking by like you got that money
you got no time for the bullshit honey
everybody's freaking out about the brand new you
you you you
and when they see you move they say
alright ok
ok alright
ok alright I see you
ok alright I see you
oh-oh one thing about you
ain't nobody gonna get in your way
ok alright I see you
ok alright I see you

oh-oh one thing about you
ain't nobody gonna get in your way
ok alright I see you
ok alright
ok alright
ok alright
ok alright
