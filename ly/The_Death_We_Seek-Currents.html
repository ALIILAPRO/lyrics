		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With every gust of wind
We're blown further back
Forgetting more and more of our past
We sought to paint the world with our vision
Bitter times of our punishment grow far and wide ignored
Is young demise not what you asked for?

The sky, it swells and sings
Begging for death at the hands of our misery
Blind pride was our disease
The world will feel the sting
The sky, it swells and sings
Begging for death at the hands of our misery
Blind pride was our disease
Do you accept your fate?

If I fall into the sky
Who would I begin to blame?
Reaching further from the light
We become what we have made
Serenity, always running from me
Can you feel it?
Dark clouds fill the sky

As the sun begins to fade
We're swallowed in
A violent catastrophe begins

We are facing the end
We have found the death we seek
Torn apart at the dawn of suffering
Broken homes, decaying streets
Torn apart at the dawn of suffering
Chasms open beyond the scale of our perception
Disassociated with reality

The sky, it swells and sings
Begging for death at the hands of our misery
Blind pride was our disease
Do you accept your fate?

If I fall into the sky
Who would I begin to blame?
Reaching further from the light
We become what we have made
Serenity, always running from me
Can you feel it?
Dark clouds fill the sky

To know I am at fault
I bite my tongue and hang my head in shame
But I know from one look in your eyes
All along you've deceived me

Why would I ever want this?
Digging through the depths and cutting through the cracks
All I wanted was to shape the earth for you
And all you wanted was a knife digging through my back

Why would I ever want this?
Digging through the depths and cutting through the cracks
All I wanted was to shape the earth for you
And all you wanted was a knife digging through my back
