		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Free Santana bitch!

Mama told me, "Never lose, 'cause baby you a winner"
I was lurking 'round his block, he was lurking on my Twitter
At the trap with the Glocks nigga, Tay-K babysitter
I was just trying to shine like some muh'fuckin' glitter
I was under rugs with my 'cause tryna rob a plug
Little bitch hit me up she want love
I ain't show enough
I said "Bitch I'm a rugrat, I don't know how to love back"
Groupies and them dub sacks, girl that's where my love at

Choppa in the trunk
Glock in my hand
If a nigga run up on me it's a wrap like Saran (issa wrap)
Choppa in the trunk
Glock in my hand
If a nigga run up on me it's a wrap like Saran
