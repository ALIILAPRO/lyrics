		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be afraid
We're the ones who'll help you find the way
So much to say
But don't be here to stay

I woke up in despair
I look ahead, beware
To find three little ghosts in front of me, I'm scared
I look around to see if anyone else can see
But no one hears my pleas
Or cares to hear me scream

I doubt that people care
Alone and so aware
And now by myself, I'm left with all this pain to bear
With shivers going down my spine and ghosts long gone dead
But then this is what they said

Don't be afraid
We're the ones who'll help you find the way
So much to say
But don't be here to stay

Help me
Someone please come and help me
Need somebody to tell me
Please, please
What the hell is going on

Crazy
I might be going crazy
Need someone here to tell me
Please, please
How do I get along?

You're nothing but a waste
You should know your place
Just like those demons in my head, it fills up my brain
All I am doing here is begging as I'm trying my best
But it becomes a mess
The fire in my head

It's overwhelming me
But then I cannot flee
I'm stuck here all by myself, alone again it seems
With all this pain inside my head and ghosts long gone dead
But then this is what they said

Don't be afraid
We're the ones who'll help you find the way
So much to say
But don't be here to stay

Help me
Someone please come and help me
Need somebody to tell me
Please, please
What the hell is going on

Crazy
I might be going crazy
Need someone here to tell me
Please, please
How do I get along?

Save me
Someone please come and save me
Need somebody to tell me
Please, please
Just how to move on

Crazy I might be going crazy
Need someone here to tell me
Please, please
How do I get along?
