		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever felt this weight on your chest?
That makes you feel like you can't breathe?
I have! Oh, God

I can't breathe i'm struggling finding the
Balance between what i want and I need
I've been playing with God but it feels
Like the devil's been coaching the team
I got so much to say but anxiety
Whispers and tells me don't speak
I've been living on earth but one day I
Wish I could go live in my dreams

I've been lost in my mind for a minute
I'm searching for somewhere to go
(Somewhere to go)
I look right at my mom and I cry 'cause
I wish she didn't have to get old
I got all of these people around me
But why do I still feel alone?
I got all this money
I just bought a house but with nobody
In it it isn't a home
All of these contacts inside of
My phone but I
Can't come in contact with someone to hold
Sometimes I sit in the shower and cry 'cause
The water disguises my tears in the flow
Look in the mirror I don't see a soul
Looking for love but I'm on the road
This isn't a song, this is a poem, God

I can't breathe
I'm not even tired but I just want to sleep
I'm drowning in pain, it's getting too deep
This weight is enormous, I'm crying for help
But don't nobody see
I'm at war in my head every day
I've been screaming and fighting for peace!

I'm hurting, my heart's full of rage!
My life is a book that they can't even
Read 'cause I'm bleeding on every page
Our people are dying too young when we're
Tired of commenting all on their page
We just said a prayer for one and
Woke up and another was taken away
Let me know if it's better in space
I wanted the money
I got it and now that I'm
Rich I got nothing to chase (Chase)
I'd rather be happy and broke than rich and
With no one to love every day (Day)
I know everybody relates (lates)
I hope that you hear while I pray (Pray)
Let me say, God

I can't breathe (I can't)
I'm on my knees (You see me)
I'm begging you please (Please)
Yeah, they left me for dead, created a storm
They thought I would drown
But they didn't know that I am a seed

And yes I'm looking for help
I wanted to love, but I couldn't love
'cause I didn't love myself
(Can't love myself)
I done blaming everyone else
No more blaming everyone else
From now on I'm blaming myself (O oh)

I can't breathe i'm struggling finding the
Balance between what i want and I need
I've been playing with God but it feels
Like the devil's been coaching the team
I got so much to say but anxiety
Whispers and tells me don't speak
I've been living on earth but one day I
Wish I could go live in my dreams
I can't breathe i'm struggling finding the
Balance between what i want and I need
I've been playing with God but it feels
Like the devil's been coaching the team
I got so much to say but anxiety
Whispers and tells me don't speak
I've been living on earth but one day I
Wish I could go live in my dreams

I can't breathe not tired but I sleep
I cry, yes I weep
They don't know what I can't be!

I can't breathe! I'm struggling finding the
Balance between what i want and I need
I've been playing with God but it feels
Like the devil's been coaching the team
I got so much to say but anxiety
Whispers and tells me don't speak
I've been living on earth but one day I
Wish I could go live in my dreams

I can't breathe i can't breathe
I can't breathe i can't breathe
I can't - breathe
