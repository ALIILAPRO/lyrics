		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Crucify me, nail my hands to a wooden cross
There is nothing above, there is nothing below
Heaven and Hell lives in all of us
And I have been cast astray

I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of rules could salvage me
Only a shipwreck, only a ghost
Merely a graveyard of your former self
We just watched the waves crash over
I've been cast astray

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
(No one needs to know)
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
(No one needs to know)

I am an ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
Lost in the abyss, drowned in the deep
No set of rules could salvage me
Save yourself, save your breath
The tides too strong, you'll catch your death
So breathe for me, just breathe

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
And you say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
And you say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Pray for the dead
Yeah

Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your full undivided attention?
There is something you all really need to know

There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Hell, believe me I've seen it
There is a Heaven, let's keep it a secret

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

If we make it through the night, if we make it out alive
Lord have mercy and pray for the dead
You say that you can save me
Don't hope to ever find me
I fear I'm too far gone
Pray for the dead

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me

I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
I am the ocean, I am the sea
There is a world inside of me
