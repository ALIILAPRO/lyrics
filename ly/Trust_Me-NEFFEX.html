		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I take a cold hard look at the world now
Hold my hand out, got a plan now
I'ma help, be the change, 'cause I can now
Here I stand now, take my hand now
No pain, no gain, no shame
Work hard, play hard, ok
I think I get it now
Don't wanna let 'em down
I'ma take the crown and speak
My mind out loud
Here I go, proud of my notes
Teach 'em what I wrote
Teach 'em all to hope
Keep 'em on the road, the road to the dream
All you need is a team
Build your own self esteem
You can do anything, prove everything
Say what you mean and believe in your dream
Find that thing that you love
That you really wanna be and don't give up
Till you've given absolutely everything

Give me a chance now to
Prove that you're something
In your own head
All these thoughts you're confronting
We've all been there
When you feel like you're nothing
Shut that shit down
Crush those thoughts and just trust me

(Don't let me down and just trust me)
(Don't let me down and just trust me)
(Don't let me down and just trust me)
(Don't let me down and just trust me)

Round 2, what's in your head now?
Sometimes think you're better off dead now
Fuck that, yeah, you heard what I said now
Don't cop out, make a plan instead now
You got this one life, here and now
To feel the sun on your skin
And to see the clouds
There's nothing out there quite like living
It's in the simple things
Watch a kid and you'll get it
It's no heaven, but a damn close second
Can always find someone who
Has it much better
But can also find someone that
Has it much worse is the cup half full or
Do you have that curse?
Turn it all around, put your mind in reverse
When everything hurts
Go listen to these words
Your life on this earth has so much worth
You just have to find the right
State of mind that works, yeah

Give me a chance now to
Prove that you're something
In your own head
All these thoughts you're confronting
We've all been there
When you feel like you're nothing
Shut that shit down
Crush those thoughts and just trust me

(Don't let me down and just trust me)
(Don't let me down and just trust me)
(Don't let me down and just trust me)
(Don't let me down and just trust me)
