		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Change will come to those who have no fear
But I'm not her, you never were the kind who kept a rule book near
We were we like a pair of thieves, tumbled locks and broken codes
You cannot take that from me, my small reprieve is your heart of gold
We were like a battlefield locked inside a holy war, your love is my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for
