		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And so it went the children lost their minds
Begging for forgiveness was such a waste of time

And the bullets start to fly
And the bow's about to break
When you hear them cry
It's too much for me to take

They said
"The world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool"
They said "The world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to me"

And so it went the children lost their minds
Crawling over bodies of those who gave their lives

And the fists begin to throw
And the fire starts to blaze
Don't you think they know
They're the fucking human race

They said
"The world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool"
They said "The world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to"

Everyone is crying out, I can hear them scream
With all these eyes upon us, but no one seems to see
That you and me are just the same as God meant it to be
But you're much too close to me
You're much too close to me

So it went
The children lost their minds
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide

And the wind begins to howl
And the wolf is at your door
You have so much of everything
But still you wanted more

They said
"The world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool"
They said "The world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to me"

They said
"The world does not belong to you
You are not the king, I am not the fool"
They said "The world does not belong to you
It don't belong to you
It belongs to me"
