		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, uh, uh, uh

Day and night (what, what)
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind (what, what)
I look for peace but see I don't attain (what, what)
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this (what, what)
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me (what, what)
I try to run but see I'm not that fast (what, what)
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone somethings will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night

Hold the phone (what, what)
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo (what, what)
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade (what, what)
Within his dreams he see's the life he made, made
The pain is deep (what, what)
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep (what, what)
The girl he wants don't seem to want him to (what, what)
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change (never change)
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone somethings will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)

At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night
At, at, at, at, at, at night
