		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You close your eyes
And leave me naked by your side
You close the door so I can&#039;t see, the love you keep inside
The love you keep for me
It fills me up
It feel like living in a dream
It fills me up so I can&#039;t see
The love you keep inside
The love you keep for me

I stay to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay, to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I wish by god you'll stay

I stay awake
I stay awake and watch you breathe
I stay awake and watch you fly, away into the night
Escaping through a dream
I stay to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I wish by god you'll stay

Hey
Stay

I stay to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I wish by god you'll stay

Stay
Stayyy
Stayyy

I wish by god you'll stay
