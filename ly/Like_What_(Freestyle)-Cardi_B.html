		  Ayo, lemme put some gas in this muthafuckin' year, bitch
I ain't really talked my shit in a minute, like
Who the fuck these bitches really think they talkin' to?
Like, bitch, is you fuckin' dumb?

Classy and a cunt (and a cunt)
Blocks and money getting spun (gettin' spun)
Like (like), like what? (Like what?)
Like a Coach bag, baby, this ain't what you want
If I ask for it, all I wanna hear is yes (yes)
Bitch said she wanna be my opp, God bless (God bless)
Look, I ain't even got dressed
Any L that I took come after YS, oh, man (oh, man)

Baby, here we go again (here we go again)
Pussy real fat, probably got a double chin
First, that bitch hate me, then this bitch hate me
And somehow, they link up and they become friends, like, how?
Bitch, pipe down (pipe down)
Moodboard, all y'all imitating my style (mh)
Bad bitch, red lips, let me show you
White toes, eating yellowtail outta Nobu
Uh, keep a hater obsessed
In my comments, having a dick-sucking contest (contest)
I'm pressure, y'all pressed (y'all pressed)
Y'all don't get addressed, y'all's getting outdressed, look
It's a look when I'm hopping out the B (the B)
Red wig hanging down to my knees (to my knees)
It's your birthday, but they talkin' 'bout me ('bout me)
Why you mad? Take a picture, say cheese (say cheese)
You dumb, you slow, you wildin' (you wildin')
Got your first pair of Ricks, now you stylin'? (you stylin'?)
Everything you got, I had five years before
I put it on the 'Gram 'fore it even hit the store, look

Classy and a cunt (and a cunt, uh-huh)
Blocks and money getting spun (gettin' spun)
Like (like), like what? (Like what?)
Like a Coach bag, baby, this ain't what you want (uh-huh)
If I ask for it, all I wanna hear is yes (yes)
Bitch said she wanna be my opp, God bless (God bless)
Look, I ain't even got dressed
Any L that I took come after YS, oh, man

I know y'all bitches be horsin' (horsin')
Lookin' this good is really exhaustin' (exhaustin')
Diamonds hit, Stone Cold Steve Austin (ding)
Just got my lasered pussy smooth like a dolphin (ah)
Top-notch bitch get the most, not the lesser (uh)
Bitches look big like third trimester (yes)
Every time I pose, these bitches get stress-er
Y'all be putting on shit, I'll never
Bitches be hating on the low, I peep it
If I say anything mean, I mean it
I ain't never lost no nigga I needed
I'm rich, I ain't getting in no pool that's not heated (uh)
Big ass yacht and I'm having sex on it
Her life so trash, think I put a hex on it
Bitches be laughing, like ho, what's funny?
You bragging on a nigga that be dying to fuck me (fuck me)

Classy and a cunt (and a cunt, uh-huh)
Blocks and money getting spun (gettin' spun)
Like (like), like what? (Like what?)
Like a Coach bag, baby, this ain't what you want (uh-huh)
If I ask for it, all I wanna hear is yes (yes)
Bitch said she wanna be my opp, God bless (God bless)
Look, I ain't even got dressed
Any L that I took come after YS, oh, man
