		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're so certain
that you're tired of chasing ghosts.
I'm such a burden.
A parasite destroys in host.
I'm so toxic. I'm so hurtful.
Who am I to be saved?

Maybe it's the medicine,
or maybe it's the state I'm in.
You've come to save me from myself again
but you'd stay away if you know what's best.

I'm not a person,
Just a lump inside your throat.
I'm self-serving.
You've been warned don't get to close.
I'm so toxic. I'm so hurtful.
Who am I to be saved?

Maybe it's the medicine,
or maybe it's the state I'm in.
You've come to save me from myself again
but you'd stay away if you know what's best.

Maybe it's the medicine,
Or maybe it's the state I'm in.
A toast to you.
You always know what's best.
