		  Back For More
Lyrics by Kat Meoz
DID YOU THINK I’D LOSE THE MOMENT
SLIP AWAY AND PASS ME BY
IT ISN'T ANYBODY'S FAULT
IT WASN’T ANYBODY'S CALL
YOU SHOULDA BET ON IT ALL
BET ON IT ALL
IT'S THE BAIT AND SWITCH
MAKIN POOR MEN RICH
THE WRITING ON THE WALL
THAT MAKES YOU WANNA SPLIT
GETTIN MINE
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
BET YOUR LIFE
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
RIDIN' HIGH
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
GET READY I’M—
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE (OH-OH)
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE DIDN’T MENTION (HA)
I’M ALWAYS OUT TO BE FIRST (THAT’S RIGHT)
IT ISN’T ANYBODY’S FAULT
IT WASN’T ANYBODY’S CALL
WE’RE GONNA FIGHT FOR IT ALL
FIGHT FOR IT ALL
IT'S THE BAIT AND SWITCH
MAKIN POOR MEN RICH
THE WRITING ON THE WALL
THAT MAKES YOU WANNA SPLIT
GETTIN MINE
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
BET YOUR LIFE
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
RIDIN' HIGH
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
GET READY I’M—
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE (OH - OH)
YOU KNOW IT- YOU BETTER WATCH IT
WATCH YOURSELF - THAT’S RIGHT
I BET YOU DIDN’T THINK I WOULD COME BACK- WELL GUESS AGAIN
YOU THINK YOU’RE READY FOR THIS - LET’S SEE IT - YEAH
(OH-OH-OH YEAH)
GETTIN MINE
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
BET YOUR LIFE
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
RIDIN' HIGH
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE
GET READY I’M—
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE (THAT’S RIGHT)
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE (OH - OH)
I’M COMING BACK FOR MORE X 3
