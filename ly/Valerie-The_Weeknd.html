		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There comes a time in a man's life
Where he must take responsibility
For the choices he has made
And there are certain things that he must do
Things that he must say

Like I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true, ooh

I never thought I'd feel this kind of hesitation (to put)
My hand on another girl
I wish I didn't have to lie
I wish I could let you know

'Cause I love you
And I need you
I only want you
And nobody's going to know if it's true

Valerie (oh, Valerie)
I know you can see through me
(I know you can see through my lies)
Valerie (oh, Valerie)
You just choose to never know
(No, you just don't know what I do, what I do, oh, Valerie)
Valerie
Why pretend to trust in me?
(I don't know why you try to trust in me baby, but I think I know)
Valerie (I know, Valerie)
You'd rather this than be alone, oh, oh, oh

'Cause I love you
Woah, and I need you
I only want you, oh
And nobody's going to know if it's true, Oh
'Cause I love you, ooh
And I need you
I only want you, ooh
And nobody's going to know if it's true

And I love you
'Cause I love you baby
And I need you
When I need, need
I only want you
And nobody gonna know, ooh
