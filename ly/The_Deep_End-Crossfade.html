		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I built my life like my bike on a rigid frame
Nothing bends it only breaks into pieces and pieces
I waited for hope to arrive but it never came
Leaving me with only pain inside

I'm going off the deep end
I built my life on a rigid frame
So nothing bends it only breaks into pieces and pieces
I waited for hope to arrive but it never came

Leaving me with only pain inside
I'm going off the deep end
Holding on is harder than it seems
When you're reaching for so much more

Seems so much more easier to just give in
When you're reaching for so much more
Another wasted Saturday's so here I stay
But nothing seems to ever change anyway hey

All this hype about life being great
Where's the love for me these days
I'm going off the deep end
Holding on is harder than it seems

When you're reaching for so much more
Seems so much more easier to just give in
When you're reaching for so much more
Holding on is harder than it seems

When you're reaching for so much more
Seems so much more easier to just give in
When you're reaching for so much more
