		  Devil in a red dress
Call 911, I'm a killer
You know I had to come fast
Bang, bang, got my hand on the trigger
Devil in a red dress
Call 911, I'm a killer
You know I had to come fast
Bang, bang, on my hand
Bang on my hand
Bang on my

Devil in a red dress
Call 911 I'm a killer
You know I had to come fast
Bang, bang, got my hand on the trigger
Devil in a red dress
Call 911 I'm a killer
You know I had to come fast
Bang, bang, on my hand
Bang on my hand
Bang on my

Devil in a red dress
Call 911, I'm a killer
You know I had to come fast
Bang, bang, got my hand on the trigger
Devil in a red dress
Call 911, I'm a killer
You know I had to come fast
Bang, bang, on my hand
Bang on my hand
Bang on my
