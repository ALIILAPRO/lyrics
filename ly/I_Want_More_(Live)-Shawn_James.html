		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I would never have thought that I'd find what I was after
I did not expect to come here and feel this way
I must admit I saw you here from across the room
You called me in just like a siren singing her tune

And I want more of a good thing that makes me feel
And you want all I have to give sounds like a fair deal
And I want more of a good thing that makes me feel
And you want all I have to give sounds like a fair deal

If you ever wanted I'd be there front and center
If you ever needed me I wouldn't be the one to fold
I can admit I tend to bite off more than I can handle
You've got a way that swept me off of my own two feet

And I want more of a good thing that makes me feel
And you want all I have to give sounds like a fair deal
And I want more of a good thing that makes me feel
And you want all I have to give sounds like a fair deal

And I want more of a good thing that makes me feel
And you want all I have to give sounds like a fair deal
And I want more of a good thing that makes me feel
And you want all I have to give sounds like a fair deal
