		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two hearts gone cold
Some things don't grow
Your hands in mine, like leaves in snow
Like sun and rain
We just can't be
You're what I want, not what I need

So tell me, how long can we live on like this?
You're the smoke in my lungs and the scars on my skin, oh
All the air in this room, it's been wearing down thin
It's sad but it's true
'Cause we're beautiful, but we just won't make it through
Baby, you and I, we're like flowers on the moon

We've tried so hard
To make this work
Pretending fire doesn't burn
We could play fools
Ignore the cracks
But, darling, we dance on fragile glass
Oh

So tell me, how long can we live on like this?
You're the smoke in my lungs and the scars on my skin, oh
All the air in this room, it's been wearing down thin
It's sad but it's true
'Cause we're beautiful, but we just won't make it through
Baby, you and I, we're like flowers on the moon

Ooh-oh-oh
I can't grow next to you
Ooh-oh-oh
Can't breathe these toxic fumes
High over the clouds, we're jumping without a parachute
'Cause if I fall, then you'll fall too
Oh

So tell me, how long can we live on like this?
You're the smoke in my lungs and the scars on my skin, oh
All the air in this room, it's been wearing down thin
It's sad but it's true
'Cause we're beautiful, but we just won't make it through
'Cause we're beautiful, but we just won't ever bloom
Baby, you and I, we're like flowers on the moon
