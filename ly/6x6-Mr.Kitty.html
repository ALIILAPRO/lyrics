		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After the night
I head into the place
Where I can feel
A cerebral embrace
It's visceral
My walls begin to break
The hell inside my mind erased

I cleanse my thoughts
That gather through the day
It's how are you
Is everything okay
Not what I want
But something that I crave
Heaven with you is hell to me

You and I inside the six by six room
Put your hand upon my beating heart
But I know this touch won't last forever
So I'm leaving here alone (alone)
You and I inside the six by six room
Place your hand around my bleeding heart
I don't know if love will keep us together
So I'm leaving you alone

I almost wish
You put me in the grave
Though it's your fault
Would I be right again
To let you off
Go back to being friends
You never caused me any pain

It started small
My body was the host
I'm fading out
Pearlescent as a ghost
And now you'll be
Someone I used to know
So easily you let me go

You and I inside the six by six room
Put your hand upon my beating heart
But I know this touch won't last forever
So I'm leaving here alone (alone)
You and I inside the six by six room
Place your hand around my bleeding heart
I don't know if love will keep us together
So I'm leaving you alone

You and I inside the six by six room
Put your hand upon my beating heart
I don't know if love will keep us together
So I'm leaving you alone

You and I inside the six by six room
Put your hand upon my beating heart
But I know this touch won't last forever
So I'm leaving here alone (alone)
You and I inside the six by six room
Place your hand around my bleeding heart
I don't know if love will keep us together
So I'm leaving you alone
