		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you need a friend
Don't look to a stranger
You know in the end
I'll always be there

But when you're in doubt
And when you're in danger
Take a look all around 
And I'll be there

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (I promise you)
But if you'll wait around awhile, I'll make you fall for me (I promise you)
I promise, I promise you I will 

When your day is through
And so is your temper
You know what to do
I'm gonna always be there

Sometimes if I shout
It's not what's intended
These words just come out
With no cross to bear

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (I promise you)
But if you'll wait around awhile, I'll make you fall for me (I promise you)
I promise, I promise you

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (I promise you)
And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me
I promise you, I promise you I will

I gotta tell you
Need to tell you
Got to tell you
I've got to tell you

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (I promise you)
But if you'll wait around awhile, I'll make you fall for me (I promise you)
I promise, I promise you

I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say (I promise you)
I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be (I promise you)
And if I had to walk the world, I'd make you fall for me 
I promise you, I promise you I will
I will
I will
