		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up on a beach out in western florida
I thought my heart wouldn't reach
But my eyes were full of love

Your life is like a graveyard to me
And i can see you're yearning to leave
Alabama stands alone
A stagnant hole in which your thoughts'll go

And you could waste some time
A dead end job you'd keep to the end of the year
But that won't keep you here
A revoluted southern way of life is out

And you're alone to question how
Long live your atmosphere
And hide in your periphery
Old unrequited fears

Your life is like a graveyard to me
And i can see you're yearning to leave
Alabama stands alone
A stagnant hole in which your thoughts'll go
A paradise that you could never know
A stagnant hole in which you're not alone
And i can't wait to see you go
