		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love her, can't leave her
Forever I'll always need her
She lie, but I believe her
Lovesick I got that fever
Love stupid, I know it
Love stupid, I know it
I know, 'cause I'm a fool in love

My baby shot me down again,
Shot me down with a love and it go bang bang
That girl's a killer from a gang,
Shot me down with a love and it go bang bang

And oh, I love her so, that's why I gotta let her know
That I'll be here for her to always love her down

And maybe that's the truth, and pluckin' chickens ain't no use
I wanna wear my tux and see you when your gowned

Bang,
Bang,
Shot 'em with a bang,
Love him down down I shot my baby with a bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang (bang)
Bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang,
Love him down, down I shot my baby with a bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang (bang)

I love her, can't leave her
Forever I always need her
She lied, but I believe her
Lovesick I got that fever
Love stupid, I know it
Love stupid, I know it
I know, 'cause I'm a fool in love

My baby shot me down, down, down (down)
Shot me down with a love and it went pow-pow (ow)
I love my baby's freaky style (freaky)
But my baby's always sneaking out (sneaky bitch)

But damn, I love her so, that's why I gotta let her know
That I'll be here for her, I'll always be her man
And baby, that's the truth, you my chick, mother goose
I got that roof, I put that diamond on that hand

Bang,
Bang,
Shot 'em with a bang,
Love him down down I shot my baby with a bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang (bang)
Bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang,
Love him down, down I shot my baby with a bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang,
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang (bang)

Oh, yeah,
I love my baby
Hey baby yeah I love you
Stupid is what stupid do
Tom and Jerry and Scooby Doo
Oh baby, I'm a fool for you
Come here, baby, be my lollipop,
I make it better, make the booty drop
Hey baby, can't get you out my brains
Damn girl, you're such a sexy thing
You're pretty little lady, and my baby makes me go down down
And my baby make me go down down
Ey my baby make me go down down
My baby make me go down down

Hey my baby make me go down down
Ey my baby make me go down down

My baby makes me go down down
Hey my baby make me go

Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
Bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang
Love him down, down I shot my baby with a bang
Bang
Shot em' with a bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

Bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang
Love him down, down I shot my baby with a bang
Bang
Shot 'em with a bang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang (bang)
