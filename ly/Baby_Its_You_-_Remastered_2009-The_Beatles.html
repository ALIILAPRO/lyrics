		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart

Wa-oh, many many many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you
What can I do, can't help myself
'Cause, baby, it's you (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Baby, it's you (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)

You should hear what they say about you (cheat, cheat)
(Sha-la-la-la-la)
They say, they say you never never never ever been true (cheat, cheat)

Wa-oh, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? Then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause, baby, it's you (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Baby, it's you (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)

Wa-oh, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? When it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause, baby, it's you (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Baby, it's you (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Don't leave me all alone (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
Come on home (sha-la-la-la-la-la-la)
