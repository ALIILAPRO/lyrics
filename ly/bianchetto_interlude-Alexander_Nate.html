		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh I've tried, going back to the old days I've prayed
I could do em' over again
But why play pretend
When I know how it ends
I been on my own
To take my throne
But niggas talkin like they know me, no no
How do I set the tone
How do I let them know
That I got time today
This bianchetto fade me slow and I'm lackin' patience
Just know that when you talking to me
I done seen it all before
And if I never win again
Still better than it was before
It's taken me the harder way
But now the heart of me is gone
So here's my final toast
To all them niggas that don't know me no more
Oh no
One more time for the niggas in the back that don't know me no more
