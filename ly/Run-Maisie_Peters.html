		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh my, what happened here?
He came, he disappeared
He was too good to be true
Swore a lot of things, none of them new
Dropped words, forgot 'em overnight
Good thing that I'll think about them up until I die

I've been lied to, I've been cut and deleted
I've heard some things that I will leave unrepeated
I've seen some flags but the reddest one is
If a man says that he wants you in his life forever, run

If he calls you up, says he's so in love
And it's been one week you better, run
If your heart says broke and your friends say don't
It's an RIP you better, run
As fast as you can, take a quick sharp turn
At the sight of the man and make it done
If a man says that he wants you in his life forever, run

If he says he's real, he's not
If he makes you smile, he's blocked

I've been lied to, I've been cut and deleted
I've heard some things that I will leave unrepeated
I've seen some flags but the reddest one is
If a man says that he wants you in his life forever, run

If he calls you up, says he's so in love
And it's been one week you better, run
If your heart says broke and your friends say don't
It's an RIP you better, run
As fast as you can, take a quick sharp turn
At the sight of the man and make it done
If a man says that he wants you in his life forever, run

You better run
You better run
You better run
You better

He likes a promise if he don't have to keep it
He hates a sentence when he has to mean it
I know it's dark and I know that I'm young
But if a man says that he wants you in his life forever, run

(RIP) Run
Run as fast as you can, take a quick sharp turn
At the sight of the man and make it done
If a man says that he wants you in his life forever, run
