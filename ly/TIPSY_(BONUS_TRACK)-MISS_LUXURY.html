		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I'm feeling honest
I'm feeling very light-headed right now
Right now
And I'm supersonic
But it doesn't seem you like that right now
Right now
Are you feeling me and my tension
Do you like the way I'm speaking?
Do you hear me? (Do you hear me?)
And my tongue is pretty tied up from this sequin liquor bottle
Do you hear me? (Like seriously do you hear me?)
Dancing by myself I'm taking pictures of your homeboys
Dont know which way im going
Cause I lost my sense of knowing that
And my head is getting dizzy di-di-dizzy di-dizzy
Maybe it's cause I'm fucking tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-ti-ti-tipsy
And I'm pretty tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
So fucking tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
And im pretty tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
So fucking tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
Cause I dont wanna feel alone tonight
So stay right here cause a bitch be falling down tonight
Cause I'm so fucking tipsy
We in the bathroom
Throwing up a storm in your toilet (Aw fuck, damn it)
And I had your sweatshirt on
And I dont think you want it back after I did this
And im dancing in circles, oh shit! Your Ubers fucking here
But I didn't get the chance to tell you
I did all this shit because im tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
So fucking tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
And I'm pretty tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
So fucking tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
Cause I dont wanna feel alone tonight
So stay right here
Cause a bitch be falling down tonight
Cause I'm so fucking tipsy
Baby I just hope you see that the liquor isn't me
I just want you with me, only when im never tipsy
I might be a party bitch but I can make you wanna hitch
I just want you next to me only when im never tipsy
Only when I'm never tipsy
Know you want to be next to me
Me
And I'm pretty tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
So fucking tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
And i'm pretty tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
So fucking tipsy
Ti-ti-ti-ti tipsy ti-ti-tipsy ti-tipsy
Cause I dont wanna feel alone tonight
So stay right here
Cause a bitch be falling down tonight
Cause I'm so fucking tipsy
