		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  push it … and i just got my hair runnin’
‘cause i got holla on me … a lot
has my waist so skinny and my wait so chilli
you might put me .. thinking wanna f*ck with me.
put your bans on, on ..pull it on ..
has my wait so skinny and my waist so chilly
you might put me .. thinking wanna f*ck with me.

i’m a boss b*tch i ..fisrt class
i got an insurance on this .. ass,
i don’t f*ck with host ‘cause they side way
i give this money by myself
…niggas that ..shit .. baby mama …
i like big .., i like real money…

chorus:
push it … and i just got my hair runnin’
‘cause i got holla on me … a lot
has my waist so skinny and my wait so chilli
you might put me .. thinking wanna f*ck with me.
put your bans on, on ..pull it on ..
has my wait so skinny and my waist so chilly
you might put me .. thinking wanna f*ck with me.

pink bottle .., yellow bitch shopper,
pull it to the club la my f*cking helicopter
it’s another year … the year, see the badest b*tch
…paper like my neighbor…in the living room ..
she not stop, somebody lie, this b*tch …

chorus:
push it … and i just got my hair runnin’
‘cause i got holla on me … a lot
has my waist so skinny and my wait so chilli
you might put me .. thinking wanna f*ck with me.
put your bans on, on ..pull it on ..
has my wait so skinny and my waist so chilly
you might put me .. thinking wanna f*ck with me.

you still the ..b*tch in this rap shit
i don’t f*ck with all…
i call the glow lickers , they wanna lick my glow,
i put …
i got a big sake …
my diamonds look like you can eat them …
i’m fly b*tch i’m making new moves …

[chorus:]
