		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fast, a cleansed soul rebirthing
See to be and understand your flip side

You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return

All is cry until the laughing
There is more between the sky and earth
That is beyond our philosophy unknown

You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return
You want nothing in return

The closest that need you, the closest surrounding you
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away

We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away

The closest that need you, the closest surrounding you
The closest that need you, the closest surrounding you
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away

We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away
We'll walk away, we'll walk away

And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home

And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
And when we walk away there'll be no coming home
