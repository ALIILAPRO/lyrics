		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No more time and space don't exist there
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
There is a place, no time in space

I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to

I can feel the city crumbling around me
I can't seem to find my way
But I can see a bright light calling through dark night
Hoping I'll find my way

Yeah I had what I wanted
It went away so fast fast
Yeah I got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
So here we go

I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to

I can feel the heartbeat underneath the concrete
Just like a kick drum plays
Running in a straight line guided by the street lights
Pushing the dark away

Yeah I had what I wanted
It went away so fast fast
Yeah I got to let go
We can dance like there's no tomorrow

There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No oh time and space don't exist there
We can dance like there's no tomorrow
There is a place, no time in space

There is a place in the distance
A place that I've been dreaming of
No more time and space
We can dance like there's no tomorrow, oh oh oh!

I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to
I've got to go all the way
I've got tomorrow to

Tomorrow, tomorrow
We can dance
