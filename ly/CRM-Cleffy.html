		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I fell in love with her face
Though she hurts me i cant lie im obsessed
cnd i thought that i had changed
But im the same as i was last year 

Im in love with the future 
I dont wanna anothers helper 
Cant find someone whole 
So i go and fall 
For her potential 

I fell in love with her face
Though she hurts me i cant lie im obsessed
cnd i thought that i had changed
But im the same as i was last year 

When i look into her eyes i can't believe what  i see 
The reflections of my exes who i left way back when staring right back at me 
 
So im asking god why they keep sending me demons? 
Or maybe its my  reflection im no hero 

Maybe i should listen to the advice from my friends 
Theyre  getting angry  cause theyve seen this all happen 
cgain and again 
Ill find some one broken 
I help pick up all the pieces now they making amends
But all them left 
Forgot the words that they said 
cpparently this is happy ever after but im stuck in the rain  
See now they burning  sage 
Saying like they hate me
When im the one who healed they pain and now they say im crazy

I said i fell in love with her face
Though she hurts me i cant lie im obsessed
cnd i thought that i had changed
But im the same as i was last year 

Im in love with the future 
I dont wanna anothers helper 
Cant find someone whole 
So i go and fall 
For her potential
