		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you in a dream, you had stayed the same
You were beckoning me, said that I had changed
Tried to keep my eyes closed, I want you so bad
Then I awoke and it was so sad

Haven't talked to you in months
And I thought that I might cry
But I'm not that kind of guy

I saw you in a dream, you came to me
You were the sweetest apparition, such a pretty vision
There was no reason, no explanation
The perfect hallucination

All good things come to an end
But I thought that this might last
But you came and left so fast

And when I'm awake, I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)

I saw you in a dream, then it came to an end
I wonder if you'll come and visit me again
You're taking your time to reappear
I'm starting to believe that when I call your name

You just don't hear me anymore
And I know that I shouldn't even try
It's a waste of time

And when I'm awake, I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
(It isn't the same but it is enough)
And when I'm awake, I can't switch off
It isn't the same but it is enough
It isn't the same but it is enough
