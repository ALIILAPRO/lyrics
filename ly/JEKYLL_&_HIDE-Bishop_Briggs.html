		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born in a time of love
Facing the winds of pain
Storm's brewing up above
I was breakin', I was breakin'

Just to raise you up
From the grave of your mistakes
Pleasure is a kind of pain
Have I had enough?
'Cause I keep wrestlin' with snakes
Sick of all the slippery stuff

Are you Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me?
Silently, I can't see in the dark
Are you Jekyll or Hyde this time?
Where's my mind? I can't sleep in the dark

Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me

Did I make it up?
I was yesterday's regret
But today I woke up in your bed
Have I had enough?
Oh, have I had enough?
Sick of all the slippery, slippery stuff
Red apple, cherry on your lips
Killing me with every kiss

Are you Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me?
Silently, I can't see in the dark
Are you Jekyll or Hyde this time?
Where's my mind? I can't sleep in the dark (dark)

Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me
Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me

Sweet and then you're sour, changes by the hour
Never know which one I'll taste
Hot and then you're freezing, different every evening
Baby, you drive me insane

Are you Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me?
Silently, I can't see in the dark
Are you Jekyll or Hyde this time?
Where's my mind? I can't sleep in the dark

Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me
Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me
Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me
Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me
Jekyll-and-Hyde-ing me
