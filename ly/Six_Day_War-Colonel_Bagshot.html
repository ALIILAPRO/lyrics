		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the starting of the week
At summit talks you'll hear them speak
It's only Monday
Negotiations breaking down
See those leaders start to frown
It's sword and gun day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

You could be sitting taking lunch
The news will hit you like a punch
It's only Tuesday
You never thought we'd go to war
After all the things we saw
It's April Fool's Day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

We'll all go running underground
And we'll be listening for the sound
It's only Wednesday
In your shelter, dimly lit
Take some wool and learn to knit
'Cause it's a long day
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

You hear a whistling overhead
Are you alive or are you dead?
It's only Thursday
You feel the shaking of the ground
A billion candles burn around
Is it your birthday?
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Although that shelter is your home
A living space you have outgrown
It's only Friday
As you come out to the light
Can your eyes behold the sight
It must be doomsday
Tomorrow never comes until it's too late

Ain't it funny how men think
They made the bomb, they are extinct
It's only Saturday
I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late
I think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late
Think tomorrow's come, I think it's too late
