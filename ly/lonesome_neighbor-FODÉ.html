		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, how are you doing
I'm your lonesome neighbor I've got loads of room
My garden is major I just need you to
Help me make this house a home

Wherever I move, there's nothing for me
No one to call: friend, and nothing new to see
No wonder I'm so tired of being alone

I don't want to live this way I'm shaking like a child
On a wild ride through this life

Cause I'm lonesome (yes, I'm lonesome)
I'm your neighbor (I'm your neighbor)
So do me a favor (Do me a favor)
And gimme some sugar, Sugar

I know you have your doubts
But take some time to help me out
And we can have some fun along the way
And I won't have to be lonesome no more

No more, no more, no more
Hey, how are you doing
I'm your lonesome neighbor
Open the door, let me in

I'm your lonesome neighbor, baby
Won't you let me in
I'm your lonesome neighbor darling

Cause I'm lonesome (yes, I'm lonesome)
I'm your neighbor (I'm your neighbor)
So do me a favor (Do me a favor)
And gimme some sugar, Sugar
