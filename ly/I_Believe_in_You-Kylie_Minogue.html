		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't believe you know me,
Although you know my name,
I don't believe the thoughts I have 
Are only mine to blame

I don't believe the magic,
Is only in the mind,
I don't believe I'd love somebody just to pass the time

But I, I, I believe in you,
I, I, I believe in you

I don't believe that beauty,
Will ever be replaced,
I don't believe a masterpiece could ever match a face

The joker's always smiling,
In every hand that's dealt,
And don't believe that when you die 
Your presence isn't found

But I, I, I believe in you
I, I, I believe in you
But I, I, I believe in you
I, I, I believe in you

And if you ever had to go away
Nothing in my world could ever be the same,
Nothing lasts forever but together till then
I'll give you everything I ever get and again

'Cause I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
'Cause I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in

But I, I, I believe in you
I, I, I believe in you
But I, I, I believe in you
I, I, I believe in you

I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in
I believe in you, I believe in

I believe, I believe, I believe, in, you
