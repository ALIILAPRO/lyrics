		  Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Send you running

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Vegetation
Aggravation
Running, hiding [?]
Snake is smiling
Whips his tail
Leaves you writhing

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle rattle

Hibernation
Altercation
Don't get angry
Snake is cranky
Whips his tail
In a frenzy

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattles me

Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time to meet your end

Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
When they rip apart
Screaming like a maniac
After my attack
Crying like a baby child
In exile [?]

Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til you're dead

Rattling 'til you're dead

Rattle, rattle rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

I'm the serpent
Devil's servant
Time your meet your end

Fangs are ready for the strike
Deadly razor sharp
Poison with a single spike
When they rip apart
Screaming like a maniac
After my attack
Crying like a baby child
In exile [?]

Sweat drips out of every pore as
I bite you more and more and more and
Take one last look at your captor
And hear my tail rattling 'til you're dead

Rattling 'til you're dead

Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle
Rattle, rattle, rattle

Isolation
Trepidation
Don't fear nothing
Snake is bluffing
Whips his tail
Sends you running

Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
Rattlesnake
