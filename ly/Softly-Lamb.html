		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (So happy with you)
(Happy with)
Softly kissing you as you lie sleeping
Breathing gently with you in your slumber
Your face is the picture of contentment
My angel's dreaming, my angel's dreaming

(So happy with you)
I'm so happy with you
So happy with you
So happy with you
So happy with you

Slowly opening your wondrous eyes on me
Shining green and glorious in the morning sun
This moment what could be more precious?
May it live forever, may it live forever

(So happy with you)
I'm so happy with you
So happy with you
So happy with you
So happy with you

Smiling on me
Your love gives me all the blessings of this new day
The heat in your skin caresses my senses in such a glorious way
(I'm so happy with you)
Smiling on me
Your love gives me all the blessings of this new day
The heat in your skin caresses my senses in such a glorious way

(So happy with you)
I'm so happy with you
So happy with you
So happy with you
So happy with you

Smiling on me
Your love gives me all the blessings of this new day
The heat in your skin caresses my senses in such a glorious way
