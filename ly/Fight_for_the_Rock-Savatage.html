		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Warriors of the night
You're here in force tonight
Stand up, raise your fist 'cause you believe
You will never fade away
Rock is here to stay
That's why you're gathered here tonight
Pledge allegiance to the rock
Together you are strong

Fight for the rock
You know you better fight for the rock
Fight for the rock 'n roll

Stand up, be counted child
Don't slip away
Don't ever let it get you down, no
Don't live your life in frustration
Get rock dedication

That's why you're gathered here tonight.

Piercing sound the thunder clouds explode into the night.

Fight for the rock
You know you better fight for the rock
Fight for the rock 'n roll

Warriors of the fight soldiers of the night
Stand up, raise your fist because you believe
We will never fade away
Rock is here to stay.
Let the torches light the sky

Fight for the rock
You know you better fight for the rock
Fight for the rock 'n roll

Fight for the rock
You know you better fight for the rock
Fight for the rock 'n roll
