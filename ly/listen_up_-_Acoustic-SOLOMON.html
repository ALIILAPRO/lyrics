		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told you not to fall in love with me
If I won't give you everything you need
Warned you three times, seems that's not enough
Is it, love?
Listen up
Oh, I

I, I feel like a broke-broken record with you
But I know my previous issues are far from yours to fix
It ain't your fault
I prefer to be alone
'Cause my heart's been turned to stone
Still here to heat you up at night

Told you not to fall in love with me
If I won't give you everything you need
Warned you three times, seems that's not enough
Is it, love?
Listen up
Oh, I

Lost my head as soon as I met ya
Found my composure
Don't know what came over me
I've been burnt to the third degree
That's why I blow hot 'n' cold like an AC
Gassin' you up then I backtrack, but lately
I can see why it's been driving you crazy
How toxic it may be

Told you not to fall in love with me
If I won't give you everything you need
Warned you three times, seems that's not enough
Is it, love?
Listen up
Oh, I
