		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember
The way you looked at me
And I remember
The feelin' of your energy
And I said it, so I meant it
That I’ll wait
For just another little taste
And I just wanna know
If I let you in boy
Would you still love me
You’ve been in all of my dreams and I hate it
Wish that I could just say that I don’t play that
Cuz every time boy I get too close
And every time boy I get so burned
But I’ll still wait
For another little taste
And I’ll wait
For just another little taste
And I just wanna know
If I let you in boy
Would you still love me
I said would you still love me
Cuz boy you’re my oxygen
When I
When I let you in did you ever love me
And I’ll wait
For just another little taste
And I just wanna know
When I let you in did you ever love me
