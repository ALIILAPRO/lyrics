		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one wants to get it when it's hot
Opportunities you gotta let go, let go
People only love you when you're gone
We don't really wanna get old, get old
No one wants to get it when it's hot
Opportunities you gotta let go, let go
People only love you when you're gone
We don't really wanna get old, get old
Twelve years at it you know that I'm still rhyming
Ain't no right timing son
I just stick to the shit violently
Move silently, you don't practice and feel novice
Is you only doing this to get women with big bottoms?
I use this shit to cope, used to be pill popping
Now I ponder in the garden while watching the figs blossom
I left the country I immigrated to with caution
Cuz the neighbours couldn't tell me apart from Bin Laden
Still vibin, boy I'm too handsome for chick problems
And the competition missing, I left em on milk cartons
They tree smoking, the productivity seems hopeless
Your vision blurring
I been saying you need focus
I pray my kids will be much better than me
I'll instil in them more values than getting the green
Lay this verse to rest with me when I be buried in deep
Along with all of my regrets from what I never achieved because
No one wants to get it when it's hot
Opportunities you gotta let go, let go
People only love you when you're gone
We don't really wanna get old, get old
No one wants to get it when it's hot
Opportunities you gotta let go, let go
People only love you when you're gone
We don't really wanna get old, get old
I've seen hubris consuming
Some of the best minds in music
Only time will prove it when all these fads are over
Long after I take my last breath
People might just care what I've written and spoke on tracks then
Amassed friends
Ghosting the toxic groups because this shit's rough
How many people gotta cut you off before you fix up?
I'm not sorry I'm leaving this bridge burnt
I would rather wrist cut up than lather and kiss butts
I'm sad that this shit matters to people that's too attached
I would rather have peace over choosing the wrong fam
I'm cruising with songs playing and pondering over life
Passengers keep talking just wait till the song ends
I'm making some small ends, ain't no point to the hoarding
We can't take it when we're getting on the plane that we're boarding
Ain't no cutting in the queue if you are already last
Everybody gets a turn, no priority pass because
No one wants to get it when it's hot
Opportunities you gotta let go, let go
People only love you when you're gone
We don't really wanna get old, get old
No one wants to get it when it's hot
Opportunities you gotta let go, let go
People only love you when you're gone
We don't really wanna get old, get old
No one wants to get it when it's hot
