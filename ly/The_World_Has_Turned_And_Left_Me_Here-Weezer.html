		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

I just made love with your sweet memory
One thousand times in my head
You said you loved it more than ever
You said

You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

I talked for hours to your wallet photograph
And you just listened
You laughed enchanted by intellect
Or maybe you didn't

You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my fac

You remain, turned away
Turning further every day

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

The world has turned and left me here
Just where I was before you appeared
And in your place, an empty space
Has filled the void behind my face

Do you believe what I sing now?
Do you believe what I sing now?
Do you believe? 
Do you?
