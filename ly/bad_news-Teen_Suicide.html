		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I feel like a ghost, oh
Got a bad thing going on
Waking up in the afternoon
Everything is going wrong

Got some really bad news for you
Got some really bad news for you

Said goodbye to my friends, they're gone now
I don't wanna live anymore
I don't care at all i don't care anymore
Got some really bad news for you
Got some really bad news for you
Some real bad news for you
Some real bad news for you
