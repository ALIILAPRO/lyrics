		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Skater shoes and faded Levi's
A mixtape of your favourite B-sides
That Polaroid of us still lives beside my bed
I know I can't avoid it but I try my best
I wanted to be you back in '05

But it gets hard when you're so little and you're lost
And you're left picking up the pieces of a world that kind of stopped

So why the hell did you leave so fast?
'Cause shooting stars are never meant to crash
Were you in pain and I just couldn't see?
Thought it'd all make sense when I was twenty-three
That you'd be there when I need you most?
Despite a million miles, would we still be close?
Would you fall in love, make her your wife?
Would you have a kid? Would they have your eyes?
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know

The time, it passed and I fucking let it
'Cause it still hurts when I don't forget it
The numbers on my chest, I put my blood in ink
When I talk about the best, I wish it didn't sting (mm, mm)
The hardest part is just accepting

That this shit's hard
'Cause I'm good and then I'm not
Looking for reasons in the pieces of the you that I've still got

So why the hell did you leave so fast?
'Cause shooting stars are never meant to crash
Were you in pain and I just couldn't see?
Thought it'd all make sense when I was twenty-three
That you'd be there when I need you most?
Despite a million miles, would we still be close?
Would you fall in love, make her your wife?
Would you have a kid? Would they have your eyes?
I guess we'll never know
I guess we'll never know
