		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were so wrong
Letting me on
As you took me down to your bed
When I came home
You were long gone
Nothing left but ashes and dust

Ooh, I'm gonna break you
Wanna shake you 'til you're broken down and I go
Ooh, I'm gonna take you
And make you regret the choice you made and I go

(I don't need that kind of love)
I don't need that kind of love
(I don't need that kind of love)
Can only watch you leave
(Can't take that kind of love)
Can't take that kind of love
Can't take that kind of love

Said she don't want 
Complicating doesn't wanna tie herself down
Keep it open, easy going
I just can't seem to make it work out

Ooh, you were so wrong
Letting this love
Shattering the good that we had
You made the wrong choice
Falling apart
Turning all into ashes and dust

Ooh, I'm gonna break you
Wanna shake you 'til you're broken down and I go
Ooh, I'm gonna take you
And make you regret the choice you made and I go

(I don't need that kind of love)
I don't need that kind of love
(I don't need that kind of love)
Can only watch you leave
(Can't take that kind of love)
Can't take that kind of love
(Can't take that kind of love)
Can only watch you leave

(I don't need that kind of love)
I don't need that kind of love
(I don't need that kind of love)
Can only watch you leave
(Can't take that kind of love)
Can't take that kind of love
(Can't take that kind of love)

I don't need that kind of love
See you slipping through my fingers and I can only watch you leave
Can't take that kind of love, oh no
We're out of luck, o-oh

(I don't need that kind of love)
I don't need that kind of love
(I don't need that kind of love)
Can only watch you leave
(Can't take that kind of love)
Can't take that kind of love
(Can't take that kind of love)

(Don't need that kind of love)
Wanna shake you 'til you're broken down and I go
(Don't need that kind of love)
And make you regret the choice you made and I go
