		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Drop every pretense
Drown every sense you own
For the girl that you love
Girl you loathe
Insistent pretext
So what does that make god
To the girl that you love?
Girl you loathe

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't

Denominations, surrender all control (all control)
To the girl that you love (girl that you love)
All control
Our indignation to every tainted soul (tainted soul)
And the girl you love (girl you love)
All control (all control)

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Girl that you love
Knows you don't

Followed her, followed her
Followed her, followed her home

Girl that you love
Girl that you love
