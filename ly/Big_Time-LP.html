		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I only coulda realized
Before the memories crystallized
There was something more to a night
I'll tell you what I know
Everything has got a sacrifice
Even winning is a compromise
If you wanna live a happy life
Don't let the good ones go

Unrequited valentines
The best of fruit left on the vine
And all these things I can't deny
I'm certified

I was big time, wasn't I?
All these big time people comin' by
But it was right there all the while
You were my big time, oh
We were big time, oh

And, where the hell was I?
When we were big time

Only so much time in a day
I mighta thrown a lot of it away
Before I die I know I'll think about
Our love, your smile, your way

Absence, lies, and alibis
Rented rooms and borrowed time
And all these things I can't deny
I'm certified

I was big time, wasn't I?
All these big time people comin' by
But it was right there all the while
You were my big time, oh
We were big time, oh

And, where the hell was I?
When we were big time

We were big time, baby
Now you know I know
We were big time, baby

We were big time, baby
Now you know I know
We were big time, baby

We were big time, baby
Now you know I know
We were big time, baby

We were big time, baby
Now you know I know
We were big time, baby

We were big time, baby
Now you know I know
We were big time, baby
