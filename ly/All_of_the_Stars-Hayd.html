		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Funny how time moves fast
While other times, it feels so slow
When we first fell in love
And when we had to let it go
All that we've done is try
Now all we can do is fold
Doesn't mean that we failed
It only means that now we know
And I hope you know

If all of the stars align in the sky
Then I would be yours and you would be mine
But not in this life, it's not the right time
It's not you and I
If all of the pieces fell into place
We'd make it all work through time and through space
We know it's too late, know we can't wait
It's better this way

Finally, the end's in sight
But wasn't it a hell of a ride?
Know I'll never be so low
I wonder if I'll reach the heights
That only you and I
Had by each other's side
The view we had from outer space
Gone before I blinked my eye
And I hope you know

If all of the stars align in the sky
Then I would be yours and you would be mine
But not in this life, it's not the right time
It's not you and I
If all of the pieces fell into place
We'd make it all work through time and through space
We know it's too late, know we can't wait
It's better this way

Wish there was something I could do to make it right
And hold you one more time
Tell you it's alright
Written in the stars, our love falling from the sky
There's no you and I
No, there's no you and I

If all of the stars align in the sky
Then I would be yours and you would be mine
But not in this life, it's not the right time
It's not you and I
