		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's up, baby?
It's your new boyfriend
Royce

Oh yeah
You know, this got that dancehall feel to it
Prince Royce
Mr. Worldwide
Takeover, that's right

Girl, your body is timeless, yeah
Girl, your body got me like
Oh, my gosh oh, my gah
Oh mama

And you're making me earn it, yeah
Oh, you're making me earn it
Oh, my gosh oh, my gah
Oh mama

Ain't nothing fake on you
You so so real (so real)
Tried playing cool
But can't help how I feel

I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo

Oh, I wish I was stronger, yeah
But you're making it harder
Oh, my gosh oh, my gah
Oh mama

And you make me go loco, yeah
Say it over and over
Oh, my gosh oh, my gah
Oh mama

Ain't nothing fake on you
You so so real (so real)
Tried playing cool
But can't help how I feel

I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo

Boom boom, mami mami mami
Damn, you sexy
Boom boom, mami mami mami
Damn, you fine
Boom boom, mami mami mami
You on fire
Boom boom, mami mami mami
Let's ride

Now, back it up
Put your booty out
Move it in, move it out
Now wind it up, while I grind it up
Like a 20 sack, and roll it out

You can go anywhere in the world
And you know that they know about me
I don't think you really ask that girl
If she knows anything about me
Nah, nah, you don't

Word of advice, want a happy life?
Don't look for what you don't wanna find
But before your boyfriend finds out
Back up it one more time
Dale

Dámelo mami chula
Dámelo mami chula
Dámelo papi chulo, yeah
Dámelo papi chulo
So back, back, back it up

I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo

I love it when you drop it down
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo
You turn around and make it bounce
Baby, back back back it up
Dámelo papi chulo
Dámelo papi chulo
