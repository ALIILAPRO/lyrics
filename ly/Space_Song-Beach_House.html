		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was late at night
You held on tight
From an empty seat
A flash of light

It will take a while
To make you smile
Somewhere in these eyes
I'm on your side

You wide-eyed girls
You get it right

Fall back into place
Fall back into place

Tender is the night
For a broken heart
Who will dry your eyes
When it falls apart?

What makes this fragile world go 'round?
Were you ever lost?
Was she ever found?

Somewhere in these eyes

Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into place
Fall back into
