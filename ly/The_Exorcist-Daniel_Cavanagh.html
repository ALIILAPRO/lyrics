		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I can't be where you are today
And I can't feel what you feel today
And I can't see what you see from there
And I can't feel the love you feel there
And I know it was hard for you
Like it's hard for me to be without you
Can you feel me?
Can you see me?
Can you feel me now?
Can you see me somehow?
Do you trust in who I am?
Do you believe in where I stand?
Do you trust in who I am?
Do you believe in where I stand?
Cos you saved me from myself
Yes you saved me from myself
Cos you saved me from myself
Yes you saved me from myself
