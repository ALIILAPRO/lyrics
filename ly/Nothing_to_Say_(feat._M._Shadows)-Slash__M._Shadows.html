		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We seem so lost and jaded
Well what a price to pay
Fear can be overstated,
and you seem infatuated
with finding who's to blame.

While it can seem so hard now,
I got a feeling we ain't meant to live this way.

Don't tell me it's too late,
cause I feel it too, we all love to hate
and let others lead the way.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still we push further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

Some feel that life's a favor,
While some don't have the time.
Wash up and kiss the alter,
All hail the mighty father,
but love will keep you blind.

Same questions we keep asking,
Won't hear the answers cause we're scared of what we'll find

We try and compensate through our troubled faith that should keep us safe
and keep searching for a sign.

Some searching to find
That love (life?) with a new piece of mind.

And still still we march further away,
Singing our songs of yesterday.
While so much still stands in our way,
Voices with nothing to say.

There wont be another day, the (no?) changing of the seasons,
And no one's gonna save us from the lies.

The greatest story ever told,
Is only what you make it.
There will be struggle and fear,
All by design

And still we march further away (We've been so logicated)
Singing our songs of yesterday (Nothing's got all the point, the blame?)
While so much still stands in our way (Yeahhhh!)
Voices with nothing to say
