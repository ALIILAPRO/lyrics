		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, if I did it, then I did it right, yeah
This ain't happenin' for me overnight, yeah
Bet against me, you gon' pay the price, yeah
Down to business, I ain't playin' nice, yeah
So ahead of y'all, I'm out of sight, yeah
When you poppin', they all want a slice, yeah
Greed and envy, that's a part of life, yeah
Mediocre, that just won't suffice

Better now than ever
Ain't no crackin' under pressure, the boy is clever
If I did it, it was stellar, nobody fresher
Stop complainin', man, my head hurts, these catchy records
Ain't nothin' really but a walk in a park for me
Heard the catalog, you know I got some scars on me (you know)
Just gettin' started, you don't really wanna start with me
It's John Q, I would sacrifice the heart in me for family
High roller, but you wouldn't know it by the way that I rolled up
Career lifespan lookin' good, it ain't slowin'
One after another, man, I just keep goin' and goin' (and goin')

Yeah, if I did it, then I did it right (yes)
This ain't happenin' for me overnight (no)
Bet against me, you gon' pay the price (pay the)
Down to business, I ain't playin' nice (woo, woo)
So ahead of y'all, I'm out of sight, yeah (out of sight)
When you poppin', they all want a slice, yeah (want a slice)
Greed and envy, that's a part of life, yeah (part of life)
Mediocre, that just won't suffice

Keep myself grounded, that's a piece of me that I won't let go
No matter what level I reach, I promise to hold it close
Ain't gotta tell me this hittin' different, man, I already know
How are you claimin' we had a baby, we ain't never spoke?
I don't be sleepin' out here with random woman on the road
They want a DNA test to prove it, I'm like here you go
I could've saved you a bunch of time and told you the results
Lookin' for hush money from me, you ain't goin' get it though
Historic, rain on my parade, I keep walkin' and ignore it
Just part of the game, yeah, it comes with the territory
It's just another day, man, I'm used to it downpourin', it's nothin' (nothin')

If I did it, then I did it right, yeah
This ain't happenin' for me overnight, yeah
Bet against me, you gon' pay the price, yeah
Down to business, I ain't playin' nice, yeah
So ahead of y'all, I'm out of sight, yeah
When you poppin', they all want a slice, yeah
Greed and envy, that's a part of life, yeah
Mediocre, that just won't suffice

You know it
On God
Won't suffice

Do not need no introduction (ooh)
Style my own can't no one touch it (ooh)
Became what they said I couldn't (ooh)
Mediocre, that won't cut it

Life is a gift, I
Wanna live it to the fullest while I can, why
Would I not when I know my days in this game are numbered?
Might as well enjoy the few years that I do have left
Who knows when I'ma write my last verse, I've
Been to hell and back ever since that first EP came out with all I
Have on it, I've been given all I have, wasn't really prepared for the pain I was
Gonna have to go through to get to the end result that I knew I wanted
Hoped I would make an impact in rap, has that been insane?
Yes, but it was worth it 
I can't imagine if I would've gave up and just turned my back on this music
Where would I be now?
Don't know how
I would of made it out from
Underneath that rainy cloud
Had my doubts, yes, but that's how I found my
True purpose, if my surface looks great who cares if underneath I'm hurtin'?
If there's one thing I've learned in
My life, it's that life is uncertain
Gettin' burned is unavoidable isn't it?
Ain't a person alive that hasn't been a victim of bein' lied to, we're all hypocrites
Givin' our two cents but not listenin'
All livin' in our own worlds thinkin' that
We're right, when the fact of the matter is a
Closed mind is the mind of an idiot
Don't believe that's true well, open it
