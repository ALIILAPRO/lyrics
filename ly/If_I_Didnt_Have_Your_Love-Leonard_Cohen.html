		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If the sun would lose its light
And we lived an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
That's how it would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love
To make it real

If the stars were all unpinned
And a cold and bitter wind
Swallowed the world
Without a trace
Oh well, that's where I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I couldn't lift the veil
And see your face

And if no leaves were on the tree
And no water in the sea
And the break of day had nothing to reveal
That's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love
To make it real

If the sun would lose its light
And we lived in an endless night
And there was nothing left
That you could feel
If the sea were sand alone
And the flowers made of stone
And no one that you hurt
Could ever heal
Well, that's how broken I would be
What my life would seem to me
If I didn't have your love
To make it real
