		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  i take the train
i don't know why
maybe i
simply don't wanna fly
anymore

every day
an endless dream
of cigarettes and magazines
well i'm
on the road

i wonder why
you didn't call today
every time it rains
i start to pray

show me how you're feelin
show me no disguise
i am always dreamin
of the lovelight in your eyes
i'm lonely in the morning
i lie awake at night
i am always dreamin
of the lovelight in your eyes

i'm rollin on
time goes by
i see my life
the sorrow left behind
miss you so

you do me cold
i'm warm inside
you must know
that i can be alright
on my own

i wonder why
you didn't call today
every time it rains
i start to pray

show me how you're feelin
show me no disguise
i am always dreamin
of the lovelight in your eyes
i'm lonely in the morning
i lie awake at night
i am always dreamin
of the lovelight in your eyes
