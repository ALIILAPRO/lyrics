		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey DJ turn me out
You got to keep me moving
Til the moon goes down
If you want to show me
Get below me shake your thing
Til you don't feel lonely

Hey mister, break it down
If you're a beat boy
Then maybe hit the ground
You could play it real cool
That be old school
Jump around until you act a fool

Shake your body
Everybody
Getting naughty
Join the party

Shake your body
Everybody
Getting naughty
Join the party

Hey DJ turn me out
You got to keep me moving
Til the moon goes down
If you want to show me
Get below me shake your thing
Til you don't feel lonely

Hey mister, break it down
If you're a beat boy
Then maybe hit the ground
You could play it real cool
That be old school
Jump around until you act a fool

One chick, two chicks, three chicks, four
Five chicks on classic at the door
Six chicks, seven chicks, eight chicks, wait!
Ain't far fetched, yes the Game's so great
Nine chicks, dime chicks, ten chicks, just to be redundant
If you didn't get it go back to one chick
Tell the DJ to play the next dub
And scratch like my fame, JMJ up above

Clap your hands if you're feeling me
One to the two, two to the three
Clap your hands if you're in the mix
Four to the five, five to the six

Shake your body
Everybody
Getting naughty
Join the party

Shake your body
Everybody
Getting naughty
Join the party

Hey DJ turn me out
You got to keep me moving
Til the moon goes down
If you want to show me
Get below me shake your thing
Til you don't feel lonely

Hey mister, break it down
If you're a beat boy
Then maybe hit the ground
You could play it real cool
That be old school
Jump around until you act a fool

Clap your hands if you're feeling me
One to the two, two to the three
Clap your hands if you're in the mix
Four to the five, five to the six

Hey DJ turn me out
You got to keep me moving
Til the moon goes down
If you want to show me
Get below me shake your thing
Til you don't feel lonely

Hey mister, break it down
If you're a beat boy
Then maybe hit the ground
You could play it real cool
That be old school
Jump around until you act a fool
