		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Original gyal, you ah no replica (no)
Smooth, clean, no regular degular (no)
Pretty fi real and pretty pon mi cellular (no)
Mi know seh yuh hot (no)

They ain't never had a pretty girl from Joburg
See me now and that's what they prefer
I don't touch no wheel 'cause I gotta chauffeur
First class, how I get 'round the world
Just miss me with the drama
Unless you comin' with the commas (double it up)
Oh, DJ, turn the sound up
'Cause we 'bout to pour the rounds up (tell 'em double it up)

From Jozi to Ibiza
They say it doesn't get sweeter
Feel my body bangin' like speaker
Ooh, sweating out my concealer
Skin tight, no millimeter
And my face card make him feel weaker
But you know that my body is a healer
Ooh, I love to make it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Boy, you know I love to make it jump, jump, jump (hm)
Tump, tump, tump, tump, back it up, up (Haibo)
You know I love to make it
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump (hm)
Boy, you know I love to make it jump, jump, jump (hm)
Tump, tump, tump, tump, back it up, up (hm, haibo)
You know I love to make it

Only gotta make a call and I'm here (I'm here)
Gunna wanna know your vibe, oh yeah (oh yeah)
Listen to me, I put some karats in your ear (in your ear)
Make the stick jump, I wanna put it in the rear
Wanna give D, I serve it like a dealer (dealer)
Deep in her throat while I'm digging in her middle (middle)
I'm back in Joburg, it couldn't feel no realer (realer)
A perfect picture like Polaroid (Polaroid, haibo)
She a trophy, no award (no award)
Baby sweet and tender like a sirloin (sirloin)
Tell the chauffeur take her to a Chanel store
Ever play with you, it'd be a world war (tell 'em double it up)

From Jozi to Ibiza
They say it doesn't get sweeter
Feel my body bangin' like speaker
Ooh, sweating out my concealer
Skin tight, no millimeter
And my face card make him feel weaker
But you know that my body is a healer
Ooh, I love to make it

Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Boy, you know I love to make it jump, jump, jump
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, pack it, top, top (Haibo)
You know I love to make it
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
Boy, you know I love to make it jump, jump, jump
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, pack it, top, top (Haibo)
You know I love to make it

Original gyal, you ah no replica (no)
Smooth, clean, no regular degular (no)
Pretty fi real and pretty pon mi cellular (no)
Mi know seh yuh hot (no)
