		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright alright alright alright woah!
Well yeah
Well I'm your harem man I was paid two by two
Well I'm your harem man I will sing and dance for you
Oh Baby say it
My love is great [unknown]

Well well
Lay your hails down 'till they race over me
Oh sweet pussy cat race your hails all over me
Oh you're so sweet, your pussy cat I'm gonna show you where it's at
Why don't you think I can [unknown] free
I want to be your fire when it's cold
It's raining outside mama don't wait until you get too old
Take home a liter and push it in me
I want to inject you in my blood
I want to set you free

Well well
My world my world... my love
I want to be your harem man
Oh baby save you do anything I can
I'll keep you waiting in a room of my own
A man can't be free until he's older
My my my ... woman, man

I want to be your harem man
I wish I was your 45 dollar bill
Spend all your money pay all your thrills
I wish I could be your walking shoes, step all over me
And take away my blues

My world my love
I wish I was you
