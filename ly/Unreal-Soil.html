		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sit back bare your cross to me
Oh won't I listen
God damn have I burned my hands
On what's been missing
I feel unreal every time I try and stop to feel
Pick me up my friend
Let me start again

You fucked with me
Behind this garden
Don't fuck with me

Long before I could even see
You're what was missing
Twisting deep inside of me
Forever missing the glistening
I feel unreal
Every time I try and stop to feel
Pick me up my friend
Hold closed your hand 

Can you see all the clear skin in front of me
Can you see can you see what you want to see
Can you see there's a little spot of light in me
Can you see can you tell I'm fucked

Bleeding emotions
Bleed emotions

Sat back gave your soul to me
But did I listen
God damn did I burn my hands
On what was missing, the glistening
I feel unreal
Every time I try and stop to feel
Pick me up my friend
Hold closed my hand

You fucked with me
Behind this garden
You fucked with me
Within this garden
Don't you fuck with me
