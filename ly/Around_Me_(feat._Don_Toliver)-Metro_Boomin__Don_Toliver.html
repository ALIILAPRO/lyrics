		  (Metro)

Like I know you are
She sitting here for hours, ain't been tellin' none'
It was all cool and it was just for fun
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)

Too much shit on your mental
Gotta switch up the tempo
Yeah, they callin' it tenfold
Show in here where the bands fold
I locked in your info
I'm 'bout to jump out the window

I seen too many worlds and I
Want you to be my girl tonight
Know I gotta keep them drugs 'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs around 
I, I seen way too many worlds and I
I want you to be my girl tonight
Know I keep a couple drugs 'round
I gotta keep a couple plugs around

Now you wan' talk when the money come in
Niggas went bad, they goin' out sad, they never gon' win
I been goin' like ten for ten
Get it on movie, get it on film
Get it on movie, get it on film
Pour my cup way above the brim
I went and got the cup with the all-white trim
Finna go and dunk way above the rim
Cold at night, so it was hard to flip
Niggas were lit when the harder hit
I ain't think twice whenever I get it
I was goin' Shiest' with the all-black fitted

I was goin' Shiesty in all-black
I was on ten when you call back
Had to think twice and you fall back
I hit a mean lick, and it was all racks
I was goin' Shiesty in all-black
I was on ten when you call back
Had to think twice and you fall back
I hit a mean lick, and it was all racks

I seen too many worlds and I
Want you to be my girl tonight
Know I gotta keep them drugs 'round me
I gotta keep a couple plugs around 
I, I seen way too many worlds and I
I want you to be my girl tonight
Know I keep a couple drugs 'round
I gotta keep a couple plugs around

Heroes are inspired
Emerging only when needed
Revealing themselves to the world in a moment marked by the realization of their ultimate destiny
With backs against the wall, they ascend the winding path of their own fate
Barely knowing the ledge, despite coping as living their whole life as two hands
