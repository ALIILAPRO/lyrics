		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why you're so sensitive
I'm tryna get close to you
Girl you know you the baddest bitch without even trying to
I don't wanna be the guy you hate
You're the only one I taste
I don't really know why you think I

I would rather be outside
I'm tryna stay close to you
Hate it when you think you're right
I would never lie to you
Tell me how many times I could say I'd drop dead for you
You're drop dead gorgeous
I know you know it

The way you're starting something I hope you know that it's pointless
The way you're talking to me I know you know that I want it
Let me be the one to show you that I can be honest
Girl Your flawless

Baby, you feel like water to me
The way you rain your body down on me
You drown me like an ocean
There's no place that I would rather be
You know I'd die to make you feel important
I'll go all night to make you feel you're wanted

I don't wanna be outside
I'm tryna stay close to you
Hate it when you think you're right
I would never lie to you
Tell me how many times I could say I'd drop dead for you
Your drop dead gorgeous
I know you know it

The way you're starting something I hope you know that it's pointless
The way you're talking to me I know you know that I want it
Let me be the one to show you that I can be honest
Girl Your flawless
