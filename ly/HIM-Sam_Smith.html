		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Holy Father
We need to talk
I have a secret
That I can't keep
I'm not the boy that
You thought you wanted
Please don't get angry
Have faith in me

Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love
It is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love
It is him I love

I walk the streets of Mississippi
I hold my lover by the hand
I feel you staring when he is with me
How can I make you understand?

Say I shouldn't be here but I can't give up his touch
It is him I love
It is him
Don't you try and tell me that God doesn't care for us
It is him I love
It is him I love

Oh, I love
No, No
I love
I love

Him I love
Him I love
(Him I love)

Holy Father
Judge my sins
I'm not afraid of what they will bring
I'm not the boy that you thought you wanted
I love him
