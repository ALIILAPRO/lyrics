		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took me without ever saying too much bout my flaws
Warmed up my body and you helped me tear down my walls
Guess I was blind all night long cause I threw it away
So I hope this reminds me to put all my strength to not causing you no pain

You chased my fears away
So how could I tear out your heart
Tears running down my face, can't stand the thought that I tore you apart
I blame myself at night
While fighting this ache down my chest, forgive me, forgive me
All I need is a chance and I'll show you the stars, take my hand

I've been staying close to you
And felt like we were bulletproof
But I shot bullets from inside
I'm picking a fight, yes I'm kicking you hard and I
Wish I had been strong like you
So I would not get your heart through
This unfair and heartbreaking ride
I took it to far, I caused too many scars baby
Judge and blame me all you want
I promise I won't say a word
Your judgement feels like I'm being blessed
Let's put the fighting to a rest
Cause darling I could never find
The one to always treat me right
But in your arms I found the one
That helped correcting all my wrongs

You chased my fears away
So how could I tear out your heart
Tears running down my face, can't stand the thought that I tore you apart
I blame myself at night
While fighting this ache down my chest, forgive me, forgive me
All I need is a chance and I'll show you the stars, take my hand
