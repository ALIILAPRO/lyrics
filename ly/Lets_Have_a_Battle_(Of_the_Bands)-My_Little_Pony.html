		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We heard you want to get together (ah)
We heard you want to rock this school (ah)
We've thought of something that is better (ah)
Something that changes all the rules (ah)

Why pretend we're all the same?
When some of us shine brighter (shine brighter)
Here's a chance to find your flame
Are you a loser or a fighter?

Me and you, you and me
Why don't we see who is better?
We don't have to be one and the same thing
Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition?
Are you afraid of failing the audition?

You're a star and you should know it
Yeah, you rise above the rest
It doesn't matter who you hurt
If you're just proving you're the best
Ah, ah-ah-ah

Battle, you wanna win it
Let's have a battle, battle of the bands
Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it
Let's have a battle, battle, battle 
Battle of the bands

(Battle) I can beat you
(Battle) Ha, you wish
(Battle) I so want this
(Battle) Not if I get it first

Me and you, you and me
Why don't we see who is better?
We don't have to be one and the same thing
Oh, what's so wrong with a little competition?
I'm going out and winning the audition

Battle, we wanna win it
Let's have a battle, battle of the bands
Let's have a battle, we'll go all in it
Let's have a battle, battle, battle 
Battle of the bands
