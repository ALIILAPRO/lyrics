		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well she's halfway over this hard on son
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And she's quite sure she's not the only one
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
Well there's a quiver up her backbone, dogs in the dust
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And she'll take what she needs and she'll do what she must
She's not gone yet but she's leaving

There's a raw bone whisper underneath the cover
Louder than a dead man's drum
There's a joke that they told her when she got much older
When she knew just what she'd become

Oh let me tell ya that she's

One part evil, three-fifths blind
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And she's oh so delicate and still don't mind
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
Well there's a chance that she knows where the bodies are kept
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And she still don't remember the tears that she wept
She's not gone yet but she's leaving

There's a raw bone whisper underneath the cover
Louder than a dead man's drum
There's a joke that they told her when she got much older
When she knew just what she'd become

Oh let me tell ya now

Well she's all too generous with my time
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And she knows that injustice is no real crime
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
And I will always remember the way that she crawled
She's not gone yet but she's leaving
When I throw up in the rain she pretends she's appalled
She's not gone yet but she's leaving

There's a raw bone whisper underneath the cover
Louder than a dead man's drum
There's a joke that they told her when she got much older
When she knew just what she'd become
