		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give it time and wonder why 
Do what we can laugh an we cry 
And we sleep in your dust because we've seen this all before
Culture fades with tears and grace 
Leaving us stunned hollow with shame 
We have seen this all, seen this all before

Many tribes of a modern kind, 
Doing brand new work, same spirit by side, 
Joining hearts and hand and ancestral twine, ancestral twine

Many tribes of a modern kind, 
Doing brand new work, same spirit by side, 
Joining hearts and hand and ancestral twine, ancestral twine

Slowly it fades
Slowly we fade
Slowly you fades
Slowly you fade

Spirit bird she creaks and groans 
She knows she has, seen this all before she has, seen this all before

Spirit bird she creaks and groans she knows she has, 
Seen this all before she has, seen this all before she has
Slowly you fade
Slowly it fades
Slowly you fade
Slowly you fade
Slowly you fade

Soldier on soldier on my good country man
Keep fighting for your culture, 
Now keep fighting for your land

I know its been thousands of years
And I feel your hurt and I know its wrong 
And you feel you've been chained and broken and burned 
And those beautiful old people 
Those wise old souls have been ground down for far too long
By that spineless that greedy man that hearless man deceiving man 
That government hand taking blood and land taking blood and land and still they can 
But your dreaming and your warrior spirit lives on and it is so so so strong 
In the earth in the trees in the rocks in the water 
In your blood and in the air we breath

Soldier on soldier on my good country man, 
Keep fighting for your children now keep fighting for your land
Slowly it fades 
Slowly you fade
Slowly it fades
Slowly it fades
Give it time and we wonder why 
Do what we can laugh and we cry and we sleep in your dust because we've seen it all before
