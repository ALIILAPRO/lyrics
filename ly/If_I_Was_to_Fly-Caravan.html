		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was to fly high in the sky, high as a kite I would fly
I'd spread out my wings and I'd do everything
If I was to fly fore I die

I'd dive through the clouds and I'd wave to the crowds
I'd smile and I'd fly round the sun
I'd glide up and down and back on the ground
I'd try not to make not a sound

Oh it would be easy for me
Nothing would faze me at all
If it all seemed more than a dream
I would fall

If I was to fly high in the sky, high as a kite I would fly
I'd hold back the rain and I'd go round again
If I was to fly fore I die
