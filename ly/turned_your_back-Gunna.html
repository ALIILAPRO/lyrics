		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh

I been this fucked up, you up and leave 
Gave you everything you need
Then you turned your back on me, you don't know
Oh (oh)
Sometimes I get upset and clench my teeth
I done made it out the streets
But I still ain't find my peace, where to go?
Oh (oh)

I get back on the road, this time, I ain't pressin' the brakes
How dare you fix your lips with me? You don't know what it take
I'm out here on my own, they throwin' stones every day
My bitch in bed alone, I wanna sleep, but I can't
I'm only in control of me
That monkey on my back, he holdin' me
I made his life a breeze
You ain't have shit, I let you roll the weed
I pull up, park the Porsche, she hold the keys
I let her hold the keys
When I came home, I kept it low, they ain't even notice me
They kept on pokin', they ain't know they'll get the roguish me
I never knew one day that we'd agree to disagree
They got ho tendency, I don't want no sympathy
And I'm right back on my grind, I ain't wastin' no more time, no
This ain't just rhymes, I'm sayin' shit that's in my mind, yeah
I fed you, gave you shoes and clothes, and you just signed out (oh)
Stick by my side, ain't no need to tell me lies, oh
I'm do or die, I'm gon' trust you gon' ride through it all (that you gon' ride through it all)
Oh (oh)

I been this fucked up, you up and leave 
Gave you everything you need
Then you turned your back on me, you don't know
Oh (oh)
Sometimes I get upset and clench my teeth
I done made it out the streets
But I still ain't find my peace, where to go?
Oh (oh)

I heard the rumors sayin' I'm packin' up and flyin' out
We ain't goin' nowhere, I'm stayin' here, gon' fight it out
I been like, "Fuck it, let's just give these niggas all clout"
Goin' on for months and I just keep on seein' these dark clouds
I told my soul it's gon' get greater, I don't know how (I don't know how)
How, they don't make no noise when I'm around (they don't make no noise when I'm around)
Press up on them boys out of town
I need some blood, better send that boy to Red Cross
No, I ain't scared, I just hate to see you dead, dog
You talkin' fire when you know I really play it raw
We havin' problems, ain't no tellin' how they gon' be solved
Miss solitude, I'm out of state and I ain't talkin' calls
In my own shoes, I'm on the move and I ain't break it off
Look at these dudes crossin' they fingers, hopin' that I fall
I paid my dues, looked out for niggas that was supposed to ball
I realized I didn't read between the lines, oh
And I ain't blind 
Had to open up my eyes and see it all (open up my eyes and see it all)
Oh (oh)
I keep gettin' high, it's been hard to ease my mind, oh
Been on this ride and they done told so many lies through it all (so many lies through it all)
Oh (oh)

I been this fucked up, you up and leave 
Gave you everything you need
Then you turned your back on me, you don't know
Oh (oh)
Sometimes I get upset and clench my teeth
I done made it out the streets
But I still ain't find my peace, where to go?
Oh (oh)

I been this fucked up, you up and leave 
Gave you everything you need
Then you turned your back on me, you don't know
Oh (oh)
Sometimes I get upset and clench my teeth
I done made it out the streets
But I still ain't find my peace, where to go?
Oh (oh)
