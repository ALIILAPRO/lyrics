		<p>
		  Da na na na na
Da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby

You've been on my mind
(How ya feel?)
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends

Firework
I feel like glitter, and every time you come around
I feel like glitter
You're the one that I wanna give my life
You're the one that I need to give my time

Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one, 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck, then bill me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner got the heat like wait
Got the shit, its all up on that head
I use it on myself on the day you dipped
Got that 4-5-7 track, 8 for me
Babydoll, I hope you agree
Because you light my

Firework
I feel like glitter, and every time you come around
I feel like glitter
(How you feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life
(How you feel?)
You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around (I love)
'Cause I love having you around

Yeah, look at my face, look at that jaw
This is north side and yeah, I can't lie
We ain't workout, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, gotta limo
Pills, can't see-through, must be a window
'Cause you in the L
'Could be a DJ, when I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't
How ya feel?
I'm parkin' in quicksand, wait-
Please don't save me

Ooh
(Please don't save me)
How ya feel?
Fa la la la la
Fa la la la la
How ya feel?

Scum Fuck Flower Boy
Scum Fuck Flower Boy (How ya feel)

We didn't get your message, either because you were not speaking or because of a bad connection

"Fuck"
