		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I rolled my spliff 
On the sunrise, half past six 
In a all-black Louis V drip
I can sleep when I get my fix
It's some very dark nights I've lived 
And I'm making those top-ten hits (mm-hmm)
See, I'm good at this pop star shit (mm-hmm)
Just cah I smile like this 
Doesn't mean I can't take your bitch (Beatfreakz)
James, Jamal and John
All of my exes singing my songs
Write my songs and I write her songs
Life is sweet and the money don't lie
I stand for my bitches, catch me outside
None of you know what I did to survive
Everyone who streamed that, followed that, played that back
Gee, thanks cah you changed my life
If I pull right up now it's a 100K minimum
Life feels good when you're making millions
Met a new ting, he was making billions
Got on one knee so I had to get rid of him
Since sixteen, every night I pray
Now I'm having dinner with Bey and Jay
I'm a Croydon girl where the pavements grey
And I had no plugs, I paved my way, yeah

My pride too high, never asked you for help
Boy, you should pree the house I just bought for myself
Still in the ends, South London, baby
For what it's worth, I'm glad you played me
Now none of these men never matter to me
Got my girls, got my cars, got my green and my weed
Know there be ring-ring, it's that money calling
This that shit, you have to spend it to believe it, darling

Number one, can't throw no shade
I make hit songs, not trap or trade
Hit that once and the pumpum's great
I can't wife her cah she way too bait
More followers than Imjustbait
Touch my skin you wanna make front page
I've gotta big whip, man's due a upgrade
They wanna catch up, but it's way too late
Uptown with Julez, man's feeding
Taking a M when SK's peaking
Meant to see one girl that I'm jeeting
But I'm kinda late for a label meeting
Princess, she look good this evening
Rubbin' my hood, ayy, bae, stop teasing (tek time)
Take off my belt and push that deek in
Give her the pipe, that's central heating

My pride too high, never asked you for help
Boy, you should pree the house I just bought for myself
Still in the ends, South London, baby
For what it's worth, I'm glad you played me
Now none of these men never matter to me
Got my girls, got my cars, got my green and my weed
Know there be ring-ring, it's that money calling
This that shit, you have to spend it to believe it, darling

They ain't believe in me
Working harder like there's three of me
Used to pray I made a 100K
I'm breaking bread all day, I do it easily
One year in, I made a lotta changes
While these niggas out here tryna beef with me
Turned the page and now I'm going places
Now these Insta' baddies wanna sleep with me
I'ma jeet and skeet
My head is in the stars and I can't ask you for help
All these scars that's on my back, I cut 'em open myself
When life gets hard it'll be okay
It's me and RAYE in this brand new Wraith
It's baby blue like Beyonc√©
You better tell Jay 'bout wewantwraiths

My pride too high, never asked you for help
Boy, you should pree the house I just bought for myself
Still in the ends, South London, baby
For what it's worth, I'm glad you played me
Now none of these men never matter to me
Got my girls, got my cars, got my green and my weed
Know there be ring-ring, it's that money calling
This that shit, you have to spend it to believe it, darling
