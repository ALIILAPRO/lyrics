		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So take them off
The blinders that cover your eyes
Don't break new ground
Just follow the beaten path

Well, all I can do in the end
Is bury it in the cellar (cellar, cellar)
And only a fool would pretend
To blame it on the weather (weather, weather)

It's so dangerous
All this blamelessness
And I feel like I lost all the good I've known
It's so dangerous
All this shamelessness
And I feel like I'm watching a tumor grow, yeah

Now take them down 
The roses you smothered, they died
I hear the cries 
Of souls you have eaten since

We all must revere and defend
The fortune of the teller (teller, teller)
We all must subdue and suspend
Belief that this gets better (better, better)

It's so dangerous
All this blamelessness
And I feel like I lost all the good I've known
It's so dangerous
All this shamelessness
And I feel like I'm watching a tumor grow, yeah

Please, just say you know you won't be satisfied
Not unless you know your name is verified
God, I hope you choke on hate and stomach bile
Even as you sing the praise of feticide
Please, just say you know you won't be satisfied
Not unless you know your name is verified
God, I hope you choke on hate and stomach bile
Even as you sing the praise of feticide

It's so dangerous
All this blamelessness
And I feel like I lost all the good I've known
It's so dangerous
All this shamelessness
And I feel like I'm watching a tumor grow, yeah
And I feel like I lost all the good I've known, yeah
And I feel like I'm watching a tumor grow, yeah
