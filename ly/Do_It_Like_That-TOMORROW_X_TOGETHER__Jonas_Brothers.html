		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You get me so off track, yeah
Been spinnin' for miles
But I think that you like that
Can't deny it

You bringin' my life back, yeah
You doin' it in style
You came with that jet pack
Now we flyin'

Every time I'm with you is like a time machine
Makin' everybody jealous like you're seventeen
On God, you're the cover of a magazine
Got me feelin' like, "Damn", hey

Oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that (whoo)
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that

Blow my mind
Then somehow you bring it right back
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that, yeah

Some things you can't fake, yeah (yeah)
Some things you just feel
Got plans we ain't made yet (yeah)
It's whatever

You throwin' that drink back, yeah
You stayin' a while
You rockin' that fit
That's makin' all them strangers smile

Every time I'm with you is like a time machine
Makin' everybody jealous like you're seventeen
On God, you're the cover of a magazine
Got me feelin' like, "Damn" (Damn)

Oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that (whoo)
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that

Blow my mind (my mind)
Then somehow you bring it right back (right back)
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that (whoo)

You sendin' signals and them waves go far
Got people dancin' up on top of their cars
You sendin' signals and them waves go far
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that

Oh my God
You blowin' my mind like that
Oh my God
The way that you bring it right back (right back)

Oh my God
You blowin' my mind like that (like that)
Oh my God
The way that you bring it right back (hey, sing it)

Oh my God (whoo)
Don't know how you do it like that (come on, come on)
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that

Blow my mind (my mind)
Then somehow you bring it right back (bring back)
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)

You sendin' signals and them waves go far
Got people dancin' up on top of their cars
You sendin' signals and them waves go far
Yeah, oh my God
Don't know how you do it like that, yeah
