		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come here, a little closer
Will you carry me away?
Stay forever and a day?
 
Come here, a little closer
And I will never run away
No, I will never run away from you
 
Tell me I'm the one
Every time I fell in love it went all wrong
You're my only one
Moon and sun, we've just begun to belong
 
Heartbeat
Tell me what you need
Hold me
I know what you need now
Don't want to turn it off
Don't want to be alone
Heartbeat
Tell me what you need
Hold me
I know what you need now
Don't want to turn it off
Don't want to be alone
 
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
 
Come here and whisper in my ear
That you will never run away
No, you will never run away, promise
 
Tell me I'm the one
Every time I fell in love it went all wrong
You're my only one
Moon and sun, we've just begun to belong
 
Heartbeat
Tell me what you need
Hold me
I know what you need now
Don't want to turn it off
Don't want to be alone
Heartbeat
Tell me what you need
Hold me
I know what you need now
Don't want to turn it off
Don't want to be alone
 
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
All night, so lonely
Everytime, when you're not here with me
