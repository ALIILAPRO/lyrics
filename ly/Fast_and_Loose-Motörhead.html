		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two o' clock in the morning, baby
I know it's late, I know it's late
I'm dark and I like the night
And I can make you feel alright
I've been around for quite a while
And I've learned that I can make you smile
I know you won't refuse
You know I'm fast and loose

Two o' clock in the morning, sugar
I know you're sleeping, you must be sleeping
Why don't you invite me in?
Get yourself some original sin
I'll wake you up, but stay in bed
Don't get up, get down instead
I don't need no excuse
To like it fast and loose

No remorse

Two o' clock in the morning, honey
Let me in baby, let me in
You know me, you know I'm wired
I'm gonna stop you feeling tired
I'm coming over and I won't be long
Just let me finish writing this song
I'm gonna blow your fuse
I know you like it fast and loose

Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose, fast and loose
Fast and loose
