		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It all started in the summer
And you hit me like a breeze
Now we've made it to the winter
And I'm hoping we don't freeze
Oh, I wanna tell you something
With all the words that I can give
I'm in love with everything about you
And that's just the way it is

And I hope you know
Even when it doesn't show, mh

I'll run through fire for you
Whatever I gotta do
Give you my heart while it beats
'Cause with you's where I wanna be

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh, you're something like a raindrop
When you're falling on the trees
Make your way down to the soil
And those roots, they do run deep

Oh, you're something like a sunrise
Pretty to my mind
Soothing to my soul
Watching the world spin one more time

And I hope (I hope) you know (you know)
Even when it doesn't show, mh

I'll run through fire for you (for you)
Whatever I gotta do
Give you my heart while it beats
'Cause with you's where I wanna be

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ooh, oh
