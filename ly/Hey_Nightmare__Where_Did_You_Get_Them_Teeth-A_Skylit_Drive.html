		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run, for your life now
Don't you see your princess is gone'
Pull your vengeance aside
Let's make it rain blood tonight
Collide your sword with mine, I'll send your soul
To the hell where it came from
Be this I know you'll never set your eyes
On a quest you can't survive
It's no surprise that your head hangs
From my heads your mouth can't sin or lie
Cut threw the limbs 
Stab threw the enemies eyes
Any last man will die
She, watching the sky burn oh how it burns
Run for the skylines run for the skylines darling
Follow the light of the moon just stay alive
Forgive me

For tomorrow
If I'm late
I'll died before I wake
Cut threw the limbs 
Stab threw the enemies eyes
Any last man will die
What's left for you
You wanted life
I showed you love
Conserve protect your life
Your life is my well being
And if lay in shadows then so be it
But left it be known that this soldier will not rest a day
Until he lays in the glamour and the grace of his bride
I will not rest one day until my victims blood is shed up
And down the shorelines
For gods sake please

Don't you forgive me
I will wait for you
Race the sun
Pray for nothing warm
The Past The Love The Memories
Let me take this time to
Ask you, inform you
Of all the things you did not know
I'm sorry I can't be the cure for your life
You where always by my side
Life spent without rain
You will always be the heart in me
You will always be
The past the love the memories
