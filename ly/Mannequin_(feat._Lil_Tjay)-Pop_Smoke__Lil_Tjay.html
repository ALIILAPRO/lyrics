		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Trap House Mob)
Huh (woo), what's rockin' cuz (woo, woo, woo, bah)
(AXL)
(This is a Melo Beat) 

Look, Dior on my body
Head to toe like a mannequin
Amiri denims got them panickin'
I pour a four in my Fanta
If my opps in a foreign
Then we shootin' up the Phantom
Dior on my body
Head to toe like a mannequin
Amiri denims got them panickin'
I pour a four in my Fanta
If my opps in a foreign
Then we shootin' up the Phantom

Big Glock up on my hip
That mean I don't ever slip
Run up on me, I'ma whack a nigga, clap a nigga, skate off in the whip
Gucci, foreign, she the drip
Fifty-five hundred the fit
55k on my wrist
I'm tired of juugin', my money legit

Trav' got the Urus, Bo got the Hurricane
I got the Range and all of them paid
I'm from the Floss, I'm a double G, and I'm known for puttin' in pain
I spent fifty on my left wrist, another hundred on a chain
Try to reach, and we takin' shots close range (baow)

Baow, bang, hit his brain
Catch me an opp, I'ma treat 'em and beat 'em and show him he lame
I lost my brother, shit won't be the same
Ever since then I been goin' insane
Do it for Smelly, I do it for gang
And Nino gon' wet 'em up, show 'em my pain

Big Louboutin for the steppin'
Big .38 for the weapon
And I catch a case for nothin'
I back the Wraith for nothin'
Gas 'em up, getty
Rock steady, rock steady
Shots hit your belly
Rust pack got me deady

Checks, Chevy
Swing a BOA, we ready
R.I.P the fallen soldiers
Screamin', "Free my nigga Melly"
Lotta shit been on my mind
Smokin' dope I'm gettin' deady
Lotta pressures on my shoulders
Steady movin' but it's heavy
I was posted by the deli
Any means to get it early mornin,' I was ready
Think I fell in love with fetti
She give super neck, I think I fell in love with Betty
Tati ate it like spaghetti
I ain't even mean to say it but I'm bein' petty
2020, vision steady
You know I ain't finna hesi'
Crossover for the cheddi

Dior on my body
Head to toe like a mannequin
Amiri denims got them panickin'
I pour a four in my Fanta
If my opps in a foreign
Then we shootin' up the Phantom
Dior on my body
Head to toe like a mannequin
Amiri denims got them panickin'
I pour a four in my Fanta
If my opps in a foreign
Then we shootin' up the Phantom
