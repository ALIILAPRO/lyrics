		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No, this is not goodbye
I swear that I'm gonna change
No, baby, please don't cry
It doesn't have to end this way

'Cause when I think of all the nights I'll be alone
I get terrified
Please don't say goodbye

'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now (yeah)

When did we lose our way?
My whole world was unraveling
And girls driving me insane
There's no road worth traveling

When I think about all of the nights you're gone (nights you're gone, oh)
I get terrified (I get terrified)
Please don't say goodbye (bye)

'Cause girl, if you leave me now
If you're givin' up and just walk right out (oh)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now

Oh, I can promise if we parted (parted)
And if you left me brokenhearted
Every single night, I'll think about you with someone else
Baby, if you leave me

Baby, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out (oh)
You will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby if you leave me now
Oh girl, if you leave me now
If you give it up and just walk right out
Baby, you will take the biggest part of me
And all the things that I believe
Baby, if you leave me now
Oh, baby, if you leave me now
