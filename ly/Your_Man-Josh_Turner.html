		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low
And put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

There's no hurry, don't you worry
We can take our time
Come a little closer, let's go over
What I had in mind

Baby, lock the door and turn the lights down low
And put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

Ain't nobody ever love nobody
The way that I love you
We're alone now
You don't know how long I've wanted to

Lock the door and turn the lights down low
And put some music on that's soft and slow
Baby, we ain't got no place to go
I hope you understand

I've been thinking 'bout this all day long
Never felt a feeling that was quite this strong
I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man

I can't believe how much it turns me on
Just to be your man
