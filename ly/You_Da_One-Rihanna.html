		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love

Baby, I love you, I need you here
With me all the time
Baby, we meant to be
You got me, smilin' all the time

'Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go runnin', runnin'
Tryna get away from lovin' ya

You know how to love me hard
I won't lie, I'm fallin' hard
Yep, I'm fallin' for ya
But there's nothin' wrong with that

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love 

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine

Baby come, take me now, hold me now
Make me come alive
You got the sweetest touch
I'm so happy, you came in my life

'Cause you know how to give me that
You know how to pull me back
When I go runnin', runnin'
Tryna get away from lovin' ya
You know how to love me hard
I won't lie, I'm fallin' hard
Yep, I'm fallin' for ya but there's nothin' wrong with that

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave (you the one)
My love is your love, your love is my love 

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always (you are the one)
You are the one so I make sure I behave (oh, you the one)
My love is your love, your love is mine

And yes I'm kinda crazy
That's what happens baby
When you put it down
You shouldn't give it to me good like that
Shouldn't hit it like that, had me yellin' like that
Didn't know you would've had me comin' back

You the one that I'm feelin'
You the one that I'm lovin'
Ain't no other, niggas like you
No there's just one, one, one, one, one, one
No, baby just one, one, one, one
I bet you wanna know

You the one that I dream about all day
You the one that I think about always
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is my love (your love is mine)

You the one that I dream about all day (you are the one)
You the one that I think about always (you are the one)
You are the one so I make sure I behave
My love is your love, your love is mine
