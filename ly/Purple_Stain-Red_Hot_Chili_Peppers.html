		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To finger paint is not a sin 
I put my middle finger in 
Your monthly blood is what I win 
I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty 
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante 
Spread your head and spread the blanket 
She's too free and I'm the patient

Black and white a red and blue 
Things that look good on you 
And if I scream don't let me go 
A purple stain I know

Knock on wood, we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood 
With Dracula and Darla Hood 
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators 
Let's get it on with the alligator haters 
Did what you did, did what you said 
What's the point? Yo, what's the spread?

Black and white a red and blue 
Things that look good on you 
And if I scream don't let me go 
A purple stain I know 
And if I call for you to stay 
Come hit the funk on your way 
It's way out there but I don't care 
'Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood, we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood 
With Dracula and Darla Hood 
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care 
'Cause this is what I wanna wear
Knock on wood we, all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

To finger paint is not a sin 
I put my middle finger in 
Your monthly blood is what I win 
I'm in your house now let me spin
Feather light, but you can't a move this 
Farley is an angel and I can prove this 
Purple is a stain upon my pillow 
Let's sleep, weeping willow

Black and white a red and blue 
Things that look good on you 
And if I scream don't let me go 
A purple stain I know 
And if I call for you to stay 
Come hit the funk on your way 
It's way out there but I don't care 
'Cause this is where I go

Knock on wood, we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood 
With Dracula and Darla Hood 
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care 
'Cause this is what I wanna wear
Knock on wood we, all stay good
'Cause we all live in Hollywood
