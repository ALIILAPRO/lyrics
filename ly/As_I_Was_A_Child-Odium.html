		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I was a child
I was so free I was so kind
I was so strong my smile was bright
I was too loud sometimes too wild
As I was a child
My dreams were big I can remind
In all those treasures so excite
My world was big my view was wide
As I was a child
As I was a child
I was so free I was so kind
I was so strong my smile was bright
I was too loud sometimes too wild
As I was a child
My dreams were big I can remind
In all those treasures so excite
My world was big my view was wide
As I was a child
As I was a child
My dreams were big I can remind
In all those treasures so excite
My world was big my view was wide
As I was a child
I was so free I was so kind
I was so strong my smile was bright
I was too loud sometimes too wild
As I was a child
