		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're like a guiding light

All nights when stars won't shine

I find myself dreaming bout you

This might just be love

This might just be love



Long live my broken past

Who lead me to you at last

I can't control my heart no more

I may just be yours

I may just be yours﻿


This might be love

I'll tell you what

It feels like everything I wanted and more

I'm running out

Of reasons not to think

This might just be love

This might just be love


I've been a jerk for years

Hurting and causing tears

I've got some love saved up in me

I'll lay it all on you

I'll lay it all on you



You hold my heart in store

Like no one else before

Oh how i long to hold you near

Did i just fall in love?

Did i just fall in love?
