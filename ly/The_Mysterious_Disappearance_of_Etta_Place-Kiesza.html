		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I will not pick flowers for you
For I choose not to kill
But instead, I'll take your hand
And show you a pair of wild daisies in full bloom
Never before seen by human eyes
They stand unaware of our presence
Not knowing that our minds are like leeches
Clinging to their soft innocent petals
They stand naked in all their glory
Branching from the same stem
Stretching for the sun as it dries the tears from their face
We will go now, leaving them undisturbed
And stop when the sun calls us
Then we too will be naked
And leaving each other all that we are
I will be of you as you will be of me
I will be of you as you will be of me
And then the sun will always be one

Down dusty roads and red hills on the rise
With rifles cocked
Bandanas on their eyes
A pair of thieves came riding in the dark
And they both went down with bullets in the heart

And so we're told one left a girl behind
I knew I had disappeared that night
I swear to you I rode the speed of light
With my ice cold tears and one thing on my mind

Where'd you go
Where'd you go
When you die, I don't know
Whether heaven or hell takes us home
Where you go
Where you go
When you die, I don't know
I just know we all go out alone
But the devil can't touch my gold
I just know we all go out alone
But the devil can't touch my gold
Yeah, yeah, yeah

The moon will rise the sun will dance away
I dug an empty grave and wrote my name
You never do go back from where you came
When you lived a life of fire and of rain

Where'd you go
Where'd you go
When you die, I don't know
Whether heaven or hell takes us home
Where you go
Where you go
When you die, I don't know
I just know we all go out alone
But the devil can't touch my gold
Yeah

I just know we all go out alone
But the devil can't touch my gold
No, no, no, no
I just know we all go out alone
But the devil can't touch my gold

I will be of you as you will be of me
And we will be of me as we will be of you
All that we are is that we should give up ourselves to each other
And then the sun will always be one
