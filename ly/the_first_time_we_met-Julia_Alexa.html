		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How could I fall in love for a second time
When I thought I'd call you forever mine
Nothing will ever feel like the first time
The thought of you alone always made me smile

No, I don't want another love like this
It'll just remind of everything I miss
I'll never find another heart like yours
Cause you were everything I wanted and more

So take me back to the first time we met
And let me re-do everything I regret
And this time I'll try not to get attached 
Cause I'd do anything now to just forget

How could I move on from everything you said
All these promises, the secrets we shared
I was so in love with all the plans we had
That in the end never really happened

No, I don't want another love like this
It'll just remind of everything I miss
I'll never find another heart like yours
I'll never be able to think love is pure

So take me back to the first time we met
And let me re-do everything I regret
And this time I'll try not to get attached 
Cause I'd do anything now to just forget

Oh please take me back
Oh please take me back

So take me back to the first time we met
And let me re-do everything I regret
And this time I'll try not to get attached 
Cause I'd do anything now to just forget
