		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know no more, I don't know no more
I can't put my finger on it, I don't know who to call
We was never used to money, they don't know how to ball
They lookin' for me, let 'em know I'm buildin' a wall
Duckin' the law, I ain't trustin' no one at all
I know that when you shine they wish some days'll be dark
And I know there be a time you really show who you are
We burned the bridge and cut the ties and we forever apart

I'm done with all these foes on my soul, just forget 'em
Ten months without no syrup, ain't no more codeine in my liver
Why men actin' like girls, talkin' to niggas like they sisters?
And if you wanna roll you can go on the road with 'em
Lookin' through that peephole, better hope it ain't a hitter
I could do bad on my own, I'on't wanna fuck with niggas
Had a big brother that loved me, a stone cold killer
If it's family, that mean the love is never ever endin'

I don't know no more, I don't know no more
I can't put my finger on it, I don't know who to call
We was never used to money, they don't know how to ball
They lookin' for me, let 'em know I'm buildin' a wall
Duckin' the law, I ain't trustin' no one at all
I know that when you shine they wish some days'll be dark (I know that when you shine)
And I know there be a time you really show who you are
We burned the bridge and cut the ties and we forever apart

Niggas just stay mad, that there is really somethin' else to it
It's always been your plan, you just ain't have no way to do it
'Member we was cool? I gave you shit when I didn't use it
Lemme get that money back, I hope you ain't ran through it
Wanna know how Wunna feel? Then listen to my music
Talk about that shit and all that knowin' I was clueless
Real life on this type of shit, it feel like a movie
I feel I just don't know no more, what all else'll do me?

I don't know no more, I don't know no more
I can't put my finger on it, I don't know who to call
We was never used to money, they don't know how to ball
They lookin' for me, let 'em know I'm buildin' a wall
Duckin' the law, I ain't trustin' no one at all
I know that when you shine they wish some days'll be dark (I know that when you shine)
And I know there be a time you really show who you are
We burned the bridge and cut the ties and we forever apart

We burned the bridge and cut the ties and forever apart
And I know there be a time you really show who you are
They was never used to money, they don't know how to ball
They lookin' for me, let 'em know I'm buildin' a wall
(I know that when you shine)
