		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had you on the phone, I heard you were mine
I've been on the run since you walked through the hallway
Heard it all before, I don't even mind
I'll do anything, pull me in and I'm far away

You're right there
But I won't say that I'm standing
I'm right here, when I see you I panic
So scared of the way it might pan out

Well I don't wanna say that this was all it was
Trying not to stay but that just made it worse
I've been keeping my distance
But I just wanna know what you're thinking
I just can't explain the way it hurts
Now that what we had is gone, I don't have the words
I'm so bad at playing along, saving my feelings
I've been keeping my distance

I talked about it last night, thought I was fine
Helped you pack your things, put your bags in the hallway
Maybe in a past life, problems aside
We could make it home, I'd hear you when you're calling

You're right there, yeah
But I won't say that I'm standing
I'm right here, when I see you I panic
So scared of the way it might pan out

I don't wanna say that this was all it was
Trying not to stay but that just made it worse
I've been keeping my distance
I just wanna know what you're thinking
I just can't explain the way it hurts
Now that what we had is gone, I don't have the words
I'm so bad at playing along, saving my feelings
I've been keeping my distance

I've been feeling so high on the way down
Hope I get another chance 'cause I know I wouldn't
Wouldn't let you pass by, wouldn't even think twice
Let you out of my mind, I don't even know why

I've been feeling so high on the way down
Said you treated me bad 'cause you know I couldn't
You know I couldn't

I don't wanna say that this was all it was
Trying not to stay but that just made it worse
I've been keeping my distance
I just wanna know that you're thinking
I just can't explain the way it hurts
Now that what we had is gone, I don't have the words
I'm so bad at playing along, saving my feelings
I've been keeping my distance
