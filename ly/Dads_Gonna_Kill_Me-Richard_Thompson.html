		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out in the desert there's a soldier lying dead
Vultures pecking the eyes out of his head
Another day that could have been me there instead
Nobody loves me here
Nobody loves me here

Dad's gonna kill me
Dad's gonna kill me

You hit the booby trap and you're in pieces
With every bullet your risk increases
Old ali baba, he's a different species
Nobody loves me here
Nobody loves me here

Dad's gonna kill me
Dad's gonna kill me

I'm dead meat in my humv frankenstein
I hit the road block, somehow I never hit the mine
The dice rolled and I got lucky this time

And dad's gonna kill me
And dad's gonna kill me

I've got a wife, a kid, another on the way
I might get home if I can live through today
Before I came out here I never used to pray
Nobody loves me here
Nobody loves me here

Dad's gonna kill me

Woo, dad's in a bad mood, dad's got the blues
It's someone else's mess that I didn't choose
At least we're winning on the Fox evening news
Nobody loves me here
Nobody loves me here

Dad's gonna kill me
Dad's gonna kill me

Dawn patrol went out and didn't come back
Hug the wire and pray like I told you, Mac
Or they'll be shovelling bits of you into a sack

And dad's gonna kill me
And dad's gonna kill me

Who's that stranger walking in my dreams?
Whose that stranger cast a shadow 'cross my heart?
Who's that stranger, I dare speak his name?
Must be old death a-walking
Must be old death a-walking

Dad's gonna kill me

Seven muzzle monkeys standing in a row
Standing, waiting for the sandbox to blow
Sitting targets in the wild west show

Nobody loves me here
Nobody loves me here

Dad's gonna kill me
Dad's gonna kill me

Another angel got his wings this week
Charbroiled with his own willie pete
Nobody's dying if you speak double-speak

And dad's gonna kill me
And dad's gonna kill me
And dad's gonna kill me
