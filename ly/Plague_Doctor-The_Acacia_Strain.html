		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are poison, you are toxic
Black tar oozing from your diseased lips
Half human, steaming pile of putrid pus
Reveling rancid rancor reeling in rot and rust

Born in filth, mourn your health
So fucking proud to be in love with yourself
Scratching and clawing walls turning red
Can't seem to get you out of my head

Buried never breathing
Die never knowing
Feast upon the ashes
It would have never lasted

Wounded and cut, sickening rot
Crippled and dropped in a burial plot
Festering folds of filth and decay
Scrub all you want, you won't wash me away

Buried never breathing
Die never knowing
Feast upon the ashes
It would have never lasted

Soap and bleach to clean the knife
I scrubbed you from my fucking life
Not even death will bring you peace
I cut out your heart and buried it deep
Not even death will bring you peace
I cut out your heart and buried it deep

Nothing to no one
Nothing to no one
Nothing to no one
Nothing to no one
