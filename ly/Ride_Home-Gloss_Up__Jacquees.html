		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jacquees sing, yeah, yeah
(Kutta, cut that shit up, man)
Yeah, yeah
(Sentro)

I'm in this club, but you on my mind (I'm in this club, but you on my mind)
Takin' these shots, I'm watchin' the time (takin' these shots, I'm watchin' the time)
Niggas on me, but I want you (bitches on me, but I want you)
Drunk as fuck, wanna fuck on you
Wanna fuck on you, yeah

Ready for the moment (for the moment)
Liquor got me floatin' (me floatin')
I ain't even gotta say much, you know where this goin'
GPS loaded (GPS loaded) 
I'm tryna stay focused (stay focused, yeah)
Gon' and leave the door unlocked, you know how I'm comin'

Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm ready to ride home
Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm ready
I'm ready to ride home

Ayy, Gloss
He know how I get on that repo' (reposado)
Turn a good girl into a freak ho (what?)
Kitty talk back to him like, "Hello" (hey)
This pussy good and ghetto (ghetto)
He the one and I don't need two (I don't need)
In the section, textin' my boo (my boo)
Whole club goin' up and I don't give a fuck (I don't give a fuck)
I'm just tryna get home to you (you)
Call me an uber black, where you at?
Facetime you drunk like, "Give me that"
If you was here right now, I'd be takin' it
I got my own dick and they hatin' it (they hatin' it)
All these songs remind me of you (of you)
All these shots make me miss you (miss you)
I'm drunk as fuck and I'm on one, come get me out of this booth (come here)

Ready for the moment (for the moment)
Liquor got me floatin' (me floatin')
I ain't even gotta say much, you know where this goin'
GPS loaded (GPS loaded) 
I'm tryna stay focused (stay focused, yeah)
Gon' and leave the door unlocked, you know how I'm comin'

Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm ready to ride home
Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm ready
I'm ready to ride home

I've been out all night, I'm ready to ride home (home)
Send me the addy, I'm on the way to your bedroom (room)
How much you miss me? Bae, tell me, I need to hear that (that)
Set up the camera, and when we're done, we'll watch playback (back)
Pour some drinks, you and me, say some things that we mean
Leave it all on the bed 'til it's wet as the sea
I can switch up the stroke, fast or go slow
Givin' you whatever you want, yeah, oh

Ready for the moment (for the moment)
Liquor got me floatin' (me floatin')
I ain't even gotta say much, you know where this goin'
GPS loaded (GPS loaded) 
I'm tryna stay focused (stay focused, yeah)
Go on and leave the door unlocked, you know how I'm comin'

Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm ready to ride home
Yes, I am, yes, I am
I'm ready
I'm ready to ride home

Yeah
