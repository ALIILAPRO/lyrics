		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hanging above you and it's over
It's over your head
Hovering slowly I hear words
Too and I totally agree
It ain't just you and me

It's hanging above you and it's over
It's over your head
Hovering slowly I hear words
Too and I totally agree
It ain't just you and me

Since then you've been looking at me
Like I been on your mind
Everything would have been
Don't take it like we're taking it home

It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over your head
It's over my head

It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over your head
It's over my head


It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over my head
It's over your head

It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over your head
It's over my head 
It's over your head
It's over your head

It's over, it's over, it's over, it's over my fucking head
