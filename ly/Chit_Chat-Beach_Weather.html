		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey there drama, are you into karma?
'Cause I'm dying to believe you're next
Oh, is your mind erasing?
Well then you better chase it
'Cause the thought it scaring me to death
Can you feel it?
'Cause I feel it now
Are you shaking?

Do you know that it's never 
Ever gonna be the way you want it?
So come on get your fix in now, now, now
You drive me crazy with that 

Chit chat, do you want that or wanna take me home tonight?
All this chit chat is holding me back
And I'm breaking just to bend your light
I thought I told you I really need your sugar
A roller coaster, I'm going supernova
Chit chat is holding me back from you, you

Hello reason, are you into treason?
Do you mind if I steal your heart?
Or is it something sacred
More than you tried to make it?
And you slowly let it rip apart

It's never gonna be the way you want it
So come on get your fix in now, now, now
You drive me crazy with that 

Chit chat, do you want that or wanna take me home tonight?
All this chit chat is holding me back
And I'm breaking just to bend your light
I thought I told you I really need your sugar
A roller coaster, I'm going supernova
Chit chat is holding me back from you, you

Like a phantom I will steal your heart
Until we're dancing in the dark
Like a phantom I will steal your heart
Until we're dancing in the dark

Chit chat, do you want that or wanna take me home tonight?
All this chit chat is holding me back
And I'm breaking just to bend your light
I thought I told you I really need your sugar
A roller coaster, I'm going supernova
Chit chat is holding me back from you, you
