		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's time you learned a lesson
It's time that you understand
Don't ever count on anybody else
In this or any other land

I once hoped for friendship
To find a place among my kind
But those were the childish wishes
Of someone who was blind

Open up your eyes
See the world from where I stand
Me among the mighty
You caged at my command

Open up your eyes
Give up your sweet fantasyland
It's time to grow up and get wise
Come now little one

Open up your eyes

We all start out the same
With simple naive trust
Shielded from the many ways
That life's not fair or just

But then there comes a moment
A simple truth that you must face
If you depend on others
You'll never find your place

And as you take that first step
Upon a path that's all your own
You see it all so clearly
The best way to survive is all alone

Open up your eyes
And see the world from where I stand
Me among the mighty
You caged at my command

Open up your eyes
And behold the fading light
It's time to grow up and get wise
Come now little one
Open up your eyes

Open up your eyes
