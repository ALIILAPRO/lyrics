		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She had nut painted arms 
That were hers to keep 
And in her fear 
She sought cracked pleasures 
The passion of lovers is for death said she 
Licked her lips 
And turned to feather 

And as I watched from underneath 
I came aware of all that she keep 
The little foxes so safe and sound 
They were not dead 
They'd gone to ground 

The passion of lovers is for death said she 
The passion of lovers is for death 
The passion of lovers is for death said she 
The passion of lovers is for death 

She breaks her heart 
Just a little too much 
And her jokes attract the lucky bad type 
As she dips and wails 
And slips her banshee smile 
She gets the better of the bigger to the letter 

The passion of lovers is for death said she 
The passion of lovers is for death 
The passion of lovers is for death said she 
The passion of lovers is for death 
The passion of lovers is for death said she 
The passion of lovers is for death 
The passion of lovers is for death said she
