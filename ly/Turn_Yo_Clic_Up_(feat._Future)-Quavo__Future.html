		  (I love you Atake)

He want the scoop, she want the tea (she want the tea)
I cannot speak, we keepin' it street (we keepin' it street)
I took a loss, but you still gon' get beat (you still gon' get beat)
How much it cost? It never been cheap (it never been)
Turn your clic up, dawg (turn 'em up)
Turn your bitch up, dawg (turn her up)
Tight in these streets, can't cross it (cross 'em up)
All these streets need bosses (boss 'em up)
Turn your clic up, dawg (turn 'em up)
Turn your bitch up, dawg (turn her up)
Tight in these streets, can't cross it (cross 'em up)
All these streets need bosses (go)

If my dawg get low on his pockets, I'm pickin' em' up (soo)
We came from the bottom together, my nigga, we get it, we splittin' it up
If my bitch tell me, "Pay for the pussy"
I take her ass shoppin' and tell her, "Shut up" (shh)
Standin' on business
Standin' on bitches, ain't nothin' to pipe that shit up (soo)
It ain't nothin' to turn a bitch up
It ain't nothin' to turn your clic up (ain't nothin')
Shit, we turned the jeweler up, just look at the diamonds, we bust (yeah)
Look at the people we touched, shit, I'm feelin' like Puffy and Russ (yeah) 
I'm sendin' this shit like a toilet, lil' nigga, so nasty, I never been flushed (ugh, nasty, go)
Bulletproof Brabus it came with a kit on it (kit, skrr, skrr)
The switch it too light, it kick if you spit on it (kick, frrt, grrah, frrt)
Hundreds of bands, I put that lil' shit on 'em (shit, hee, ooh, hee)
Dope in my hand, I had to go flip somethin' (flip it, flip, go, it's gone)

He want the scoop, she want the tea (she want the tea)
I cannot speak, we keepin' it street (we keepin' it street)
I took a loss, but you still gon' get beat (you still gon' get beat)
How much it cost? It never been cheap (it never been)
Turn your clic up, dawg (turn 'em up)
Turn your bitch up, dawg (turn her up)
Tight in these streets, can't cross it (cross 'em up)
All these streets need bosses (boss 'em up)
Turn your clic up, dawg (turn 'em up)
Turn your bitch up, dawg (turn her up)
Tight in these streets, can't cross it (cross 'em up)
All these streets need bosses (boss 'em up)

Big dawg status, Bal Harbor
I ball in his mall for my brothers
Goyard bag, tote the cutter 
I got it out the field, fuck Russell 
Go and ask Lori about the Patek, then go and ask Jordan, ask Dess
Phillipe water, tryna drown a bitch, it's a habit trickin' on a bitch
Shit, I'm thinkin' I could've been a pimp
Shit, I'm cookin' up dope like it's dinner
Shit, I come from Zone 6, nigga trippin'
Shit, I'm floatin', I'm higher than a blimp
Shit, it look like I swimmin' in glass
Shit, I turn up my bitch, 'cause she bad
Shit, I'm makin' her ex-nigga mad
Shit, they goin' for that bap, I'ma smash
Real nigga alert, I'm securin' the bag
Pipin' a bitch, it ain't nothin' I got cash
Turn up the shooters with switches, go bad
Stay with some scammers, my dawg movin' packs
Trappin' or rappin', my dawgy fall off, no cappin', I'm buyin' him a brick
Fuck on your bitch then I told her to call off, actually, I'm makin' her quit
Painkiller, got my lil' demons on go, they ready, hit with the stick
Painkillers, got my lil' bitch on go, she ready to eat up the dick
My main hitters, call up the gang members, they was already on a lick
Hangin' with Migos, all these drugs and guns, think we Mexican
(Freebandz)

He want the scoop, she want the tea (she want the tea)
I cannot speak, we keepin' it street (we keepin' it street)
I took a loss, but you still gon' get beat (you still gon' get beat)
How much it cost, it never been cheap (it never been)
Turn your clic up, dawg (turn 'em up)
Turn your bitch up, dawg (turn her up)
Tight in these streets, can't cross it (cross 'em up)
All these streets need bosses (boss 'em up)
Turn your clic up, dawg (turn 'em up)
Turn your bitch up, dawg (turn her up)
Tight in these streets, can't cross it (cross 'em up)
All these streets need bosses (boss 'em up)
