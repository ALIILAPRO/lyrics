		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The Saptan is a warrior
The Saptan is a king
The Saptan is a guardian, the leader of the Kin
The Saptan is a guardian, leader of the Kin

His first name is Nizar
The son of Sir Quanni
He wrote in his memoir what is now history
He wrote in his memoir what is now history

Yes he lived through the war
The Singularity
He ventured out so far away from authority
He ventured out too far from the authority 

He taught us to embrace
Our darkness and our sins
For noble is our race and stronger is our Kin
For noble is the race and stronger is the Kin
