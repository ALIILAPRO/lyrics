		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a war in my head
Lying next to you I fell asleep
Underneath the skin
There's a woman
There's a human
Still the same

On the last day
The wind took your happiness
I hear your crying

I'll come to you
In one of those summer nights
To lie side by side

I'll come to you
In one of those summer nights
To lie side by side

I'll come to you
In one of those summer nights
To lie side by side

Hold on
Hold on
Underneath the skin
There's someone
(Side by side)

Hold on
Hold on
Underneath the skin
There's someone
(Side by side)

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Underneath the skin
There's someone

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Underneath the skin
There's someone

(Hold on, hold on)
(Hold on, hold on)
(Hold on, hold on)
(Hold on)
