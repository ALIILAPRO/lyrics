		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The roads of youth are fading out of sight
I'll just have to remember what I'm not
Never let me doubt that I won't be trapped
The horses in my head, never will be tamed

The city eats you when you fall
But there you'll find poetry 
That reaches only the lame souls 
Who falls on the road to be free

Before being a number, I'm a soul 
Who tries to grip the freedom of the hole
I hope I'll grow wise, I'm still jeopardized
By all the smashing lights, right in my own eyes

The city eats you when you fall
But I've seen the poetry 
That reaches only the lame souls 
Who falls on their way to be free

You try to walk with pride but time is on your back
No matter what you try, lights will turn into dark
The storm comes real fast, we should take the risk 
Before wearing masks, to explore our dreams

The city it eats you when you fall
But I've found poetry 
That reaches only the lame souls 
Who falls on the road to be
