		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, I look happy, happy all the time
But you don't see me, see me when I cry

I can't find an open door
When I try, it breaks me more
Should I quit and should I go?
Should I leave this all behind?
Same things happen all the time
Can't get out of my mind
Doing things I shouldn't do
If you ask me, I have no clue

Yes, I look happy, happy all the time
But you don't see me, see me when I cry
'Cause I'm a master, master of pretending
Lately never-ending

When does this all make any sense to me?
God, I know you can set me free
And please open a door and again restore
This broken piece of me

A better treasure chest that was made for more
And there is purpose behind closed doors
A better treasure chest that was made for more
And there is purpose behind closed doors

Am I the one who is insane
For not feeling like the same?
All I want is to be heard
In a world that's full of hurt
Waking up, searchin' for a sign
Yes, I fall, but I still climb
No, you don't need me to teach
Just 'cause the dream is far to reach
Take this fear and take that doubt
Throw 'em away before I drown
Before I drown

Yes, I look happy, happy all the time
But you don't see me, see me when I cry
'Cause I'm a master, master of pretending
Lately never-ending

When does this all make any sense to me?
God, I know you can set me free
And please open a door and again restore
This broken piece of me

A better treasure chest that was made for more
And there is purpose behind closed doors
A better treasure chest that was made for more
And there is purpose behind closed doors

When does this all make any sense to me?
God, I know you can set me free
And please open a door and again restore
This broken piece of me
