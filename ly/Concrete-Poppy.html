		  Bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep
Bury me six feet deep
Cover me in concrete
Turn me into a street
Bury me six feet deep
Cover me in concrete
Turn me into a street

Chewy chewy
Yummy yummy yummy
Sharp and pointy
Yummy yummy yummy
Break me off a piece of 
That tasty treat
Sugar in my teeth
Demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep
For eternity

Bury me six feet deep
Cover me in concrete
Turn me into a street
Whoa, whoa

Some people like candy
Some people like coffee
But these lifeless flavors
Don't satisfy me
I tried to eat ice cream
I tried to drink tea
But I need that taste
Of young blood in my teeth

Chewy chewy
Yummy yummy yummy
Sharp and pointy
Yummy yummy yummy
Break me off a piece of 
That tasty treat
Sugar in my teeth
Demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep
For eternity
Sugar in my teeth
Demons in my dreams
Watch me while I sleep
For eternity

Bury me six feet deep and just
Cover me in concrete please
Turn me into a street
Turn me into a street
Don't want to wait forever, and ever, please
Turn me into a street
Turn me into a street
Turn me into a street
Turn me into a street
Turn me into a street
Turn me into a
