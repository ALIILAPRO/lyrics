		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never cared about the money never really needed fame
You think it would've changed me, but I've always stayed the same
The label tried to sue me, TMZ tried to screw me 
Blabbermouth can fuck itself 'cause they never fucking knew me
Everybody seems like they're waiting for me to die 
Talk shit behind my back, can't look me in the eye
They say I'm overrated, that I should've already faded
Give a shit about it all 'cause I love to be so hated

All in all it's a good life I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (it's all sham pain)

I barely get to eat and when I finally get to sleep
I get drug out of bed for another meet-and-greet
I shake the hand of every fan, put on a happy face 
Spread so fucking thin, I'm all over the place
I hate riding on the bus (I) hate flying in the planes 
Sedate myself just to kill the pain
I have no life forgot the hope
The whole thing's turned into one big joke

All in all it's a good life I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (it's all sham pain)

I mean no disrespect, but I ain't picking up the check
Taking selfies on your phone while you're breathing down my neck
It's getting pretty fucking old and I'm almost nearly done
I'm glad that you're happier when I was number one

I'm living the good life a toast to you now
It's all sham pain
All and all it's a good life I got what I want
I can't complain (I can't complain)
I'm living the good life a toast to you now
It's all sham pain (it's all sham pain)
