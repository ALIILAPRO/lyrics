		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't even feel at home
But I keep my feelings low-key
Lockin' me out with no key
I just wanna go, you want me to leave
I don't even feel no love
Only in-between the sheets
Only time you notice me
When I make you feel right
You don't see what I see, yeah

Kissin' me goodnight
Wakin' up to the sunlight
But you only want me over late
Tall glass of lemonade

You don't ever say forever
Layin' next to me
But nights like this I wish I never
Said that I was free
You don't ever say forever
Layin' next to me
But nights like this I wish I never
Said that I was
Free, free, free, free

I'm always gon' answer your calls
Talkin' 'bout, "Come and see me"
I know we ain't even that deep
I'm still comin' anyway, maybe it'll change
I only worry 'bout you
Worry 'bout whatever you need
Always give it to you for free
And I know it ain't right
You don't see what I see

Kissin' me goodnight (goodnight)
Wakin' up to the sunlight (sunlight)
But you only want me over late
Tall glass of lemonade

You don't ever say forever
Layin' next to me (layin' next to me)
But nights like this I wish I never
Said that I was free (free)
You don't ever say forever
Layin' next to me
But nights like this I wish I never
Said that I was
Free, free, free, free

Said I was
Free, free, free, free
Free
Free
