		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know, what went wrong
If I did, would it matter 'cause
It just wasn't enough
You know when the moment comes
To be strong, to resistance
And that is what
We're lead to believe

When the big road falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here, I will be here

You don't mind if life's not that pretty
It will soon disappear and will be miles away
Away from here

When the big road falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
And when it all seems to fall apart
You can't breathe
You don't know what you're thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here, I will be here
I will be here, I will be here
I will be here (I will be here) I will, I will, I will

When the big road falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here
And when it all seems to fall apart
You can't breathe
You don't know what you're thinking
You need somewhere to start
I will be here, I will be here

When the big road falls apart
And you think that the feeling will linger
You need somewhere to start
I will be here, I will be here
