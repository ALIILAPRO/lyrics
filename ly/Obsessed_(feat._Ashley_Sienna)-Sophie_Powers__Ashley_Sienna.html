		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a drama queen
If I don't get what I want then I freak
Like a fever dream
I can't sleep
I can't breathe
I can't eat

You're a certified disaster
You got no class
You talk like trash
You're a walking toxic hazard
It's all red flags

I think that I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
When you touch my lips
Look at me like this
And my heartbeat skips
I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
'Cause you're speaking my language
And you're talking so dangerous
Don't you know I'm shameless?

I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
Yeah, yeah
Obsessed
Yeah, yeah

I'm under your spell
I'm dizzy, I'm weak
Begging on my pretty knees
Looks like I taught you well
Heard 'What You Need' so you used it on me

You're a certified disaster
You got no class
You talk like trash
You're a walking toxic hazard
It's all red flags

I think that I'm a, I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
When you touch my lips
Look at me like this
And my heartbeat skips
I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
'Cause you're speaking my language
And you're talking so dangerous
Don't you know I'm shameless?

I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
Yeah, yeah
Obsessed
Yeah, yeah

I'm obsessed
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you taste
It's something 'bout the way you talk

It's the way you taste
Way you talk
I don't wanna stop (obsessed)
It's the way you walk 
Way you watch, got me feeling hot (obsessed)

It's the way you taste
Way you talk
I don't wanna stop (obsessed)
You're the worst
You're the best
What a mess

I'm obsessed
When you touch my lips
Look at me like this
And my heartbeat skips
I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
'Cause you're speaking my language
And you're talking so dangerous
Don't you know I'm shameless?

I'm a, I'm a
I'm obsessed
Yeah, yeah
Obsessed
Yeah, yeah

I'm obsessed
