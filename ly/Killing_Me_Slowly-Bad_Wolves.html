		  Killing me, killing me
It's killing me slowly

I built these walls to hide my ghosts
Your fingers trace the wounds exposed
I try and try to let you in
But I fail again and again

So I keep you at arm's length and let you go
But I don't wanna give you away
Yeah, I keep you at arm's length and let you go
But only if you promise to stay

You think you know that you know
But you really don't know me (know me)
I know you love so hard
And it's killing me slowly (slowly)

And now I can't eat, can't sleep
Knowing that you're not lonely (lonely)
I know you love so hard
And it's killing me slowly (slowly)

Killing me, killing me
It's killing me slowly

I run this maze, erase my steps
With lips that lie with every breath
You try and try to let me in
But I hurt you again and again

So I keep you at arm's length and let you go
But I don't wanna give you away
Yeah, I keep you at arm's length and let you go
But only if you promise to stay

You think you know that you know
But you really don't know me (know me)
I know you love so hard
And it's killing me slowly (slowly)

And now I can't eat, can't sleep
Knowing that you're not lonely (lonely)
I know you love so hard
And it's killing me slowly
Killing me slowly

You're everything I need
I should've known, I should've known
You're everything I need
I should've known (should've known)

You're everything I need
I should've known, I should've known
You're everything I need
I should've known (should've known, should've known, should've known)

You think you know that you know
But you really don't know me (know me)
I know you love so hard
And it's killing me slowly (slowly)

And now I can't eat, can't sleep
Knowing that you're not lonely (lonely)
I know you love so hard
And it's killing me slowly (slowly)

You're everything I need, I should've known
(It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me slowly)
You're everything I need, I should've known
(It's killing me, it's killing me, it's killing me slowly)
