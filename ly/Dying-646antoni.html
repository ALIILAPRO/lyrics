		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta know, she got my soul
Baby why you acting so cold
When I'm around you hardly show
I bet your friends don't even know
Living life on the road
Baby love to act up
Baby ain't love actor
Only love for fashion
Same drugs always crashing
Same drugs always crashing
I roll a spliff, you roll one too
We getting higher than the moon
I tell you baby, sing the blues
Feel like dying witchu too
Feel like dying witchu too
Why do you play with my feelings
You know when I'm locked in, my love got no ceilings
You see that big smile on my face, that's for image
Wrote this song to show how I'm feeling
I gotta know, she got my soul
Baby why you acting so cold
When I'm around you hardly show
I bet your friends don't even know
Living life on the road
Baby love to act up
Baby ain't love actor
Only love for fashion
Same drugs always crashing
Same drugs always crashing
I roll a spliff, you roll one too
We getting higher than the moon
I tell you baby, sing the blues
Feel like dying witchu too
(Dying witchu too)
