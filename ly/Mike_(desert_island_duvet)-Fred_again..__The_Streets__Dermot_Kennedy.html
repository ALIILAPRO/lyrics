		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All that I've got is you
All that I've got is you
All that I said is true
All that I've got is you

Two people on a carpet with light around the curtains
Two people from a circus on a flying carpet
Give me one thousand and one nights to tell you this story
And then I'll help with the dishes
Like Solomon on green silk with the golden stitches
From old and weathered arts
Only the silk is fast fashion 
and the stitches are barely holding together your heart

Let me re-up your dose of grape
Don't stain your spotless mood
Up close your face don't look the same as from across the room
Your eyebrows look tidier
Your hair the sort of mess that takes hours
Pleasant sky at night on the ceiling
There's an island duvet plot of barring in the sea
Two bedridden people just sharing out the tea
Two people on a carpet couldn't care for what's real

All that I've got is you
All that I've got is you
Don't know what you do
Don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me
Don't know what you do
Don't know what you do
Don't know what you do to me

Two people on a carpet with light around the curtains
Two people from a circus on a flying carpet
You're wiser than your years but everything changes
And when it does what is people refuse to
You caught me at a good time 'cause I'm feeling bad
Tonight the wind is following your command
Is it the Arabian aromas or maybe it's the takeaway?
Your eyes are often advert

Take you back to my loneliest thoughts
Lately my back has got to know the wall
I'm aimless describing what I'm saying, innit
But you persuade me to define what I'm saying, innit
I want life from the sky with none of the pain of living it
Not afraid of heights but I'm afraid of whips
Right in my thinking when your lips go to bite
It's quiet in the kitchen but for the disco lights
Your thoughts go in and find my inner ear
The years of your life giving life to my ears

Two people on a carpet with light around the curtains
Two people from a circus on a flying carpet
You had your heart broken but you're making it stitch
Taking apart everyone you've dated since
Right in my thinking when your lips go to bite
It's quiet in the kitchen but for the disco light

(Don't know what you do to me)
(Don't know what you do to me)
(Don't know what you do to me)
(Don't know what you do to me)

All that I've got is you
All that I've got is you
