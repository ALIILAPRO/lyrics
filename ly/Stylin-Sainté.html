		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain’t really much in the hood these days
I'm tryna get me paid
10 racks can really do good these days
Keep my packs all laid
This baddie wanna link and talk bout dates
Shw don’t know mans face
Know that my links back home wanna see man paid
And I know that’s great
Cah, I know I’m gonna keep it a hunna
All damn summer
Your guy can’t flex like me what a bummer
If your guy need work he can come do runner
Need a YS chain for my YS stunners
On a date with bird tryna cop some hummus
But I need a big whip tryna flex that hummer
Checks for my team gotta split with my brother
Gotta check on my dukes drop a check for my mother
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain’t even been driving no license
But a bean gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now i'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain’t even been driving no license
But a bean gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now i'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding
Took a stop off for tea
Ain't really much with the G’s
Bro got himself a new B
Her drop on fleek
Know that her boy on T
She don’t take calls on E
Never post on the feed
Know that the link cant leak
Don’t bite the hand that feeds
Double up on speed
Bros been out OT
Might never come back lowkey
I was out with the bro on a pedal bike cruising through ends when my bro got a text on His phone
Told the plug bring 10 with a medal back flex hit my darg on a text then post by the home
Never tell when a check finna pop on mans phone if a snake try call leave a message at tone
I ain’t ever took drugs but check out my flex if you watch man step when I’m outta my zone
In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain’t even been driving no license
But a bean gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now i'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding In a whip all vintage just gliding
Tryna flick thru notes just doing my ting
I was out with the brodie just sliding
He ain’t even been driving no license
But a bean gonna slide if we just vibing
I remember back then we were just Skyping
Now i'm out OT with the crew flying
Baby girl tell me are you really riding
