		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know what I'm talkin' bout, I don't-
I don't know what I'm talkin bout,  fuck it
That's like pit stop, you know

I'm so high, got me sick
I'm so high, got me sick
So high it got me sick (yeah)
You know I just want the percs, some alcohol
The fucking weed, with the lean, with the
Hell you need? It’s a drug party
Bring your friends inside here
Maybe it's too much information
Maybe it's too much that I'm spacin'
Maybe it's too much that I don’t think right
Maybe should I ever just stop
At the green light
Is this life? am I living right?
Should I put a new in my sprite tonight
Its the problems in my head, I won’t lie
Why the fuck so many damn questions, man
I don’t even know why
Am I really that special? Am I
Really that one of a kind?

Em deen uoy taht yas ll'uoy taht retfa
Dna yek a dnif tsrif ll'uoy
Yek a dnif ll'uoy tsrif tub
Em rof gnillaf uoy wonk I
Ees I smеlborp eht lla wonk uoy
Em htiw evol ni llef yеht
Taht dias snomed ym dna
Em raeh uoy dias reve uoy ecno
