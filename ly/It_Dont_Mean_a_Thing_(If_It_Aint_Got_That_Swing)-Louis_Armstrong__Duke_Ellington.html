		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What good is melody, what good is music
If it ain't possessin' something sweet?
Nah, it ain't the melody and it ain't the music
There's something else that makes this tune complete

Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
Well, it don't mean a thing, all you got to do is sing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you got

Yes, it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing, boy
I said, don't mean a thing and all you got to do is sing like
Nah, it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got, oh
Don't mean a thing, boy, if it ain't got-a-that a swing-a
A bo ba doop, bo bo ba doop
Take it
