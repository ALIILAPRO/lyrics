		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey Mister DJ
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby

Hey Mister DJ
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never want to stop
It's gonna drive me crazy

Music, music, music, music
Music, music, music, music, music

Music makes the people come together
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Don't think of yesterday
And I don't look at the clock
I like to boogie-woogie, uh, uh
It's like riding on the wind
And it never goes away
Touches everything I'm in
Got to have it everyday

Music makes the people come together, yeah
Music, mix the bourgeoisie and the rebel

Hey Mister DJ

Hey Mister DJ
Put a record on
I wanna dance with my baby
And when the music starts
I never wanna stop
It's gonna drive me crazy
Uh, uh, uh

Music (music) makes the people (makes the people)
Come together, yeah
Music (music) mix the bourgeoisie (mix the bourgeoisie)
And the rebel
