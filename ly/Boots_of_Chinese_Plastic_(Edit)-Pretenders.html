		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four Nam Myoho Renge Kyo Buddha please
Can you help a little peasant that's begging on her knees
Illusion fills my head like an empty can
Spent a million lifetimes loving the same man

[Chorus]
Whoa! Every drop that run through the vein
Always makes it's way back to the heart again
And by the way you look fantastic in your boots of Chinese plastic

Hare Krishna, Hare Rama too,
Govinda I am still in love with you
I see you in the birds and in the trees
That's why they call me Krishna Mayee

[Chorus]

Hoffa told us we should tolerate the people and the things that make me wanna hate
Oh have a little mixed mercy on me, this seasoned beauty in this human pageantry
Jesus Christ came down here as a living man
If he can live a life of virtue then I hope I can
Unto others as you would have a turn
Back here and repeat until you learn, learn, learn

Whoa! Every drop that run through the vein
Always makes it's way back to the heart again
Every dog that lived his life on a chain knows what it's like 
Waiting for nothing!

And by the way you look fantastic in your boots of chinese plastic
