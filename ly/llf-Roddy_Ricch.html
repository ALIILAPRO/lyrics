		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My OG Pete told me 
The goal in life was to have fast money, fast bitches, and fast cars
But the consequences behind that life is glory
But all fast things must slow down at some point
Or life will force you to stop
His result was twenty-six years in the federal penitentiary
I've realized I've lived fast, I wanna take my time
Time is the most expensive luxury in the world
It's something you spend and never get back
But you never know how much you have left

They say we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of our life
They say we gon' be livin' like this for the rest of tonight
You know they gon' be bangin' this shit for the rest of our lives
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young
Live fast and die young

(Ooh, yeah, ooh)
Live fast and die young, ohh, ohh
