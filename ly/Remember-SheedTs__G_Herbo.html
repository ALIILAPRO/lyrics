		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the love, time cost me
Yeah, I never would've thought that you would cross me
Uh, okay, yeah
Baby, please don't give up
(Ayo, Pluto, you going brazy)

Everybody tried until they lost me, uh, lost me, uh, lost me
Yeah, everybody tried until they-
I said, everybody tried until they, yeah (uh, okay)

Yeah, 'member when you said you wan' party? Then we fell in love with X
Layin' up and telling stories, next thing I know, we undressed
Talk about the future or the love, let's talk about what's next
Ask me what I did, my life was dreamy, I told you I'm blessed

Rockstar party (yeah, uh, uh, yeah, come on, uh)
Rockstar party (G Herbo)
It's a rockstar party (rockstar, it's a rockstar, ayy, ayy)
It's a rockstar party (uh)

Livin' like Matt Hardy
"Swervo, is you pullin' up without a foriegn?" And I'm like, "Hardly"
I remember that one year I bought four
But before that, I went on tour
And break the Lamb' and copped another, gotta buy a 'Rari, uh
Pull up BP with the lights on, lookin' like a cop car, smokin' on zaza (roll up)
Cameras on me, got me feelin' like a popstar, take a G6 like a rockstar (X)
I'ma pop out to the club and flex
After that, we makin' love and sex
And you know I don't give a fuck 'bout a check
Wake up, buy you a new Rolex, fuck it
And I ain't duckin' my pistol, I tuck it, you know I'll bust it in public (bop)
You know I'll bust like nine, ten times, we keep on fuckin' and fuckin' (rrah, let's go)

Rockstar party (yeah, rockstar party, it's a rockstar party, it's a rockstar)
Rockstar party
It's a rockstar party (ayy, Sheed)
It's a rockstar party

Yeah, livin' like Jeff Hardy
Bust down, I want Cuban links and diamonds on my body
Yeah, neck on froze like skating rinks and wrist on lazy river
Uh, ho gon' ho, so play the bank and focus on that chicken
What? I got rich 'cause I ain't crash, go back broke, then I'm back whippin'
How you gon' talk about that shit like me and bro ain't stand on business?
Big old walk, diamond chain, take a step back, you can see my pendant
I came in this shit alone, so really I'ma remain the villain (what?)
So much hurt, so much loss, explanation seem the illest
I've been chasing sunsets in this shit so I can see a side

All the love, time cost me
Yeah, I never would've thought that you would cross me
Uh, okay, yeah
Baby, please don't give up
