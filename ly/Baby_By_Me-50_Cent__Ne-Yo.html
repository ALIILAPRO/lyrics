		  Have a baby
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, Be a, Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire

I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thing (when I'm in that thing)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, ow (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)

First it's her neck, yeah then her back
Yeah I'm a freak, I get into all that
Girl I perform for ya, like a porno star
Till ya had enough then I just need a little bit more
New music, new move, new position
New erotic sounds is goin' down now listen
I can hear your heartbeat, you're sweatin' I can paint a perfect picture
I get deeper and deeper, I told ya I'll get ya
I work that murk that just the way ya like it baby
Turn a quickie into an all nighter maybe
Your sex drive it match my sex drive
Then we be movin' as fast as a NASCAR ride
Switch gears slow down, go down whoa now
You can feel every inch of it when we intimate
I'll use my tongue baby, I'll leave you sprung baby
I'll have ya head spinnin' sayin' 50 so crazy (crazy, crazy)

I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thing (when I'm in that thing)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, ow (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean

Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Oh)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Come see what I mean)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Ow)
Be a millionaire, be a, Be a millionaire (Lil mama come see what I mean)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Oh)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (Come see what I mean)
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire (ow)
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire

Girl I want you to give me what you got and give me more
Girl you can start on top or on fours
You know I like it, when you get into it
Don't nobody do it, uh, like I do it
Feel the rush, from my touch, get intoxicated
Drunk off my love, call the Hennessey thug
Passion, ya laughin', I can make you smile on the regular
Tell me what you want, shorty, that's what I'm a get ya
Yeah, I need you to be what I need, more than liquor or weed
I need you to maybe give me a seed
I need you to give me reason to breathe
I need you, I'm tellin' this so you know what I need
I'd be a part-time or full-time lovers, significant other
Don't matter which way it go, I'm oh so gutta
Girl you could get it however you wan' get it
I'm feelin' you, still feelin' you right now, get it

I don't play no games (I don't play no games)
So when I'm in that thing (when I'm in that thang)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean, ow (see what I mean)
Said lil' mama put me on (baby put me on)
Bet I'll have you gone (bet I'll have you gone)
Come see what I mean (see what I mean)
See what I mean (see what I mean)
Come see what I mean, come see what I mean

Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, be a, Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Have a baby by me, baby! Be a millionaire
Be a millionaire, be a, be a millionaire
