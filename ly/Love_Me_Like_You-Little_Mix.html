		  Sha la la la
Sha la la la
Sha la la la

He might got the biggest car
Don't mean he can drive me wild or he can go for miles
Said he got a lot of cash
Darling he can't buy my love, it's you I'm dreaming of

They try to romance me
But you got that nasty
And that's what I want (that's what I want)
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other numbers
When I got my number one

Last night I lay in bed so blue
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you

You still get it that I want
You were pouring out your love, I could never get enough
Now I'm dealing with these boys
When I really need a man who can do it like I can

They try to romance me
But you got that nasty
And that's what I want (that's what I want)
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other lovers
When I got my number one

Last night I lay in bed so blue
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you
Sha la la la, sha la la la (woo ooh, oh oh) 
Sha la la la, can't love me like you (oh)
Sha la la la, sha la la la (woo ooh, oh oh) 
Sha la la la, can't love me like you (oh)

L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me
When you're with me, boy I want it everyday
L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me
When you're with me, boy I want it everyday

Last night I lay in bed so blue
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new (woo ooh)
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you
Last night I lay in bed so blue (love the way you give it to me)
'Cause I realized the truth, they can't love me like you (boy I want it everyday)
I tried to find somebody new (L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me) 
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you (L-O-V-E)
