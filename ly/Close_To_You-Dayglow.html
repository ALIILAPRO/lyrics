		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw you lookin' for the side door
You didn't wanna stick around for
The rest of the night
I guess that's alright
They all left when you walked home
It makes sense that they all know
It was only for you
If only you knew

What good is love
Without any strings?
Held it above
Stuck in between
Tell me for once
What that even means
I wanna know you
But can't make it right

There's somethin' on my mind
There's somethin' that I
Wish I would've told you but you just don't seem
To wonder what I'm doin' when you're close to me
Oh, yeah
There's somethin' on my chest
I wish I would've said
I think it over and it might be true
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you

We locked eyes from a distance
So close but I missed it
Now you're walkin' away
When I wish you would stay
I get stuck in a conversation
A different night, same situation
I beat myself up
For not speakin' up

Every night, I can't make it right, yeah

There's somethin' on my mind
There's somethin' that I
Wish I would've told you but you just don't seem
To wonder what I'm doin' when you're close to me
Oh, yeah
There's somethin' on my chest
I wish I would've said
I think it over and it might be true
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you

Only overthinkin' when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you
Oh, yeah
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you
I'm only overthinkin' when I'm close to you
Oh, yeah
