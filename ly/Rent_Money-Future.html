		  Super
They go crazy
Yeah, they comin' in and out, in and out, in and out
Trap spot boomin'

Got the money comin' in, it ain't no issues
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
Your baby mama fuck me better when the rent's due
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
She sucked my dick, she came home, I bet she kissed you

Treat me like I'm Al Capone, nigga, fuck you
John Gotti, illuminati, nigga, fuck you
I put a middle finger up, because, fuck you
This money got me geekin' up, nigga, fuck you
Red bottoms with the fur like Frank Luc
I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yeah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
She jocked my whole team, she seen who's winnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
This for my dogs on the one way in penitentiaries
Send a direct hit, you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up, I need some more attention
She didn't wanna play fair, I put her on suspension
I put a ki' on Greyhound now I'm in a new dimension
Offered her 25, he tryna take some of my percentage
I was petrified you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
I'm a big dog, it ain't no sense in holdin' back
On my Usain Bolt shit, I ran up me a sack
Fuckin' with them strippers all in G5
And as soon as the club closed we board the G5
I got scammers and junkies lined up on each side
I got five percent tint on each side
I tried to make it outta school on the east side
I'm on my Nicky Barnes shit, so it's fuck school
I'm blowin' money real fast like Big Meech crew
I like my hundreds stacked up, I like 'em neat too
They come in stuck together when they in the wrap still
I fucked a rapper bitch, I was on a drug deal
I fucked a rapper bitch, I was on a drug deal

Got the money comin' in, it ain't no issues
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
Your baby mama fuck me better when the rent's due
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
She sucked my dick, she came home, I bet she kissed you

I fucks R&B bitches, should thank you
Them bricks coming in like the John Doe crew
They put a number on your head, they tryna stank you
I'm 'bout to take 'em out the game, nigga fuck you
They got me goin' insane, now it's fuck you
I let my brother fuck your bitch, he got the dog food
I damn near get half a ticket for a walk through
I fuck dem Super Bowl bitches down in Houston
I got this westside freak that like boostin'
I built my empire up like Lucious
Ayy gimme pounds, gimme bricks, I'm a nuisance
I make the blogs with ya bitch 'cause I'm ruthless
I make the blogs with ya bitch 'cause I'm ruthless
Yeah, I get cash money like I'm Mack Maine
I just put a rapper bitch on game
I be smokin' rapper weed with my gang
I just slam dunked ya bitch hall of fame

Got the money comin' in, it ain't no issues
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
Your baby mama fuck me better when the rent's due
I just a fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
She sucked my dick, she came home, I bet she kissed you

I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you, yeah

Nigga, with your loud ass, bruh
Yo, what's going on E? (What's up, bruh?)
