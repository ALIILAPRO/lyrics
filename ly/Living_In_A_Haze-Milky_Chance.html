		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been up a couple days I wonder why
I been living in a haze what a foolish life
Now I'm back out on the pavement, don't know why
I should be dancing
I should be dancing the night away

I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
Moving like I'm paranoid, paranoid
I wish was a disco boy, disco boy
I should be dancing the pain away, the pain away

I'm gonna wear my favorite color tonight, oh my
I'm gonna shake it like the thunder tonight, oh my
Dreams up in my head
How far can I get
I hope it's not too late to fly 'cause I
Feel like I been going under tonight, oh my

I been up a couple days I wonder why
I been living in a haze what a foolish life
Now I'm back out on the pavement, don't know why
I should be dancing
I should be dancing the night away

I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
Moving like I'm paranoid, paranoid
I wish was a disco boy, disco boy
I should be dancing the pain away, the pain away

I should be dancing 
I should be dancing 

I'm gonna wear my favorite color tonight, oh my
I'm gonna shake it like the thunder tonight, oh my

I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
Moving like I'm paranoid, paranoid
I wish was a disco boy, disco boy
I should be dancing the pain away, the pain away

(The night away)
I should be dancing 
(The night away)
I should be dancing 
(The night away)
I should be dancing 
(The night away)
The night away
