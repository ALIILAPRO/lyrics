		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every night 'round about this time
It's like she knows I'm lonely
Rolls up when the wine is gone
Like a record on repeat
Leaning on old memories
And talking 'bout what we used to be
She'll probably be the death of me
But damn if it ain't sweet

She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warning
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

Shadows dancin' down the hall
Whispers that she wants me
Try my best not to fall
When she falls into me
We all need some kind of fix
For me she's the one I pick
Nothin' else will do the trick
She's all I need

She's my pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warning
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison

For some, I guess it's alcohol
I don't want none at all
I just want you
No, I just want you

My pretty little poison
My heartache in the night
With a kiss on her lips just like cyanide
Yeah, she came with a warning
But I didn't mind
I'll go out on that high every time
She's my pretty little poison
My pretty little poison
She's my pretty little poison
