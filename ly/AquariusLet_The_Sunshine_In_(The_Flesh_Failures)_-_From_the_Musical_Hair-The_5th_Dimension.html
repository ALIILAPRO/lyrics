		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the moon is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Harmony and understanding
Sympathy and trust abounding
No more falsehoods or derisions
Golden living dreams of visions
Mystic crystal revelation
And the mind's true liberation, Aquarius
Aquarius

When the moon (when the moon) is in the Seventh House
And Jupiter (Jupiter) aligns with Mars
Then peace will guide the planets
And love will steer the stars

This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius
Aquarius

Let the sunshine, let the sun shine in
The sun shine in
Let the sunshine, let the sun shine in
The sun shine in
Let the sunshine, let the sun shine in (oh, let it shine)
(Come on) the sun shine in (now everybody just sing along)
Let the sunshine (and let the sun shine on in), let the sun shine in 
(Open up your heart) the sun shine in (and let it shine on you)
(And when you lonely) let the sunshine (hey, let it shine), let the sun shine in
(You gotta open up your heart) the sun shine in (and let it shine on in)
(And when you feel like you been mistreated) 
Let the sunshine, let the sun shine in (and your friends turn their backs upon ya)
(Just open up your heart) the sun shine in (let it shine on in)
(You got to feel it) let the sunshine (you got to feel it), let the sun shine in 
(Oh, open up your heart) the sun shine in (and let it shine on in)
(Now, let me tell you one thing)
Let the sunshine, let the sun shine in (I want you to sing along with the 5th dimension)
(Hey, and open up your heart) the sun shine in (oh c'mon)
Let the sunshine (and let it shine), let the sun shine in 
(Glory day) the sun shine in 
(Hey, you got to feel it) let the sunshine (you got to feel it), let the sun shine in 
(When you open up your heart) the sun shine in (you got to let the sun come on in)
(Now I say, in the morning) let the sunshine, (late in the evening), let the sun shine in 
(Open up your heart) the sun shine in
(Hey, when you're feeling low) let the sunshine
