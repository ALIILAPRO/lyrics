		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Gimme that old time screamin' and a-shoutin' (go up)
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God

I don't need the pills you take
Just to feel the spirit movin'
Brother, I ain't slept in days
All without the drugs you're usin'
Fit me for the builder's use
Use me for the great commission
As it was and always will
As it is, I'm here to witness

Old time screamin' and a-shoutin' (go up)
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God

I don't need the laws of man
To tell me what I ought to do
He reached down and touched my hand
And gave me quite a talkin' to
Gave it to me strict in charge
Somethin' simple I could ponder
'Til the role is called on high
'Til we all meet over yonder

Old time screamin' and a-shoutin' (go up)
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God

I don't need the pills you take
Just to feel the spirit movin'
Brother, I ain't slept in days
All without the drugs you're usin'
Fit me for the builder's use
Use me for the great commission
As it was and always will
As it is I'm here to witness

Jesus said he'd go before
And come back when the house was finished
All this sin and wagin' war
My God's comin' any minute

Old time screamin' and a-shoutin' (go up)
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
Gimme that old time screamin' and a-shoutin' (go up)
Go up, tell it on the mountain
Faith too strong to be left doubtin'
Way of the triune God
Way of the triune God
Way of the triune God
