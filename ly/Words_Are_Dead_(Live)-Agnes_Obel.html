		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna buy you roses
'Cause the words are dead,
Follow in the blindness
On the arrow head
'Cause the words are dead
And you know it
Yeah the words are dead
Lower them down

Didn't know if you could
Deny the dead,
Leaving them in silence
On their moldy bed
Oh I am numb
And over
Their kingdom come
Lower me down

They are dead, they are dead
Oh, don't cry for me,
Oh, don't cry for me,
Oh, don't cry for me,
Oh, don't you cry for me

Lower them down in the ground
Lower them down in the ground
