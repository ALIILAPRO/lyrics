		  "And we ready to (x15)

And we ready to Partay

Yo yo yo, jonny, lets meet infront of the paradise at 11pm man

Like usual its gonna be wild tonight man, Some sick dj’s playing,

And you know the girls gonna be hot.

Yo yo yo man where you at?

We’re all here waiting, were all VIP’d up to the max

We outside the joint man, we can hear the music pumping from inside the club,

And we dying to get in, hope you’re on your way.

Theres sam, jimmy and steve with us to, we got the groove on,

And we ready to partay.


Ahh jonny, you missin this, you missin this,

The chicks are hot, the drugs are good, the lights are flashing, the bass is bumping, we all jumping.

Everybody is getting wild.

And we ready to x15

And we ready to partay

And we ready to partay
