		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, what's up, mane?
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, what's up, mane?
If you try to run
I'ma cock my gat and blast you
If you try to run
I'ma cock my gat and blast you
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, what's up, mane?
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, what's up, mane?

Still got no hoes, so I'm pouring four O's
Solo in a solo cup, double up
Three percs fizzle at the bottom
If you don't know hit you when I throw bones
From a pile of skeletons still
Sitting in my front lawn
Drawn to the shadows, call me Shadowkhan
Crawl to the gallows, now the shadow gone
Born with an arrow, sharp with a broken bow
Aim it at the fucking battlefront
Ladder climbing up to her window
(Ladder climbing up to her window)
Glass shatters, now I'm playing fucking limbo
(Glass shatters
Now I'm playing fucking limbo)
Yeah, I got the cut on my neck
Now that bitch wet only fucking with me when
She thinks I'm depressed
Told that bitch "bet"
I'ma fucking jet, no sweat, I'ma sip lead
Swallow fucking bullets 'till my
Lips seep red, ruby been dead

If you try to run
I'ma cock my gat and blast you
If you try to run
I'ma cock my gat and blast you
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, whats up, mane?
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, whats up, mane?

Yung James Jones sippin' on that throwed
MAC-11 grip, and my fucking pistol all chrome
I'm fucking bound to the bone
Bound to the phonk
Every day a different day
Still getting throwed
Middle finger to the hoes
Middle finger to the world
Umbrella for the tears and the red
Rain coming down my eyelids
Hate this showbiz, hate all this fame shit
Vanish away like SpaceGhostPurrp did
Either that or blow a hole through my head
Shit 'Cause things ain't what it is
Everything's switched
It's like I'm watching a movie
And I've seen the end
Pretend smiles turn to whispers
When your body turns
$carecrow 'boutta burn up in an urn

Whats up, mane? If you try to run
I'ma cock my gat and blast you
If you try to run
I'ma cock my gat and blast you
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, whats up, mane?
Bitch ass niggas make me wanna
Act insane, whats up, mane?
