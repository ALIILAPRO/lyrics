		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There was a little boy, too different to belong, too lonely to be strong (on fire, on fire, oh)
Laying on the ground
He said that fallin' down
It wouldn't make a sound (on fire, on fire, oh)

So now I'm gonna show ya, till the end of time, till the end of time (on fire, on fire)
So now you're gonna know, yeah, why I'm gonna shine, why I'm gonna shine

I'm burnin' I'm on fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore, don't need your oxygen
I'm burning in a new way
Here I am taming the flames
Not afraid anymore, strong like a warrior
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in' -in'

There was a little girl
From a broken family
With a silent fantasy (on fire, on fire, oh)
Her head was in the sky
Heart was made of stars
Her skin was made of scars (on fire, on fire, oh)

So now I'm gonna show ya, till the end of time, till the end of time (on fire, on fire)
So now you're gonna know, yeah, why I'm gonna shine, why I'm gonna shine

I'm burnin' I'm on fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore, don't need your oxygen
I'm burning in a new way
Here I am taming the flames
Not afraid anymore, strong like a warrior
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in' -in'

Oh, I'm burnin', I'm on fire
Oh, I'm burnin'

I'm burnin' I'm on fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore, don't need your oxygen
I'm burning in a new way
Here I am taming the flames
Not afraid anymore, strong like a warrior
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in' -in'

I'm burnin' I'm on fire
Here I am, inside the flames
I don't care anymore, don't need your oxygen
I'm burning in a new way
Here I am taming the flames
Not afraid anymore, strong like a warrior
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in'
And when I hit the dust
I'm gonna get back up
And light up like a flare
I'll be burnin', -in' -in' -in' -in'
