		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It may sound minor but I know that it's major
It may look like a simple complex but it's compound in nature
When it's the root of every movement, it's the motive in my steps
You bet until it gets resolved, I cannot reach a state of rest
I'm laser-focused, with no target
Shooting blindly in the dark
Out of tune with my inner muse
A destination without a start
How can I
Relay my dream onto this page
Of circles, dots, and lines
Of binary dimensions
Make it erase it rearrange the pieces
But one of them is missing
When a chord's dissonant
When a note doesn't fit
Even still I insist I'm
Laser-focused, with no target
Shooting into the dark
Lack of sleep bringing sweet relief
To the siren inside
How can I
Relay my dream onto this page
Of circles, dots, and lines
Of binary dimensions
Oh, I wish I knew
It remains the one thing on my mind
So I'll just keep on trying to break this trend
Only for it to elude me once again
How can I
Relay my dream onto this page
Of circles, dots, and lines
Of binary dimensions
I wish I knew
