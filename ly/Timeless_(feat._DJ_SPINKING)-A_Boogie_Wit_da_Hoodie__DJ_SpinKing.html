		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
Qp spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really

I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, "I love you," I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
'Cause I could never put nothin' over grindin'

I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, but if Floss hit me up I go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more
Switch the flow up, if you a busta I'mma cut you off
Bitch I'm goin' up
Gettin' money, what the fuck you thought?
Nigga, hold up it get ugly
I'm a fuckin boss, hah
Good now but I started off
Just a young nigga runnin' 'round and the butter soft
Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
RIP t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'
I can't waste no time, I can't waste no time with it
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I can't waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
