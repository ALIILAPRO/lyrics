		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I awake or is this just a dream?
I had a nightmare, some sort of vision
I was stuck in an empty room
When the black book appeared
The light were dim but the face in the book
Was in daylight
Eyes of fire staring at me
It's the eyes of a woman
And see on her spirit
Steppin' out of the book

I hear her callin' for her coven to come
There's a light in the doorway
Entering shadows whose number is 13
They do the sign of devil's seed
I'm in the middle of a magic ring
Somebody tell me what's going on
"Only we know the secret
Of the curse that you bear"
Listen, they sing, the coven sings
Night after night, hear them sing
Now they're still here, I can hear them again
Night after night, I have this dream
"You're only living on borrowed
Time from your life"
