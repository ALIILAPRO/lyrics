		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The dark is always coldest before dawn as the day is slowly drawn
Sunlight and daybreak expose all the wrongs
From the night before, we wanted so much more
Now all we crave is rest and retreat

Give me rust over gold like a strength when I'm old
A balance between the light and dark and a cause to uphold
Give me love over hate, a meaningful fate
And an honest and humble ability to appreciate

Loss is always hardest at the start as it breaks the heart
And severs the ties of what once was
As we move on and realize what's now gone
Learn to celebrate the times we once had

Give me rust over gold like a strength when I'm old
A balance between the light and dark and a cause to uphold
Give me love over hate, a meaningful fate
And an honest and humble ability to appreciate

Do you ever stop and think how come
Have you ever wondered why we're so numb
Though it may not matter in the end
I just can't help but ask will we ascend the weak end

Give me rust over gold like a strength when I'm old
A balance between the light and dark and a cause to uphold
Give me love over hate, a meaningful fate
And an honest and humble ability to appreciate
