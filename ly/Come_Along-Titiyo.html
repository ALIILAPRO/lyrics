		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play with it while you have hands 
Dust settles, cities turn to sand 

Trespassing this is their land 
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand 

Come along now 
Come along with me 
Come along now 
Come along and youÂ´ll see 
What it's like to be free 

Come along 
Come along with me 
Come along now 
Come along and you'll see what it's like to be free 

Come along now 
Come along with me 
And I'll ease your pain 
Come along 
Come along with me 
And let's seize this day 
Come along, come along with me 
Oh, come along with me 

Stay out stay clear but stay close 
Friends, foes, God only knows 
Lets be the thorn on the rose 
Time flies, make a statement, strike a pose 

Come along now 
Come along with me 
Come along now 
Come along and you'll see 
What it's like to be free 

Come along 
Come along with me 
Come along now 
Come along and you'll see what it's like to be free 

Come along now 
Come along with me 
And I'll ease your pain 
Come along 
Come along with me 
And let's seize this day 
Oh, Come along with me 

Time flies, make a statement, take a stand
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand
Time flies, make a statement, take a stand
Time flies, take your chance 

Come along
