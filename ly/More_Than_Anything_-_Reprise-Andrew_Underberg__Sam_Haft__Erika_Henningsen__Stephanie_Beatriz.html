		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've already done so much
So many lives you've changed
So many souls you've touched
And in the end, if it's only me you've saved

There's something that I've been dying to say
More than anything, more than anything
Need you to know I love you more than anything
More than anything
