		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You look so pretty
When you cry
Don't wanna hit you
But the only thing
Between our love is
A bloody nose
A busted lip
Three,  a blackened eye

You look so pretty
When you cry
Don't wanna hit you
But the only thing
Between our love is
A bloody nose
A busted lip
A blackened eye

You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped

(Cock, cock, cock it)

When I undo my belt
You melt and you walk away
With a red, red, red welt
(Or so they say)

When I undo my belt
You melt and you walk away
With a red, red, red welt
(Or so they say)

You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped

I wanna have your ache
And beat you too
I wanna have your ache
And beat you too
I wanna have your ache
And beat you too
I wanna have your ache
And beat you too

You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped
You're a little pistol
And I'm fucking pistol whipped

(Cock, cock, cock it)
(Cock, cock, cock it)
(Cock, cock, cock it)
