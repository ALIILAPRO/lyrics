		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've always been afraid
My best years have passed
They say the good ol' days
Well, they never last i've been
Running into you in my head
Inbetween, what could of been ya
Everybody seems to leave
Bittersweet memories

Time does seem to fly
Then it's hard to find, yeah
Used to dine and dash run and laugh
Skinny dip off a ship
Oh woah, not a worry for a million miles
Driving off, be right back, oh
'Cause, baby, after all of this time
We'll meet again, with time to spend
'Cause even after all of this time
Would you be mine?
Cause I'd drop it all just to gеt you

Bring me back to life bring me back to lifе

I've always dreamed too big
For this little town
But now I can't remember how to slow it down
Time does seem to fly
Then it's hard to find, yeah

I've grown tired of being stuck in a race
Office space it's all fake
Everybody seems to cheat
Best believe, that's not me
Want a midnight sky, rolling high
Take a trip on a whim, oh woah
Not a worry for a million miles
Flying off be right back, oh woah
'Cause maybe after all of this time
We'd meet again, with time to spend
'Cause even after all this time
Would you be mine?
'Cause I'd drop it all just to get you

Bring me back to life bring me back to life
