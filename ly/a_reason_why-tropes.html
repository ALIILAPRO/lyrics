		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need more than a reason why
Like why you left me out to dry tonight
Every day I stay right by your side
Is another where I'm spiraling at night
I need more than a reason why
Like why you left me out to dry tonight
Every day I stay right by your side
Is another where I'm spiraling at night

My phone lights up once a month
And every time I'm terrified
Like I can't tell what the fuck you want
Can you clarify? I put the job on me
'cause they all watch me
I can see their eyes one more and I'm dying
(I need more than a r Fuck)

I need more than a rеason why
Like why you left me out to dry tonight
Evеry day I stay right by your side
Is another where I'm spiraling at night
I need more than a reason why
Like why you left me out to dry tonight
Every day I stay right by your side
Is another where I'm spiraling at night

Leave her, she a keeper, going deeper
Cheaper, can't find a pillow
Ain't a sleeper
Weeper, always crying, you should leave her
Leave her, she a keeper, going deeper
Leave her, she a keeper, going deeper
Cheaper, can't find a pillow
Ain't a sleeper
Weeper, always crying, you should leave her
Leave her, she a keeper, going deeper
