		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

Little did you know
Your home's really only a town you're just a guest in
So you work your life away
Just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin

Florida is one hell of a drug
Florida, can I use you up?

The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm haunted but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared
Well, no one asks any questions here

So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?

Little did you know
Your home's really only the town you'll get arrested
So you pack your life away
Just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas

Florida is one hell of a drug
Florida, can I use you up?

I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida

It's one hell of a drug
It's one hell of a drug
Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
So take me to Florida

Little did you know
Your home's really only a town you're just a guest in (take me to Florida)
So you work your life away
Just to pay for a timeshare down in Destin (take me to Florida)
Little did you know
Your home's really only the town you'll get arrested (take me to Florida)
So you pack your life away
Just to wait out the shitstorm back in Texas (take me to)

Florida is one hell of a drug (take me to)
Florida, can I use you up?
Florida is one hell of a drug
Florida, go on, fuck me up
