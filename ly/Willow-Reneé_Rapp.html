		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looks like you're still getting used to
Being fully grown
I know it's hard to slow down when
There's still more to go
Maybe it's just how you're treated
Not something you know
Only so much you can explain
Over the phone

So I'm coming to you
Can I get your permission
To lay underneath you?
Not a special occasion
I just had a feeling
Wanna ask how you're doing
And mean it, I mean it

Willow, don't cry, don't cry
Willow, don't cry, Willow
Willow, don't cry, don't you
Willow, don't cry, don't cry
Willow, I'll cry, Willow
Willow, I'll cry for you

Don't have to use your own tears
Just to grow your own roots
Just keep your passion for flowers
And it'll patch over youth
And there's a whole lot of rain
But there's a hole in the roof
That makes it easy to swim in a bad attitude

So I'm coming to you
Can I get your permission
To lay underneath you?
Not a special occasion
I just had a feeling
Wanna ask how you're doing
And mean it, I mean it, oh

Willow, don't cry, don't cry
Willow, don't cry, Willow
Willow, don't cry, don't you
Willow, don't cry, don't cry
Willow, I'll cry, Willow
Willow, I'll cry for you
