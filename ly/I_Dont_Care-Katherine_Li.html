		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care, I don't care, I couldn't care less
'Cause who would want somebody who would treat them like the best?
I don't mind, I don't mind, that all my friends
Yeah, they're all falling in love, it kinda sucks watching all of them

Not supposed to be a race
It feels like that anyway
Hearing all of them complain
At least they're feeling wanted in some way
Shouldn't feel down 'bout myself
But how come I'm the only one around
Who hasn't had someone clear the doubt?

I don't care, I don't care, I couldn't care less
'Cause who would want somebody who would treat them like the best?
I don't mind, I don't mind, that all my friends
Yeah, they're all falling in love, it kinda sucks watching all of them

Isn't like I'm that obsessed
Thinking about first date dresses
It might all turn out a mess
At least that's what the love song always says
Am I supposed to feel okay
That I won't ever feel the same heartbreak
That I really shouldn't crave

What if it was meant to be this way?
Just needed someone to show up, stay (stay)
Know I didn't say it but just know I still feel like this
When I finally look away

I don't care, I don't care, I couldn't care less
'Cause who would want somebody who would treat them like the best?
I don't mind, I don't mind, that all my friends
Yeah, they're all falling in love, it kinda sucks watching all of them
I don't care, I don't care, I couldn't care less
'Cause who would want somebody who would treat them like the best?
