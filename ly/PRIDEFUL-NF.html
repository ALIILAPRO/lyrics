		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Feels like I work my hardest when I'm at my lowest
Even unhappy people can have happy moments
Even small circles fall when the people you chose are
Lookin' at you like you owe 'em that money you're grossing
Brief seconds that impacted my life, on a huge scale
Weigh 'em like what's wrong and what's right
Predictions I predicted often arrive
Like they own the place, and suffocate the areas that I thrive
Had some disagreements
Business model got some cracks, that's your biggest weakness
Way before I got involved, you knew that ship was sinkin'
So tellin' me to dive in water you won't dip your feet in
Tends to make me question you for lots of reasons
Keep twistin' my words, you got some courage, I applaud you
Tables, they turn, but was it worth what it cost you?
Watch and observe, lot of concerns in my heart, still
Angry and hurt, got what you earned bein' prideful

Prideful, yeah, prideful
Taking what you need, then blame it on me, man
That's so prideful, ayy, prideful
Callin' me conceited, oh, that's how you see it
Well, that's so

That's so shameful
Guess that's what I get for bein' faithful
Oh, you think I'm soulless 'cause the bank's full?
Yeah, oh, you think I'm heartless 'cause I made dough?
Yeah, that's so painful
Didn't know what you was doin' on the down low
Yeah, still you out here actin' like it's my fault
Yeah, I ain't never said I was an angel, no
I know myself enough to know what I need
Showed your true colors, I don't like what I see
Story keeps changin', I know what that means
Know what that means, I know what that means
How'd you go from bein' that somebody I believed
Into bein' someone doubtin' me behind the scenes?
Can't forgive a sorry that I ain't ever received
I mean least you could've done was gave me an apology

But you're so prideful, yeah, prideful
Taking what you need, then blame it on me, man
That's so (that's so), prideful, ayy, prideful
Callin' me conceited, oh, that's how you see it
Well, that's so (that's so, that's so)
(Callin' me conceited, oh, that's how you see it)
(That's so, prideful, prideful, yeah)
(Callin' me conceited, oh, that's how you see it)
(That's so)
