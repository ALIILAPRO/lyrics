		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you like scars?
Do scars make the man?
Do you want me wounded and hardened?
My head in the sand?
My fists up in defiance
Is that what you understand?

Am I too good to be gone?
Beginning the ending for too long

This is my flagship attempt
At a second chance
Do you want me groveling and sober
A brilliant wreckage
Or three sheets to the wind
Three pages of you
But I've misplaced the truth?

Am I too good to be gone?
Beginning the ending for too long

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

So come on, come on, come on

Am I too good to be gone?
Beginning the ending for too long

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

When I crossed myself
Is when I crossed the line
I could see the storm
I had my dagger drawn
I just needed a reason
Something natural
But something wicked came

And we turn like a hog
On the spit of our lives
And the ceremony swells
And our eyes burn bright
But there was never a reason
It was natural
This is part of the fight
So come on
Oh come on, come on
Bring it on

Have we gone too far?
Have we lost our minds?
Imitating the seasons
And we fall behind

Am I too good to be gone?
Beginning the ending for too long
