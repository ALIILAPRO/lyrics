		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got all these bitches lying to my face
Wonder will they ever change
But they always stay the same
Then they switching for the fame
Cut out all the bullshit like im akame
Slice and dice these bitches
Cause they out of fucking place
Like woah
Imma light these bitches like im motherfucking bols
Pussy nigga pulled up but he a no show
Then im finna light his ass like a mistletoe
She said I love you but my heart is already too cold
Stop
Freeze
Yo ass like im esdeath
Fuck with me you end up on yo death bed
On her knees she set the mood thats enough said
End yo life with a blade got no reset
Holy fucking smokes she be on my mind
Reminiscing while I sit back and recline
She too bad like a dime
And it's only a matter of time
Gotta wait till it's right
She go end up falling for me like she fucking mine (yuh)
Slicing off yo head like im akame
If they talking shit like mine
I'll pull up let the choppa spray
Sniper by my side if he talking we can go n play
She liking all the blue i think she tryna hop up onto my wave
I slide into this bitch
Heavy metal
Like im tatsumi
Shorty she can't think of how i be so she imaginate
And she wanna eat on triple 6 i told her grab a plate
I'm slicing all the bullshit with a cursed blade
Shorty you can't be afraid
I'm burning up this beat like i was bols
If you talk on mine then ima pull up with a bolt
Why you always talking shit when you know that you gon fold
It's triple 6 swish n ill let the clip unload
Fuck all of these bitches cause they playing with my mind
I can be like esdeath and go and freeze time
Why the shorty always switching up
She never make her mind
It's about time that i read between the lines
I got all these bitches lying to my face
Wonder will they ever change
But they always stay the same
Then they switching for the fame
Cut out all the bullshit like im akame
Slice and dice these bitches
Cause they out of fucking place
Like woah
Imma light these bitches like im motherfucking bols
Pussy nigga pulled up but he a no show
Then im finna light his ass like a mistletoe
She said I love you but my heart is already too cold
