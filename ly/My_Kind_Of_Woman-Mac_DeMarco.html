		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, baby
Oh, man
You're makin' me crazy
Really drivin' me mad
That's alright with me
It's really no fuss
As long as you're next to me
Just the two of us

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Beggin' you please, baby
Show me your world

Oh, brother
Sweetheart
I'm feelin' so tired
Really fallin' apart
And it just don't make sense to me
I really don't know
Why you stick right next to me
Wherever I go

You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
My, oh my, what a girl
You're my, my, my, my kind of woman
And I'm down on my hands and knees
Beggin' you please, baby
Show me your world
