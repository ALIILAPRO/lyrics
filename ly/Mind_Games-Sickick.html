		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I smell your fear, I smell your f-

There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in there ain't no lettin' go, lettin' go
Watch me turn your mind into my home

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mind mind games, mind games)

Now that I'm in there's no lettin' go
And your emptiness begins
Once I grip onto your mind and soul
Your brightness starts to dim
Sin after sin you won't feel no more
You've lost your trust again
I know you wish you could let me know
That you're prayin' for an end

I can lie to you and tell you you can get me out your head
But I'm lovin' all the pain I'm causin' you too much instead, baby

There's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in there ain't no lettin' go, lettin' go
Watch me turn your mind into my home

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Bitch, you think you know me?
Holdin' back the dark force so long, call me Kenobi
Thinkin' I just gotta force this song when I get lonely
Take advantage, say you'll hold me close but never show me
Someone told me you can only disguise and be pretend
Tears manifest sometimes, my only friend
You'll never see them again they hide behind a mask
Thinkin' you're winnin' with all of your grinnin' but I got the last laugh

I can lie to you and tell you I can't get you out my head
But I'm lovin' watchin' you think you're controllin' me instead

Singing there's another side that you don't know, you don't know
I can't wait to get you all alone, all alone
Once I'm in there ain't no lettin' go, lettin' go
Watch me turn your mind into my home

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Mind mind games until you lose control)

Until you lose control
