		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Solitary motion in the wake of an avalanche Deer in the headlights there goes a weaker one He's listenin' in the fast gaze I don't care now to see the way Do you hear the silence? I was far too late  Oh living for the city and it's always troubling To keep it in the hot lane I don't care about no scenery And you run from it then now you can't escape  'Cause it's all you see But we're all just an end to a simple thing And it's all you see and it's all you see  We're just tamer animals We're just tamer animals  Solitary motion in the wake of an avalanche We took a hit then trying to see if you hold it in And you run from it then now you can't escape  'Cause it's all you see But we're all just an end to a simple thing And it's all you see and it's all you see  We're just tamer animals We're just tamer animals We're just tamer animals""
