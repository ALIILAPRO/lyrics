		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What to do? What to say?
Shall you carry our treasure away?
What a gem, what a pearl
Beyond rubies is our little girl
How can we speak of debt?
Let's not haggle for darling Cosette

Dear Fantine, gone to rest
Have we done for your child what is best?
Shared our bread, shared each bone
Treated her like she's one of our own
Like our own, Monsieur
Your feelings do you credit, sir
And I will ease the parting blow
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed
Now, may I say, we are agreed?

That would quite fit the bill
If she hadn't so often been ill
Little Dear, cost us dear
Medicines are exspensive Monsier
Not that we begrudged her so
It's no more than we Christians must do

One thing more, one small doubt
There are treacherous people about
No offense, please reflect
Your intentions may not be correct

No more words, here's your price
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice
Come, Cosette, say goodbye
Let us seek out a friendlier sky
Thank you both for Cosette
It wont take you too long to forget
