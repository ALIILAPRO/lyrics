		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What it is, ho? What's up?
Every good girl needs a little thug
Every block boy needs a little love
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up

Can't you see it's just me and you?
Panoramic view, that's my point of view, babe
All about me, that's the energy
That's that lemon pepper thing, I'm a ten-piece, baby

Bedroom bully in the bando
He gon' make it flip, do it with no handles
Never switchin' sides, only switchin' angles
Ooh, we go crazy like Rambo

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

Hit 'em up, hit 'em up in a truck
Got it tucked, he get it up like it's stuck
All night, I like
You ain't gotta say it when you know it's on sight

Bedroom bully in the bando
He gon' make it flip, do it with no handles
Never switchin' sides, only switchin' angles
Ooh, we go crazy like Rambo

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

What it is, ho? (What it is?) What's up? (What's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

I don't care if you run the streets
Long as you're comin' home to me
I love the way you walk and the way you speak
He gon' keep it real, that's the deal
That's the reason that I stay down, down (down, down, down, down)
I put that all on my name (all on my name)
Yeah, that's an even exchange (tell 'em what it is)
Stay on your tail, we gon' tell 'em, we gon' tell 'em what, babe?

What it is, ho? What's up? (What it is?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (needs a little thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (needs a little love, yeah)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up

What it is, ho? What's up? (Oh, what's up?)
Every good girl needs a little thug (needs a little thug)
Every block boy needs a little love (little love)
If he put it down, I'ma pick it up, up, up (hey, hey)

Back it up and do-do it like that, yeah (what it is? What's up?)
Back it up and do it like that, yeah (hey, yeah)
Back it up, back it, do it like that, yeah (yeah)
Back it up, gon' do it like that, yeah, woo (hey)

Hey, what it is? (Ay, what's up?)
J White did it (little thug)
More hits on the way, yeah (a lil' love)
We need a lil' love, you know I mean, woo (hey, hey, hey, hey)
Ride out, whoa
