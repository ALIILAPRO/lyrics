		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish that I could change the weather
Enjoy the sound of silence in my car
There's things I just can't hate forever
I found a crowded place to fall apart

You-you-you-you can blame it on N.E.r.d.
You-you-you-you can blame it on a tangerine dream
You-you-you-you can blame it on a spaceman
Blame it on Snacky, blame it on Dexy, ooh
Da-da-da-da-da

I don't like the music on the radio
They don't play my song
I don't like the music on the radio
But I sing along

I wish that I could change the weather
Enjoy the sound of silence in my car
There's things I just can't hate forever
I found a crowded place to fall apart

You can blame it on the neon trees
You can blame it on the love and rockets
You can blame it on a Ladytron
Blame it on Snacky, blame it on Dexy, ooh
Da-da-da-da-da

I don't like the music on the radio
They don't play my song
I don't like the music on the radio
But I sing along
(Da-da-da-da-da)

I don't like the music on the radio
They don't play my song
I don't like the music on the radio
But I sing along

I don't like the music on the radio
They don't play my song
I don't like the music on the radio
But I sing along
(Da-da-da-da-da)

I don't like the music on the radio
They don't play my song
I don't like the music on the radio
But I sing along
(Da-da-da-da-da)
