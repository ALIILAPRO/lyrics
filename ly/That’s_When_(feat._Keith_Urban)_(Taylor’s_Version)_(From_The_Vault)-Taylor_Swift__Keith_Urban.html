		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I come back?"

And you said, that's when, when I wake up in the mornin'
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughin' when I'm cryin'
And that's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby that's when

Mm-mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said "Leave those all in our past"
And you said "When can I come back?" 

And I said, that's when, when I wake up in the mornin'
That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
Laughin' when I'm cryin'
And that's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby that's when

And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone, did you ever think of me?"

And I said, that's when, when I woke up in the mornin'
That's when it was sunny or stormin'
Laughin' when I was cryin'
And that's when you were waitin' at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby that's when

(That's when, when I woke up in the mornin') yeah
(That's when it was sunny or stormin')
When I'm laughin', when I'm cryin'
(That's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate) that's when I miss you
(That's when, when I see your face)
That's when I want you
That's when I love you
That's when
