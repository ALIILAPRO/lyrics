		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lost in a world of my own
Everything feels so unknown
I tried to wake up from this dream
But nothing is quite what it seems
I'm running but I'm not getting far
I'm driving, but I can't find the car
I'm flying, but I can't reach the sky
I'm swimming, but I can't stay alive
Trapped in a dream
Can't break free
It's like reality is mocking me
I'm screaming and shouting
But there's no sound
I'm lost, I'm stuck
I can't be found
The clock is ticking, time's running out
I need to wake up, I need to shout
I need to find my way back to life
Breaking through the chains cut like a knife
Wake me up
Set me free
From this dream, this misery
I need to feel alive again
Trapped in a dream
Can't break free
It's like reality is mocking me (No, I can't gеt it out my head)
I'm screaming and shouting
But therе's no sound (No, I can't, no, I can't get it out my head)
I'm lost, I'm stuck
I can't be found
No, I can't get it out my head
No I can't, no, I can't get it out my head, oh
