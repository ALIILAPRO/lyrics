		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
When you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in the tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop

Heart beats so loud that it's drowning me out
Living in an April shower
You're pouring down, baby, drown me out (ooh-ooh-ooh)

You're just like a river (ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're just like a river (ooh-ooh-ooh)
You go on forever
You're just like a river

Blowing bubbles in the bath, I can't stop from thinking lately
You could be the one, have the honor of my babies
Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile
Was a desert 'fore I met you, I was in a drought

Heart beats so loud that it's drowning me out
Living in an April shower
You're pouring down, baby, drown me out (ooh-ooh-ooh)

You're just like a river (ooh-ooh-ooh)
You're just like a river (ooh-ooh-ooh)
You go on forever
You're just like a river

You're never running dry (oh)

I feel you everywhere
Your face is all in my hair (hair)
Covered up in your sweat
It turns me on that you care, baby
Your love, it flows just like a river

You're just like a river (that's what you are)
You're just like a river (that's what you are)
You're just like a river (that's what you are)
You're just like a river
You're just like a river (heart beats so loud that it's drowning me out)
Just like a river (living in an April shower)
You go on forever (you're pouring down, baby, drown me out)
You're just like a river
