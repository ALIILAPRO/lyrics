		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1
I could be deep in darkest of oceans
I could be buried along with the rest
But a single word from your lips in the distance I'd crawl

Even when you show me the worst of emotions
I would eat the dust from the palm of your hand
I know most people would probably leave but I can't

Chorus
Just don't tell me that you need me If nobody would tell me to stop
I'd be dead and it won't be enough
You'll be leaving, while I'm bleeding
Ooh I'd be gone and you'd say you're sorry but you'd still come to the after party

Verse 2
What if I am scared for the pain when I'm sober
I don't wanna see what you do to me
Even when I think of you know its a sweet memory

I know I am better than this when it's over And all this fucking time I am wasting on you Maybe it's just better to love them and leave Like you do

Chorus
And then you tell me that you need me If nobody would tell me to stop
I'd be dead and it won't be enough
You'll be leaving, while I'm bleeding
Ooh I'd be gone and you'd say you're sorry but you'd still come to the after party

M8
If this our last night
Can you just hold me tight And pretend that you
Don't wanna say goodbye I know that I'll be fine
I know that I'll be fine

Chorus
But then you tell me that you need me If nobody would tell me to stop
I'd be dead and it won't be enough
You'll be leaving, while I'm bleeding
Ooh I'd be gone and you'd say you're sorry but you'd still come to the after party
