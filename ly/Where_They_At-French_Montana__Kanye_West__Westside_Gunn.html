		<p>
		  Take another fuckin' photo, man 
Don't take another fuckin' photo, man (alright my brother, I just got here)
(I just got here, homie)
Don't take no photos, stop it (okay)

Ooh, where they at?
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at?
Where they at? (Grrt)
Ooh, where they at? (Doot-do-do-do-doot)
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at? 
Niggas actin' like they fly than Superflygod, but (Where they at? Yeah)
Where they at?
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at?
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at? (Haan)
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at?

Ayo
Hermes bandana on my head, I think I'm Tupac
The watch four-hundred retail with bethel, got no rooftop (skrrt)
Nine bed, thirteen baths in The Boondocks
Off-White lots, twenty-ones, Laurent tube socks
Got your bitch on the Peter Pan with two blocks
The bomb look like a Fupa, baby, let's make dua
If the dogs come, don't call my phone, I never knew ya 
If you make it, a Pucci wet suit you while we scuba
Multi-millionaire and a two-time loser (ah)
Got a button on the back with the air-booler (grrt)
Got bricks off consignment, if I fuck with you
Gucci racer suit on and I ain't even drive it
(Superflygod, uh-uh)

Where they at?
Where they at? (Doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Ooh, where they at?
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at? (Haan)
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at?
Where they at? Yeah

Remember when they asked dumb shit like, "Can he rap?"
I don't even know where most my Grammy's at
Remember when they asked dumb shit like, "Can he rap?"
Now I can't even find my diamond plaques
Emerge through the smoke and the haze like Isaac
More LV than Pharrell in my closet (no, for real)
South Bronx, I gotta rep, send your bitch outta breath
Word to Anna, smoke the loosey on the Met Gala steps
Reverse the odds, silk Versace on Big in "Hypnotize"
California love, but New York my blood can't pick a side
Both got mansions, just a different size
Cocaine city, the billboards, the rap drug lords
The flow fentanyl, the boys slept on
The opps stepped on, haan

Where they at?
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at? (Grrt)
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at? (Doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at?
Where they at? Yeah
Where they at?
Where they at? (Doot-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
Ooh, where they at?
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at? (Haan)
Where they at?
Ooh, where they at?

What's the deal? (Uh-huh)
For the feel?
For the thrill
What's the deal?
(Coke Boy, baby)
You know what it is, when you hear that, "Haan"
My vibration
High vibration (haan)
Got vibes waitin'
Where they at?
Montana, Westside 
Buffalo, Chicago South Bronx, ha
