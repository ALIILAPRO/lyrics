		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want my kisses back from you
I'm takin' all my kisses back from you
And every breath you held on to
I'm takin' all my kisses back from you
Give me the hello's and goodbyes
And pack up every morning and goodnight
I want the sunrises and moons
I'm takin' all my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you

I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you
Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back from you
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you
Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I'm takin' all my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you

So this is what goodbyes are said for
But I don't even know you no more
Well, you crawl on your begging knees
"Oh, don't hate me, don't hate me, please"
You want me to forgive, forget you
As easy as these lips impress you
And undress what you said was mine
No more lying, no

I want my kisses back from you
I'm takin' all my kisses back from you
And every breath you held on to
I'm takin' all my kisses back from you
Give me the hello's and goodbyes
And pack up every morning and goodnight
I want the sunrises and moons
I'm takin' all my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you

Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back from you
Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back from you
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you
Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back from you

All the sweeter nothing's I said
Way your legs would cross me in bed
Motion pictures you took of us
Lost the color, your cheeks were blush
Our future is a memory at best
Don't bother trying to reach or connect
Like the shade of your lipstick font
You were put on

Now, I want my kisses back from you
I'm takin' all my kisses back from you
And every breath you held on to
I'm takin' all my kisses back from you
Give me the hello's and goodbyes
And pack up every morning and goodnight
I want the sunrises and moons
I'm takin' all my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you

I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you
Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back from you
I want my kisses back, I want my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you
Kisses back, I want my kisses back
I'm takin' all my kisses back
I want my kisses back from you
