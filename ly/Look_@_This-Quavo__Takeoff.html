		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Infinite)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

Look at this (yeah)
Check me, look at this (check me)
I got three on the neck, two on the wrist
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (uh)
And my diamonds got insurance, it's no GEICO (ice)
Show out on these hoes, player Patek, rose gold
Uh, big ol' stick
If I shoot the rounds, they gon' stick (woo)
Look at it ki-ki-kick
Now they forfeitin', it kick (yeah)
Red eye coupe, no time, went at it 
Do topsy turns in that
Too many bitches
I got three on the neck (three), two on the wrist (two)
Two on the wrist (two, ooh)

Two on the neck, 'bout three on the wrist (literally)
The money keep comin', the tabs keep runnin'
Don't know what to do with this shit (no)
The cars and clothes and hoes
No, you know we ain't new to this shit (you know that)
We given our tags for toes
For niggas that troll and look like a lick (lick)
Poppin' out, I'm out in Paris fashion week
You see the pics (flash)
Medallions big as a Ferris, askin' me, "How much is this?" (Wow)
No matter the problem or the occasion, know that we takin' the risk (go)
Some niggas would rather be famous
But you see me, I was made for this (Takeoff, oh)

Look at this (yeah)
Check me, look at this (check me)
I got three on the neck, two on the wrist
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (uh)
And my diamonds got insurance, it's no GEICO (ice)
Show out on these hoes, player Patek, rose gold
Uh, big ol' stick
If I shoot the rounds, they gon' stick (woo)
Look at it ki-ki-kick
Now they forfeitin', it kick (yeah)
Red eye coupe, no time, went at it 
Do topsy turns in that
Too many bitches
I got three on the neck (three on the neck), two on the wrist (two)
Two on the wrist (two, ooh)

If I through the lane, I'm dunkin', don't do layups, yeah (no-no)
I don't spill the drip for free, young nigga, gotta pay up, yeah (oh)
The gang go on a spendin' spree, like Latrell, yeah (spree)
How much your drip cost? (Woo)
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (two hunnid)
I even told Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder to look at this (Ray Charles)
Mama, Takeoff, gave me a Perky, swear I felt it kick (mama)
Dropped a bag of presidents, I came from bowls of grits (go)

Look at this (yeah)
Check me, look at this (check me)
I got three on the neck, two on the wrist
Three on the neck, two on the wrist (uh)
And my diamonds got insurance, it's no GEICO (ice)
Show out on these hoes, player Patek, rose gold
Uh, big ol' stick
If I shoot the rounds, they gon' stick (woo)
Look at it ki-ki-kick
Now they forfeitin', it kick (yeah)
Red eye coupe, no time, went at it 
Do topsy turns in that
Too many bitches
I got three on the neck (two), two on the wrist (two)
Two on the wrist (two, ooh)
