		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember what I said
Spoken in the dead of night
We're through
I hear voices in my head
Saying that you wouldn't want
To you
So why does it hurt?
I left you first
Can't admit it to myself
But I guess I was wrong
Knew the entire time
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
You are looking into my eyes
Saying that you never felt
This good
Now I dream of better times
Wishing I could hold you close
Again
So why does it hurt?
I left you first
Can't admit it to myself
But I guess I was wrong
Knew the entire time
So why does it hurt?
I left you first
Can't admit it to myself
But I guess I was wrong
Knew the entire time
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
You are my dearly beloved
