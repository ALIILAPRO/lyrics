		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, let's be it girl

Outrageous

Sexy as I want to be
Got these fellas chasing me
It's 'bout time I hit the streets
All my girls still feelin' me

B-girl ain't lost the beat
Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet
Gotta keep going, no stopping me
And if you don't like it then

La la la la la la la

Media over here
Come through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show, it's

Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, let's be it girl

Outrageous

Ding ding ding
Ding ding ding ding ding

I'm about to bring the heat
Locking down the industry
All dressed up and glamorous
Red carpet and cameras

Take trips around the globe
Rims on my Jeep, so nobody knows
So hot that you're coming out your clothes
I'm about to give it to ya

Media over here
Come through like a world premiere
Trench coat and my underwear
Let's go with this freak show, it's

Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, let's be it girl

Outrageous

I just want to be happy
In a place where love is free
Can you take me there somebody?
Oh, and when you mention my name
Make sure you know the truth
Until I'm about to keep it forever

Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, let's be it girl

Outrageous, when I move my body
Outrageous, when I'm at a party
Outrageous, in my sexy jeans
Outrageous, when I'm on the scene
Outrageous, my sex drive
Outrageous, my shopping spree
Outrageous, we on a world tour
Outrageous, let's be it girl
