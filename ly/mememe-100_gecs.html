Back once again

And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
Anything about me

You'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

When we were together, I tried to tell you
I used to tap dance and I was in choir
And I broke my arm when my dad crashed a go-kart
He didn't mean to, my mom didn't buy it
I tried on your lipstick, I thought I looked pretty
But you didn't care, no, 'cause you're always busy
And you're always busy, so you never hear me

So you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

Do I sound like a joke when I'm talking to you?
I take it back quick and I nod like "true"
You say so many things, and I don't know what I mean
Short messages to you, short messages to me
Now if I think of a joke when I say goodbye
I put my palms on my face and pretend to cry
But I'll laugh too fucking hard, you probably think I'm so mean
But I don't even know you, and now you'll never really know

And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

I guess it's such an easy game, ga-ga-game, ga-ga-game
If I put you right to sleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep
Rationality could change, cha-cha-change, cha-cha-change
All in the car I was asleep, sle-sle-sleep, sle-sle-sleep
Could you explain it all away? (Way-way-way, way-way-way)
Like it was all so clean? (Cle-cle-clean, cle-cle-clean)
So content about the weight off my back, I forget
And I guess I never knew, but I don't think I'll pretend it's cool
And I guess I'll never know

Know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
No, you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me

Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me (woo)
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me
And you'll never really know, know-know-know, know-know-know
Anything about me, me-me-me, me-me-me-me-me
