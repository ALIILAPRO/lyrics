		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was more like a beauty queen from a movie screen
Said "don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one?"
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She says I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She said her name was Billie Jean, and she caused a scene
Every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Mother always told me be careful who you love
Be careful what you do before the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who said that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights the law was on her side
Who could can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and her plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round

So take my strong advice
And remember to always think twice, do think twice

She told my baby that we danced till three
And she looked at me, showed a photo of my baby crying
His eyes were like mine
'Cause we dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
Then she stood right by me, the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon, but she called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who says that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son

So take my strong advice
And remember to always think twice
Do think twice
