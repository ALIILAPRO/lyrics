		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Perfect)

(Sheesh) I be on ten, ten, ten (sheesh), shit
Me and my niggas came here for the win (double up), shit
I'm with the gang, I ain't worried 'bout them (uh, yeah), shit
Me and my niggas came here for the win

She ain't fuck with me back then, but she comin' 'round
'Cause she see I'm banking them M's
She lookin' at me for bands, she turned to a fan
Now she got her hand down my pants
I need them hunnids on hunnids on hunnids
On hunnids on hunnids on hunnids, it's true
They say that time is money
If time is money, then why would I spend it on you?

Huh (what), okay (yeah)
We used to sit on the sidelines (yeah, what)
She used to give me the side-eye, shit, okay
Now she gon' say that it's my time ('cause it is), whoa-whoa
Now she on my time (she is), bitch, go away
Twelve hour flight to Japan (yeah)
I need a bitch when I land (yeah)
Tokyo James, my coat (my coat)
Know they gon' search on the 'Gram (yeah)
I don't rock chains no mo' (I don't)
I just spent a bag on a home (I did it)
Plain Jane watch just to mix it up (mix it up)
I don't wanna make you feel broke (I don't)

Flexing with your re-up, like you up (like you up)
Fucking with my bro, he keep it tucked
I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm up, up, up
Yeah, I'm up, up, up, yeah, I'm (yup)

I be on ten, ten, ten (sheesh, I am)
Me and my niggas came here for the win
I'm with the gang, I ain't worried 'bout them
Me and my niggas came here for the win

She ain't fuck with me back then, but she comin' 'round
'Cause she see I'm banking them M's
She lookin' at me for bands, she turned to a fan
Now she got her hand down my pants
I need them hunnids on hunnids on hunnids
On hunnids on hunnids on hunnids, it's true
They say that time is money
If time is money, then why would I spend it on you?

Ten, shit, ten, yeah
I be on, uh, I be on, uh, ten, yeah, yeah
