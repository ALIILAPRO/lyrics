		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days I can't face the world outside
I fall straight into my mother's arms
Oh and some days it feels like no one's on my side
Then I look into my mother's eyes

Into my mother's arms
Oh, just feels like a child
Just like a child
Into my mother's arms, where I
Where I shall belong
Where I won't be home

Mm, some say, "If you never have to hide
If you just live within the line you draw"
But I know, if you take away the light
If you take away the light, it's all dark, is it not?

Ooh, into my mother's arms
Oh, just, just like a child, no
Just like a child, no
Into my mother's arms
Where I, I don't have to hide
And show my mother's eyes

Mm, say "Hush child, lay your worries off the side
'Cause you rest into your mother's arms"
