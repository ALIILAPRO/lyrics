		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God, it's the pistol, put the crack back
Stayin' on my job dealin' wit haters wit a jab step
Dealin' wit this mob, police watchin', studio phone tapped

Going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God, it's the pistol, put the crack back
Stayin' on my job dealin' wit haters wit a jab step
Dealin' wit this mob, police watchin', studio phone tapped

You best believe that I could see ya from a mile away
Thought that my girl was down sleepin' wit the enemy
The streets are dangerous I could be dead any day
That's why I'm ridin' wit my dawg smokin' plenty hay

This shit contagious, doin' dope and it's killin' me
Even though I know I hit the snow, is you feelin' me?
This shit contagious, doin' dope and it's killin' me
Even though I know I hit the snow, is you feelin' me?

Going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God, it's the pistol, put the crack back
Stayin' on my job dealin' wit haters wit a jab step
Dealin' wit this mob, police watchin', studio phone tapped

Going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God, it's the pistol, put the crack back
Stayin' on my job dealin' wit haters wit a jab step
Dealin' wit this mob, police watchin', studio phone tapped

Going through a thang but I gotta snap back
Give it all to God, it's the pistol, put the crack back
Stayin' on my job dealin' wit haters wit a jab step
Dealin' wit this mob, police watchin', studio phone tapped
