		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You crossed my mind, it's been a while
Now I'm sitting in a taxi with his arms around me
She just moved out, and I don't know why
I really wanna call you up and talk about it

Soon as one of us is happy
The other one gets lonely
So sad it's almost funny
How off we are
Should it be this hard?

Never took the shot, thought I had to hide it
It was stupid, I know
Never spoke my mind and I blamed the timing
Every time we got close
Yeah, we could be great
Anybody can see it
I'm the last one to know
Never took the shot, it was dumb, I'm sorry
Is it over? Did we miss the party?

I broke it off, didn't hurt that much
Now I've been hoping I would meet you out, without feeling guilty
I just meet someone, and now I'm stuck
She got me packing all my stuff, we're leaving the city

Soon as one of us is happy
The other one gets lonely
So sad it's almost funny
How off we are
Should it be this hard?

Never took the shot, thought I had to hide it
It was stupid, I know
Never spoke my mind and I blamed the timing
Every time we got close
Yeah, we could be great
Anybody can see it
I'm the last one to know
Never took the shot, it was dumb, I'm sorry
Is it over? Did we miss the party?

Ah, ah-ah, ah
Is it over? Did we miss the party?
Ah, ah-ah, ah
Is it over?

Soon as one of us is happy
The other one gets lonely
Sounds a bit dramatic
But it's killing me, slowly

Never took the shot, thought I had to hide it
All those years ago
Never spoke my mind and I blamed the timing
Should have followed you home
Yeah, we could be great
Anybody can see it
I'm the last one to know
Never took the shot, it was dumb, I'm sorry
Is it over? Did we miss the party?

Ah, ah-ah, ah
Is it over? Did we miss the party?
Ah, ah-ah, ah
Is it over? Did we miss the party?
