		  Konvict, konvict, konvict

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)

'Cause we gon' fight, oh yes, we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you)

Nobody wanna see us together
Nobody thought that we'd last forever
I feel them hoping and praying
Things between us don't get better (better)
Men steady coming after you (you)
Women steady coming after me (me)
Seems like er'body wanna go for self and
Don't wanna respect boundary
Telling you all those lies (oh, ooh)
Just to get on your side (side)
But I must admit there was a couple
Secrets I held inside (inside)
But just know that I try (try)
To always apologize ('gize)
And I'ma have you first
Always in my heart to keep you satisfied (satisfied)

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)

'Cause we gon' fight, oh yes, we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you)

You got every right to wanna leave (wanna leave)
You got every right to wanna go (wanna go)
You got every right to hit the road (hit the road)
And never talk to me no more (me no more)
You don't even have to call (have to call)
Even check for me at all (me at all)
Because the way I've been acting lately (I've been acting)
Has been off the wall (off the wall)
Especially towards you (towards you)
Putting girls before you (before you)
And they watching everything I've been doing
Just to hurt you (hurt you)
Most of it just ain't true (ain't true)
And they won't show you (show you)
How much of a queen you are to me
And why I love you, baby

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)

'Cause we gon' fight, oh yes, we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you)

(Oh, oh, ooh, oh)
'Cause I got you, babe
(Ooh, oh, ooh, oh) 
'Cause I got you, babe
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
'Cause I got you, babe
(Oh, ooh, oh, ooh)
Cause I got you, babe

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)

'Cause we gon' fight, oh yes, we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)

Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)

'Cause we gon' fight, oh yes, we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Believe we gon' fight (we gon' fight)
Fight for our right to love, yeah (right to love, yeah)
Nobody wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no ('cause I got you, babe)
