		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My body
My body feels like winter
And I stayed in bed until dinner
I don't feel the way I look anymore, mm

You gave your love away
To someone else
I know she knows my name
So take responsibility
For the crimson letter on your face

Oh, morning
Does she know you in the morning?
Does she know all of your broken parts and secrets like I do, like I do?

You called me
You called me from her bedroom
And said that you would be home soon
I fell asleep and woke up alone, mm

You gave your love away
To someone else
I see her everywhere
There's no accountability
For this battered heart you can't repair

Oh, morning
Does she know you in the morning?
Does she know all of your broken parts and secrets like I do, like I do?
Oh, morning
Does she love you in the morning?
Or does she throw away the one who holds her closest like you do, like you do?

Do you see the mess you're making? (Making)
Do you see the mess you made me? (Made me)

Oh, morning
Does she know you in the morning?
Does she know all of your broken parts and secrets like I do, like I do?
Oh, morning
Could she love you in the morning?
Or does she throw away the one who holds her closest like you do, like you do? Mm
