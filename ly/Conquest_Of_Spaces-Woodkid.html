		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stretched to the core of galaxies
Distorted city grids
By a black hole of vanity
Blossoms the age of greed

Beyond the laws of density
Towers of glass and steel
Temples and fragments of memories
Drifting away from me

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces
Expanding between you and me
Come with the night the science of fighting
The forces of gravity

After the gates of prophecies
A million light years away from me
Straight for the eye of destiny
Reaching the point of tears

Behind the dreams of mastery
Love dies silently
Torn to the flesh as the fire bleeds
Echoes of history

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces
Expanding between you and me
Come with the night the science of fighting
The forces of gravity

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces
Reaching the starlight and silver fields
Come with the night the science of fighting
The forces of gravity

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces
Expanding between you and me
Come with the night the science of fighting
The forces of gravity

I'm ready to start the conquest of spaces
Reaching the starlight and silver fields
Come with the night the science of fighting
The forces of gravity
