		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no
And I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no

And I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no
And I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no

In a whip thinkin' what if
You and this never existed?
Hollow kiss, bottle liquor
Man, I'm sick, man, I'm schizo

All white leather
You know this man ain't shit without you in the interior
I'm dying somewhere in the dark
All white leather
And I think what if we weren't riding, dying together?
The whole world would fall apart

And I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no (never felt so alone, alone)
And I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no

I thought you were my new best friend
Wish I knew better then
Who knew you were just out to get me?
My whole world just fell apart

'Cause I never felt so alone
Felt so alone, no, no
I could never be more alone
Than when I ain't got you here
