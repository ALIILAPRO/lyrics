		  Where the fuck my blunt? Where the fuck my cup? Where the fuck my reefer?

Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
I'm smokin' on kush
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
I'm smokin' on kush
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You know I'ma chief 'em
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, huh
You know I'ma chief-

I'm flyin' just like a eagle
Bitch cryin', I don't need her
.45, long heater
Hellcat big, two-seater
This bitch said she was hungry, this dick what I feed her
I'm on the block servin' entrees, yeah, three-fives a reefer
Yeah, yeah, you know I'ma keep 'em
Huh, huh, let me chief
All these hoes some eaters, huh, huh, they be eatin'
Cut the lights off, we gon' pull up creepin'
We got four sticks, we four deep, in the four door Jeep
My boy' trigger finger itchin', leave yo' brains on the seat
My trigger finger itchin', I feel like D-Wade with the Heat
Made him do the runnin' man, we sent some runnin' shots at his feet
I pop X, I pop X, yeah, yeah, I'm geeked
She pop X, she pop X, yeah, yeah, she sleep
Cullinan Rolls Royce, I'm 'bout to pull up to a meet
Let's play Russian roulette, bitch, who gon' die first, you or me?
You or me?

(Let's play Russian roulette, bitch, who gon' die first, you or me?)
You or me?
(Let's play Russian roulette, bitch, who gon' die first, you or me?)
Yeah

(Star made the beat, I just took it out the oven)
Yeah

I been fighting my demons, huh
I been fighting my-, yeah
I been fighting my demons, huh
I been fighting my-, yeah
I been fighting my demons, huh
I been fighting my-, huh
I been fighting my demons, huh
I been fighting my-, huh, huh
I been fighting my demons, yeah
I been fighting my-, huh, huh
I been fighting my demons, yeah
