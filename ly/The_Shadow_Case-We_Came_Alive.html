		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Rebirth, rebuild the empire that you’ve once destroy
Asking yourself a question well I don’t have the answer

Trying to escape the fate
I knew you doesn’t have a guts to do it all

Finding a way to escape from
A cold blooded murder

Will it be the end of me?

will you save me when I am fallin’
Deepest into the other side of me
Trying to escape from the nightmare

But you don’t have a guts
I know you never have a guts

I saw the mirror image of you, there’s a ghost who kept chasing your steps forth and back

Finding a way to escape from
A cold blooded murder

Will it be the end of me?

Will you save me when I am fallin’
Deepest into the other side of me
Trying to escape from the nightmare

But you don’t have a guts
I know you never have a guts

I saw the mirror image of you, there’s a ghost keep chasing your steps

It still lives in you
It still lives in you

The mark of the death

Rebuild, the story of a dead man

Chasing his own grave
Chasing his own grave

The mirror image of perfections
The vision of the worst destruction"
