		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are everything to me
And I, I would die for you
There have been times when I'm up all night
Crying in the dark, so I sleep with the light on
I've heard I've got words like a knife
That I don't always choose just so wisely
But I see trees and the colored leaves
When I think about all that we could be

And when you're gone, time is so slow
And like the grass, I've watched us grow
I heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I never let you know?

But you are everything to me
You're sweeter than candy cane
Better than any childhood dreams
I am yours, and you are mine
I have your heart, I don't even need a ring
I'd give up all I have, in exchange for who I love more than anything

And when you're gone, time is so slow
And like the grass, I've watched us grow
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow
How could I ever let you go?

But you, you're everything to me
And I, I would die for you
Yeah, I would die for you

And when you're gone, time is so slow (I would die)
And like the grass, I've watched us grow (I would die)
I've heard you reap only what you'll sow (I would die)
How could I never let you know? (I would die for you)
