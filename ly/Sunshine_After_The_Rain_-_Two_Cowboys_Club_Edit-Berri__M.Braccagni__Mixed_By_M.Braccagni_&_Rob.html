		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
when you were mine
since you went away
my heart's not free
it keeps raining down on me
will there be a day
when the sun will shine
I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
sunshine after the rain
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
when I hear your name
I start to cry, each day's the same since your goodbye
it's like a game, forgetting you
every night I pray
tomorrow brings a sunny day and happy things
just like the way it used to be for you and me
I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
sunshine after the rain
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
everywhere I go
I see a face we used to know
I pass a place we used to go
when you were mine
since you went away
since you went away
my heart's not free
it keeps raining down on me
will there be a day when the sun will shine
I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
sunshine after the rain
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
I want to see the sunshine after the rain
I want to see bluebirds flying over the mountains again
sunshine after the rain
oh where is the silver lining shining at the rainbow's end
