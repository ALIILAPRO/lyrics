		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
I can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The thought of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Whoa, you didn't let me know that is real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm my lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say 

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love you

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You'd be like heaven to touch
Oh, I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby
To warm my lonely nights
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say 

Oh pretty baby
Don't bring me down I pray
Oh pretty baby
Now that I've found you stay
Oh pretty baby
Trust in me when I say
