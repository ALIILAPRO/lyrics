		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of the blue
I found you
When I wasn't even looking
You landed in my life
And it felt like
I opened up my eyes and I came alive
Like color in the dead of the night

Can we stay this way?
Hold on or will we let it get away?
Can you feel what's coming next?
Is this real or just the butterfly effect?
Just the butterfly effect

I've been caught up
Felt it enough
To know it's hard to make it last
But you give me a good rush
With every touch
You open up my eyes and I come alive
Like color in the dead of the night

Can we stay this way?
Hold on or will we let it get away?
Can you feel what's coming next?
Is this real or just the butterfly effect?
The butterfly effect

I'm loving how I'm feeling like I'm floating away
Maybe we can be the ones

Who stay this way
Hold on, never let it get away
Can you feel what's coming next?
Is this real or just the butterfly effect?
Just the butterfly effect
The butterfly effect
