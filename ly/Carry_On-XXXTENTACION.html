		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you
Yeah
High up, but you fall back down

Trapped in a concept
Falsely accused, misused and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you fucking rest in peace
(I tried to be patient with you)
(Yeah)
(High up) Now the fact that I'm alone is fucking comforting
And I can't seem to shake this fucking feeling in my
(How did you get here) Cold shoulder, heart broken, misspoken
I'm cut open, her fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd probably dance
On my grave, inside my head
I see your face, I fucking hate
That I love you still
(High up) yeah
(But you fall back down)

(How did you get here) carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah

How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, but you fall back down
