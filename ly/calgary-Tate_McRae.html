		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Mm, mm

Same bar, same street
I'm twenty, but I still feel like fifteen
Oh, oh
Same fears, same dreams
Still tryna get my brother to like me
Mm, mm

You said that I always seem to land on my feet
But I got problems hanging like a chain 'round my neck
Trying, but I'm barely seeing past twenty-three
And the best of me right now is looking a lot like a mess

I thought I had my shit together
Can't lie, the pills are looking tempting
Oh, oh
I thought that I was getting better
No, I got better at pretending
Oh, oh
Oh, ah
Oh, ah

Old friends, downtown
They didn't like me then and don't like me now
I'm drunk, oh wow
All my habits came back around
I'll figure it out, that's what I say
Figure it out and take a break
I'll figure it out

Maybe, one day, I'll finally get my shit together
Can't lie, the pills are looking tempting
Oh, oh
I thought that I was getting better
No, I got better at pretending
Oh, oh
Oh, ah
Oh, ah
Oh, ah
Oh, ah

And I do it again, I'm a creature of habit
The moment's gone, but I'm still tryna catch it
Everyone left, and I never got past it
Never got past it

Same bar, same street
I'm twenty, but I still feel like fifteen
