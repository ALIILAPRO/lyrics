		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know that I'll be there for the highs and lows
Give you mine if your heart gets broke (ME13)
By your side when you're all alone
I will be there

And I'll be there for the highs and lows
Give you mine if your heart gets broke (gets broke)
By your side when you're all alone
I will be there

Ayy, Prinz (and I'll be)
I'll be there through the highs and lows
We all know life gets tough when you're by yourself, it's a lonely road
If you ever need someone, stop crying around and call my phone and
I will be there
Yo, look
These highs and lows are a part of life
Live everyday like it's your last, I left my past, the futures bright
If leave the dark, you'll find the light
If you're going through high and lows, remember
I will be there

And I'll be there for the highs and lows
Give you mine if your heart gets broke (gets broke)
By your side when you're all alone
I will be there

I feel like I take life easy, you'll never see me on the drivers wheel
Always the passengers side of the journey, let me sit back and enjoy my meal
Nonchalant, I keep myself to myself
You ain't gonna hear my plans, I keep my circle small 
Seen too many man try giving their helping hand (haha)
They see me winning, I'm making more, and I'm speaking less
I prove them wrong every time I sing
They make a mistake and they second guess
They know I got G-O-D on my side and He told me
I will be there

And I'll be there for the highs and lows
Give you mine if your heart gets broke (gets broke)
By your side when you're all alone
I will be there

And I'll be there for the highs and lows
Give you mine if your heart gets broke
By your side when you're all alone
I will be (ME13)
