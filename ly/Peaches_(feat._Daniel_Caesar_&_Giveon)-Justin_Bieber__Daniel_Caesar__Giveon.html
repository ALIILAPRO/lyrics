		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

And I say, oh (oh)
The way I breathe you in (in)
It's the texture of your skin
I wanna wrap my arms around you, babe
And never let you go, oh
And I say, oh
There's nothing like your touch
It's the way you lift me up
Yeah, and I'll be right here with you 'til the end

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

You ain't sure yet
But I'm for ya
All I can want
All I can wish for
Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs
There's no time, I wanna make more time
And give you my whole life
I left my girl, I'm in Mallorca
Hate to leave her, call it torture
Remember when I couldn't hold her
Left her baggage for Rimowa

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

I get the feeling, so I'm sure (sure)
Hand in my hand because I'm yours, I can't
I can't pretend, I can't ignore you're right for me
Don't think you wanna know just where I've been, oh
Done being distracted
The one I need is right in my arms
Your kisses taste the sweetest with mine
And I'll be right here with you 'til the end of time

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)

I got my peaches out in Georgia (oh yeah, shit)
I get my weed from California (that's that shit)
I took my chick up to the North, yeah (bad ass bitch)
I get my light right from the source, yeah (yeah, that's it)
