		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
He cut out my tongue
There is nothing to save
Love me, oh Lord
He threw me away
He laughed at my sins, in his arms I must stay

He wrote
I am broke
Please send for me
But I am broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

Her skin is white and I'm light as the sun
So holy light shines on the things, you have done

So I asked him how he became this man
How did he learn to hold fruit in his hands?
And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay

Left me alone, when I needed the light
Fell to my knees, and I wept for my life
If he had've stayed, you might understand
If he had've stayed, you never would have taken my hand

He wrote
I'm low
Please send for me
But I'm broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

And where is the lamb, that gave you your name?
He had to leave, though I begged him to stay

Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip
Begged him to stay by the light of this ship
Me fighting him, fighting life, fighting dawn
And the waves came and stole him and took him to war

He wrote
I'm broke
Please send for me
But I'm broken too
And spoken for
Do not tempt me

Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay
Cut out my tongue, there is nothing to save
Love me, oh Lord
He threw me away
He laughed at my sins, in his arms I must stay

We write
That's all right
I miss his smell

We speak
When spoken to
That suits us well
That suits us well
That suits me well
