		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I dead?
Name on a toe tag
So cold
Living in a body bag
Think I'm dreaming
'Cause I'm not feeling anything

Hands tied, trying to rip the bandage
One breath
Away from the casket
As I'm bleeding
Life won't leave me
I can't stop thinking

If my world stops spinning
And tomorrow never comes
Will I be remembered?
Did I give enough?
Will I be forgiven?
For everything I've done
What if I don't wake up
And tomorrow never comes?

Every lie
Every word unspoken
I remember every heart that I've broken
Buried like bones
Beneath my headstone

Did I try
Did I try to make amends?
live and die
Or did I really just pretend
Nightmare's talking
As I'm sleepwalking
But I can't stop thinking

If my world stops spinning
And tomorrow never comes
Will I be remembered?
Did I give enough?
Will I be forgiven?
For everything I've done
What if I don't wake up
And tomorrow never comes?

Can't tell me it's too late
Don't tell me to lose faith

If my world stops spinning
And tomorrow never comes
Will I be remembered?
Did I give enough?
Will I be forgiven?
For everything I've done
What if I don't wake up
What if I don't wake up
And tomorrow never comes?

What if I don't wake up
What if I don't wake up
What if I don't wake up
And tomorrow never comes?

What if I don't wake up
What if I don't wake up
What if I don't wake up
And tomorrow never comes?
