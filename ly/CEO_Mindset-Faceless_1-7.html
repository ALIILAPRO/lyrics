		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Double C, that's Chanel, I know that she like it
Hit the spritz, then she's "It" for the rest of the night
Coco filling up the air, chest tight
Who's that?
My girl
Goddamn, that's right
Double C, that's Chanel, I know that she like it
Hit the spritz, then she's "It" for the rest of the night
Coco filling up the air, chest tight
Who's that?
My girl
Goddamn, that's right
In the party
Feeling so sick
Hundred-thousand dollars on my watch, that's it?
Fuck about a bitch, give her cock, she spit
Told her she's 'gon "Gawk gawk gawk" on this shit, she 'gon
She 'gon hit
Told her "Run this"
I'mma make her clap like this, that's lit
I'mma make a hit, right there, on-the-spot
I told that girl to drop, 'cause I like your bitch a lot
Double C, that's Chanel, I know that she like it
Hit the spritz, then she's "It" for the rest of the night
Coco filling up the air, chest tight
Who's that?
My girl
Goddamn, that's right
Double C, that's Chanel, I know that she like it
Hit the spritz, then she's "It" for the rest of the night
Coco filling up the air, chest tight
Who's that?
My girl
Goddamn, that's right
