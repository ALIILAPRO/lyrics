		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whisper soft, porcelain
Handle careful and restrain
To seek is to find me
We would die if we'd walk the same

Oh-oh I wanna go alone with you
Even though I know I'm high alone
Oh-oh I wanna go alone with you
Even though I'll die alone

What's the use of hatred?
You're smart and know what's in your head
The process of dying is painful
I don't wanna believe the comfort is in your head
Your head

Oh-oh I wanna go alone with you
Even though I know I'm high alone
Oh-oh I wanna go alone with you
Even though I'll die alone

I wanna go alone with you
Even though I know I'm high alone
Oh-oh I wanna go alone with you
Even though I'll die alone
