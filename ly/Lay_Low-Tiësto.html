		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time

I'm hearin' voices in my head
There's no way to escape
Da-da-da-da, they got me
Anytime, anywhere
In my mind, in the air
Da-da-da-da, surround me
(Lay low) they surround me
(Lay low) surround me
Anytime, anywhere
In my mind, in the air
They're waiting for me
Oh, they're callin' on me

Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time (surround me)
Yeah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and baby, I feel high
I feel high (they're callin' on me)
Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time (surround me)
Yeah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and baby, I feel high
I feel high (they're callin' on me)

I'm hearin' voices in my head
There's no way to escape
Da-da-da-da, they got me
Anytime, anywhere
In my mind, in the air
Da-da-da-da, surround me

Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time
Yeah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and baby, I feel high
I feel high

(Lay low) they surround me
(Lay low) surround me
Anytime, anywhere
In my mind, in the air
They're waiting for me
Oh, they're callin' on me

Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time (surround me)
Yeah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and baby, I feel high
I feel high (they're callin' on me)
Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time (surround me)
Yeah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and baby, I feel high
I feel high (oh, they're callin' on me)
