		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Should I stay? Should I go?
Should I run far away
To the point where I can't
Even see the universe?
I know I’m killing time
And baby that’s not fine

I’ll pack it in, pack it in
Never smoke anything
Never eat anything that will
Compromise my health
And, baby that means you, too that means you

It’s impossible to pin-point
You were like a fat joint
I cannot remember you back in November
Never gonna allocate all of this dark hate
Stuck in the middle, middle of it

Give it up, give it up, give it up for lent
Take a break, pack it in
Take it out to the bin
Isn’t it counterfeit? Take a hit a little bit
Wasn’t it not worth it?
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna even know
Why you haven’t even sold our band of gold
Isn’t it counterfeit? Take a hit a little bit
Wasn’t it not worth it? Whoah

Slip up, faux pas, yet another mistake
When we blunder all I see
Is another thunderstorm
Brewing above the house of anarchy we share

When we have a visitor
They are visibly disturbed
The don’t want to hang around in
The company of you and I
And I don’t blame them one iota no I don’t

It’s impossible to pin-point
You were like a fat joint
I cannot remember you back in December
Never gonna dissipate all of this black hate
Stuck in the middle
In the middle of it of all

Give it up, give it up, give it up for lent
Take a break, pack it in
Take it out to the bin
Isn’t it counterfeit? Take a hit a little bit
Wasn’t it not worth it?
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna even know
Why you haven’t even sold our band of gold
Isn’t it counterfeit? Take a hit a little bit
Wasn’t it not worth it?

I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna be your personal assistant
You’ll meet my resistance everyday, oh
What’s it gonna take to make it
Crystal clear to you we are through?
I’m angrily surprised at you i don’t wanna
I don’t wanna be like this back then
Yes, maybe, now it’s crazy
We’re no good for one another, no, no, no
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna act like this
You know I wanna be free i want to be free
I want to be free

Give it up, give it up, give it up for lent
Take a break, pack it in
Take it out to the bin
Isn’t it counterfeit? Take a hit a little bit
Wasn’t it not worth it?
I don’t wanna, I don’t wanna
I don’t wanna even know
Why you haven’t even sold our band of gold
Isn’t it counterfeit? Take a hit a little bit
Wasn’t it not worth it? Whoah
