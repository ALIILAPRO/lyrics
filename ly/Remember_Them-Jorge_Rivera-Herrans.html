		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Captain
Captain!
Captain!

We must move quickly
We don't have much time
He didn't notice I mixed lotus in his wine
Mark my words now
This is not the end

But captain, what'll we do with our fallen friends?

Remember them
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them!
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone!
And our comrades will not die in vain

I need all our hands on his club
This is how we're getting out of here
Use your swords to sharpen the stub
And turn it to a giant spear!
(Let's kill him!)
His body is blocking the path!
If we kill him we'll be stuck inside!

Captain where do we attack him?

We gotta stab him in the eye!

Yes sir!

Remember them!
When the fire begins to fade
For the fallen and afraid
We are not to let them die in vain
Remember them!
We're the ones who carry on
The flames of those who've gone
And our comrades will not die in vain!
Now!

Argh

Scatter!

Ahh

Who hurts you?

There are more of them?

Who hurts you?

Hide

Who hurts you?

Captain we should run

Wait

Who hurts you?

Captain please!

Wait!

It was Nobody Nobody!

If nobody hurts you be silent!

Don't go!

Let's grab the sheep and away we go!

Have you forgotten the lessons I taught you?
He's still a threat until he's dead
Finish it

No

No?

What good would killing do
When mercy is a skill
More of this world could learn to use
My friend is dead!
Our foe is blind!
The blood we shed
It never dries!
Is this what it means to be a Warrior of the Mind?

Don't!

Hey, cyclops!
When we met I led with peace
While you fed your inner beast
But my comrades will not die in vain!
Remember them!
The next time that you dare choose not to spare
Remember them
Remember us
Remember me!

I'm the reigning king of Ithaca! 
I am neither man nor mythical
I am your darkest moment!
I am the infamous
Odysseus!
