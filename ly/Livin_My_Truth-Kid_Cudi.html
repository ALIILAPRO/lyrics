		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-uh, dude
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh

Lights flicker for the mighty rager nigga (I like)
When the girlies lookin', please don't ask for pictures (it's a)
Mission every day just livin' out some scriptures (we here)
We forever (know that)
I won't miss ya (uh, uh)
Turn it loud, it don't matter when and how (it's cool)
I Feel I graduated, time I take a bow (salute)
New adventures, we escapin' with the crew (as we do)
Get all in it (aha)
No more slackin' (he a beast)

Mhm
This life goes on and on, yeah
Mhm
Livin' my truth is all I know, yeah
Mhm
In this life it goes on and on, yeah
Mhm
Livin' my truth, livin' with love

True story, it's the chapter of the chosen (we are) (do-do-do-do-do)
Hands high, feelin' right, I'm rosie golden (we off) (do-do-do-do-do-do-do)
To new experiences, memories I'm holding (feel like)
I'm a winner (uh-huh)
Never losin' (na-uh)
I remember like my momma use to tell me (you can)
Do anything no matter what they tell me (papa)
He'd be proud, he be smilin' from the clouds (no doubt)
Got my angels (and God)
On my job (to the moon)

Mhm
This life goes on and on, yeah
Mhm
Livin' my truth is all I know, yeah
Mhm
In this life it goes on and on, yeah
Mhm
Livin' my truth, livin' with love
