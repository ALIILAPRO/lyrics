		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It was June
I was ten
I still think of that day now and then
A parade
And a girl
And a crowd of thousands
She sat straight
As a queen
Only eight
But so proud and serene
How they cheered
How I stared
In that crowd of thousands
Then I started to run
And to call out her name
As the crowd on the road went wild
I reached out with my hand
And looked up
And then she smiled
The parade
Traveled on
With the sun in my eyes
She was gone
But if I were still ten
In that crowd of thousands
I'd find her again

You're making me feel I was there too

Maybe you were 
Make it part of your story

A parade

A parade

Passing by

Passing by

It was hot
Not a cloud in the sky
Then a boy
Caught my eye

In a crowd of thousands

He was thin
Not too clean
There were guards
But he dodged in between
Yes he made himself seen
In that crowd of thousands
Then he called out my name
And he started to run
Through the sun and the heat
And crowd
I tried not to smile
But I smiled
And then he bowed

I didn't tell you that

You didn't have to
I remember!

The parade
Traveled on
With the sun in my eyes
You were gone
But I knew
Even then
In a crowd of thousands
I'd find you again

Your highness
