		  (Metro)
(Metro Boomin, want some more, nigga)

Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)

I just spent a twenty thousand dollars on a freak (dub)
I went white diamonds, pink diamonds in the teeth (pink)
Fuck her on the private, on a island, on a beach (private)
I can turn your block into hydraulics for a fee
Water on my neck and wrist, you lookin' for the reef (ice)
I come from the north but I got shooters on the east (North side)
Ten Perky got me burnt, I could barely speak (I'm burnt)
Money, you ain't never earn, it practice what you preach (hey)
Me and Metro once again, know how this shit go (Metro)
Told my young nigga not to spin, here go you some bowls (how)
I got twenty thousand friends now that I got on (on)
Way before I signed a deal, it's trappin' on some phones
I can't trust nobody no more (no trust)
Momma told me cut him off, she see he act a hoe (my momma)
I got ten of 'em, I'ma stand on every toe (ten of 'em)
F&N, nigga, and they takin' niggas' souls (baow)
Like the boogeyman (boogeyman)
Shows in Amsterdam, million dollar Lamb' (Lambo)
Man, I thought he was my twin 'til he showed his hand (my twin)
I done ran my millions up, walk past, I don't know the man

Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (night)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (night)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (night)

Man, I feel alone, but that's how it gotta be (alone)
Man, I would be lyin' if I say I ain't miss the three
Nights I wanted to cry, why them niggas blamin' me? (Hey)
I don't want no sorry, nigga, the pain I feel ain't easy (hey)
I'm thinkin' spinnin' bout' my brother Take, this shit been eatin' me
I can't get no peace when I be sleepin', seein' demons
Fake smile on my face but they don't know that I be schemin' (for real)
Don't nobody starve, everybody eat (eat)
Hold the stick like a guitar, we were runnin' in the streets (hey)
I think she a star, put Chanel on her feet (Coco)
Diamonds up to par, when we step out, go to eat (hey)
Swimmin' with the sharks, it get dark in the sea (dark)
When you livin' large, got her hand out for free
Sticks in the car, we ain't playin', we on D
We ain't playin', we on D

Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (yeah)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (night)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (night)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (opps)
Night vision, I can see the opps when they hide (night)
