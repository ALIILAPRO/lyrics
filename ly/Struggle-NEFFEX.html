		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, growing up ain't easy
Too many things to do weekly
Too many thoughts to think deeply
Too many thoughts to be sleeping, yeah
Oh my god, I'm not eating
I feel so empty, I'm receding
And all of my friends are misleading
All of these posts and
The lives they're leading, yeah

Oh, no way
I ain't gon' stand for this today
I'ma keep my head down, I'm okay
I don't wanna listen to a word they say
Uh, and we all know fear is a slogan, yeah
And we all feel broken, yeah
And we all outspoken
Need someone who can just go show them

Sometimes I struggle in this place
Been in circles several days
Never knowing the right way hmm, yeah
Sometimes I struggle in this place
People look the other way
And we all deal with our pain oh, yeah

No, I'm not down, no, I'm not out
If I got a voice they gon' hear me shout
I can make my own choice and
We've all got a mouth
I'ma make noise, yeah, that I don't doubt
I don't feel failure, not yet
Mistakes, they make ya better, don't regret
And like Drake's said, man, I'm upset
Too many people out here
Wasting their breath, yeah, yeah

And still I feel like we've
Just all been going crazy
Too many people need to
Find themselves some safety
Just take control of your life
It's all day to day, yeah
Don't need nobody else
Myself can always save me

Sometimes I struggle in this place
Been in circles several days
Never knowing the right way hmm, yeah
Sometimes I struggle in this place
People look the other way
And we all deal with our pain oh, yeah
Sometimes I struggle in this place
Been in circles several days
Never knowing the right way hmm, yeah
Sometimes I struggle in this place
People look the other way
And we all deal with our pain oh, yeah
