Hahaha, wh-what the fuck?
Je t'aime, Trippie Redd (WNDWS)
(I'm shy, oh my God) Yeah

Yeah, she sucked them Dragon Balls
Bitch, I feel like Cell (Cell)
And I'm schizophrenic, might do damage like the cell
R.I.P. my brother, rob some banks, put 'em in that cell
They can't comprehend that we so real
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (yeah, yeah, yeah) (kamehameha)

Crash like Titanic, special beam cannon like I'm Piccolo
I was getting bread, lil' bitch, I had to pick the loaf
Throw me in the sun like I'm Broly, I'm invincible
Put my codeine in the freezer, smoking on this Nimbus cloud
Twin Glocks, Gohan Krillin, nigga, but I am not kiddin' 'round
Put a Halo on my head when I hit her in the spirit realm
Fat nigga, Majin Buu, I'm eating, never gave a fuck
Spirit bomb my wrist, lil' bitch, 'cause I've been blowin' up
That Wock' and 'Tussin, hit the fusion dance, gang

Yeah, she sucked them Dragon Balls
Bitch, I feel like Cell (Cell)
And I'm schizophrenic, might do damage like the cell
R.I.P. my brother, rob some banks, put 'em in that cell
They can't comprehend that we so real
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (yeah, yeah, yeah) (kamehameha)

And I feel like Coola
'Cause I'm the coolest
Mr. Satan, number one shooter
Spike Devilman 'cause I'm the boolest
Master Roshi, I can teach you how to do it
And I travel galaxies like a God, I'm Lord Beerus
Collect the Dragon Balls and wish for a new Urus
Keep that heater, Super Saiyan, bitch, like I'm Vegeta
Prince of all Saiyans, I ain't playing, from the future
Keep that steel on me, like I'm Trunks (okay)
That Wock' and 'Tussin, hit the fusion dance, gang

Yeah, she sucked them Dragon Balls
Bitch, I feel like Cell (Cell)
And I'm schizophrenic, might do damage like the cell
R.I.P. my brother, rob some banks, put 'em in that cell
They can't comprehend that we so real
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku
They don't understand it, Planet Namek, like I'm Goku (yeah, yeah, yeah) (kamehameha)
