		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
They need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance
That whole defense

Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinning me
It's never-ending, never-ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I will never surrender?

In time or so I'm told
I'm just another soul for sale
Oh, well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent
We're temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I will never surrender?

I'm the voice inside your head
You refuse to hear
I'm the face that you have to face
Mirrored in your stare
I'm what's left, I'm what's right
I'm the enemy
I'm the hand that'll take you down
Bring you to your knees

So who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
What if I say that I will never surrender?

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays
You're the pretender
Keep you in the

Keep you in the dark
You know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark
And so it all began
