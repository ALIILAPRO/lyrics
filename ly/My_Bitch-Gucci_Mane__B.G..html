My bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (Honorable C.N.O.T.E.)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch

When you mine, I'll spoil you like the kingpin daughter (skrrt)
Flaunt ya, look at what the dope man bought ya (mwah)
Hunt ya, Gucci fishin' head, I just caught ya (go)
Scored ya, if you ain't doin' the things the way I taught ya (huh)
Hold ya, flood your wrist with iced-out boulders (burr)
I'm the coroner, so make sure you salute me like a soldier (woo)
Soldier, when the pull up's overdue, just like I told you (woo)
I'm 'bout to drop the top so we can get some more exposure (huh, huh)
Had the jet waitin' on the runway and we pulled up with the doors up
My bitch keep bumpin' into people 'cause she walkin' with her nose up (woah)
A hundred bottles of Don P, baby, drank it 'til you throw up (yeah)
When you was younger, baby, tell 'em what you wanna be when you growed up (yeah)

My bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (huh)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (what? I need me a hot girl)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch (look)

That's my lil' bitch (bitch), that's my lil' slut (slut)
Man, I swear to God she is a mug (mug)
She love to fuck (fuck), she like it rough (ooh)
She's so real, had to put her in cuffs
She like to fight, she love to cuss (cuss)
Got my name tattooed in her butt (yeah)
She never lie (no), she never steal (no), always knew she was the one I could trust (trust)
She say she was leavin', but that was a bluff (bluff)
Left her nigga, then was back in an hour (yeah)
Laid her down, hit that pussy for hours (yeah)
Always tell me, "Daddy, you got the power" (power)
Always tell me, "Daddy, lead, I'ma follow" (follow)
She get mad, get to kickin' and hollerin' (yeah)
Got to barkin' like a baby chihuahua (woof, woof, woof) 
Calm her down, then we fuck in the shower (shower)
Dick her down, she don't give me no problems (none)
Like to look me in my eyes when she swallow (look)
Lil' raw dog, we don't fuck with no condoms (none)
Raw dog, make her my baby mama (mama)
Made her mad, had to send her some flowers (flowers)
When she mad like that pussy more fire (yeah)
I'll never leave you, bitch, that's a promise (yeah)
Shoot, Chopper City, Michelle Obama (bitch)

My bitch (yeah)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (no way I'd mug you, my bitch girl)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (the real nigga break it off)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (take it off, I'ma break it off, yeah)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (when you mine)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (you know what happen)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (you get the word)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you my bitch (if you my girl)
When you my bitch, my bitch, my bitch, when you, huh? My bitch
My-, come on right here
