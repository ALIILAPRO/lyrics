		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Remember running down the hills like
We were young I thought we'd never die
I thought things would never change

But now we're older and we're wiser
Isn't it crazy how time flies
And how all the colors have changed
Oh I wish that I knew then what I know now

You say you lost your good thing now
Stumbling around all over town
Hands in the air up high
We were seventeen
Seventeen
You'd say it's time to go back home
I'd always walk you to your door
Staring up at the stars
We werе seventeen
Sevеnteen

Remember how I used to call you
We used to whistle on the Avenue
I thought we'd always remain

And though we're older and we're wiser
Still think of you from time to time
And how all the colors have changed
And I wish that I knew then what I know now

You say you lost your good thing now
Stumbling around all over town
Hands in the air up high
We were seventeen
Seventeen
You'd say it's time to go back home
I'd always walk you to your door
Staring up at the stars
We were seventeen
Seventeen

And IIII I know
Everything that comes must go
But what a show
What a show

You say you lost your good thing now
Stumbling around all over town
Hands in the air up high
We were seventeen
Seventeen
You'd say it's time to go back home
I'd always walk you to your door
Staring up at the stars
We were seventeen
We were seventeen
We were seventeen
