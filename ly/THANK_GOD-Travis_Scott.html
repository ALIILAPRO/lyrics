		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't doubt it, I won't
He won't mislead all His followers
Prayin' on the process, minus Spirit
Feel like
Like I'm
Floatin' in my prime time

One life, live it, right now
One life, live it, yeah

Goodbyes, that's life
Fun times, for life
For life, from down my eyes
Thank God I'm free tonight 
Ooh

Got God on the line
Tell the devil I'm fine
He always tryin'
Tryin' his best (no question)
Top of the pole, me and my bros
When the story gets old
It's gon' be BMF (muchas gracias)
This shit sound hard
It wasn't made easy
You can't live twice
Thank God I'm breathin' (you are not fuckin')
We gotta go now

One life, live it, right now
One life, live it, yeah

Goodbyes, that's life
Fun times, for life
For life, from down my eyes
Thank God I breathe tonight (let me in)

Oh

Still no pressure
Thank God, I breathe
'Cause shit I speak is what they need, I tell no lies
I'm still up top, they still can't drop, I'm what they not
Yeah, yeah (yeah)
Last tape was filled up with slaps, I just gotta run this shit back
Didn't like the way this shit went down at the awards, I admit it, turned to a beast
This that shit right here that get me goin', after I pop me a piece
Way that we killin' the critics and killin' the hate, might gotta talk to a priest
The way we evolved and knocked down walls, this shit's outrageous
I quarterback calls, I don't like 12, except Tom Brady
Can't short my stock, I still stack tall, you still can't trade me
Storm's a minor but you know she livin' major (that's right, daddy)
When you flyin' up this high, it ain't no cables
Shit so lit, what happen in Vegas, it stay in Vegas
Mornin' time, we check the news, we made the papers
