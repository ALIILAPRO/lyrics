		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep my name up out yo mouth better keep that head down watch the ground

Imma never get involved in all that petty shit
Don't fuck around

Tryna be the best but I guess I'm like the rest my soul go south

Triple six can't fuck with this
Wanna bark like a dog get bit by the hound

Pussy mothafucka talk shit
On the kid
Tell me why the mothafuckas wanna be so big
With the keyboard clicks
And the ego fix
Put the black fit on imma let shit rip like
Put em in a six foot grave
Rest in piss better get em out the way
I don't wanna play
But I keep on creating the ways that I make it to every goal that I made

Bitch I really really be feeling like I am Jason
Put em in a coffin with the blood up in the basin
I don't give a fuck another one, basic
Bodies in the basement
They don't wanna face it

Uh
And I'm back in this bitch
Brand new track
Black cap
In the fit
They cannot fathom the work I put in to be part of this shit
No chains on the kid

No chains on the kid
Never gon change
Don't wait on it bitch

I don't want fame
No name
Till I'm dead

Keep one face
Same face
To the end

Wonder why the trust runnin paper thin
Worlds unjust play safe wanna win

Tryna stay sane
Never stable again
When they label a man
Can't escape
Not a way to advance

Not a way to advance
I don't ever wanna be anotha mothafucka stuck up in a trance
Imma talk back
Till they wanna put me in the back of a black Cadillac and leave my body in a bag
In the bottom of the god damn sea

Aint nobody really wanna let me be me
Imma see you underneath

Curb all your misery suffer invisibly
Fuck everybody and thing

Keep my name up out yo mouth better keep that head down watch the ground

Imma never get involved in all that petty shit
Don't fuck around

Tryna be the best but I guess I'm like the rest my soul go south

Triple six can't fuck with this
Wanna bark like a dog get bit by the hound
