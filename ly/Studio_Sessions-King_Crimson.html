		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, first of all, I couldn't even see his face
I couldn't see his face
He was holding a gun against me and, uhm
I was thinking, this is a dangerous place
Well, this is a dangerous place

I said, I'm nervous as hell from this stuff
Because those guys were gonna kill me for sure
Really, they ganged up on me like that
I couldn't believe it
I mean, look, I'm still shaking, you know?
It's weird
Go out in the streets like this, you can't
It's a dangerous place
It's a dangerous place

So suddenly 
These two guys appear in front of me
Start real aggressive
Start at me, you know
"Wha- what's that?"
"What that on that tape?"
"What do you got there?"
I said "it's a tape"
"What are you talking at me that for?"
I said, "oh, it's just a tape, you know?"
And they said, "well, play it for us"
I said "oh no"
They couldn't find it
They turn it on, you know?
They grabbed it from me, took it away from me
Turned it on
And it says, he held a gun in his hand
This is a dangerous place
What dangerous? What gun?
What gun?
You a policeman?!
The deeper I talked, the worse I got into it
I talked, I totally, I said
Look man, I'm not-
It went on forever
Anyway, I finally unplug my shit
I said, look, look, I'm in this band here, you know?
I'm in this band, you know?
And we're making a recording, you know?
It's just about New York City
It's about crime in the streets
The explanation was going nowhere
But finally they just kinda let me go, I don't know why
I don't know why
So I walk around the corner
I'm like shaking like a leaf
Now I thought, this is a dangerous place once again, you know
Who should appear with 2 police men?
