		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You such a whore, ooh
I need her
When she's on me I don't feel so lonely
You make me horny
Ride me like a pony
Push down on me
She's just such a fuckin' whore I love it

I-i just fuck her on her side
And she bitch for me, on life
For her pussy, I would die
Every second we on fire
Her problem is
The easy eye
Let's sing some more, she's just such a fuckin'

You such a fuckin' hoe
I know you'd like it more
I fuck her when I'm bored
Like I need, she's a whore
I love it

Let's sing some more, she's just such a fuckin'
