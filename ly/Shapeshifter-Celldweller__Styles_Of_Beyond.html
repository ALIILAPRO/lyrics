(Put the pedal to the metal and go)

Put the pedal to the metal and go
Put the pedal to the metal and go
Put the pedal to the metal and go
Put the pedal to the metal and go

Shapeshifter

You ain't never seen nothing so rugged at ninety
Uh huh, the cops behind me, yup
The boiler's grinding, keep the cuffs
Enjoy your doughnuts, sir, you ain't gonna find me
It's not likely; their brains is blown out
You're chasing a ghost with no brakes to slow down
Hundred-proof octane, ready to drink bitch
Stop playing, I'm hot man, gimme that pink slip

Time's up, the animals crept through
Leave 'em in the dust with a packet of jet fuel
Too quick, eat 'em up, better for pet food
No brain, slow lane, missing your head screws
Huh, skin and bones let mess with your chrome set
Tricked out, hopping like your cruse in a cold chest
Parked in eagle with a safety pin
Take the backseat, now let the games begin, yeah

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Raw rubber - in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go
Breathe in slow

Shape-shifter
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own

Shape-shifter
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Put the pedal to the metal and go

Go
Go
Go
Shapeshifter
Go
Go
Go
(Shapeshifter)

Tough match, you lost by a hubcap
The big boss spray painted on my mud flap
Get a rush, yeah, we're calling your cold bluff
Can never get enough (get enough)
Step in, hold your breath and hang tight
Known for the big dollar bet in the cage fight
You're playing with the sharks, step inside
Everybody on your mark, get set, now let's ride

That's right, put the pedal to the metal and go
The yellow madellow with slicks on sending 'em home
Stick cars in the concrete, gripping the road
So quick, get in the palm trees, look out, whoa
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own
I told you, I don't want to close your casket
Quit now before you go blowing a gasket

Ha, get ready, get set, let's roll
Raw rubber - in a bit of petrol
Red, yellow, hit green, then go
Breathe in slow

Shape-shifter
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own

Shape-shifter
We got car keys hooked to remote controls

Shape-shifter
We got car keys hooked to remote controls
Hit a button that'll smoke any whip you own

Shape-shifter
Put the pedal to the metal and go

Go
Go
Shapeshifter
Go
Go
Put the pedal to the metal and go
Go
Go
Go
Shapeshifter
Go
Go
Go
