		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I could just let go
Of all the memories I know
Of all the memories I know
But they're still stuck in my brain

Every time I fall asleep, I know I'll wake up alone
I'll wake up alone
Dreams of you wrap around my throat
I think I'm gonna choke, I think I'm gonna choke

Running, running, running, running though the dark
Watch me run a little more
'Cause when I said forever, I meant forever, now

I wish I could just let go
Of all the memories I know
Of all the memories I know
But they're still stuck in my brain
I wish I could just let go
Of all the memories I know
Of all the memories I know
But they're still stuck in my brain

I never wanted to cry
I always thought I would make it right
But now I'm stuck inside this shame instead
"Pontificating hypocrite" is what you said
When my heart breaks just a little bit, I wanna drop dead
I didn't wanna concede
Or call my fantasies make-believe
Holding tightly to the task at hand
When I really should be focusing to learn and understand
But I bury all the tragedy with sand
Running, running, running, running to my car
I can't fucking cry in front of her
When I said forever, I meant forever, now

I wish I could just let go
Of all the memories I know
Of all the memories I know
But they're still stuck in my brain
I wish I could just let go
Of all the memories I know
Of all the memories I know
But they're still stuck in my brain (stuck in my brain)

I wish I could just let go (just let go)
Of all the memories, I know (I know)
Of all the memories I know
But they're still stuck in my brain
