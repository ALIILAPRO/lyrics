		  Dem-dem-dem-dem dem-dem
Dem-dem-dem-dem
Dem-dem-dem-dem dem-dem
Dem-dem-dem-dem

Uh, I'm in my prime, Optimus
Sagittarius, so you know I'm an optimist
Man, keep it all real, I'm a prophetess (okay)
So at least you took an L off your bucket list (bucket list)
It's time to make hits and it's time to diss
How you still dissin', still can't find some hits? (Okay)
Was it worth it, dummy? I ain't mind a bit
Still on that show gettin' no chips, time to dip

I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (okay)
Ritchie like guy and I still eat Thai
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, bitch, nice try
Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (still wife me)

Rap bitches tell they team, "Make 'em like Barbie"
Had to come off IG so they can't stalk me
All they do is copy looks, steal music, too
Want to see what bitches do when they lose the blue-print
I mean the pinkprint, ho, let it sink in
I spoke to Jay the other day, he's still the kingpin
He's still the only nigga that I woulda signed to
If I ain't sign to Wayne perfectly designed crew
'Cause we the big three, don't need a big speech
We made the biggest impact, check the spreadsheet
That's Lil Weezy to Barbie and Drizzy Drake
Niggas gettin' more cheese, kissy face
I'm a bad bitch, fuck the bitch (uh)
Bitch get slick, I'ma cut the bitch
I'm a bad bitch, suck some dick (okay)
If that bitch get slick, I'll cut the bitch
I'll cut up the bitch, I'll gut the bitch (okay)
Had to fuck up the bitch, man, fuck the bitch
Won't shoot her but I will gun-butt the bitch
When we say "Fuck the bitch" dick-up the bitch
She was stuck-up so my niggas stuck up the bitch
Still draggin' her so don't pick up the bitch
Get the combination to the safe, drug the bitch
Know the whole operation been bugged the bitch

I, I, I, I-I, I-I, I (okay)
I'm still fly, just bagged a white guy (okay)
Ritchie like guy and I still eat Thai
Want the Nicki cheat code? Come on, bitch, nice try
Let's be real, all you bitches wanna look like me
Wanna be in demand, get booked like me
Wanna run up in the lab and cook like me
But ain't nan you hoes pussy good like me
Pussy so good his ex wanna still fight me
Face so pretty bitches wish they could slice me
She just mad 'cause he never bought her ice like me
I cut all my niggas off, but they would still wife me (still wife me)

They would still wife me
They would still wife me
Yeah, him, too
He would still wife me
When it come to stealin' flows these birds is fluent
But they stutter when get asked 'bout the queen's influence
When it's clear they bite me, I'm flattered they like me
I don't wanna check bitches, tell 'em wear their Nikes
Barbie tings, there's Barbie tings
Big Barbie tings, there's Barbie tings
Big Barbie tings, there's Barbie tings
Barbie dream house, Barbie rings
There's Barbie beach house, Barbie Benz
Barbie white picket, Barbie fence
All tea, all shade, bitch, all offense
If you ever try to confiscate Barbie's Ken
I'ma put you in the box where my dollies been
Chop it up and the next stop garbage bin
'Cause you hoes too old to be gossipin'
I'm just tryna find out when the new Porsche come in
