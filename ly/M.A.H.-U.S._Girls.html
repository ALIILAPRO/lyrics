		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Started out as a local love
Really physical
I fell, nice and clean, the way you portrayed yourself to me
Through that screen, I wanted to believe everything
And then this local love went beyond the insular
You took me for an eight-year ride though you were never by my side
I always wanted to believe
Now this is what I'm questioning

As if you couldn't tell, I'm mad as hell
I won't forget so why should I forgive?
Supply me with one reason why, boy

The war rolled on and on, I left that land my home
We watched your hair go grey, that stressful manly shade
You wore it well, no one could tell the situation was held
But lies shone in your eyes
As you were the first in line to use those bugs up high
The coward's weapon of choice
But you got that winner's smile
And you know how to leave 'em moist
We can never know the hands we're in, until we feel them grip
Choking off our air supply but I don't cry
Every day I look, every day I see
That good war music still getting written for me

As if you couldn't tell, I'm mad as hell
I won't forget so why should I forgive?
No, not as long as we both shall live
As if you couldn't tell, I'm mad as hell
I won't forget so why should I forgive?
No, not as long as we both shall live
These vital lies just don't come in my size
