		  LOVE LETTER

My dear beloved
I fear Love As I fear you
Through my laughter I can hide what bothers me Not always
Sometimes I laugh because I laugh
I cried when you left
I cried so hard
I cried til no tears where left to cry
And I hated love
I felt empty, and worn, betrayed and used
I felt abandoned and useless
All felt useless and unworthy

It was then that I closed all doors to my heart
I closed them and I laughed
But.. I did not really laugh
After a while I started to feel joy again
I discovered music - again
And I wrote, I wrote so much

And all the while I hoped to never see you again Because seeing you meant to feel again your touch I will never forget how we sat in perfect silence Listening to bad musicans trying to be funny
And we said nothing
And just - held each other
I shall never forget that

It was then that I knew that a part of me
Belonged to you forever
And I could not say what part it was
It wasn't my body and it was more than my heart Some would call it magic others love
i don't know how you call it
I don't know what it was but
i could have sat there forever

And now I'm coming back
Although it was you who left but
I'm coming

And I fear love
I fear love because more than love
I fear rejection
I fear rejection and abandonment
And blame and guilt or addicton

To not be touched To not be love That is what i fear

Yes I fear to not be loved
In fact to fear to not be loved
Belongs to love because love is so delicate
It disappears if you do not care for it
Love is like snow
It falls only under certain conditions
And it stays only for a season and then melts away
That is what I have experienced with love
And why with you is it that i want it to stay forever And then it's not winter nor spring
It is the moment when I touch your hands and I Feel your nearness and your silence
And within this silence I can hear you
But not in words
I hear something else
And it can only be you
Because - you sound different
You sound different than the rest
And i have heard many
But you sound different
Like the palms of your hands
They felt unique and mine
As if they belonged to me
Your head on my breasts feel like the first touch Your lips when they rest on my skin
They feel like the only lips I want to have on me Everywhere softly
I want your gentle love
Yes I fear brutality and violence
Within this softness because I know it
I have known it

And now - I fear love

Maybe I have always feared it
But I'm coming my love
I'm coming
And I want to be gentle
And I want your gentle touch

Please be patient with me
I have known other than pure love I have known other than pure love
Let us be gentle my love
And not fear love
Let us be us
Let us be touched by silence When we hold each others hands When we hold each others hands
