		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hands up, baby, hands up,
Gimme your heart, gimme, gimme your heart
Gimme gimme
Hands up, baby, hands up,
Gimme your heart, gimme, gimme
All your love, 
All your love.

Angel face, I love your smile,
Love your ways, I like your style.
What can I do to get closer to you?
Don't think twice or count to ten.
Don't take advice, don't ask me when.
Just come my way, simply kiss me and say:

Hands up, baby, hands up, ...
With your head up in the sky,
Every day you're walkin' by,
Why don't you have the stars looking at me?

Stop that game, don't waste your time,
For all your dreams are matchin' mine,
No use to play hide n seek for a week.

Hands up, baby, hands up,...
Let me be your Romeo, your wonder boy,
And your super champ.
Let me take you to the milky way
On a holiday, (on a holiday)
Follow me (follow me) 
why don't you follow me (why don&'t you follow me)?
Just come my way simply kiss me and say:

Hands up, baby, hands up, ...
