		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We too feel alone

That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine

Where have I been all this time?
Lost enslaved fatal decline
I've been waiting for this to unfold (Good)
The pieces are only as good as the whole

Severed myself from my whole life
Cut out the only thing that was right
What If I never saw you again
I'd die right next to you in the end

That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine
That place in my mind
Is that space that you call mine

I won't let you walk away
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
Without hearing what I have to say
