		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't feel a thing
Definitely not you,
I never follow through
It's just how it goes,
Sinking in my room
Not singing "Oh" to you,
Could be how it went
If I had made the move.
If I had made the move.
(If I had made the move)
(If I had made the move)
(If I had made the move)
If I had made the move.
Never gettin' close to you
Never gettin' high,
Always gonna wonder
Did I pass you by,
All these lights can't see a thing
(Yeah) It's all on my mind,
I can't feel your touch so close
I always wonder why.
(Always wonder why)
(Wonder why)
I always wonder why.
(Wonder why)
(Always wonder why)
Yeah, bye.
I know I can improve
but I'm trying not to care,
Lonely is not there
when I truly care,
Gotta think about myself
But it's hard when it's twelve,
I swear I'll get it once I do
And then I'll finally know.
(Ohhh)
Then I'll finally know.
(Ohhh)
If I had made the move.
Never Gettin' close to you
Never gettin' high,
Always gonna wonder
Did I pass you by,
Never Gettin' close to you
Never gettin' high,
Always gonna wonder.
