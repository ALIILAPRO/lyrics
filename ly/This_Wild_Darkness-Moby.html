		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A portion like madness in season
Bracing all like a breaking of reason
With every night lost and every day torn
With the drama feeling calmer and it's calmer in the storm
Speakers are crying like a forrest in the rain
I was so alone with my thoughts and my pain
And the darkness closed like a mouth on a wild night
I'll never be free

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way

I can't stand on my own anymore
I can't stand in the stain of the broken and poor
I can't break what I held and it never was true
In the mirror what I said was I lied to you
And me and everything I see and everything I could
Tried so hard to be good
For myself, for you, for the hidden and divine
For everything but I can fail just so many times

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way

I can't stop when I feel like stopping
At five A.M. just cry, shoot, copping
The perfect life was enough for you
And ever enough to see me through
For all the lies that were spoken in waves
And the way we lived as an affront to the days
Was an affront to the things that we cared about
Was an affront to everything that we cared about

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way, oh

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way (light my way)
Light my way (light my way)

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way (out of the darkness)

Ooh, in this darkness
Please light my way
Light my way (light my way)
