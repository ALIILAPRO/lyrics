		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Find a wheel, and it goes round, round, round
As it spins along with a happy sound
As it goes, along the ground, ground, ground
'Til it leads you to the one you love

And your love will hold you round, round, round
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head, goes spinnin' round, round, round
'Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of

Oh, in the night, see the lights, the moon
Goin' round and round in tune
And the fallin' snow in the day
Makes them all wanna say

Find a song (find a song) and sing it round, round, round
And with ties so strong, that your hearts are bound
Hold them near (hold them near) the ones you found, found, found
For you know that this is really love

Find a wheel (find a wheel) and it goes round, round, round
As it spins along with a happy sound
As it goes, (as it goes) along the ground, ground, ground
'Til it leads you to the ones you love

And your love (and your love), you'll hold her round, round, round
And your heart's a song with a brand new sound
And your head (and your head) goes spinnin' round, round, round
'Cause you found what you've been dreamin' of

In the night, you see the lights, the moon (the moon)
Goin' round and round in tune (in tune)
And the fallin' snow in the day (day)
Makes them all wanna say

Find a song (find a song) and sing it round, round, round
And with ties so strong, that your hearts are bound
Hold them near (hold them near) the ones you found, found, found
For you know that this is really love

Find a song, find a song
For you know that this is really love
Yeah, you know that this is really love
Ooh
