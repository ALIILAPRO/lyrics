		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whip fit four or five in it
GPS so you're not misguided
(Hey)
(Internet money, bitch)
Uh (yeah), ayy (yeah)

Pull up in the whip, fit four or five in it (five in it)
GPS so you're not misguided (guided)
Run with me, you can go where the sky is (sky is)
Tell me what you want, girl, don't be silent (yeah)
When you with me, girl, you feel enlightened (ooh)
Don't be scared, baby, don't be frightened (ooh, ooh)
Rollin' up the dope, baby, I get the highest (oh)
I said, "Don't hold back, just enjoy the ride"

Thrusting, doing it right
I know your nigga can be so conniving (depriving)
I need your attention undivided ('vided)
You want the vibe? I can provide it ('vide it)
Thrusting, thrusting, thrusting
Busting, she busting, buss, buss it, buss it
Pussy so good that I might sing (ooh)
She a PYT, she a young hot thing

Got me thrustin' the thirst, got her bustin'
Got me surfin' through the pussy like a jet-ski
Banana color yellow, it was Fendi
Girl no keep it in the ignition whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Made our own religion, our own rules
Made our own religion, our own rules
Our daughter's first purse is Chanel Coco
Whatever we gon' do, don't irk my soul
Goin' beyond, beyond, beyond (goin' beyond)
Goin' beyond, beyond, beyond (goin' beyond)
Goin' beyond, beyond, beyond (PYT)
I done took one off the bench and turned it into a starter
Chains and my rings, forty pointers, whoa (Freebandz)

I ain't falling, but I love that body (shorty)
I ain't falling, but I love me a hottie (what)
Trust me, don't think about it
Cross me, don't think about it

Thrusting, doing it right
I know your nigga can be so conniving (depriving)
I need your attention undivided ('vided)
You want the vibe? I can provide it ('vide it)
Thrusting, thrusting, thrusting
Busting, she busting, buss, buss it, buss it
Pussy so good that I might sing (ooh)
She a PYT, she a young hot thing

I ain't lusting, don't follow me (yeah)
Gyal feisty, shawty feisty (hey)
And she high class, hella pricey (pricey)
This a big, big, big one right here, ya' dig what I'm sayin'?
This is massive
I fuck her so good, I should charge a small fee (Global)
