		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you gave me just a coin for every time we say goodbye
Well I'd be rich beyond my dreams, I'm sorry for my weary life
I know I'm not perfect but I can smile
And I hope that you see this heart behind my tired eyes

If you tell me that I can't, I will, I will, I'll try all night
And if I say I'm coming home, I'll probably be out all night
I know I can be afraid but I'm alive
And I hope that you trust this heart behind my tired eyes

'Cause I'm no angel, but please don't think that I won't try and try
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I can't live my life
I'm no angel, but please don't think that I can't cry oh
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I won't fly

I know I'm not around each night
And I know I always think I'm right
And I can believe that you might look around

'Cause I'm no angel, but please don't think that I won't try and try
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I can't live my life
I'm no angel, but please don't think that I can't cry oh
I'm no angel, but does that mean that I won't fly.
