		  M&M’s FOR BREAKFAST


Verse 1:
Shoulda known he wouldn’t call 
Bet he doesn’t care at all 
Shoulda listened when they said 
Let it go let go 
Guess that now I know 

Pre:
Why’d u have to go and kiss me like that 
How u gonna leave me flat on my back?
I still smell like your cologne 
Got me waiting by the phone 
Hoping you gon’ call back 

Chorus:
Damn this man he got in my head
Took my heart cut it out my chest
Bit me hard got me so depressed 
Breakfast served M&M’s in bed 
Oh look at what you started
What you see ain’t what you get 
Kept my pride and my self respect
Bet on me and myself instead

Oh you fucked up my mind
Fucked up my mind x3
I lost my mind

Verse 2:
Oh it must be a delight
To monopolize my life
Cherry-picking with your time
Oh cheri, that’s fine! 
Imma recover in no time

Pre:
Why’d u have to go and kiss me like that 
How u gonna leave me flat on my back?
I still smell like your cologne 
Got me waiting by the phone 
Hoping you gon’ call back 

Chorus:
Damn this man he got in my head
Took my heart cut it out my chest
Bit me hard got me so depressed 
Breakfast served M&M’s in bed 
Oh look at what you started
What you see ain’t what you get 
Kept my pride and my self respect
Bet on me and myself instead

Oh you fucked up my mind
Fucked up my mind x3
I lost my mind

Outro:
Boy you should know 
You had me low 
I went from blue to seeing red and now yellow
Took me some time
To dry my eyes
Pull myself up, get out my bed 
I’ll be alright
