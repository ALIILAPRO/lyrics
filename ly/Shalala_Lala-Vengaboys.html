		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a boy in my mind and he knows I'm thinkin' of him
All my way to the day and the night the stars shine above me
He's been gone for some time but I know I truly love him
And I'm singing a song, hoping he'll be back when he hears it

My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning
Shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala, shalala lala in the evening
Shalala lala, shalala lala just for you

If your love's gone away just like mine you feel like crying
Sing along maybe once, maybe twice, let's try it together
Some sweet day, no one knows, he'll return and you'll be happy
Shout it sweet in a song, listen to your heart it is singin'

My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning
Shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala, shalala lala in the evening
Shalala lala, shalala lala just for you

My heart goes shalala lala, shalala in the morning
Shalala lala, shalala in the sunshine
Shalala lala, shalala lala in the evening
Shalala lala, shalala lala just for you

Shalala lala, shalala lala just for you
