		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was never one for singing what I really feel 
Except tonight I'm bringing everything I know that's real 

Stars, they come and go, they come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
Hey but it gets lonely there when there's no one here to share 
We can shake it away, if you'll hear a story 

People lust for fame like athletes in a game, 
we break our collarbones and come up swinging, 
some of us are downed 
some of us are crowned, and some are lost and never found 
But most have seen it all, 
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always come up singing 

Some make it when they're young, 
before the world has done its dirty job 
and later on someone will say 
"You've had your day, now you must make way" 
But they'll never know the pain of living with a name you never owned 
or the many years forgetting what you know too well 
That the ones who gave the crown have been let down 
You try to make amends without defending 
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes of grown men of twenty-five 
that follow as you walk and ask for autographs 
Or kiss you on the cheek and you never can believe they really loved you 
Some make it when they're old 
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare 
or perhaps there's nothing there) 

Stars, they come and go, they come fast they come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But most have seen it all, 
they live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always have a story 

Some women have a body men will want to see 
and so they put it on display 
Some people play a fine guitar, I could listen to them play all day 
Some ladies really move across the stage and gee, they sure can dance 
I guess I could learn how, if I gave it half a chance 

But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar 
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord 
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display 
Except the tunes, and whatever else I say 
But anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say 
I meant to tell a story, I live from day to day 

Stars, they come and go, they're coming fast they come slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But most have seen it all, 
who live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
And we always have a story 

So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around 
I'll come up singing for you, even when I'm down
