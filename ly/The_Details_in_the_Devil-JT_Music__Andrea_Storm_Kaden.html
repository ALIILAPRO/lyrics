		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a peek behind the curtain at my grand design
Any less than picture perfect and it'll be cast aside
I'm so impatient for inspiration, my pen becomes the sword
Because I'll scrap ya if I have to go back to the drawing board
Some dreams are simply meant to die
What happens if they get revived?
You thought you could toss me out?
The ink ain't even dry
I'm no good, so cross me out
And then we'll dot some eyes
That's a price all artists pay
A "sacrifice"? (That's so cliche)
But lightning struck and I was born
The final cut just cut my cord
Your dark imaginatio might be where demons hide
So why'd you ever blame them when your pen brought them to life? (No)
You can't choose your family at least, not genetically
But I feel like we'll be real quick friends
You brought me back, so don't that make sense? (Oh, that makes sense)
Oh, don't you color me surprised (I only see in black and white)
'Cause you can kill the show (it'll always get revived)

You made it happen, you made it real
When you imagined, you gave us life, and made us feel
Your thunder clappin'
It's getting real
So if you haven't checked the forecast
The weather's lookin' wet, I'll take the wheel

So what if I'm a little rough around the edges?
I'm an unmade masterpiec, I keep artists on their ledges
This reboot might get messy that's why I'm sorta sketchy
I don't dance obediently the demon's knees are far from bendy
You made me in your image so I lack a soul (bam, bam, bam)
Tryna wipe me from existence? You're playing whack-a-mole (ow)
Too bad you cannot erase me, that, in fact, is why you hate me
I'm your vision, bastardized 
(Like frankenstein), then actualized 
No, I won't color you surprised (you pull the plug, I'm still alive)
True artists never thrive (at best they'll survive)

You made it happen, you made it real
Nobody's acting, but it's a show I'm gonna steal
Go call the cast in, I'll play the heel (ya-hahaha)
And if you haven't read the details
The devil's due his debt so take the deal

I've been abominated, hollow eyes aglow
Reanimated, yet unrecognizable
No better way to paint it
This frame cannot contain it
To think of talent wasted out of ink
But now I taste it
La-la-la-la-la
Even angels need to let the steam off
La-la-la-la-la
And no one's here to shut the damn machine off
This work of art once pure of heart
May still, become, corrupted (all the stains are my scars)
I've come to find, it wasn't lightning
That I've been struck with

You made it happen, you made it real
Lights, camera, action
You put me right back on the reel
Now look who's laughin', your fate is sealed
Don't bother askin' for the details
The devil's due his debt and that's the deal

(You made it happen)
(You made it happen)
(You made it happen)
(You made it happen)
(You made it happen)
(You made it happen)
(You made it happen)
