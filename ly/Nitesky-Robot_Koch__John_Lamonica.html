		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No one knows what it's like
You and me, you and I
Underneath the night sky
You and me, you and I

I get lost all the time
In my thoughts, in my mind
You come through like a light
In the dark, give me sight

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

I will come right back to you
Come right back
Come right back to you

No one sees what it's like
You and me, you and I
Never go, never hide
You and me, you and I

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you let my soul out
You let my soul out
You let my soul out
It will come right back to you

If you
