		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's somethin' left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that Heaven's right here, baby
Touch me so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that Heaven's right here, baby
Touch me so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heartbeat so loud
I can't believe there's somethin' left in my chest anymore
But goddamn
You got me in love again

(La-la-la, la-la-la)
(La-la-la, la-la-la)
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's somethin' left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
And again, and again, and again, and again
