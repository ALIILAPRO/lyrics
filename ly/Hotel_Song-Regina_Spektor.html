		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come in, come in
Come into my world I've got to show
Show, show you
Come into my bed
I've got to know
Know, know you

[Chorus]
I have dreams of Orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my...
You will never be my fool
Will never be my fool

Floaters in my eyes
Wake up in a hotel room
Cigarettes and lies
I am a child; it's too soon

[Chorus]

A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address; I wade downstairs

The porter smiles to me a smile
I've bought
With a couple of gold coins
A sign that I've been caught

I have dreams of Orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my...
You will never be my dear
Will never be my dear, dear friend
Dear, dear friend, dear, dear friend

A little bag of cocaine
A little bag of cocaine
So who's the girl wearing my dress?
I figured out her number
Inside a paper napkin
But I don't know her address

Come in, come in
Come into my world I've got to show
Show, show you
Come into my bed
I've got to know
Know, know you

I have dreams of Orca whales and owls
But I wake up in fear
You will never be my...
You will never be my dear
Will never be my dear, dear friend
Dear, dear friend, dear, dear friend
