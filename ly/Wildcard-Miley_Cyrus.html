		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you wanna play house? I could be your wife
Go and meet your mom in a dress too tight
Maybe I could stay and not break your heart
But don't forget, baby, I'm a wildcard

I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough
And don't wait for me
'Cause forever may never come

I'm a wildcard, ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, ooh
Forever may never come

I walk in the door with my lips stained red
Pillows on the floor and the flowers dead
Make the music stop before it starts
'Cause don't forget, baby, I'm a wildcard

I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough

I'm a wildcard, ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, ooh
Forever may never come

(Wildcard, ooh)

And ooh, bet your lovin'
I want all in
I want all or nothing
Ooh, it'll cost ya
I want all in
I want all or nothing

I love when you hold me
But loving you is never enough

I'm a wildcard, ooh
Loving you is never enough
I'm a wildcard, ooh
Forever may never come

(Wildcard, ooh)
