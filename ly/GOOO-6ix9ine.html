		  (Ayo, Model, that shit fire though)

He tough on the app, in person he copped it, yeah
I'm real, like, fuck all treesh and boppers, yeah
I'm Batman, yeah, might switch into Robin, yeah (bop-bop-bop-bop)
Whatever you jackin', nigga, I drop it yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She pull that pussy out, she better pop it, yeah
I blow her back out, bitch, I'm wildin', yeah (bop-bop-bop)
My shooter, he stay with a 9 like Iguodala (bop-bop-bop)
Every time we outside it's on his body (bap, bap, bap, yeah)

Active, posted, never not havin' motion (bap
Glock loaded, pass it to bro, he throwin' (boom)
Yeah, yeah, pass it to bro, he throwin'
Fuckin' his bitch, I'm havin' my way
I pass her to bro, she blowin'
Go, go, you know these bitches be hoein'
I jump in the lamb', I'm swervin' the lane
I'm drivin' this shit like it's stolen
Go, go, nigga callin' me bro, I don't know him
He jackin' that shit, who know him
Last nigga did that got folded

He tough on the app, in person he copped it, yeah
I'm real, like, fuck all treesh and boppers, yeah
I'm Batman, yeah, might switch into Robin, yeah
Whatever you jackin', nigga, I drop it, yeah
She pull that pussy out, she better pop it, yeah
I blow her back out, bitch, I'm wildin', yeah (bop-bop-bop)
My shooter, he stay with a 9 like Iguodala (bop-bop-bop)
Every time we outside it's on his body (bap, bap, bap)

She want Casamigos, tell her, "Casa we go"
She said, "We gon' fuck, just wait 'til my kid go sleep though"
Ain't nobody got time for that, just give lil' bro the opp pack
Once I beat it, if she eat it, just know I'm doggin' them fruit snacks

He tough on the app, in person he copped it, yeah
I'm real, like, fuck all treesh and boppers, yeah
I'm Batman, yeah, might switch into Robin, yeah
Whatever you jackin', nigga, I drop it yeah
She pull that pussy out, she better pop it, yeah
I blow her back out, bitch, I'm wildin', yeah (bop-bop-bop)
My shooter, he stay with a 9 like Iguodala (bop-bop-bop)
Every time we outside it's on his body (bap, bap, bap, yeah)
