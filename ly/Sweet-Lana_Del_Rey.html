		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stars in my eyes, hiking up Griffith
Thinking about what was said and what didn't
Get said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now
I wrote you a note, but I didn't send it
'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about
What you don't really understand, I've got magic in my hand
Stars in my eyes

I'm a different kind of woman
If you want some basic bitch, go to the Beverly Center and find her
I'm sweet
Bare feet
If you wanna go where nobody goes
That's where you'll find me
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee

What you doing with your life? Do you think about it?
Do you contemplate where we came from?
Lately, we've been makin' out a lot
Not talkin' 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things
Do you want children? Do you wanna marry me?
Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?
I've got things to do like nothing at all
I wanna do them with you
Do you wanna do them with me?

If you want someone, then just call me up
And remember where I'll be
Sweet in bare feet
You can find me where no one will be
In the woods somewhere
In the knife in the heart of a valley
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, come to my house on Genesee
