		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been defeated
I begged for what I needed
I suffered now I'm ready for war
Been through the struggle
Black eyes and bloody knuckles
But I don't feel the pain anymore


If blood don't tell you the truth
Then could you please cut me loose?
'Cause I've been wanting to die
If burning makes me a liar
Then come join me in the fire
I know you wouldn't survive
But I'll be burning alive


I'll be burning alive


I met my demons
And asked them for their reasons
I wrote their names in blood on the wall
They speak in riddles 
And meet me in the middle
They're quiet while they wait for the fall (oh oh)


If scars are makeup and paint
Then thanks for setting me straight
'Cause I've been living a lie
If burning makes me a liar
Then come join me in the fire
I know you wouldn't survive
But I'll be burning alive


I'll be burning alive


I've got a story
I won't be sorry it's told
Is it real or fantasy?
Outrun the monsters after me
You'd be praying for a savior to arrive
I'll be patient in the flames
While I'm burning alive


I'll be burning alive
