		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't you understand what that means?
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love, you have to talk to somebody about a new life
I don't love my wife anymore, I don't love my kids anymore
Missin' out on life, they're usually my age
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding on
And finally, they just get weak and they say
It doesn't matter anymore
And the Spirit of God says
I'll infuse you with desires
With what you have and what's in front of you (yeah, yeah)
(Desires for what you have, okay)
So, as He works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him, and say
I'm here doin' it, man
Help me want what I got
Help me love what's in front of me
Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends
And help me serve the city I live in
And not wish it away and hope I can move
Help me, God
I wanna be a man of love
Not a man in lust
But you gotta do that
And so I bring you to this verse, and I'm done, I'm done
Psalms Chapter 8
And do you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so superior to us all
I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, "Check the Bible"
I don't know if it was God, but it felt like God
I thought the thought in my head, "Check the Bible"
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything, I don't have to look anywhere
Just look at the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day and here's the verse of the day
Today, in the Bible
Look at this (that's cool)

Look at the splendor of the skies
You creative genius glowing in the Heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their setting
I know You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
I have to ask this question
I gotta ask this question
Compared to all this cosmic glory
Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal man or be
Ooh, don't get me started
I could read you another hour on infatuated
Or be infatuated with Adam's son?
Why are you so infatuated with me?
You're the star reader, You're the ocean maker (yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who do, are you man? (Rhino designer)
And then it goes on in verse 5
And it says, "Yet what honor you have given to me
Created only a little lower than Elohim
Which is the name of Creator God
Artist God"
You wanna call God "Artist?"
At some point tonight before you go to bed, be like
"Yo, Elohim," and He'll hear, "You're the best artist ever"
Below Elohim, crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You have delegated to them mastery over all you have made
You've made me a partner with you
I wish to think my preaching was mostly about you
And you're not gonna like this but I'm gonna to tell you the truth
I've discovered my preaching is mostly about me
