		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hold soft flames on my tongue
And chew on them like chewing gum
They burn the roof of my mouth
But I won't spit it out loud right now
There's an inferno in your mouth
I can tell by the way you smile like it burns
You press your lips together like you're kissing yourself
To stop me from learning

He's a keeper, he's a believer
He's on the ground, on his knees in a theater
And he put us in a car, I don't know where we are
But he fell in love with a fever
"I could never leave her, I could never keep her"
That's what he says to the neighborhood preacher
And he put us in a car, I don't know where we are
But I fell in love with the fever and I

I watch us burn and fall, the heat is ten feet tall
The potential is bench pressing us into the wall
And the flick of flames weaving through my teeth
If the hot gum were to slip out, where would we be?

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

(Part two)

Your teeth wanna tattle and confess to me
Your molars are complaining, I can hear them weep
Sucking on fire while you're a liar that says they feel nothing
Your hand is watching mine like an L.A. hawk
My hand is well aware that it's being stalked
Wincing a smile while I'm chewing on the flame
'Cause I've never been one to ruin a game

He's a keeper, he's a believer
He's on the ground, on his knees in a theater
And he put us in a car, I don't know where we are
But he fell in love with a fever
"I could never leave her, I could never keep her"
That's what he says to the neighborhood preacher
And he put us in a car, I don't know where we are
But I fell in love with the fever and I

I watch us burn and fall, the heat is ten feet tall
The potential is bench pressing us into the wall
And the flick of flames weaving through my teeth
If the hot gum were to slip out, where would we be?

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

Your teeth are on fire, do you notice? No
Your mouth is burning, do you notice? No
Your hair burns, my hair burns
Your skin burns, my skin burns
Do you feel anything? No
Do you feel anything? No
If I tell you what I'm thinking promise, you won't tell yourself
If you tell me what you're thinking, I swear I won't tell myself
He's on the ground, he's on his knees, he's a believer
He's on the ground, he didn't listen to the preacher
