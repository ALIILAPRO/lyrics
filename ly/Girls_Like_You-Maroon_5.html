		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Spent twenty-four hours
I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend
Getting even, ooh-ooh
We spent the late nights
Making things right, between us
But now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwoods baby
And play me close

'Cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Girls like you
Love fun and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you

I spent last night
On the last flight to you
Took a whole day up
Trying to get way up, ooh-ooh
We spent the daylight
Trying to make things right between us (oh, oh)
And now it's all good baby
Roll that Backwoods baby
And play me close

Yeah, 'cause girls like you
Run around with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Girls like you
Love fun and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

I need a girl like you

Maybe it's 6:45
Maybe I'm barely alive
Maybe you've taken my shit for the last time, yeah
Maybe I know that I'm drunk
Maybe I know you're the one
Maybe I'm thinking it's better if you drive

Oh, 'cause girls like you
Run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown, when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah

(You, yeah)
(You, yeah)

'Cause girls like you (girls like you)
Run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown (sundown), when I come through 
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah (oh-oh)

Girls like you
Love fun, yeah me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I need a girl like you
