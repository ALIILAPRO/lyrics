		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Untouchable, like a distant diamond sky
Keep reaching out and I still can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning hotter than the sun
And when you're close I just want to come undone

And the in middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta, come on come on, say that we'll be together
Come on come on, little taste of heaven
Little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you'll say that I'll be here anyway

And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta, come on come on, I wanna be together
Come on come on

And in the middle of the night we could form this dream
I wanna feel you in the dark lying next to me
You gotta, come on come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, Come on, little taste of heaven

Hey!

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You gotta, come on come on, don't make me wait forever
Come on come on

And the middle of the night we could form this dream
I wanna feel you in the dark lying next to me
You gotta, come on come on, say that we'll be together
Come on come on, little taste of heaven
Little taste of heaven
My little taste of heaven
