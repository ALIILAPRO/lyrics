		  Causin' havoc
Causin' havoc
Causin' havoc
Causin' havoc
Causin' havoc
Causin' havoc

Causing havoc with the motherfucking automatic
I have had it with these stupid motherfuckers, come and grab it
I ain't done, where you coming from?
Better start to run, before bullets reach the gun
Spray and pray a lot of fun
Causing havoc with the motherfucking automatic
I have had it with these stupid motherfuckers, come and grab it
I ain't done, where you coming from?
Better start to run, before bullets reach the gun, spray and

Before bullets reach the gun
Spray and pray a lot of fun, boy

Causing havoc with the motherfucking automatic
I have had it with these stupid motherfuckers, come and grab it
I ain't done, where you coming from?
Better start to run, before bullets reach the gun
Spray and pray a lot of fun, boy
Why are you so fucking greedy keeping evil from the needy
Slit your throat and keep you bleeding, all your fucking numbers needed
I'ma keeping slicing this, show my blade you start to piss
Keep on laughing, it could happen to you, you motherfuckers gotta move
Blade deep in your motherfuckin' chest
Can't breathe, can't see, then you fall to your knees
Better pray to the Freddie Man, 'cause he killing on demand
Devil worship bitches creeping in your fucking village
