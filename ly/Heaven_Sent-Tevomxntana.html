		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said, "Don't get too attached", but she attached to me
You said you would die for her, but that's not what it seems (yuh)
Shawty heaven sent she came from a place far away
It's something I can't explain
Hope these feelings don't decay
She said, "Don't get too attached", but she attached to me
You said you would die for her, but that's not what it seems (yuh)
Shawty heaven sent she came from a place far away
It's something I can't explain
Hope these feelings don't decay

Stacked up
Oh yeah, I'm in my bag
Will you stay ten toes if they pull up with gats?
I'm so gone, I wonder where I'm at
Oh, she a ten out of ten (oh)
Look good from the front and back
I don't know, shawty, do you love me like you say? (Like you say)
Tell me, do you love me like you claim? (Claim)
'Cause it's sunny out but I still feel the rain (rain)
Yeah, I want your body, I don't care about a Millie Plain (no)
Might just go away
I'm just a fourth away
Is she for me or the gang?
Does she love me or my chains?
Shawty, look at my face
You can tell that I'm going insane
I ain't playin', no, this ain't a game
I hope that this love can be tamed

She said, "Don't get too attached", but she attached to me
You said you would die for her, but that's not what it seems (yuh)
Shawty heaven sent, she came from a place far away
It's something I can't explain
Hope these feelings don't decay
She said, "Don't get too attached", but she attached to me
You said you would die for her, but that's not what it seems (yuh)
Shawty heaven sent, she came from a place far away
It's something I can't explain
Hope these feelings don't decay
