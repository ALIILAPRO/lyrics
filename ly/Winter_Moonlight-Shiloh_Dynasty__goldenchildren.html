		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you
Yeah
High up, but you fall down harder

I'm not one to burn bridges
But you burned it to dust
I'm not one to trust bitches
That's the lesson I've learned
Threw my heart into the ditches
And you left it to rot
Threw my heart into the casket
Sent it off in a hearse
Carry on
My life inside your arms
My heart inside your palms 
You crush it i'll carry on

Now I got a lotta baggage from my last bitch
She told me don't you worry i'll be here until my last breath
No ones ever loved me only til my last hit
The moment you find better throw my heart inside a casket
Fucking confused, fucking misused 
Tucking issues underneath the carpet, no one can use em
If I lose you 
Think i'll finally lose it
If I pull through 
Think i'll finally lose it

I'm not one to burn bridges
But you burned it to dust
I'm not one to trust bitches
That's the lesson I've learned
Threw my heart into the ditches
And you left it to rot
Threw my heart into the casket
Sent it off in a hearse
Carry on
My life inside your arms
My heart inside your palms 
You crush it i'll carry on

How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you
Yeah
High up, but you fall down harder
