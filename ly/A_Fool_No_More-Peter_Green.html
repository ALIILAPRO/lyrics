		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yes, I've packed up my clothes
I'm movin' away from your door
Lord, I've packed up my clothes
Said, I'm moving away from your door
I've been your fool for so long
Babe, I won't play that fool no more

I gave you all my money
I work as hard as I can
I came home early one morning
I found you with another man

Babe, I've packed up my clothes
And I'm movin' away from your door
Said, I've been your fool for so long
And Lord, I won't play that fool no more
 
So goodbye, baby
You don't even care
Yes, I had a love so strong for you
But you treat me so unfair

Said, I've packed up my clothes
I'm movin' away from your door
You know, I've been your fool for so long
And babe, I won't play that fool no more
