		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bro I understand life is hard and shit
But shit, my nigga like
You either gone sit there
And take them fucking punches
Or you gone get the fuck up and fight the fuck back

Crumbled up the world in my hand into pieces
So much drip you would thought that I leaked this
Thought I was dead, it was all in they head
Now a nigga coming back like Jesus
Gotta feed the team
And I'm sure that these crackers got cheese
I believe it's Cheese-Itz
Nigga been the wave, gottem see sick
Now I'm pulling up on your beaches
But I call them women cause I ain't that cold
But you know I ain't never gave a sheet, Switch
The flow up
A nigga been getting his dough up
Cause broke what, I don't love
I'm living to pick all my bros up
Let's glow up, No Hold ups
I figured I'm killing you hoes, Yup
I been delivering dope stuff
Like a drug dealer, but much iller
A clutch spitter, now you stuck with a 
Deluxe Nigga, Ku Klux Killer
Not a bullet hitting them up
But I spread love til the hate dries up
That's why you mother fuckers hate my guts

Woah, Goodnight
Is a nigga good, what it look like
Doing anything that I would like
Grinding every night for the good life
Woah, Goodnight
Is a nigga good, what it look like
Doing anything that I would like
Grinding every night for the good life
Woah

Everybody thought I was decease, but
Freeze up, now I'm coming back like Isa
Jesus, like an immigrant I keep a visa
Ease Up, never that
Now bring on back the beat cause
I'ma milk the game
Like some big ol double Ds yup
Feel it in my veins
Like the blood I never blood, what
I could never be cut
Only handle hot shit
What the fuck's a tea cup, speed up
I handle bars now I'm riding til the cycle break
I might go make an idol shake
My vital trait's a tidal wave 
I'm isolated by the way, I hide away
Til I create the final stage where I negate
The constant hate, I'm sorry wait
Get to a kind of pace
The brain don't know to take
I'm trynna slay illiterate pounds waste
Noncreative haters cannot equate
It's bombs away the second they try to face
I won't let them operate
They'll find the fate
Is for me to dominate
I need you to concentrate
Woah, let me know
When I'ma stop putting these beats in the burial
I was way too down bad I was very broke
Nigga was bored so he flipped like a varial
Can't be a scary hoe
So much material
Cause I heard from both sides like it's stereo
Trynna copy my vibe like it's Karao-
Ke, man of the house I can carry yo keys
Please, I don't think you understand
I could never starve myself
Depending on another man
I could be broke one day
On the other hand
Disloyal rockstar, I'ma make another band
Big facts
My appeal popping and I'm fresh
no tic tac
Bars hard, feel it in your stomach
That's a six pack
All my niggas really made it happen
Y'all just chit chat
Had to show my ass and while it's out
You can kiss that
