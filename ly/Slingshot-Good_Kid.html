		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I've been waiting for all these
Years just to see you come back home
But each step that you took towards her, well you took each one alone
And every time you said ""My God"" how is it up there on that throne?
Well I've been waiting undefeated
Just to hear you say that I'm not needed
I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all but I wanted it!
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all
No you won't be there and
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
My God
I hope you're falling
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
It's gonna be the start of what you are
Well I remember when you said that you hate everything I do
You didn't have a reason then, wish I'd given one to you
And then you would say ""Oh my God""
I couldn't know what you'd been through
Well I've been waiting undefeated
Just to hear you say that I'm not needed
I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all but I wanted it!
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all
No you won't be there and
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
My God
I hope you're falling
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
It's gonna be the start of what you are
I said I was an honest man
You said I wasn't at all but I wanted it!
Well I think you're just afraid of the fall
But you won't be there at all
No you won't be there and
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
My God
I hope you're falling
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
It's gonna be the start of what you
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
My God
I hope you're falling
Oh my God
I hope you're falling apart
It's gonna be the start of what you are
