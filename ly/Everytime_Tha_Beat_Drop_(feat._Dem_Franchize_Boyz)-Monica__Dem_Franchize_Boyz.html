		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  R-R-R-Rock then bend my knees, every time the beat drop 

I can't help who I'm is when they play my sh 
I just love to dance every time the beat drop 
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night 
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop 
I said oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude 
And you work it real slow you can do it 
Move it till you make him lose it 
(R-R-R-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop) 
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop 

I know you used to seeing Mo laid back 
So for the most part you think I'm like that (dig this) 
You about to get a glimpse of the fit 
I'm getting niggas on the floor mane when I hit the door mane 
Cause I ain't one of these too bourgeois broads 
Always in the club holding up the wall (now dig this) 
You about to get a taste of the way that we do it down here in the A 
Let me say 

I can't help who I'm is when they play my sh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop 
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night 
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop 
I said oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude 
And you work it real slow you can do it 
Move it till you make him lose it 
(R-R-R-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop) 
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop 

Now I ain't talking bout a little two step 
I'm talking bout something that'll make you sweat 
And when I talk well I'm through talking 
I'm about to do something move something let you see something 
When I say get gutta it's enough said 
Do the bounce like you over on Bankhead 
And if anybody got a problem with the way you doin you 
Look 'em dead in the face and say 

I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh 
I just love to dance every time the beat drop 
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night 
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop 
I say oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude 
And you work it real slow you can do it 
Move it till you make him lose it 
(R-R-R-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop) 
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop 

You know pimpin' make the beat drop fuckin' wit a laptop 
I make 'em do it do it as soon as the beat drop 
Might throw my towels out like Nick I like to wild out 
I'm a stay in the game until I fall out 
First I lean grab a ball and then I pop wit it (I pop wit it) 
When they bring the mics the crowd I rock wit it (I rock wit it) 
I never hind licks trying to get quick 
When the songs on they like that's my shit 

I can't help who I'm is when they play my sh
I just love to dance every time the beat drop 
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night 
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop 
I say oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude 
And you work it real slow you can do it 
Move it till you make him lose it 
(r-R-R-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop) 
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop 

I can't help who I'm is when they play my shhh 
I just love to dance every time the beat drop 
I love to wild out damn right shake it all night 
Ay that's my jam every time the beat drop 
I say oh all the ladies in the club grab a dude 
And you work it real slow you can do it 
Move it till you make him lose it 
(R-R-R-rock then bend your knees every time the beat drop) 
He gon' be a fan every time the beat drop
