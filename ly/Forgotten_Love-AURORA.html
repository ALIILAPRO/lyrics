		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you tell if I'm cold?
If I'm out of daydreams?
If I lose what is loved?
Will a new love await me?
I am touched by wonder
When I am blind in the dark

But you drown me in daylight
Don't swim with me darling
I prefer the sun of you
When you are away

If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love

I forget how emotions dance when they aren't inside of me
I forget how the sun feels when she isn't around me
And my dreams become sweeter when something is missing
I'm in love with the hunt itself
It makes me feel alive, alive

If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love

Hun går ferilisseræna féressu
Hun går férilisserana irsser
Ruriguere
Ruriguere
Lissiræna hun går
Fîri lisinof
Fîri lisinof

I release my body and there is no ghost of you inside my mind
I am moving on and thank God you let me try
You are the reason I can dance
Within the fire of goodbyes, of goodbyes
I can lie in the dark room without the feeling that I'm lonely
Oh, (it's the beauty of forgotten love) oh

If I am left with a rose in my hand, let it die
It's the beauty in forgotten love
And I don't care if you don't understand why I cry
It's the beauty in forgotten love
Oh (it's the beauty in forgotten love)
Oh, oh (it's the beauty in forgotten love)
