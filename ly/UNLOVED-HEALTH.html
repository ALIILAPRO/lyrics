		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lonely as I am
To love someone like you
Lonely as I am
Too low for someone new

I pretended to feel like you
I pretended to be like you
I pretended to feel like you
I pretended

And it was not my fault
You were unloved when you were a child
I wasn't there
You sleep with the light on
You are starting again and again and again

Would I be lying
If I were to tell you the truth?
Why are we lying?
The dream of someone new

I pretended to feel like you
I pretended

And it was not my fault
You were unloved when you were a child
I don't care
You sleep with the light on
You are starting again and again and again

I pretended to be like you (I don't care)
I pretended to feel like you (I don't care)
I pretended to be like you (I don't care)
I pretended to feel like you

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care
