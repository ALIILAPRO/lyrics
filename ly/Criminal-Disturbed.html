		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

In violent times
You shouldn't have to sell your soul
In black and white
They really really ought to know
Just don't know
Those wandering minds
Who took you for a working whore
Kiss them goodbye
They shouldn't have to jump for joy
Jump jump jump jump jump

You shouldn't have to shout for joy shout

Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

They give you life
And in return you gave them hell
As cold as ice not witch your ice ice baby
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to shout the tale shout

Shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

Will you never shout, huh
I feel as though you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout, huh
I feel as though you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout, huh
I feel as though you're never gonna let it all out
Will you never shout, huh
I feel as though you're never gonna let it

And when you've taken down your guard
If I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
(Break break break break break)

I'd really love to (shout) your heart (shout)

Shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on

I'd really love to (shout) your heart(shout)
Shout, shout, let it all out
These are the things I can do without
Come on
I'm talking to you, so come on
(Shout) come on let me shout shout let me
(Shout) come on let me shout shout
(Shout)
(Shout)
Come on let me shout shout let me
Come on let me shout shout
Come on let me shout shout let me
Come on let me shout shout
Shout
