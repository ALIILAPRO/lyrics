		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a world
Without borders
No limits
You can do anything
New revolution
The Wild West

We don't have no time
For petty drama
Left it all behind
Like what's your karma?
(Gimme it)

Stepping on the scene
(Don't step to me)
Kill your king and queen
(New legacy)
Paint the walls
Black and green
We're taking it

Rolling up like what
(What's up)
Diamonds in our mouth
(Oh yeah)
Cut the chord
It's all ours
We're taking it

Oo you knew this day would come
So lift your hands up

Get down
When you see us better run
Get down
It's a stick up we're the gun
Get down
Everybody hit the ground
Get down

Get down

Everything you heard about is true
We're liars and we're criminals too
(Do what we want)

Head against the dash
(And stay there)
Wipe it with our cash
(Blood paper)
Gimme it
Everything
We're taking it

Oo you knew this day would come
So lift your hands up

Get down
When you see us better run
Get down
It's a stick up we're the gun
Get down
Everybody hit the ground
Get down

Get down

We run this town
We run this town now
We run this town
We run this town now

Get down
When you see us better run
Get down
It's a stick up we're the gun
Get down
Everybody hit the ground
Get down

Get down
