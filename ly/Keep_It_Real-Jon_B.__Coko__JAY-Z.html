I remember when cheatin on my girl was once my steez 
But the loves so good, you got me on my knees askin, "Please can we?" 

Make love tonight, feel so right 
Hold you tight, take my sweet time 
To let you know how I am feeling for you 
So tight, your love is right 
Keeps me up, girl, all night 
I love the way you hook me up, girl, will you 

Always hook you up (You, baby, baby) if you keep it real 
Your love, girl, Ill keep it real (Ill keep it real, baby) 
You have got me stuck on how good it feels 
It feels so good to me, my baby

Cause I never thought Id find someone to spend my time with 
And the way you've opened up to me 
Lets me know that you're the one for me, so tell me can we 

Make love tonight, feel so right 
Hold me tight, take my sweet time 
Let me know how you feel, my love is real 
So tight, your love is right 
Keeps me up, boy, all night 
I like the way you give it to me 

Always hook you up if you keep it real 
Your love, girl, Ill keep it real [Just keep it real]

Yo, realer than my late night creeps, you understand me

And I shall return to sweat out your perm 
Cutie, I would truly do damage to your dooby

I keep it real, what, I keep it realer than real, word to my life, Jigga 

Always hook you up if you keep it real
