		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Too many puppies are being shot in the dark
Too many puppies are trained not to bark
At the sight of blood that must be spilled so that we may maintain 
Our oil fields
Too many puppies
Too many puppies
Too many puppies are taught to heal
Too many puppies are trained to kill
On the command of men wearing money belts that buy mistresses 
Sleek animal pelts
Too many puppies 
Too many puppies
Too many puppies
Too many puppies 
Skinny was born in a bathtub 
And he grew so incredibly thin 
Even the tide from the eyedropper sucked him in 
Skinny never knew any questions 
Skinny never looked alike 
Skinny sold somethin' every single night 
Skinny sold a soldier to me 
Skinny sold the wife 
Skinny sold a suction cup and a knife 
Skinny found a hello dolly record in the house
Sold it to a truck driver in the night
Too many puppies with guns in their hands 
Too many puppies in foreign lands
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war 
Machine
Too many puppies are just like me
Too many puppies are afraid to see
The visions of the past brought to life again
Too many puppies, too many dead men
