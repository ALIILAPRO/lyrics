		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ever since you said my name
I will never be the same
Can't believe what I became
When you got into my brain
I know I should stay away, to the way you playin', yeah
But every night the lines getting blurred
And I fall for your words, no

So let's not talk too much
Please don't call this love
I get my hopes up for you

Oh, you never mean the things you say
Oh, you never mean the things you say
So hush, don't you bother (hush, hush, hush, hush)
Go mess up another (hush, hush, hush, hush)
Oh, you never mean the things you say
Oh, you never mean the things you say
So hush, don't you bother (hush, hush, hush, hush)
Go mess up another (hush, hush, hush, hush)

Maybe I will never learn
Maybe I will never change
(No, no, no, no, no)
'Cause I hate the way it burns
But I love the way you taste, oh
It's like everything you do
You've been mappin' out the moves
And every night the lines getting blurred
I won't fall for your words, no

So let's not talk too much
Please don't call this love
I get my hopes up for you

Oh, you never mean the things you say
Oh, you never mean the things you say
So hush, don't you bother (hush, hush, hush, hush)
Go mess up another (hush, hush, hush, hush)
Oh, you never mean the things you say
Oh, you never mean the things you say
So hush, don't you bother (hush, hush, hush, hush)
Go mess up another (hush, hush, hush, hush)

When it's 4 in the morning
You don't mean it, do you?
When you're bored and lonely
You don't mean it, do you?
When you drunk and sorry
You don't mean it, do you?
When you say you want me
You don't mean it, do you?
When it's 4 in the morning
You don't mean it, do you?
When you're bored and lonely
You don't mean it, do you?
When you drunk and sorry
You don't mean it, do you?
When you say you want me
You don't mean it, do you?
