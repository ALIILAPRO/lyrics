		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People..stop fighting, angels are crying
We can be better, love is the answer
Search inside, are there anymore tears to cry ?
Don't you wonder why ?
Why you feel so alone all against the world
(World, world)
Search back time, when you used to sing along
To the music of your soul
Song of faith you can change, it's not too late
People..stop fighting, angels are crying
We can be better, love is the answer..
Search inside, are there anymore tears to cry ?
Don't you wonder why ?
Why you feel so alone all against the world
(World, world)
Search back time, when you used to sing along
To the music of your soul
Song of faith you can change, it's not too late
(People..stop fighting, angels are crying
We can be better, love is the answer) x4
Love is the answer
