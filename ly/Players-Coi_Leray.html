		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
'Cause girls is players too, uh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girls is players too (keep it player, baby)
'Cause girls is players too
Bitches gettin' money all around the world
'Cause girls is players too

What you know 'bout livin' on the top
Penthouse suites, lookin' down on the opps?
Took him for a test drive, left him on the lot
Time is money so I spent it on a watch, hol' on
Lil' titties showin' through the white tee
You can see the thong bussin' out my tight jeans (okay)
Rocks on my fingers like a nigga wifed me
Got another shorty? She ain't nothin' like me (yeah)

'Bout to catch another flight (yeah)
The apple bottom make 'em wanna bite (yeah)
I just wanna have a good night
I just wanna have a good night (hold up)
If you don't know now you know
If he broke then you gotta let him go
You could have anybody, eeny, miny, moe
'Cause when you a boss, you could do what you want

Yeah
'Cause girls is players too, uh
Yeah, yeah
'Cause girls is players too (keep it player, baby)
'Cause girls is players too
Bitches gettin' money all around the world
'Cause girls is players too

I go, on and on and on again
He blowin' up my phone but I'm ignorin' him
He thinkin' he the one, I got like four of him
Yeah, I'm sittin' first class like Valedictorian, uh
Came a long way from rag to riches
Five-star bitch, yeah, I taste so delicious
Let him lick the plate, yeah, I make him do the dishes
Now he on news talk 'cause a bitch went missin', sheesh

'Bout to catch another flight (yeah)
The apple bottom make 'em wanna bite (yeah)
I just wanna have a good night
I just wanna have a good night (hold up)
If you don't know now you know
If he broke then you gotta let him go
You could have anybody, eeny, miny, moe
'Cause when you a boss, you could do what you want

Yeah
'Cause girls is players too, uh
(And it's time that we let 'em know that)
'Cause girls is players too (keep it player, baby)
'Cause girls is players too
Bitches gettin' money all around the world
'Cause girls is players too
