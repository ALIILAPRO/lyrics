Harvard dropout bitch
Ooh, yeah

Ooh
Dropped out, then I got rich (yeah)
Dropped out, then I put a Patek on my wrist (brrr)
Dropped out, for my teacher 'cause she ain't shit (huh)
Dropped out, spent a half a million on my whip (yeah, ooh)
Dropped out, and I ain't never had a job (wow)
Dropped out, knew I was gon' be a star (yeah)
Dropped out, used to go to Harvard off a bar (damn)
Dropped out, now I'm richer than your mom (huh)
Dropped out, then I got rich (ooh ooh)
Dropped out, then I got rich (yeah)
Dropped out, then I got rich (ooh)
Dropped out, then I got rich (yeah)
Dropped out, then I put a Patek on my wrist (huh)
Dropped out, for my teacher 'cause she ain't shit (yeah)
Dropped out, spent a half a million on my whip (wow)
Dropped out, spent a half a million on my whip (brrr)

Dropped out, as a tenth grader (yeah)
Why chase a bitch when I got paper (why)
Hit it from the back, 'til I broke the table (brrr)
Still free agent, I just left the label (yeah)
CEO, do what I say so
If not, I'ma cut his payroll (huh)
Lunch, lady give me dirty Faygo
Still riding dirty even if my case closed
Used to hotbox the bathroom at school (brrr)
Go hot every day, number 1 rule (yeah)
Used to walk, now I got a drop top (huh)
Stop talking to me I don't fuck with you (nope)
Bought a bust down 'fore I learned how to write (wow)
I ain't learnt shit, but I'm flooded with ice (ice)
Teacher mad at me, 'cause she knew I was right (yeah)
I been poppin' pills, sippin' drank all night

Ooh
Dropped out, then I got rich (yeah)
Dropped out, then I put a Patek on my wrist (brrr)
Dropped out, for my teacher 'cause she ain't shit (huh)
Dropped out, spent a half a million on my whip (yeah, ooh)
Dropped out, and I ain't never had a job (wow)
Dropped out, knew I was gon' be a star (yeah)
Dropped out, used to go to Harvard off a bar (damn)
Dropped out, now I'm richer than your mom (huh)
Dropped out, then I got rich (ooh ooh)
Dropped out, then I got rich (yeah)
Dropped out, then I got rich (ooh)
Dropped out, then I got rich (yeah)
Dropped out, then I put a Patek on my wrist (huh)
Dropped out, for my teacher 'cause she ain't shit (yeah)
Dropped out, spent a half a million on my whip (wow)
Dropped out, spent a half a million on my whip (brrr)
