		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why, but I feel down
You need to know I can't go on
I was a rose, I was an animal
Don't let me change, don't let me go

All around is stone all is soft inside

All that I know lies within emotion
Words remain unspoken
Lead me through the dark
All that I see came to me in colors
Lasted for a moment, lead me through the dark
All that I know all that I
(Ah, ah)

I need it all, I don't know where to begin
I carry more than you see
My dreams are bigger than me
Please bring me light, I bear a shadow
I call them back to me
So they could feed on me

All is stone and all is soft inside

All that I know lies within emotion
Words remain unspoken
Lead me through the dark
All that I see came to me in colors
Lasted for a moment, lead me through the dark
All that I know all that I
(Ah, ah)

Do you know that we're
All turning softer inside?
We can save what is pure
If the hearts can collide
All that I've ever known is
The universe is wild is the universe is wild
