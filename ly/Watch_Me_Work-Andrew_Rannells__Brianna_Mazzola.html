		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm

Never gets old no matter how much I'm told
I'm amazing, you're amazing
Hard to get tired when I'm always on fire
I'm blazin', ooh, you're blazin'

All my greatness
It doesn't come for free (yeah)
All my talent
It doesn't grow on trees
Take a breather (ooh)
Then take it all away
If the top is where you wanna stay

You gotta work hard (uh-huh)
To make it look it easy
You gotta live fast
To keep makin' that money (ooh)
If you want to be as famous as me
You gotta work, gotta work, gotta work
Watch me work

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Go ahead and watch me work

Haters wanna be me or be with me
Yeah, they're f-f-freakin', yeah, they're freakin' out
I just keep on workin', lurkin', smirkin'
When they think that I'm peakin', never peakin' yeah

All my greatness
It doesn't come for free (ooh)
All my talent
It doesn't grow on trees
Take a breather (yeah)
Then take it all away
If the top is where you wanna stay

You gotta work hard
To make it look it easy
You gotta live fast
To keep makin' that money (ooh)
If you want to be as famous as me
You gotta work, gotta work, gotta work
Watch me work

Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Go ahead and watch me work
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Go ahead and watch me work

If the top is where you wanna stay
You gotta work hard
To make it look it easy (so easy)
You gotta live fast
To keep makin' that money (ooh)
If you want to be as famous as me
You gotta work, gotta work, gotta work
Watch me work
