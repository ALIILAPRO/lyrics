		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in a world
With nobody else
Every time we talk
They'll give us a stare
Conspiracy, no privacy
Blame on me, instead of pointing out somebody

Take that man, I can let you go and do it
Take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh, take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh-no-no, take that man, I can let you go and do it

Free me from my mind
From words I cannot find
Imagine you and me
Escape reality
Oh, unnatural, so fictional
(Um, no-no-no-no)
Blame on me, instead of pointing out somebody

Take that man, I can let you go and do it
Take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh, take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh-no-no, take that man, I can let you go and do it

Oh-ooh, how could you be so heartless?
Oh-ooh, how could you be so heartless?
Oh-ooh, how could you be so heartless?
Oh-ooh, how could you be so heartless?
Oh-ooh, how could you be so heartless?
Oh-ooh

Take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh, take that man, I can let you go and do it
Take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh, take that man, I can let you go and do it

Oh, take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh, take that man, I can let you go and do it
Oh, take that man, I can let you go-
Do it, do it
Don't, don't, don't
Don't, don't
