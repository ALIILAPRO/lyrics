(Padam)
Padam

You look like fun to me (padam)
You look a little like somebody I know (padam)
And I can tell you how this ends (padam)
I'll be in your head all weekend (padam)
Shivers and butterflies (padam)
I get the shivers when I look into your eyes (padam)
And I can tell that you're all in (padam)
'Cause I can hear your heart beatin'
Padam
Padam

Padam, padam
I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
I know you wanna take me home
Padam
And get to know me close
Padam, padam
When your heart goes
Padam, padam
I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
I know you wanna take me home
Padam
And take off all my clothes
Padam, padam
When your heart goes
Padam

(My name)

(Your eyes)

This place is crowdin' up
I think it's time for you to take me out this club
And we don't need to use our words
Wanna see what's underneath that T-shirt
Shivers and cold champagne
I get the shivers every time you say my name
And I can tell that you're all in (all in)
'Cause I can hear your heart beatin' (padam)
'Cause I can hear your heart beatin' (padam)

Padam, padam
I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
I know you wanna take me home
Padam (ah-ah)
And get to know me close
Padam, padam
When your heart goes (ah-ah)
Padam, padam
I hear it and I know
Padam, padam
I know you wanna take me home
Padam
And take off all my clothes (take off all my)
Padam, padam
When your heart goes
Padam

Padam, padam
(Ah-ah)
Padam, padam
(Your heart goes) 
Padam, padam (padam)
Padam, padam
(I know you wanna take me home) 
Padam
Take off all my clothes, padam (padam, padam)
When your heart goes
Padam
