		  Let's do this dance


Bia tu

Banja

Roll up the Ganga

Don’t be shy

Forget ya manners

It’s you and I

And I

And I

Don’t pull out phones

To post no stories

That’s too corny

DND

Till I DYD

the next morning

We still zoning

Please don’t

Yak

Dusse

Cause That’s 100 per bottle

Or 3 story posts from models

Give them a heart cause mine is hollow

No

Oh no

I don’t do no follows

You got jokes

Apollo

a mill in game

Like Gil and Wallo


Aint no stressing
you were at Fati’s
If you getting questioned
Don’t block your blessings
seeing stars
in the presence
Of Kresnt


Haaaaa

No sleep

Lowkey

oh don't tease

On the DL U a freak

with A BBL

Salam khala

Aryana Sayeed

All good , Sayest

Mashallah

At least

On god

Bismillah

1000’s way to die

Hazar rah’s

Turn this up

Where the Afghan kush at

burn it up

Smoking on George Bush pack

We don't know you hair

You get bushwhacked

buttons don't get pressed
They all push back

New deal new deal new deal new deal new deal

That's the price you pay when you too real

They don't ever ask how you feel

don't play with fam that can get you killed

new price tag

We like that

Get knocked down

we fight back

Its like that

My face

on every rice bag

Basmati

Jasmine

She wanna let a lad in

10 out of 10

Im smashing

But who’s asking

We go on and on

Erykah Badu

Afghans love me more than Jadoo

With chai tea

And some gosh feel

elephant in the room

see time heal

Grew up in choir

surrounded by bands

And the boy still on fire

Man you stand no chance

CHUNCE

Chants

I’m at it again

Bitch im the man

Ball like Durant

Rap like the end of the month

I owe them some rent

a milly percent

I don't like to  talk

I vent

Pray off  the sins

Repent

This ain’t a trend

the closest of friends

switch for a couple of cents



You bums cant do this

Rahst bogo

Kee matahna as Mah khoobtar rap cun nah

Haaaaa

No CHUNCEEEE
No CHUNCEEEE
