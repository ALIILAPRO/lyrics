		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're children playing in the sun
A sense of freedom on the run
We never knew what time it was
We just knew how sublime it was
Our course determined by our stars
My momma knows just where we are
The Earth was forming from below
A dragon showed which way to go
Spacing out, we're spacing in
Phasing out, we're phasing in
Turning up by burning out
Lifting off and gazing in

Our luck, it changes with the tide
Our constellations changing side
Macro mirror-image fades
Our over-conscience colour shades
We're astral-planing, floating free
On our continuum frequency
A ring was formed out of the stone 
Metamorphose, tetraform
Spacing out, we're spacing in
Phasing out, we're phasing in
Turning up by burning out
Lifting off and gazing in 

Our luck, it changes with the tide
Our constellations changing side
As macro mirror-image fades
Our over-conscience colour shades
We're astral-planing, floating free
On our continuum frequency
A ring was formed out of the stone 
Metamorphose, tetraform
Spacing out, we're spacing in
Phasing out, we're phasing in
Turning up by burning out
Lifting off and gazing in
