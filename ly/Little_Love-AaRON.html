		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on dance around
Shine upon the ground
From me to you
Don't you know I'm strong

I could win the world
For you for you
Don't you ever cry
I would stop breathin'

For you for you
Don't worry life is easy
Don't worry life is easy
Did you ever fly

Let me teach you how
I'll do I'll do
Drive upon the mountains
Dive into the moon

I'll do Iâ€™ll do
Don't worry life is easy
Don't worry life is easy
Be my unicorn

I'll chase all the dragons
For you for you
I'll build you a castle silver gold
It's your favorite color I have been told

Don't worry life is easy
Don't worry life is easy
