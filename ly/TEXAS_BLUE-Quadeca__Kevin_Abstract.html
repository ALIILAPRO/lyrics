		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wakin' up next to you, am I complex to you?
Scratches on your back, the sun peeking through
Sagging baggy jeans, X-rated preview
Feel the wind coming in, are you gonna let it take you too?

I'll be honest (I'll be)
You like movies more than I do (I'll be)
But who asked you? (Who asked?)
'Cause you ain't, you ain't (you)

Syrups and syndromes, all the beasts in the jungles
Undercovers, undercover, seeing you in flashes
Old photos and boxes of matches
Red button icon, eyelashes, memories I don't wanna see

I'll be honest (I'll be)
It hurts so much more than I knew (I'll be)
But who asked you? (Who asked?)
Who asked? (I'll be honest)

Plus or minus, you give and take away
Don't remind me, erase them hoes in a day (I'll be, I'll be)
I'll be honest
I bite my tongue, ha-ha-ha (I'll be, I'll be)
I'll be honest
You said I'm enough, but you wanted (I'll be, I'll be)
A little more something, I got it (I'll be)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be here
Uh-ooh

If I could tell you the truth (uh)
You hold 'til it splits into two (mh)
I'm going missing the second I give in
So I gotta give it to you
Watching you dancing up there, changing direction
You painting the sky with your hair
Watching you dancing, dancing (dancing)
Dancing up there, dancing, dancing

Waking up next to you (tah, tah)
Colder than Texas blue (ah, ah)
Purple tea in the cup (uh, uh)
Green wasn't indica
New pair of dreams
We burned it all up (ah)
Ash on the sheets
You making me suffer, huh
What will it take to slow you down? (Yeah)
That silent treatment gets a little loud
It's surround sound
It's surround sound

I'll be honest
It hurts so much more than I knew
But who asked you? (Who asked?)
Who asked you? (I'll be honest)

Plus or minus, you give and take away
Don't remind me, erase them hoes in a day (I'll be, I'll be)
I'll be honest
I bite my tongue, ha-ha-ha (I'll be, I'll be)
I'll be honest
You said I'm enough, but you wanted (I'll be, I'll be)
A little more something, I got it (I'll be)
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be here

(I'll be honest)
Waking up next to you (you said I'm enough but you wanted)
Am I complex to you? 
Scratch on your back (a little more something)
Am I complex to you? (I got it)
I got it, I got it (I'll be, I'll be, I'll be)
I got it

Uh-ooh
Watching you dancing up there
Watching you dancing up there (I'll be, I'll be)
Watching you dancing up there
Watching you dancing up there, uh ( (I'll be)
Watching you dancing up there
Watching you dancing up there
Hey, yeah, hey, yeah (oh, watching you, watching you)

I'll be, I'll be
I'll be honest
I'll be, I'll be here
(Uh-ooh)
I'll be, I'll be
I'll be honest
