		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If only I could know
If only I could know
If only I could know
I could
If only I could know
If only I could know
If only I could know

I got a sad boy by my side
But I'm with him
Is it really do or die
But I'm with him
Was a sad day when I took his life
But I'm still with him
Gonna die right by his side
So I'm still with him
I'm still with him

If only I could know
If only I could know
If only I could know
I could
If only I could know
If only I could know
If only I could know
