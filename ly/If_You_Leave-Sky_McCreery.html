		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that it hurts
I know it feels endless
I know how it goes
I know you think you can't take this

I know you feel lost 
Like no one can find you
You're a puzzle in pieces 
That I'm trying to fix

If you leave, I'll be broken inside
If you leave, I will break down and cry
If you leave, yeah, I'll never be the same
I know it's selfish to say, but if there's no other way
Please just stay for me, yeah
Please just stay for me

I hate to admit it that I feel the same way
And though it's toxic to get there
And though it's toxic just to say

If you leave, I'll be broken inside
If you leave, I will break down and cry
If you leave, yeah, I'll never be the same
I know it's selfish to say, but if there's no other way
Please just stay for me, yeah
Please just stay for me
