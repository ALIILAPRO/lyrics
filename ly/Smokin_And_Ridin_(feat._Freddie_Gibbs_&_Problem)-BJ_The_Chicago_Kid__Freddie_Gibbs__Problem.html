		  Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'

I left my love in San Francisco with ten pounds of indo
I put her on the road with the work
Told her: "hold that first, I'm gon' cash out, get mo'"
Down from the jump, hand on the pump, she my shot gun rida'
If a nigga want funk, throw him in the trunk
Burn him up, pass my lighter
Smokin' on killa, straight casualties
In your weed like Mickey and Mallory
A pimp nigga, bitch nigga, yeah, I gotta be
A broke bitch fuck with my allergies
(Phoow!) Damn Fred, God bless you
These niggas and these hoes can't stress you
A sack of the good, rollin' the wood, ain't no pressure

I got money on my mind, dopeheads on my line
Police tryna hit me but they miss me every time
'Bout to smoke it right, pourin' up a pint
Police tryna hit me but the miss me every time

Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'

The gangsta Gibbs and we cruising down these ghetto streets
You checkin' out his trials, seeing how they be
His cup full of pink, mines full of brown
And you know that's us coming down the block when you hear that sound
Right now I'm smoking with Gibbs but girl I'm thinking 'bout you
Then I smoke some more with Problem too
And when we done smoking, I'm tryna get to you, baby, baby

Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'

Half a zip of that cali-flower
Every time I write rhymes in first class
New Rollie on, that's how I define high times
Long way from them drive-bys
Them ratchet hoes and them drug dealers
Bougie party need a fifty plus
I'm bring ratchet hoes and all drug dealers
R-N-S, I love niggas, almost more than I love weed
Body shots, I see bloods bleed
Once you return to hood they say "blood leave"
That's how they show me they love me
I thank 'em now that I smash off
Drop some bread in my cash vault
Then hit the block and drop a half off
Smoke with me, roll it up
Money stacks getting Kobe tall
My young ridder hit his first lick
We celebrate even though they roll
Dream drag keepin' me calm
Stay focused on what I need to do
I'm the one, there's no need for two
I bleed the block, it bleed the truth

Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'
Smokin' and ridin'
