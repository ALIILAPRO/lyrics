		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you'll look the other way
I know you long for something new
So there you're wasting all your day
Looking for something that was right in front of you
And I just want them to notice you
And I, I'll never let go of you

There's something flying in the air
And I just don't know what it could be
Smoke is flying everywhere
I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me
And I, I know that we might be through
But I, I'll never let go of you
I'll never let go of you

I know you'll look the other way
I know you long for something new
So there you're wasting all your day
Looking for something that was right in front of you
And I just want them to notice you
And I, I'll never let go of you

There's something flying in the air
And I just don't know what it could be
Smoke is flying everywhere
I'm getting the feeling it's the end for you and me
And I, I know that we might be through
But I, I'll never let go of you
I'll never let go of you
