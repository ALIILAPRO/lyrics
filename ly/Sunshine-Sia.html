		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My sweet, I know that you feel weak
My sweet, I swear you got this beat
And my love, I know that it has been tough
My love, I know you've had it rough

Tell me your secrets tonight
I'll take 'em with me, and I'll get the elves workin' on them
In the workshop
We'll take your problems apart, but I'm back using our hearts
Got the elves working so hard, make your pain stop

I'm Santa's helper and I've got your back
All my love is gift-wrapped
Don't be scared, I'm by your side
I'm Santa's helper, give your fears to me
I'll take them home, baby
And return them as sunshine

I'll bring you sunshine, yay
I'll bring you sunshine

Darling, I know you wanna sing darling
But you gotta stop running baby
You know that I carry baby
Your heart is safe with me

Tell me your secrets tonight
I'll take 'em with me, and I'll get the elves workin' on them
In the workshop
We'll take your problems apart, but I'm back using our hearts
Got the elves working so hard, make your pain stop

I'm Santa's helper and I've got your back
On my no frills gift wrap
Don't be scared of my own side
I'm Santa's helper fissure me
I'll take them hold me be
I'm maternal my sunshine

I'll bring you sunshine, yay
I'll bring you sunshine

I'm Santa's helper and I've got your back
All my love is gift-wrapped
Don't be scared, I'm by your side
I'm Santa's helper, give your fears to me
I'll take them home, baby
And return them as sunshine

I'll bring you sunshine, yay
I'll bring you sunshine
I'll bring you sunshine, yay
I'll bring you sunshine
