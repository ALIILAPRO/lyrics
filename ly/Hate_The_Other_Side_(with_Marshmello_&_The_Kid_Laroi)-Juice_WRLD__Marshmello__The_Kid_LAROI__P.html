		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got pain in my heart
(Mello made it right)
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hunnid times
Yeah

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hunnid times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side

Bougie off the ecstasy, I might act rude, uh
I lost gang members, I can't act cool, uh
I got gang scriptures in my tattoos
I was runnin' from the police in my trap shoes
Posted, tryna flip a hunnid, I couldn't buy food
Come from nothin', but I blossomed to a tycoon
Betrayal scars, can't stop thinkin' 'bout them stab wounds
We might not catch him today but he gon' die soon
I'm from Chicago, she said she like my accent
I'm from Chicago where Glocks what we react with
Standin' tall, make him tumble when that MAC spit
Bitch, I'm a gangster, I just took off on some rap shit
(Off on some rap shit)

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hunnid times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side (yeah), hate the other side

Hate the other side, hate the other side
Could give a fuck about a bitch, got too much money on my mind
Shit, I heard they was lookin' for me, I'm not hard to find
Everybody that I'm with got nothin' to lose, bitch, they gon' ride
Saw my uncle in the grave, that brought tears to my eyes
But I ain't gon' lie, I done been through this shit too many times
My heart's still tryna recover from pain all my life
I really been to hell and back a couple hunnid times
Couple hunnid times, read between the lines
I'm still tryin', I'm still tryin' to get by
I still got memories that lay deep inside
Creepin' up on my mind, it's fuckin' up my life

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hunnid times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side
