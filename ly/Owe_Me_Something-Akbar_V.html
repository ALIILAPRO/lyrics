		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This shit get real
I had to run up them bands i couldn‚Äôt wait on a deal
Fuck how you feel
Y‚Äôall bitches wasn‚Äôt never with me when i was shooting in the gym
I kept it trill 
With a fuck ass nigga that i know couldn‚Äôt pay for a bill 
I need to heal
All this pain inside make me wanna pop me a pill 
These pain killers I‚Äôm abusing 
That nigga wanna fuck he choosing
I‚Äôm in that vert with the Uzi
Nigga trying to take mine I get ruthless
These stress done made me cold 
How that nigga a boss and he owe
Never go back and forth with a broke ass bitch cause we ain‚Äôt even in the same boat 
That nigga Dior my body 
So I pop this pussy properly 
I‚Äôm a boss bitch fly me private 
Like a rubber band let me pop it bitch can‚Äôt stop me (yeah)

Money getting taller my nigga fuck how you feel my nigga (yeah yeah)
Money getting taller my nigga fuck how you feel my nigga (yeah yeah)
These bitches they owe me something pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
These bitches they owe me something pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
Two hundred in cash I‚Äôm living two hundred on the dash I‚Äôm whipping (yeah yeah)
Stay out of rich bitch business
Stay out of rich bitch business (yeah yeah) 
These niggas they owe me something 
Pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
These bitches they owe me something pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)

I do it all for my people 
When I step on a scene I‚Äôm a diva 
The watch on my wrist look like here come the sun like I play with the Beatles 
Had to let that old nigga go cause he start getting the big head acting like I need him 
This shit get crazy I‚Äôm talking crazy 
Can‚Äôt fuck that Nigga raw nomore he want my baby 
I‚Äôm a walking lick I‚Äôm a come up and a lot of these niggas be hard up
For the money and fame success comes with pain but none of this shit they tell ya 
Had to rerock some bitches like I‚Äôm playing with a brick cause the shit they didn‚Äôt wouldn‚Äôt player (that‚Äôs not player)

Money getting taller my nigga fuck how you feel my nigga (yeah yeah)
money getting taller my nigga fuck how you feel my nigga (yeah yeah)
These bitches they owe me something pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
These bitches they owe me something pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
Two hundred in cash I‚Äôm living two hundred on the dash I‚Äôm whipping (yeah yeah)
Stay out of rich bitch business
Stay out of rich bitch business (yeah yeah) 
These niggas they owe me something 
Pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
These bitches they owe me something pay me like you owe me something (yeah yeah)
