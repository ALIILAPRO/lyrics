		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Frozen moments in time,
Stopped hourglass,
They predicate, what you will know,
Dispositions lie within,
And so do we,
Don't want to run.
Don't want to hide,
Renounce the prayers for inspiration,
If you dictate what i will be
Then smash my face upon the concrete i'm weary,

I feel the stares piercing,
So sorry to soil your precious eyes,
Reflections spoon-feed you,
The bitterness and disgust that is me,
If you choose to reach out to lend to me,
I'll chew off your hand

I'm not beggin' for your fuckin' change
I'm not beggin' for your fuckin' change
I'm in touch with myself,
All alone within myself,
All one. alone

Do what you will make it the whole of your law,
Burn down the faith that shadows life
And take a deeper look inside of what makes you
Pull down the shades internal light can be blinding
Brilliance
I'm not begging for your fuckin' change,
I'm just begging for a fuckin' change,
Complacence quenched of me

Lineage is ending
I am that, once was me, rising upward, guts wrenching
Sculpted cold, blistering, break the mold, sever me

Cut your throat, be the martyr, bitter pills, that we swallow,
Take me, chase me, swallow with me
Know, now, know, now
Inside of truth, coming to, close to me, ground consumes and embraces me
Now forever

Born again,
I'm repositioning,
Self inside to self non-dimensional,
Lost to being,
I've recognized the cause,
Existence to come, alive now forever

I am once was
... that is me
I am once was,
That is me

I'm broken altered vacillating force,
Round square corners circles dance around wet figures,
Prisoner of time i'm no more,
Insight will guide us through the majesty of nothing,
It's like i'm touched with love by angel girl,
Let bastards rot in time for all their evil,
Let bastards rot in time for all their evil,
Let bastards rot in time
