		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought that you would be
Standing here so close to me
There's so much I feel that I should say
But words can wait untill some other day

Kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time
Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since can't remember when
It's been a long, long time

You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you

So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again

Haven't felt like this, my dear
Since can't remember when

You'll never know how many dreams
I've dreamed about you
Or just how empty they all seemed without you

So kiss me once, then kiss me twice
Then kiss me once again
It's been a long, long time

It's been a long, long time
