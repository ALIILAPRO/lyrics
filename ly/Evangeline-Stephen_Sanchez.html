		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, give it all
I'd give it all just to make you mine
And if you need a minute
Honey, I'll give you all my time, all the time
Do you need The Sandman?
Or a phone call to Mr. Jones? Oh
I'll put your dreams to sleep
With rattling bones

So, don't go to sleep, don't rest your head
I'll be the pillow, and I'll be the bed
Holding your dreams as you lie to rest
Evangeline, Evangeline
Don't go to sleep, don't rest your head
I'll be the pillow, and I'll be the bed
Holding your dreams as you lie to rest
Evangeline

Anybody call a doctor
I'm a thousand degrees in love, oh
And I'm sick of all the guessing
Between the two of us
You're my angel in the doorway
I couldn't bare to lose you
And if you're so in love
Honey, why stay refused?

So, don't go to sleep, don't rest your head
I'll be the pillow, and I'll be the bed
Holding your dreams as you lie to rest
Evangeline, Evangeline
Don't go to sleep, don't rest your head
I'll be the pillow, and I'll be the bed
Holding your dreams as you lie to rest
Evangeline
