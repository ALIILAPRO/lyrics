		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I made it weird
The second I said those eight letters
You kinda disappeared so fast your silence made my head hurt
I take it back and honestly, I probably didn't mean it
Is there a way that you can turn this off?
And right now, I could use the old us

I used to hear your voice every night
Call me at 11:29
To say you'll drive by in a minute
But nothing is the same now, is it?
Singing off key in your car
Playing with your keys in the dark
Every single sound, I miss it
'Cause all I'm hearing now are crickets

I'm sorry if I'm having trouble following your logic
You got this funny way of keeping things purely platonic
I'm not delusional, I'm not the only one who sees it
And now I don't know how to turn it off

I used to hear your voice every night
Call me at 11:29
To say you'll drive by in a minute
But nothing is the same now, is it?
Singing off key in your car
Playing with your keys in the dark
Every single sound, I miss it
'Cause all I'm hearing now are crickets

You could hold my hand and rest your head
To keep your heart real busy
You could tuck me in and play pretend
But you just couldn't kiss me

I used to hear your voice every night
Call me at 11:29
To say you'll drive by in a minute
But nothing is the same now, is it?
Singing off key in your car
Playing with your keys in the dark
Every single sound, I miss it
'Cause all I'm hearing now are crickets
'Cause all I'm hearing now are crickets
