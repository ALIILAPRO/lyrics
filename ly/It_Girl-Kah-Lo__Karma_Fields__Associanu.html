		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a story about a girl

Let me tell you a story about a girl
She walked around like she ran the world
She walked around like she knew everything
And wouldn't back down till you kissed her ring
She had that certain je ne sais quoi
There's just that something about her
She twirls around in her fancy gowns
Like the world revolves around her now
It does

That girl is a dream
She means everything
It does
That girl is a dream
She means everything

She's the it girl, she can't control it
She has 'it'
She has 'it'

She walks in and heads turn
Everyone knows that she's the one
You can't get next to her
Even if you tried
And it's the way her dress falls just a little bit
Aye
And if she looks over her shoulder, and she draws you in
Aye
For just a moment

And it's the way her dress falls, just
And it's the way her dress falls, just
And it's the way her dress falls, just
And it's the way her dress falls, just
That girl is a dream
She means everything
And it's the way her dress falls

Aye
She has 'it'
Ah
And she knows it

That girl is a dream
She means everything
She has 'it'
That girl is a dream and she knows it
She means everything

She's the it girl, she can't control it
She knows it
She has 'it'
