		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you (I love you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I love you too (and I love you)
Baby, will you call me the moment you get there?
Hey, baby, um-hum
I love you (I love you)
And I love you (I love you)
And I love you too (and I love you)
Baby, will you call me the moment you get there?
Hey, baby, um-hum

Call me (the moment)
The moment (you get there)
You get there? Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah

My dearest, my dearest of all darling (ah-ooo)
I know, I know, I know, I know we've got to part (ah-ooo)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
It really doesn't hurt me that bad yeah (ah-ooo)
Because you're taking me with you
And I'm keeping you right-a here in my heart
It's all because I love you (I love you)
Woo-hoo, and I love you (I love you)
And I love you too (and I love you)
Baby, will you call me the moment you get there, baby?
Will you do that? Will you do that for me now?

Call me (the moment)
The moment (you get there)
You get there? Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Call me (the moment)
The moment (you get there)
You get there? Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
Call me (the moment)
The moment (you get there)
You get there? Yeah, yeah, baby, yeah
