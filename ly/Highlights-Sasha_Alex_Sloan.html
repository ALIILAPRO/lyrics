		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you when I was broken?
When I was learning out everybody's names
Where were you when I was empty?
When I had no one else to turn to for advice

I'm not angry anymore for what you did
But who does that to a kid?

You love me when it's easy
You love me when it looks good to your friends
You love me when you need me
Or anytime the spotlight's on again
And it's been this way my whole life
Sometimes it feels like
You only love me for the highlights

Where were you when I was sleepless?
Watchin' streetlights turning off
'Cause you were there for birthday cakes
And had a smile on your face, but
Where were you when I was lost?

I won't blame you for the person I've become
But you made it hard to trust someone

You love me when it's easy
You love me when it looks good to your friends
You love me when you need me
Or anytime the spotlight's on again
And it's been this way my whole life
Sometimes it feels like
You only love me for the highlights

Do you ever wish you stayed? (Wish you stayed)
Do you ever turn around? (Turn around)
Do you ever wish you knew
The person I am now?
