		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This sounds kinda strange I thought 
I saw you at a party but 
I finally got close it wasn't you

I know we don't talk right now 
But if I saw you I'd sit down 
And ask about your afternoon

You made it clear that it's over now 
But you're all that I think about
So now I don't know what the hell to do

'Cause I've got a soft spot 
I've got it for you 
It for you

We used to lay in bed and talk 
For hours about everything 
And anything you said you wanted to

Pull the covers over our short hair 
Pretend like the city wasn't there 
Like it was only just us two

You told me that it's over now
But I can't help that I think about
All the things that we used to do

'Cause I've got a soft spot 
I've got it for you 
It for you

I wish I left all my things at your place so I could come get them 
We'd do things we might regret and say that we could make exceptions 
I just can't take the rejection
Maybe I'm just second guessing

'Cause I've got a soft spot 
I've got it for you 
It for you
It for you
It for you
It for you
