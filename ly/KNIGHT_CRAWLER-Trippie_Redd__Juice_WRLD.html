		  (CB on the Beat)
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh
Yeah, first thing, uh

Yeah, first things first, I pop a pill 
After that, I crack a seal
Then I go raw dog your ho 
Kids, don't try that shit at home
I forgot how sober feel 
Life been gettin' super real
Leave me 'lone, I'm in my zone 
She do white like Home Alone
My weed smell like death, am I too high? Yes
Perky make me itch, crawlin' in my skin
My weed smell like death, am I too high? Yes
Perky make me itch, crawlin' in my skin

Don't know where I'm from, don't know where I been
I got connections, like Verizon
I'll start a riot, run up, don't try it
I got my nine, are you ready to die, kid?
I get so high that I'm flyin'
You know that I'm never lyin'
I'm in a whole 'nother world
Tryna plot and plan how I'ma take over the world

Yeah, first things first, I pop a pill 
After that, I crack a seal
Then I go raw dog your ho 
Kids, don't try that shit at home
I forgot how sober feel 
Life been gettin' super real
Leave me 'lone, I'm in my zone 
She do white like Home Alone
My weed smell like death, am I too high? Yes
Perky make me itch, crawlin' in my skin
My weed smell like death, am I too high? Yes
Perky make me itch, crawlin' in my skin

Yeah, jumped out the Demon, I'm brave and I'm bold
Pop out with a diva, she model for Vogue
Might pick her up, fuck that bitch out of control
Might bust on her face, might cum on her nose
If she good, I'ma ice her fingers and toes
No drownin' the king, I might clear the room
Better stay in your lane or we spin like a wheel
From the trenches, lil' bitch, keep a fire in the hills
Gotta hold on yourself or you die with the mills
Lil' cookie gon' crumble, your life is as still
Red flag like I'm a knight in Chanel
Pop out at the party, the opps say, "I yield"
If you diss on the gang then we fightin' in here
If you up you a pipe, then you dyin' in here
Big dog, bitch, like a titan in here
999, start a riot in here

Yeah, first things first, I pop a pill 
After that, I crack a seal
Then I go raw dog your ho 
Kids, don't try that shit at home
I forgot how sober feel 
Life been gettin' super real
Leave me 'lone, I'm in my zone 
She do white like Home Alone
My weed smell like death, am I too high? Yes
Perky make me itch, crawlin' in my skin
My weed smell like death, am I too high? Yes
Perky make me itch, crawlin' in my skin
