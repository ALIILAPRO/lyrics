		  Pray to god, but I'm feeling like he's going deaf
Now when I lean on you and I got nothing left
Hey, I've been wanting to call you
Tell you that I'm sorry
Same old fucking story everybody sings

And I'm say I'm okay but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay but I saw that you liked it
2 A.M. and faded
I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me
Know that's when you're crying

Why you, why you, why you checking, if you're over it
Why you, why you say, "Let go," if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you, why you, why you checking, if you're over it
Why you, why you say, "Let go," if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Nowadays I'm just a bitch to everybody else (fuck you and you)
I don't need no shoulders I'm good crying by myself (fuck you too)
Moving on to chokers, you know I still adore ya
Unrequited love is just a lover's telling

And I'm say I'm okay but I guess I'm a liar
You say you're okay but I saw that you liked it
2 A.M. and faded
I know that's when you like it
Know that's when you miss me
Know that's when you're crying

Why you, why you, why you checking, if you're over it
Why you, why you say, "Let go," if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you, why you, why you checking, if you're over it
Why you, why you say let go, if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better (lil' Boat) at faking it than me, baby (lil' boat, lil' boat, lil' boat)

I'm not gon' act like I don't love ya baby 'cause deep in my mind, girl I know I do
Try to search all through the world and that well but I can't find a girl who looks close like you
I done made millions of dollars, but I'm still alone until I come home back to you
I remember all of the times we were parked by your house and laughed all on your avenue
Oh you can't front, you're a stone cold diva
I had to get counselling from my mom, she's a heartbreak teacher
Remember that time I put those pepperonis on your face made you a creature
Now I think 'bout you every single time I eat pizza

Why you, why you, why you checking, if you're over it
Why you, why you say, "Let go," if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you, why you, why you checking, if you're over it
Why you, why you say, "Let go," if you're still holding it?
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby
Just a little bit better at faking it than me, baby

Why you holding me?
Why you holding me?

Ooh she killed that shit
She was killing it, that was hard, bruh
I didn't know she could get that high
But she killed that
Go 'lani, go 'lani
