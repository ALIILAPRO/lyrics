		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel lighter in the waistline
With no hands around me
No spit in my teeth
No, I'm not your daydream
I won't have your baby
Stop 'cause you're killing my vibe

It's a shot in the dark
I'm not a walk in the park
I come loaded with the safety switched off
This girl is a gun
And we've been having some fun
And I could show you if you turn the lights on

I keep waiting for luck
To come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop calling
I keep falling in love
This measuring cup
Is overflowing with the same damn problems

This girl is a gun
Before you know it, it's done
And you'll be wishing that you crossed your fingers
Oh but God is it fun
When you can have more than one?
So lemme show you how to touch my trigger

My newest baby's testing me lately
Making me crazy from morning to evening
I cannot take it, I love it, I break it
Need it, leave it
If I believe it's a waste of my
Time is a blessing, with me it's a lesson
And I can't be stressing to give you attention
'Cause oh it's never enough
So I'm giving you up
And you'll be better with a nice girl, darling

I keep waiting for luck
To come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop calling
I keep falling in love
This measuring cup
Is overflowing with the same damn problems

(Yeah) This girl is a gun
Before you know it, it's done
And you'll be wishing that you crossed your fingers
Oh but God is it fun
When you can have more than one?
So lemme show you how to touch my trigger

I keep waiting for luck
To come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop calling
I keep falling in love
This measuring cup
Is overflowing with the same damn problems

This girl is a gun
Before you know it, it's done
And you'll be wishing that you crossed your fingers
Oh but God is it fun
When you can have more than one?
So lemme show you how to touch my trigger
