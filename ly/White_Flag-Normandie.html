		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is hell
Ashes of a fantasy
We were chasing down a dream But now I'm waving a white flag
So will you let it rest in peace Let it be
Just a fading melody in your head Cause I'm waving a white flag

I am better without you Without you

So I'm breaking up my heart in two Getting rid of every part of you
We are standing in a burning field of clover I'm breaking up my heart in two
Let it wither into deja vu
I'll be hiding in the storm until it's over Without you

This is hell
Product of your apathy Losing sight of what is real
But now I'm waving a white flag So will you let it rest in peace Let it be
Just a fading memory in your head Cause I'm waving a white flag

So I'm breaking up my heart in two Getting rid of every part of you
We are standing in a burning field of clover I'm breaking up my heart in two
Let it wither into deja vu
I'll be hiding in the storm until it's over Without you

When it's over, it is over
Put a rest to it, put a rest to it x3
It is over

So I'm breaking up my heart in two Getting rid of every part of you
We are standing in a burning field of clover Without you x2
So I'm breaking up my heart in two Getting rid of every part of you
We are standing in a burning field of clover I'm breaking up my heart in two
Let it wither into deja vu
I'll be hiding in the storm until it's over Without you
