		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of days when I was yours, seems so long ago
Now we're standing in the cold, nervous when we talk
Such a sadness in your eyes and now you're looking down
You try your hardest not to show it
Yeah, I can't hold you, give you hope, 'cause I'm not comin' home

And I wish that I could give you more
When you're leaving me an open door
And I wish that I could let you know
How it hurts me too that we're moving on

Oh, where did love go?
It's right in your hands, then it's suddenly gone
Oh no, nobody knows where it disappears
And it breaks my heart

Empty station, 2 AM, see your name on the phone
Saying, "so good to see you but it made me really miss you
It's hard to be alone"

And I wish that I could give you more
When you're leaving me an open door
Yeah, I wish that I could let you know
How it hurts me too that we're moving on

Oh, where did love go?
It's right in your hands, then it's suddenly gone
Oh no, nobody knows where it disappears
And if I only could, I'd go back in time
Take back every word, say, "I've changed my mind"
But no, nobody knows where it disappears

I know it hurts us
But I don't have it
Say, we were happy, so what happened?
Now you're acting like it's nothing
But it was something
You can't erase me
All the memories, you can't change them

Oh, where do love go?
It's right in your hands, then it's suddenly gone
Oh no, nobody knows where it disappears
And if I only could, I'd go back in time
Take back every word, say, "I've changed my mind"
But no, nobody know where it disappears
And it breaks my heart

(But I don't have it)
(And it breaks my heart)
(So what happened?)
(I know it hurts us)
(But I don't have it)
(Say, we were happy)
(So what happened?)
