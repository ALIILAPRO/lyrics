		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We must play our lives like soldiers in the field
The life is short
I'm running faster all the time
Strength and beauty destined to decay

So cut the rose in full bloom
'Til the fearless come and the act is done

A love like blood
A love like blood
'Til the fearless come and the act is done

A love like blood
A love like blood

Everyday through all frustration and despair

Love and hate fight with burning hearts
'Til legends live and man is god again

And self-preservation rules the day no more
We must dream of promised lands and fields
That's never fade in season
As we move towards no end
We learn to die
Red tears are shed on gray
'Til the fearless come and the act is done

'Til the fearless come and the act is done
