		  Let's get it crunk up on 
Have fun up on, up in this dancery
We got ya'll open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me
Don't need no hateration 
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waitin'
So just dance for me

Come on, everybody get on up
'Cause you know we gots to get it crunk
Mary J. is in the spot tonight
And I'ma make it feel alright (make it feel alright)
Come on baby, just, party with me
Let loose and set your body free (oh)
Leave your situations at the door
So when you step inside jump on the floor

Let's get it crunk up on (let's get crunk up on)
Have fun up on, up in this dancery
We got ya'll open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me (gots to dance for me)
Don't need no hateration 
Holleration in this dancery (holler, holler, holler)
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waitin'
So just dance for me

Ooh, it's only gonna be about a matter of time
Before you get loose and start lose your mind
Cop you a drink, go head and rock your ice
'Cause we celebratin' no more drama in our life
With the Dre track pumpin', everybody's jumpin'
Go ahead and twist your back and get your body bumpin'
I told you, "Leave your situations at the door"
So grab somebody and get your ass on the dance floor

Let's get it crunk up on 
Have fun up on, up in this dancery (in this dancery)
We got ya'll open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me (and you gots to dance for me)
Don't need no hateration 
Holleration in this dancery
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waitin'
So just dance for me

We don't need no haters (y'all we don't need 'em, no)
We're just tryin' to love one another (love)
We just want y'all have a good time (mm-hmm)
No more drama in your life (mm-mm, no)
Work real hard to make a dime
If you got beef, your problem, not mine (yeah, not mine)
Leave all that B-S outside
We're gonna celebrate all night (all night)
Let's have fun, tonight, no fights
Turn that Dre track way up high (turn it up, turn it up)
Makin' you dance all night and I (all night long)
Got some real heat for ya this time (real heat for ya)
Doesn't matter if you're white or black (doesn't matter, doesn't matter)
Let's get crunk 'cause Mary's back

Let's get it crunk up on (let's get it crunk up on )
Have fun up on, up in this dancery (in this dancery, hey)
We got ya'll open, now ya floatin'
So you gots to dance for me (so you gotta dance for me)
Don't need no hateration (dance for me)
Holleration in this dancery (dance for me)
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waitin' (let's get it, let's get it, let's get it)
So just dance for me

Let's get it crunk up on (dance for me)
Have fun up on, up in this dancery (let's get crunk up on)
We got ya open, now ya floatin' (all I want y'all to do)
So you gots to dance for me (is just dance, just dance)
Don't need no hateration (come on, come on)
Holleration in this dancery (come on, come on, come on, come on)
Let's get it percolatin', while you're waitin'
