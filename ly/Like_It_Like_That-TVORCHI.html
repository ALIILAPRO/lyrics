		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you okay baby?
I can see that you're feeling just a bit under the weather
Are we okay maybe?
Is it true that you know how to take it away and bring it right back?
 
I can tell you're feeling the same way
I know you like it like that (like that)
Can you tell that I'm feeling the same way
I know you like it like that (oh oh oh)
 
I like it like that
like it like that,
 like it like that, 
like it like that
Ooh I like you like that
like you, like you like that, 
like you, like you like that, 
like you, like you like that
 
Different colors
Same blood
Same feeling
Sweet to sour
Every hour
Crazy feeling
That you make me feel
 
Different colors
Same blood
Same feeling
Sweet to sour
Every hour
Crazy feeling
That you make me feel
 
I can tell you're feeling the same way
I know you like it like that
Can you tell that I'm feeling the same way
I know you like it like that (like that)
 
I like it like that
like it like that, 
like it like that, 
like it like that
Ooh I like you like that
like you, like you like that, 
like you, like you like that, 
like you, like you like that
 
I like it just the way it is
I like you just the way you are
I like it just the way it is
I like you just the way you are
 
Ooh I like it like that
like it like that, 
like it like that,
 like it like that
Ooh I like you like that
like you like that, 
like you like that, 
like you like that
