		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Who's that angry man I see
Is he coming closer
Well I'll just make believe
That I've never been afraid

Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead

From spooky stories that he's read
They put pictures on his body
Living out a fantasy
To be the last one left alive, hah!

Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead

He's lost the instruction
No control
Suicide fever, he won't be much older
I know, won't go, away

What's that smoke that I can see
Rising from the ashes
Well, it seems that there will always be
Someone just like you

Crackle, Crackle,
And you're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead, firehead, firehead!
