		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your lies

Yeah
I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday

There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home and like that

Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

I don't know what I thought I might say
Seems like we never were taught the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made and thought you might stay so

I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed me home and like that

Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies

You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies have all the power of control

Broken down, a victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind
Wrapped up inside your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies
