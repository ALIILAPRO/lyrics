		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were my everything
My here goes nothing
Thought you were chasing me
But you were running
I did nothing wrong
Was perfect as perfect can be
You didn't shed a tear
'Cause you've got this down to a T

And I was crying
And you kept lying
Saying you're sorry
For the thousandth time

Bad hearts don't break when they say goodbye, so
I hope one day I'll cross your mind and you'll realize
You ruined the girl who could make you better
And you'll regret the moment you gave me back my sweater
But if you're still okay
It's 'cause bad hearts don't break (break, break, break)

You walk away and you shrug your shoulders
You were over us before we were over
Barely been a week and there you go again
And I already know how that love will end

She'll be crying
And you'll be lying
Saying you're sorry
For the thousandth time

Bad hearts don't break when they say goodbye, so
I hope one day I'll cross your mind and you'll realize
You ruined the girl who could make you better
And you'll regret the moment you gave me back my sweater
But if you're still okay
It's 'cause bad hearts don't break

I always wondered how they do it, oh
Hurt someone like there's nothing to it?
It must be that

Bad hearts don't break when they say goodbye, so
I hope one day I'll cross your mind and you'll realize
You ruined the girl who could make you better
And you'll regret the moment you gave me back my sweater
But if you're still okay
It's 'cause bad hearts don't break (break, break, break)

Bad hearts don't break (break, break, break)
Wish they would
Bad hearts don't break
