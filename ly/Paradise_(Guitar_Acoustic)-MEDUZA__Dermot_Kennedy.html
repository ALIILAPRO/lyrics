		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm-mm-mm-mm

In the fading light, hearts collide
Shadows dance in the distance
Something just ain't right, I'm cold inside
Help me find what I'm missin'
We're all scared to fly, still we try
Learn to be brave, see the other side
Won't you lead me there? Have no fear
Close your eyes, find paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (my, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
Mm

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm-mm-mm

Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Oh, paradise
Oh, my, my, my
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Oh, my, my, my
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (my, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
Oh, my, my, my (my, my, my)
There's a thousand miles between you and I
Oh, my, my, my (my, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise

Mm-mm-mm-mm
Oh, my, my, my (my, my, my)
Just a thousand miles between me and paradise
