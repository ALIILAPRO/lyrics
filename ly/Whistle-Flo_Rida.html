		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

Look, I'm bettin' you like people
And I'm bettin' you love freak mode
And I'm bettin' you like girls
That give love to girls and stroke your little ego
I bet you I'm guilty, your honor
That's just how we live in my genre
Who in the hell done paved the road wider?
There's only one Flo and one Rida
I'm a damn shame, order more champagne
Pull a damn hamstring tryna put it on ya
Let your lips spin back around calmer
Slow it down, baby, take a little longer

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go (hey)

Whistle baby, whistle baby (hey)
Whistle baby, whistle baby (hey)

Whistle baby, whistle baby (hey)
Whistle baby, whistle baby

It's like everywhere I go, my whistle ready to blow
Shawty don't even know, she can get any for the low
Told me she's not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
Show me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle
Baby, we start slow then you come up and park close
Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
Show me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo
Talented with your lip like you blew out a candle
So amusing (amusing)
Now you can make it whistle with the music (music)
Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it (do it)
Even if it no picture, never lose it (lose it)

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go (hey)

Whistle baby, whistle baby (hey)
Whistle baby, whistle baby 

Whistle baby, whistle baby 
Whistle baby, whistle baby

Go on, girl, you can twerk it
Let me see you whistle while you work it
I'ma lay back, don't stop it
'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me
Now, shorty, let that whistle blow, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, baby, make that whistle blow, oh-oh

Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Let me know
Girl I'm gonna show you how to do it
And we start real slow
You just put your lips together
And you come real close
Can you blow my whistle baby, whistle baby
Here we go

You can blow my whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
You can blow my whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby

You can blow my whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
You can blow my whistle, baby
Whistle baby, whistle baby
