		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jason Derulo

I can't read ya
My sexy Mona Lisa
Can't tell if you gon' leave here
Or if you wanna stay
Girl, just ease up
Don't yell in my two-seater
You say that you a freaker
But fall asleep at eight

Sheesh
But you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy
Like my mama, mama
Sheesh
Girl, you killing me
But you won't see me
With another lover

Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco
I'm just riding the wave
Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo
But I love you that way

Oh-oh
There's something 'bout a crazy lover
Oh-oh
I love you that way

Damn, that body
Devil in Versace
Did I win the lottery
Or am I gonna pay?
Damn, you got me
Like Bitcoin and like Doge
I'm rich with you beside me
'Cause you're not coin-based

Sheesh
But you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy
Like my mama, mama
Sheesh
Girl, you killing me
But you won't see me
With another lover

Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Like boats in Acapulco
I'm just riding the wave
Baby, oh-oh
You're just a little loco
Emotions like a yo-yo
But I love you that way, yeah

Sheesh
Girl, you're perfectly
Dysfunctional, you crazy
Like my mama
