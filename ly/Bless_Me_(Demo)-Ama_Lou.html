		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch out now
Wait a minute, wait a minute
You need to watch out now
Wait a minute, wait a minute

Bless me, hit me up, I've got a date (all right)
Hold here, put you through the wrong way (watch out now)
You signed for it, but you signed the wrong page (all right)
I said "Bless me," hit me up

Tell me now if you're too fragile (all right)
Yeah, leave the keys on the dresser
Did I mention that that is a house that I'm burning down?
So I won't be there to let you out, that completes my message now
And how yeah, can I decipher if I've been found?
I have stood thy only culprit
And you're not glowin' unless you're moonlit, yeah

Left wing, stays a right, the wrong place (all right)
So we need to stay right out the way
Here so maybe be, bet the decision was made (all right)
I said "Bless me," rip me away, I'm on edge

Tell me now if you're too fragile (all right)
Yeah, leave the keys on the dresser
Did I mention that that is a house that I'm burning down?
So I won't be there to let you out, that completes my message now
How yeah, can I decipher if I've been found?
I have stood thy only culprit
And you're not glowin' unless you're moonlit, yeah

I've been waiting, I'm contemplating (come here now, sit down)
All my life, well, that felt amazing (wait a minute now)
I've been waiting, back and forth pacing (welcome y'all)
Overly wasted, I have been patient (welcome to this extravaganza)
I've been waiting, I'm contemplating (come on over here now, come on over here now)
I've been waiting, back and forth pacing (wait a minute )
I've been waiting, that felt amazing
I've been waiting, I have been patient (come here, wait a minute)

Well tell me now your confession, yeah, yeah (ladies and gentlemen, what you are now witnessing)
But leave the keys on the dresser, yeah (is none other than Ama Lou)
Well did I mention? (Well did I mention?)
That that is a house that I'm burning down
So I won't be there to let you out, that completes my message now
And how yeah, can I decipher if I've been found?
I have stood thy only culprit
And you're not glowin' unless you're moonlit, yeah
