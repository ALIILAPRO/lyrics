		  What's up
Stand up and say what's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
Woah

People over there what's up
Feel me, stand up and say what's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You better get with this
'Cause this is where it's at
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

I be skippin' and jumpin'
Leavin' the competition
Makin' 'em disappear like your
Favourite magician
Unwrap that (motherf***er)
Till the wheels fall off
And I bounce 'em back to back
Till they necks get soft
Most of the time you see me, being simple
These are the type of people
To get popped like a pimple
Statin' my claim to fame
To be one of the badest (young n****s)
To set foot in this game
And I haven't even started yet
But you can better believe
I'm 'a take it off a show shot, dead
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

Say woah
People over there what's up
If you feel me stand up and say what's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You better get with this
'Cause this is where it's at
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

Woah

Steady sticking and moving
Like there's no time left
I did it before the fall
Like I lost my breath
Baby that's what happens
When you snooze you lose
Grip your fate when you breaking the rules
They tellin' me Jack was nimble
They said he was quick
But I bet that (n****)
Can't do the (s***) that I did
Rippin' and runnin' the tracks
Can't believe your eyes
The most gifted, talented surprise
It ain't even time to give up
I gotta be on my game haul out


Like, what the (f***)
Beginning to bounce back
So you better watch out
And tell that (b**** a** n****)
Keep my name up your, outh

People over there what's up
Feel me stand up and say what's up
What's up 
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You better get with this
'Cause this is where its at
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

Woah

I'ma keep on pumpin' and stompin' as I please
I know you see me comin'
Movin' like a stampede
Been known for bringin' the drama
Just to (f*** s***) up
It's all because of the drama that enough's enough
Bringin' the entertainment slash, top billing
Suntan Superman, Ron Killings
I didn't think of the risk's
Goin' against the grain
Them are the reason and the 'cause of why I'm insane
Definitely makin' impressions
And leavin' you standin' and guessin'
My tongue be goin' off
Like a Smith and Wesson
You better get boosted up
Make noise and thats a fact
You better get ready for me
'Cause it be like that

People over there, what's up
If you feel me, say what's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You better get with this
'Cause this is where it's at
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

Damn, what's up
If you feel me
Say what's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up

You can get with this
Or you can get with that
You better get with this
'Cause this is where it's at
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
Woah

What's up, if you feel me, say what's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
Woah
