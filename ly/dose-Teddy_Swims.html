		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, babe
Like a cold, cold hand on the stove, babe
My heart and my mind on a stoke, babe
Tripped and fell on down the stairs
Don't know if I'll find them things again
Slid in my life like a thief in the night
And you stole my common sense
The sun will never shine and the wolves will never cry
'Til I'm holdin' you again

Love how you kiss every tattoo on my face
Yeah, it's the time and place
To do what the doctor said a dose of you a day
By morning what I need
The perks of being a fiend
Is that I get to take a dose of you a day

Ayy
(Come on, just one more)
Ayy
(Come on, just one more)

Each night, I stay up like a high note
Thinking 'bout the way you say my name
When's the last time I slept?
I can't get a blink, I'm stressed out
Really need to this bed rock
Baby, you know my sweet spot

Love how you kiss every tattoo on my face
Yeah, it's the time and place
To do what the doctor said, a dose of you a day
By morning what I need
The perks of being a fiend
Is that I get to take a dose of you a day

Ayy
(Come on, just one more)
Ayy
(Come on, just one more)

Slid in my life like a thief in the night
And you stole my common sense
The sun will never shine and the wolves will never cry
'Til I'm holdin' you again

Love how you kiss every tattoo on my face
Yeah, it's the time and place
To do what the doctor said, a dose of you a day
By morning what I need
The perks of being a fiend
Is that I get to take a dose of you a day

Ayy
A dose of you a day
Ayy
A dose of you a day
