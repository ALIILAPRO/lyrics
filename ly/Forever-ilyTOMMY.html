		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beside me

Forever in my mind, only you (I want you to live
I want that more than anything in this world)
The pieces in my life go away with you (I want you to fight 
Like hell to stay with us)
Forever in my mind, only you (With everybody else gone 
I know, it might not be what you want
It might be too hard for you to keep fighting, so)
The pieces in my life run away with you 
(If you wanna go, I want you to know it's okay)
Forever in my mind

I was all alone, on my own, it's okay though
Do you really love me, do you really trust me? 
(The pieces in my life run away with you)
I was down bad, feelin' sad, feelin' sorry
Now you really gone 
And I can't get you to call me (forever in my mind)

Wanna run away, fuck this love and fuck this place
If you was a ghost, I would kiss you anyway
(The pieces in my life run away with you)
I can't fill my lungs, feelin' like I'm outer space
You're the one I love, but you're the one I hate (forever in my mind)

I can't really see you with anyone else
All these fuckin' Perky's not good for my health
(The pieces in my life run away with you)
Wanna end it all, I can't do this again
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him (forever in my mind)

I can't really see you with anyone else
All these fuckin' Perky's not good for my health
(The pieces in my life run away with you)
Wanna end it all, I can't do this again
Tell her that I love her, she do it for him

Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life go away with you
Forever in my mind, only you
The pieces in my life run away with you
Forever in
