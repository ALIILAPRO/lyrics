		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me think about it, hmm
Let me think about it, hmm

You saying baby I'll take you for a ride
Let's get together, work it all night
I'll be your lover, your sexy affair
I'll make you feel like, heaven is near

Let me think about it, hmm
Let me think about it, hmm
Rah!

Come on girl believe me I'll make you see
That I am the true way, to ecstasy
Touch me, feel me and you will find
We are meant to be and I ain't blind

Let me think about it, hmm
Let me think about it, hmm
Rah!

(Let me think about it)
(Let me think about it)

Can I get with you baby?
Blow your mind, do whatever you like, hmm
Let me think about it (think about it)

You don't have to think no more 
'Cause baby I got the cure

The cure is what's up
The cure is what's up
That's what's up, that's what

Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it

You say you want me
You say you need me
You say you love me
How come you're leaving?

Let me think about it (baby think about it)
Let me think about it (baby think about it)
Let me think about it (baby think about it)
Let me think about it (baby think about it)

Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
Let me think about it
