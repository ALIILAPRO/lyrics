		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Slatty
Yeah
Okay, okay
Thought I seen the devil, but he looked just like me
How the fuck you cannot see?
That these niggas can't fuck with me
Hop up on the mic, spill out all my pain
Niggas hear my songs, they say I'm insane
Slatty post office, I come and deliver pain
Leather jackets on us like a motorcycle gang
Flags on our sticks, nigga you know what we bang
I gave yall time to catch up
These niggas still ain't catch up
You know I'm still gon' run it up
I'm back for good, let's run it up
Took my trip to Cali'
We trapped out the cove
We don't dilly-dally
We gon' get that gold
Hopped up out that car, mad–µ his body fold
Hopped up out that car, now he a flying soul
Thought I seen the devil, but he looked just like me
How the fuck you cannot see?
That these niggas can't fuck with me
Hop up on the mic, spill out all my pain
Niggas hear my songs, they say I'm insane
Slatty post office, I come and deliver pain
Leather jackets on us like a motorcycle gang
Flags on our sticks, nigga you know what we bang
I gave yall time to catch up
These niggas still ain't catch up
You know I'm still gon' run it up
I'm back for good, let's run it up
