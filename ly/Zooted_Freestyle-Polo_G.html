		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

I work the pack, I was never over the stove whippin'
Had to trap to make a way, this shit a cold business
Boy, if you conversate with rocks, might get a long sentence, uh
Nina blowin' kisses til it's soul liftin'
My lil' homie known for shootin' like he Cole Bennett
Was just a shawty, off this checks, was fuckin' grown women
My life a movie, all these bitches wanna roll in it
The cloth I'm cut from was special, I wear my clothes different
Locked in the booth, say I'm the GOAT from how I'm killin' tracks
Bitch, just be grateful if you got a chance to witness that
I fucked up the racks, went on the road just to get it back
Starin' in the mirror, still ain't met nobody really yet
Coward was that nigga, lost his soul, I remember that
How you go on ten thousand drills, still ain't no killer yet?
Three blicks in the whip and if they deep then we got sticks for that
They gon' have to outline his body like a silhouette
What you know 'bout watchin' out for opps, in a bullpen?
Devil don't care 'bout your innocence, you will get lured
I might have a bed made in Hell for these new sins
I can't say I'm sorry 'bout some shit that I'm gon' do again

We might pop out at your party, snuck them Rugers in, uh
Them Glocks hot when my shooters spin
Baby, we just set the tone, we don't do the trends
I'm from where they try to make a livin' off of two-for-ten
Yeah, bitch you know how we rock
Fuck with the gang, you get brutalized
Please don't try to take my chain, boy, that's suicide
Comin' straight from the slumps where it's do or die
Now how you gon' survive? Ain't nowhere you can hide
For sure, them troopers slide, hollows go into his spine
That glizzy'll bust, leave his noodle fried
Is you with us or what? Better choose a side
Don't sign up for this, if you ain't 'bout it, this shit deadly
Goofies talkin' 'bout that they outside, nigga, barely
I got way too faded, seein' the reaper but he sparred me
From a slimy-ass block where niggas real rarely
Bein' broken and trusting snakes the only thing that scare me
If I hear that back door unlock, a nigga gettin' burried
VVS my pendant, this shit hittin', check my clarity
Got on and made donations in my hood like a charity
I been reeking' havoc, 'cause they never played it fairly
