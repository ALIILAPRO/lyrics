		  VERSE

I am Driving on the highway 
in my car though the night 
i'm going to see my lover 
who lives in L.A 


I'm Driving on the highway 
in my car all night long 
I'm going too meet my darling 
and my heart is BEATING so hard 
Yeah i'm on m way 
i'm hitting the road again 

CHORUS

and i'm driving and driving and driving 
driving on the highway 
cause i'm going to see my lover who lives in LA 
and i'm driving and driving and driving 
driving on the highway 
cause i'm going to meet my darling who lives in La 

VERSE 2

Driving on the highway 
in my car all night 
I am lonely by myself 
And its seems like it's never going to end 

it has been so long so long 
more that i can stand 
i wanna see her again 
no i can't wait anymore 
And Here Is L.A 
i'm getting closer now 

CHORUS

and i'm driving and driving and driving 
driving on the highway 
cause i'm going to see my lover who lives in LA 
and i'm driving and driving and driving 
driving on the highway 
cause i'm going to meet my darling who lives in La
