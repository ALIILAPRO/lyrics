		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I look for you
Every day
Every night
I close my eyes
From the fear
From the light
As I wander down the avenue so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

Pink lemonade sipping on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine living on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for

I long for you
Just a touch
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming

As I wander down the avenue so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile

Pink lemonade sipping on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine living on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for 

Pink lemonade sipping on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine living on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for
