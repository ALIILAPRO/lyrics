		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I wasn’t even searching for love
That’s usually right when it creeps up on you and
I know in my heart that it’s true
Oh yeah
Boy you got my attention what’s up?
My heart is beating
No one’s got me opened so much
I think I’m dreaming
Got my hands way up, I surrender to love!

What a feeling, to let it all go
What a feeling, I’m losing control
What a feeling, feels like I’m on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling, to let it all do

I, I used to think I’ll never fall in love
It’s like my favorite star I used to stare at every night
Came down from the sky, oh yeah
Ooh, I loved the way you touch
My heart is beating

Boy, I just can get enough
You got me speechless
Got my hands way up, I surrender to love!

What a feeling, to let it all go,
What a feeling, I’m losing control
What a feeling, feels like I’m on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling, to let it all go
What a feeling, I’m loosing control
What a feeling, feels like I’m on top of the world
What a feeling, what a feeling
What a feeling, what a feeling
