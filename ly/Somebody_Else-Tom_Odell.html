		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm walking down the road
Saw you driving past in somebody else's car
I'm thinking to myself
"I bet you're probably breaking somebody else's heart"

Blow a kiss
I am happy that you exist
Feel that light-headed feeling that I've missed
Oh, I've missed

I wonder where you are
You're probably waking up in somebody else's arms
We tried to make it work
But all you really needed was somebody else's love

Shut my eyes
And I call your name, you reply
That your heart will heal, it just needs time (need some time)
Just need time (oh, it needs some time)

Ready?
