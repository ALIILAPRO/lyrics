		  (Wheezy outta here)

Okay
Me and Wheezy, we mixin' hoes from Argentina and California
We was in a Bentley B, flowin' up the street, playin' one of our songs, yeah (uh)
Said if I gave her a beep, now they fuckin' up VIP, tryna see if we goin' (goin')
Been smokin' shit, loud, this noise (noise)
Swervin' around in these toys (toys)
Stack a lot of funds, diamonds on my thumb
Make her pussy cum (make her pussy cum), yeah
Two hundred in a month, know she gettin' some
She suck it 'til it's numb (she suck it 'til it's numb), uh
We spend this shit for fun, Isabel Marant
Yves Saint Laurent (yeah, Yves Saint Laurent), yeah
We smoke a lot of Runtz, high up to the sun
I could touch the sun (I could touch the sky)

We don't take lightly to niggas who chasin' the clout for a buzz (nah)
These pussies don't talk to my niggas 'cause they know we get the business done (get the business done)
We like some students, white chalkin' you niggas
And trust me, we gonna keep a grudge (yeah)
Swear to god that I'm goin' all out for my family
Might pay a visit to your mom (visit to your mom)
I got a hundred thousand in my pocket, lil' nigga, I got it out the swamp (uh)
I just hope that you watchin', quit rockin' these watches
Somebody'll plot and get you slumped (plot and get you slumped)
Got my check up like Nike, my boxers Versace
And now my whole engine in the trunk (engine in the trunk)
I can make her my wifey and have her all icy and hire security like Trump (Trump)
I only trust you as far as I can spit, FN on my hip, can't nobody size me
Heard the young boy got clipped, should've watched his lip, I'm on that slime shit
She give me her pussy and lips, don't give me lip, so I gave her a diamond
I saw when she had a nip slip and it remind me

Me and Wheezy, we mixin' hoes from Argentina and California
We was in a Bentley B, flowin' up the street, playin' one of our songs, yeah (uh)
Said if I gave her a beep, now they fuckin' up VIP, tryna see if we goin' (goin')
Been smokin' shit, loud, this noise (noise)
Swervin' around in these toys (toys)
Stack a lot of funds, diamonds on my thumb
Make her pussy cum (make her pussy cum), yeah
Two hundred in a month, know she gettin' some
She suck it 'til it's numb (she suck it 'til it's numb), uh
We spend this shit for fun, Isabel Marant
Yves Saint Laurent (yeah, Yves Saint Laurent), yeah
Smoke a lot of Runtz, high up to the sun
I could touch the sun (I could touch the sky)

(Uh)
(Uh)
