		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you are cast out
What's your next move gonna be
Will you return cold
Or will you turn up the heat
(God please forgive those who doubt me)

Did you really think the pain
Would send me to an early grave
Did you think I couldn't break these chains
After all the hell I overcame

God please forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames

Well I am back now and stronger than you think
'Cause when it's dark, the light gives me the urge to see
Last thing I sold them, had been my dignity
But the truth is the devil sold his soul to me

To me, to me
The devil sold his soul to me
To me, to me
The devil sold his soul to me

God please forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames
God please forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Make sure they never forget my name

The greatest trick
That the devil did
Was convince the world
He doesn't exist

The greatest trick
That the devil did
Was convince the world
He doesn't exist

Just outside this
(God please forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me)
After all that hell I overcame

God please forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Then throw them down into the flames
God please forgive those who doubt me, forgot about me
Make them remember again

Did you really think the pain
Would send me to an early grave
Did you think I couldn't break these chains
After all the hell I overcame

Outside this

The greatest trick
That the devil did
Was convince the world
He doesn't exist
