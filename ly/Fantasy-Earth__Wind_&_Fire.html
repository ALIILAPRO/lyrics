		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every man has a place, in his heart there's a space
And the world can't erase his fantasies
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship, Fantasy
All your dreams will come true, right away

And we will live together, until the twelfth of never
Our voices will ring forever, as one

Every thought is a dream, rushing by in a stream
Bringing life to our kingdom of doing
Take a ride in the sky, on our ship, Fantasy
All your dreams will come true, miles away

Our voices will ring together until the twelfth of never
We all, will live forever, as one

Come see victory, in the land called, "Fantasy"
Loving life, a new decree
Bring your mind to everlasting liberty

As one

Come to see, victory in a land called, "Fantasy"
Loving life, for you and me, to behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find, other kind, that has been in search for you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize it's your life, now in review
And as you stay for the play, fantasy, has in store for you
A glowing light will see you through
It's your day, shining day, all your dreams come true
As you glide, in your stride with the wind, as you fly away
Give a smile, from your lips, and say
I am free, yes I'm free, now I'm on my way

Come to see victory
In a land called, "Fantasy"
Loving life for you and me
To behold, to your soul is ecstasy
You will find other kind
That has been in search of you
Many lives has brought you to
Recognize, it's your life now in review (ahh-oh)

Oh, oh, oh, oh
