		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But a very important one
And it was scheduled to talk about the great things 
That we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration
And we will talk about that very much so in a little while 
But I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville
So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thankâ€”

Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacin' men
Will fuckin' swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart has gone as still as a corpse

Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacin' men
Will fuckin' swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart has gone as still as a corpse

Why the fuck should I apologize?
Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag dick suckers with ties (great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
Where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind that flies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation (violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation 
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why? (this has been going on for a long, long time)
Why? (It has no place in America)
Why? (what is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives)
(No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society)
(And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play)
