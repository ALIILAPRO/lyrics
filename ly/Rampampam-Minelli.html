		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You shot me so damn well, rampampam)
(You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam)
(I see the satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam)
(I loved you and I trusted you so well, so why, oh why, oh why?)

Baby, I see what's on your mind, I see
You try to find another lie, for me, and when I ask about it, mmh
When I ask you're hiding from me, mmh-mmh

Confusing thoughts and mystery, I see
Our love was just a fantasy, for me
You played me like nobody, mmh-mmh
When you were everything for me, mmh-mmh

You shot me so damn well, rampampam
You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam
I see the satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam
I loved you and I trusted you so well, so why, oh why, oh why?

You shot me so damn well, rampampam
You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam
I see the satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam
I'm lookin' at you and I'm asking why, oh why, oh why, oh why?

Another face, no sympathy, from me
You turned me into your enemy, I see, don't wanna talk about it, mmh-mmh
'Cause I don't have no reason to believe you

Confusing thoughts and mystery, I see
Our love was just a fantasy, for me
You played me like nobody, mmh-mmh
When you were everything for me, mmh-mmh

You shot me so damn well, rampampam
You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam
I see the satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam
I loved you and I trusted you so well, so why, oh why, oh why?

You shot me so damn well, rampampam
You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam
I see the satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam
I'm lookin' at you and I'm asking why, oh why, oh why, oh why?

My soul is hollow
I know what you're hiding from me
And maybe tomorrow
I'll see what you want me to see
T-I-T-I baby, T-I oh

You shot me so damn well, rampampam
You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam
I see the satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam
I loved you and I trusted you so well, so why, oh why, oh why?

You shot me so damn well, rampampam
You shot me then you got me and I'm like damn, rampampam
I see satisfaction in your eyes, rampampam
I'm lookin' at you and I'm asking why, oh why, oh why, oh why?
