		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Afterglow, sitting on the park bench,
High with you, waiting for the sun to smile on everyone.
Cigarettes and Feelings keep me…

There’s something in the air,
You’ve got your hand on my chest.
I love the way you spin your hair, 
Yeah, I think it’s the best.
I lose my mind when you whisper sweet nothings.

You’re velvet turtleneck,
Falling apart at the seems.
My favorite thing about you, 
You always say what you mean.
I love the way I light up when you call me.

One, two, three, I’m caught in the middle…

Afterglow, sitting on the park bench,
High with you, waiting for the sun to smile on everyone.
Cigarettes and Feelings keep me,
Laughin when everything is all fucked up,
I see rainbows when I think us, its all a dream?
Cigarettes and feelings, you and me.

You got me stumbling,
You never give me a break.
I know what day this thing’ll kill me, 
You’re my favorite mistake. 
I love the way I light up when you call me.

I know you see me here.
You’re always playing this game,
You’ve got me breathless, got me begging you to drive me insane.
I always fall for the things that will hurt me. 

Afterglow, sitting on the park bench,
High with you, waiting for the sun to smile on everyone.
Cigarettes and Feelings keep me,
Laughin when everything is all fucked up,
I see rainbows when I think us, its all a dream?
Cigarettes and feelings, you and me.

We got this French roulette,
Guess we’ll see how it ends.
You’re the bullet going straight through my head.
We got this French roulette,
Guess we’ll see how it ends.
You’re the bullet going straight through my head.

One, two, three, I’m caught in the middle...

Afterglow, sitting on the park bench,
High with you, waiting for the sun to smile on everyone.
Cigarettes and Feelings keep me,
Laughin when everything is all fucked up,
I see rainbows when I think us, its all a dream?
Cigarettes and feelings, you and me.

Cigarettes and feelings, you and me.
