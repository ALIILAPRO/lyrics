		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking
When I said I'd like to smash every tooth
In your head
Oh oh oh

Sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking
When I said by rights you
Should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da, bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Oh oh oh oh oh
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da, bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da, bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Oh oh oh oh oh
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da, bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Oh oh oh oh oh

Bigmouth, oh oh oh oh, bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Oh oh oh oh oh
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da, bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
