		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you heard the news?
I'm doing what I said I would
So now you say
Boy, I always knew you could
My wildest dreams
Murdered by reality
I gave you all I could give to you
But now I'm taking back what belongs to me

I read you like a drugstore book
How'd I ever think you were cool
You got no bait left on your hook
You're no friend and buddy, I'm no fool

[Chorus]
Ain't nothin' you can do about it
Ain't nothin' you can say
ain't' nothin' you can do about it
No one's gonna stand in my way

I've done my time
I've given up my pound of flesh
So why can't the man seem to understand
That I've already passed the test

You did your best to keep me down
Tried to make my spirit give in
But I'm here to make a big, big sound
It's your turn to lose and it's my turn to win

[Chorus]

I know you can never go back
Once you turn and walk out that door
Got no time for worries like that
I'm not a kid anymore

You did your best to keep me down
Tried to make my spirit give in
But I'm here to make a big, big sound
It's your turn to lose and my turn to win

[Chorus]
