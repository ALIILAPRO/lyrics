		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And sometimes the blues just get a hold of you
Oh, just when you though you had made it
All around the block people will talk
I wannna give it all that I've got 
I just don't want, I don't wanna waste it

Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons on my mind
Sure does appeal to me
You know you we can get there easily
Just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea

Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And most times you choose between the two
Oh, wondering, wondering if you have made it
But I'll have some kids and make my plans
And I'll watch the seasons running away
And I'll build me a life in the open, a life in the country

I'm talkin' 'bout sweet seasons on my mind
Sure does appeal to me
You know you can get there easily 
Just like a sailboat sailin' on the sea
Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout sweet, sweet, sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons
Talkin' 'bout sweet seasons
