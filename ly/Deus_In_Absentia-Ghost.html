		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In this your time of need?
You're turning to the light
You have just begun to explore the dark
In the urban night

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore (more)

You're so goddamn frail
Failing for a change
You just had to know all about the world
But you will never know
'Cause no one ever told you how

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forever

The world is on fire
And we are tied as one eternally
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore (more)

(Deus, Deus)

All of your imaginations
Are now running down your face
All of your imaginations
Are now running down your face

Oh, you are looking good
Payback in disgrace
And you're doing fine worshipping your lord
Standing in his grace
'Cause no one ever told you how

The world is on fire
And you are here to stay and burn with me
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forever

The world is on fire
And we are tied as one eternally
A funeral pyre
And we are here to revel forevermore (more)

(Deus, Deus)
