		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been up all night staring at the ceiling my friend.
You're looking at me saying
that you've been about searching for a reason to end it.
Just wanna tell me that you're running all the time about to loose your ground, 
drinking your own poison but I brought the wine yeah.
I know you're cold oh, I saw the signs. 

I'm looking for ways, keep your problems at bay bet I could fix you up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem) 
Cause I'd rather stay than having to face my trauma building up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem)
(Maybe I'm the problem)
Maybe I'm the problem. 

All of your friends tell me you are spiraling down hoping for redemption. 
While I'm on a rollercoaster trying not to fall down while breaking all my pride.
So I'm running all the time 
about to loose my ground yeah, 
breathing in your toxin letting it cloud my mind see, 
I know you're cold oh, I saw the signs. 

I'm looking for ways, keep your problems at bay, bet I could fix you up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem) 
Cause I'd rather stay than having to face my trauma building up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem)
I'm looking for ways, keep your problems at bay, bet I could fix you up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem) 
Cause I'd rather stay than having to face my trauma building up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem)

I brought the wine for you to drown in, 
I stared a fire thinking helping you would keep me grounded. 
I saw the signs making me the villain,
cause I've been out of touch and lately I found out that maybe I have a savior complex. 
Yeah maybe I'm the problem. 

(Maybe I'm the problem)

(oh-oh-oh)
(Maybe I'm the problem) 
(oh-oh-oh) 
(Maybe I'm the problem)

I'm looking for ways, keep your problems at bay, bet I could fix you up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem) 
Cause I'd rather stay than having to face my trauma building up. 
(Maybe I'm the problem)
(Maybe I'm the problem I)
Maybe I'm the problem.
