		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time keeps turning, yet my memory is running slow
But I still see your afterimage
Tell me now, how does a river pick its flow
The tides locked me to this intention
Here we go again, the devil's watching from below
So just keep writing
See it in my eyes, I never wanted to survive
So I'll show you who I've learned to be

I've seen a perfect crime
I've seen a girl who lies
I've seen an angel watching devils with his greedy eyes
And if you wanted to be anything more than just free
Just take a step into my life and try to breathe again

Just for today
It's okay
To want to run and say that I'm not afraid
Of the way
That I've been burning up
'Cause when you write the words I ignite
Thousands of lives through my eyes
So when you're done having fun
Just hit the chords again
Next comes the pain of the way
You're falling into me
I know it's closed reign
But the flame is sinking in again
See thousands of words through my eyes
And when you finally realize
That you're the one holding the gun
I'll say my first goodbye

Time's still turning, yet my memory is running low
This isn't my first time y'know
Tell me now, how do you want this to go
I'll cast my hand, don't wanna know

You've seen a hundred lies
I see that all the time
I've seen the devil's protégé with my own very eyes
And if you wanted to be anything more than just me
Just take a step into my life and try to breathe again

Just for today
It's okay
To want to scream and say that I'm still afraid
Of the way
That you've been burning up
'Cause when you mark the lines I ignite
Thousands of lives through your eyes
And when you're done having fun
Just strike the keys again
Next comes the pain of the way
You're crashing into me
'Cause in the domain
Of my brain
I'm getting lost again
See thousands of words through my eyes
And when you finally realize
That I'm the one who's always won
Just recite my goodbye

Just for today
It's okay
To want to run and say that I'm not afraid
Of the way
That I've been burning up
'Cause when you write the words I ignite
Thousands of lives through my eyes
So when you're done having fun
Just hit the chords again

Next comes the pain of the way
You're falling into me
I know it's closed reign
But the flame is sinking in again
See thousands of words through my eyes
And when you finally realize
That you're the one holding the gun
I'll say my last goodbye
Just for today
It's okay
To run and try to say that I'm not afraid
Of the way
That I've been burning up
'Cause when you write the words I ignite
Thousands of words through my eyes
So when you're done having fun
Just play this song again
