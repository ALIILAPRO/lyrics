		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yo, man
(Yo)
Open up, man
(Yeah, what do you want, man?)
My girl just caught me
(You let her catch you?)
I don't know how I let this happen
(With who?)
The girl next door, ya know?
Man, I don't know what to do
(Say it wasn't you)
Alright

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had
Given her an extra key
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

How yuh fi give the woman access to your villa?
Trespasser and a witness all the hacklin' a yuh pillow
You better watch your back before she turn into a killer
Let's review the situation that you're caught up inna
To be a true player, yuh haffi know how fi play
If she say, "A night," convince her say, "A day"
Never admit to a word when she say
And if she claims ah yuh, tell her, "Baby, no way"

But she caught me on the counter (it wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (it wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (it wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (it wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (it wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (it wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (it wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
I had tried to keep her from what
She was about to see
Why should she believe me
When I told her it wasn't me?

Make she know say that she really no have right fi vex
A never you she see yah make the gigolo flex
A smaddy else a favor you inna di complex
Seein' is believin', so you better change your specs
You know she a go bring a whole heap a things up from the past
All the likkle evidence, yuh better know fi mask
Quick pon yuh answer, know how fi talk
But if she pack a gun, you know you better run fast

But she caught me on the counter (it wasn't me)
Saw me bangin' on the sofa (it wasn't me)
I even had her in the shower (it wasn't me)
She even caught me on camera (it wasn't me)
She saw the marks on my shoulder (it wasn't me)
Heard the words that I told her (it wasn't me)
Heard the screams gettin' louder (it wasn't me)
She stayed until it was over

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me

Wanna tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
I've been listenin' to your reasonin'
It makes no sense at all
Need to tell her that I'm sorry
For the pain that I've caused
You may think that you're a player
But you're completely lost
That's why I sing

Honey came in and she caught me red-handed
Creepin' with the girl next door
Picture this, we were both butt naked
Bangin' on the bathroom floor
How could I forget that I had given her an extra key
All this time she was standin' there
She never took her eyes off me
