		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can't seem to find someone's shoulder
Who will I rely on when it's over?
Took a chance with you, it made me colder
Better on my own when it's all over
So when I'm weak, who do I call?
My God it hurts, I can't be calm
What do I do?
Do I run?
Tired of hate, tired of love
I've dug my nails into my arms
She turned and left with all my scars
What is my worth?
What is my worth?
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left the question, "What's my worth?"
Gave my love a piece of me
She put my heart beneath her feet
She turned and left the question, "What's my worth?"
My worth, my worth
