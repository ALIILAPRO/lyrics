		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My fighting is best
But I never felt this power before
Call me Thunder Ranger
Let me tell you some more
I was hit by a lightning
And fucked by your mom
My katana is rising
And it drops like a bomb

I really wanna fist pump your face
And it goes 
But I got moves in my body
Let's set them free

Left and right
And kick it to the side
We're going round and round
And down to the ground

Go, you got it
Go, go, you got it
Ichi, ni, san, kawaii

Whatever you do
Whatever you say
I never stop to party
'Cause tonight
Is all that I need
I'm feeling the beat
So, I'm never gonna stop
I'm dancing like a ninja
I'm dancing like a ninja
I'm dancing like a ninja

I'll punch you back
In time and I don't give a shit
Then you're a great great great grandson of a bitch
It's date night, baby
And it starts with a kiss
What a pretty lovely couple
Your face and my fist

I really wanna fist pump your face
And it goes 
But I got moves in my body
Let's set them free
Hail to the thunder
Your only fucking God

Whatever you do
Whatever you say
I never stop to party
'Cause tonight
Is all that I need
I'm feeling the beat
So, I'm never gonna stop
I'm dancing like a ninja

I give you one last chance
To back off and go home
Now you're gonna meet the mighty thunder

Let's go
Fight

Get down
I'm gonna end you like a boss
Take this and that
I'll break your bones
Don't ever fuck with the thunder again

Left and right
And kick it to the side
We're going round and round
And down to the ground

Go, you got it
Go, go, you got it
Ichi, ni, san, kawaii

Whatever you do
Whatever you say
I never stop to party
'Cause tonight
Is all that I need
I'm feeling the beat
So, I'm never gonna stop
I'm dancing like a ninja
I'm dancing like a ninja
I'm dancing like a ninja
