		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Took a ride to the end of the lane
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train with nobody I know
But the pain and the longing's the same
When you're dyin'
Now I'm lost, and I'm screaming for help alone

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire
Scared
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax (love)
There is an answer to the darkest times
It's clear we don't understand it
But the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you
I believe that we're in this together
Don't scream, there are so many roads left

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

It's as if I'm scared (relax)
It's as if I'm terrified
It's as if I'm scared
It's as if I'm playing with fire (relax)
It's as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax
Relax

"Same day I want to dress for wedding
Same day while I want married
What happened? He's go married another girl
While he's married another girl, I am very, very sad
I can't walk, like God take my legs
How he's married different lady, I no believe
After one month I am sent up in balcony
Some bomb come for my eyes, my eyes gone
My eyes gone in bomb, now I have only one eyes
I am sad, until now I no married any man after"
