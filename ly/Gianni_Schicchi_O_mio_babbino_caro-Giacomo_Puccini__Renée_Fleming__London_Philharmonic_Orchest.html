		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had a girl and she did me wrong
I didn't let that kind of shit go on too long
Split the clouds and divided the sea
Showed the evil girl how nasty the tiki god could be
She didn't call no more nor bother me
My little tiki god make sure I'd live in peace
One day I read they found a body in the river
Tiki God, make me shake, make me shiver
I got a Tiki God... saves me... I got a Tiki God
When Bobby Brady found the idol in the rubble
Had no idea it would cause so much trouble
When Greg tried to throw it back in the ocean
There was a rumble, an awful commotion
Don't ask me how, but the tiki found Bobby
He thought the idol was some Hawaiian hobby
Turned out the god was mean and vicious
Didn't respond to Bobby's 3 wishes
He had a Tiki God... saves him... he had a Tiki God
So when you're caught up in an evil plot
Your life's in danger and you can hear the shots
Your head is spinning and you're fading fast
How long do you think the kind of fun can last
Your luck will change with a simple motion
I found my idol in a bottle on the ocean
Splits the clouds and divides the sea
And shows those evil guys how nasty those tiki gods can be
You got a Tiki God... saves you... You got a Tiki God
