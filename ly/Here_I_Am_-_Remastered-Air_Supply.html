		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am, playing with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside
So there's no sense pretending, my heart, it's not mending

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh, baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without you

On my own, I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain
I just can't live without you, I miss everything about you

Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh, baby, those memories come crashing through
And I just can't go on without, go on without
It's just no good without 
You (just when I thought that I was over you)
Without you (just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you (just when I thought that I was over you)
Without you (just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you (just when I thought that I was over you)
Without you (just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you (just when I thought that I was over you)
