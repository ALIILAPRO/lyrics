		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your numbers up you have to go 
The system say's "I told you so" 
Stocked in a train like a truckload of cattle 
Sent off to slaughter in a useless battle 
Thousands of us sent off to die 
Never really knowing why 
Fuck the system they can have me 

I don't need society! 
I don't need society! 

Before you know it you're in he corp 
Grab your gear boy you're off to war 
Stocked in a train like a truckload of cattle 
Sent off to slaughter in a useless battle 
Thousands of us sent off to die 
Never really knowing why 
Fuck the system they can have me 

I don't need society! 
I don't need society! 

You were an apple pie clone living at home 
Never straying to far from your phone 
Now son make it through enemy lines 
You must hurry there's not much time 
Made it sir. They're gonna drop the bomb 
No time to evacuate, they'll call our moms 
Fuck the system, they can't have me 

I don't need society! 
I don't need society!
