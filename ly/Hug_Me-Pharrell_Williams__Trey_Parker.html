		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey

Why do you insist on trying to give me away (hey, hey)
When they were too good and you wanted to shake them, who came?

I was your dirty boy, you're the new secret toy
Show me off and get your joy (who stayed in trouble with you?)
Oh, don't you want some more? Come on, I think they're gone
Our part is coming on (you're either with me or doomed)

Hug me (bring it in)
Would ya loosen up, would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture

Wake up, you're sleeping on me, playing this stupid game

(Hey, hey)

Why can't we flex on the world and make them say our name

(Hey)

Our favorite color's purple, we stay out past the curfew
My kung-fu grip will hurt you (who stayed in trouble with you?)
You dyed your hair like me, black so everyone can see
Your parents couldn't believe (you're either with me or doomed)

Hug me (bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture

Oh would ya, would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya loosen up, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya
Oh would ya, would ya, would ya
Would ya wanna take a picture?

(Hey)

Hug me (bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture
Hug me (bring it in)
Would ya loosen up? Would ya
Hug me? (Bring it in)
I think they wanna take a picture
