		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

That part
Bang this shit in the hood one time
Lil' bitch, I'm back and poppin'
Tell that ugly bitch to move away, I need more options
Broke? then fix your pockets, all I do is profit

Quarter million, switchin' lanes, that part
Bet my bitch move the same old thing, that part
405 with the gun off safety, that part
A.M., still tryna make that play
Rich or poor nigga, pick your fate
Style on top of style, nigga
Five years I've been rich, nigga
Drove Bimmers down Fig, nigga
Pushed Porsches down Broadway
I've been divin' in different hoes, nigga
Got a chain that's worth the Rolls, nigga
Got an engine back with the top in it
Nigga drivin' it like it's a bomb in it, uh

Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored (yeah, uh)
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay (that part)
Beggars can't be choosers, bitch, this ain't Chipotle
Nigga with an attitude, I feel like O'Shea
Walkin', livin' legend, man, I feel like Kobe (Kobe)
I just left the strip club, got some glitter on me
Wifey gonna kill me, she the female OJ
Y'all don't feel me, man, this ain't okay
Four Seasons, take a shower, new clothes, I'm reloaded
Rich nigga, still eatin' catfish
That bitch ain't really bad, that's a catfish
If I walk up out of Saks Fifth
Have the paparazzi doin' backflips, yeah
If I lay you down on the mattress
Blow the back out 'til you backless
Think we already established
She just got 'em done, bra-strapless, yeah
Okay, okay, okay, okay (that part)
Beggars can't be choosers, bitch, this ain't Chipotle (that part)
Nigga with an attitude, I feel like O'Shea (that part)
Walkin', livin' legend, man, I feel like Kobe (that part)

Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy

That part
Bang this shit in the hood one time
Lil' bitch, I'm back and poppin'
Tell that ugly bitch to move away, I need more options
Broke? then fix your pockets, all I do is profit

Few million made and still ain't changed, that part
Me and my girl got matchin' bling, that part
I'ma get so blowed, I'ma lose my brain, that part
Me and XO only thing go straight
Need me a bitch that'll go both ways
Style on top of style, nigga
Since a youngin' I wanted to ball, nigga
Had a pistol in my drawers, nigga
When I was broke, I had the sauce, nigga
Got a Chevy with side to side on it
Hundred spokes, the Dana Danes on it
Got a chopper that stand at 5'2"
I put your homies right down beside you, uh

Me no conversate with the fake, that part
All my bitches independent bitches, that part
I just want the paper, that part
All my bitches flavored
That part, that part, that part, that part, ayy
That part
That part
That part

Walkin', livin' legend, man, I feel like Kobe (that part)
I just dropped sixty, man, I feel like Kobe
Lamar was with me, man, I feel like Kobe
Pippen at my wedding, man, I feel like Jordan
Trippin' at my wedding, I be raa-uh-ayy
Ain't say shit, nigga
You was listenin' close though
You was listenin' to hoes though
You wouldn't listen to the flow though
Listen to the G.O.A.T.
Lunch line, young nigga from the 'Go, though
I'ma freestyle this mothafucka, who knew?
When I'm with my niggas, nigga, ScHoolboy Q
And, uh, Top Dawg, call bro dawg
Get that nigga on the phone
Top Dawg on the phone
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ha
