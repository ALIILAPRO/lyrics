		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Midnight and the moon is out
Careful, you might hurt yourself
Pleasure leads to pain
To me they're both the same

Sweat dripping down to the floor
Bite marks like an animal
You might be insane
But maybe we're the same

Tonight, you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone

I don't need a future
I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my
Self-inflicted torture
You don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself

I can tell that you're new to this
Slow it down but you can't resist
Feed your fantasy
Give yourself to me

Tonight, you came here
'Cause you know what I need
And no one likes to be alone

I don't need a future
I don't need your past
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to my
Self-inflicted torture
You don't have to ask
I just need a lover
So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself

Give it to me, babe
(Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me, babe
(Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me and nobody else, babe

Give it to me, babe
(Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me, babe
(Give it to me, babe)
Give it to me and nobody else, babe

Gimme what I want
Gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself
