		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Packing while you're asleep
You were the catalyst
I don't know what it is
About how you breathe
About how you breathe
I wanna be alone
Hate it that no one knows
You're good to everyone
All them but me
All them but me

And if you hear me leavin' in the mornin'
Could you just pretend that it was only wind?
'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through, you don't know where I've been

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'

Say something sweet to me
It never meant a thing
Used to the turbulence
I wore long sleeves
I wore long sleeves
Fought 'til you tethered me
Swept under surfaces
Never enough of it
You didn't think
You didn't think

If you hear me leaving'in the mornin'
Could you please pretend that it was only wind?
'Cause I can't love you even if I want to
Got a lot to work through, you don't know where I've been

It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'
It's been a long time comin'

Comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin'
Comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
I'm comin' down, I'm comin' down
