		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Real niggas do not deserve pussy
Meaning it's more, you see right through walls
Ain't talkin' about pussy
Meaning you deserve the whole box of chocolates
Come at me
Forrest Gump had a lot goin' for him
Never without pussy
Y'know, Jenny almost gave it all up for him
Never even pushed for the pussy
Where's Forrest now when you need him?
Talk to me, talk to me
Hey, ay, hey
Attention, all you niggas
All you bitches

Sit back and relax your mind, just ride, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why, just why
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
You are now watching MADtv

Niggas'll lose they mind for it
Wine for it, dine for it (pussy)
Spend time for it, see no colored line for it (pussy)
Double back handicap and go blind for it (pussy)
Pussy got endless prisoners
Pussy always revengin' her
Pussy is calculating
And good pussy is rather dangerous
Pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
Pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
I mean, the pump fakes on the Facebooks
And the screw face when the bae look
Won't get you no pussy
I mean, the fake chains and the gold names
For insecure, gon' reassure you not to get pussy
You overcompensate too much for the pussy
You like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy
See, that's what pussy niggas do
I know the ways of a pussy, I see pussy lookin' at you
How many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day?
How many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away?
How many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable?
But if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
Sol√°na, middle fingers up, speak your truth

You could never trivialize pussy
But a bum nigga like you would try it (pussy)
I know what you really 'bout
I hear your dick is weak, buddy
It's only replaced by a rubber substitute
We ain't feelin' you

Think I caught a vibe, kinda feel a nigga
You could touch the booty if you like, I ain't trippin' on ya
(Such a nice girl, SZA)
I'm really tryna crack off that headboard
And bust it wide open for the right one
'Cause you that one
Yeah, you that one
Like doves in the wind, hey, hey
That pussy like doves in the wind, hey, hey
Pussy like doves in the wind
I will make you beg for it
I wanna see you call out

Sit back and relax your mind, just ride
Sit back and relax, you'll find just why
(Dangerous boy, I wanted to do it all)
Sit back, relax, just ease your mind, just ride
(Unfortunately you couldn't get your shit together)
You are now watching MADtv

We take things, and my influence so far, and then it's out of my hands
And, you know, while as I said it can be scary, it can also be a little bit comforting
Because I've learned that when I get to that point, and I can acknowledge
"Okay, Audrey, that's as much as you can do," I can actually let it
