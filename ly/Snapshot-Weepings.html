		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  See you walking by tonight, make me wanna take a snapshot (Snapshot)
I honestly cannot resist
When you got your body moving like this
But i always stay by my lonely
They ain't my friends ain't my homies
Trust goes with lust and its gone like the wind
Changing the tides and we talking again?

Thought you better than that
Oh, got you wetter than that
Choosing him over me that's in the past

Stuck in my mind its like you are a drug
You are perfection, why you acting smug
You're in denial but my love's proof for ya
What can i do for ya to like me back?
I crack
These thoughts i unpack
I'm stuck in the loop i'm a stupid mess
All of these thoughts in my head cause stress

Why can't i go?
I'm all alone
I must find home
It ain't with your bones

See you walking by tonight, make me wanna take a snapshot (snapshot)
I honestly cannot resist
When you got your body moving like this
But i always stay by my lonely
They ain't my friends ain't my homies
Trust goes with lust and its gone like the wind
Changing the tides and we talking again?

See you walking by tonight, make me wanna take a snapshot (Snapshot)
I honestly cannot resist
When you got your body moving like this
But i always stay by my lonely
They ain't my friends ain't my homies
Trust goes with lust and its gone like the wind
Changing the tides and we talking again?
