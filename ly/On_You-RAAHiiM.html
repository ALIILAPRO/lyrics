		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The way you talking shit is getting hard to hear 
Pain never really comes out clear 
But I can hear it in the tone know you're scared
I can hear It through the your phone it's there 
Talking loud won't make things clear 

I get it feel like you got so much more to say 
Feel like the writing on the walls is fake 
It's getting hard for me to concentrate 
I'd rather put something down on you babe 

On you, on you, on you, on you 
On you, on you, on you, on you
I'd rather put something down on you
On you, on you, on you, on you
On you, on you, on you, on you

You don't ever really make things fair 
You don't ever really make things clear 
At a current disadvantage in here 
Feel like I'm always going to war with your cares 
Like I'm always going to war with your fears 

But, I get it, I get it, feel like you got so much more to say 
Feel like the writing on the walls is fake 
It's getting hard for me to concentrate 
I'd rather put something down on you babe 

On you, on you, on you, on you 
On you, on you, on you, on you
I'd rather put something down on you
On you, on you, on you, on you
On you, on you, on you, on you
