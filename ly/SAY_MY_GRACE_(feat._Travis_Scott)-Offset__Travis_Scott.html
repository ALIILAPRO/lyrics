		<p>
		  Whoa
Shh, whew, whew, whew, whew
Hey

Make room on my plate, I just said my grace and then I ate
Got a particular taste
I just stuffed my pockets and my face
Okay, let's have a debate
We talkin' 'bout poppin', I promise I'm feelin' a way (who?)
I took the bodies up out of my closet
I buried 'em deep and they still in the way

I know some lil' niggas got baptized, trap guys (trap guys)
They can't put the drillin' away (way)
Had to part ways with the sad vibes, bad guy
You might be a villain today (hey)
Ask God, why I didn't get a answer? (Why?)
Why I lose my brother to bullets? (Why?)
Why I lose my grandma to cancer? (Why?)
Why me, God? I need answers (Why?)
Why young niggas straight out Atlanta? (Why?)
Why the judge and the cops tryna jam us? (Why?)
Why I keep gettin' all of these chances? (Why?)
Why me, God? I need answers (hey)
Speak your mind and you might get canceled (canceled)
Pinky ring, and it cost me a Phantom (Phantom)
Whack the witness, the evidence tampered (whack 'em)
Dirty money, the safe is the hamper (dirty money)
Yeah my bitch, she a star, and I stamped her (stamped her)
P.E. Jordan three, that's a sampler (P.E.)
I don't wanna do it, but I gotta do it
Gotta kill you, nigga, if it's me or you (hey)
He got fire, I got fire, nigga, lighter fluid (fire)
Got away from the haters, say Hallelujah (bye)
Shit be crazy, this shit be the closest to you (crazy)
It's okay 'cause they know that I come to do it (hey)
Hold your V up for Virgil, exclusive Louis (V)
Bitches geekin' and tweakin', I hit a U (geek)
Wrist is hittin' and glistenin', this shit a movie (glistenin')
If it's smoke at the door, then I'm tendin' to it (smoke)
Watch when I step, Murakami my belt (hey)
Angel on my shoulder but the devil on the left (devils)
I got a mill', not a mill' for my shelf (million)
I do it alone, I own myself (alone)
Nigga, stay home 'fore your dome get left (baow)
Niggas playin' dirty, hit below my belt (dirty)
I'ma get the bag, do the show myself (show)
Do that shit again, I had to show myself (hey)

Make room on my plate, I just said my grace and then I ate
Got a particular taste
I just stuffed my pockets and my face
Okay, let's have a debate
We talkin' 'bout poppin', I promise I'm feelin' a way (who?)
I took the bodies up out of my closet
I buried 'em deep and they still in the way

I filled up the crib with cars, the halls, with all and all, I'm still havin' space (yeah, space)
Got a particular taste, picky eater, I guess, but I'm still stuffin' my face (yeah, yeah)
She got a natural wrap, like a natural do
Like the blunt, she don't like that shit laced (it's lit, woo)
I was outside of the buildin', I'm ownin' the spot
Want a B, then you gotta have faith (ooh)
I'm in a meditative state 
Ever since we lost bro, ain't really much more I can Take
I pop a ten when it's late, mama told me to pray
I do that 'cause you know I can't play (let's-)
We flip to feel up for real
We got the rides in the back but you know we ain't come here to play
You be up playin' the stakes, I been up playin' abroad with broads and mates (yeah)

Make room on my plate, I just said my grace and then I ate
Got a particular taste
I just stuffed my pockets and my face
Okay, let's have a debate
We talkin' 'bout poppin', I promise I'm feelin' a way (who?)
I took the bodies up out of my closet
I buried 'em deep and they still in the way
