		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not above a love to cash in
Another lover underneath those flashin' lights
Another one of those ruthless nights
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I shoulda guessed that this would happen
I shoulda known it when I looked in your red, hot eyes
Spewin' all your red, hot lies
Yeah, yeah, yeah

What's the worst part of this hell?
I can only blame myself

'Cause I know you're poison
You're feedin' me poison
Addicted to this feelin', I can't help but swallow
Up your poison
I made my choice and
Every night I'm livin' like there's no tomorrow

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Any way you want me, baby
That's the way you got me, I'll be yours
My story's gonna end with me dead from your poison

I got so good at bein' untrue
I got so good at tellin' you what you wanna hear
I disassociate, disappear
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So far beyond difficult to resist another gulp

Yeah, I know it's poison
You're feedin' me poison
I'm chokin' from the taste and I can't help but swallow
Up your poison
I made my choice and
Every night I'm wasted like there's no tomorrow

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Any way you want me, baby
That's the way you got me, I'll be yours
My story's gonna end with me dead from your poison

Poison, I'm drownin' in poison
I'm fillin' up my glass but it's always hollow
Full of poison, I'm sick of the poison
Wish I had something to live for tomorrow
