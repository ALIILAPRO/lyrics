		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't see the meaning 
Of this life I'm leading
I try to forget you 
As you forgot me
This time there is nothing 
Left for you to take
This is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I 
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I 
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

Close to ending it all
I am drifting through the
Stages of the rapture 
Born within this loss
Thoughts of death inside
Tear me apart from the 
Core of my soul

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I 
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I 
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

At times the 
Dark's fading slowly
But it never sustains
Would someone
Watch over me
In my time of need?

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I 
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I 
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

And I 
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I 
Should step out of the rain
Turn away
