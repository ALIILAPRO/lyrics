		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling to pieces, I keep falling to pieces, falling to pieces over you,

But I know in summer the wind will blow,
I know in summer the wind will blow,

Saying it's peaceful when you've been so deceitful,
Is a trait that I hate about you,

But I know in summer the wind will blow,
I know in summer the wind will blow,

And though you'll never change my mind,
Maybe I could let this slide, 

Ooooooooohw

Feeding me ego, is the reason that we go, 
From a zero to a hundred again,

But I know in summer the wind will blow,
I know in summer the wind will blow,

And though you'll never change my mind,
Maybe I could let this slide, 

Ooooooooohw

Falling to pieces, I keep falling to pieces, falling to pieces over you,

But I know in summer the wind will blow,
I know in summer the wind will blow,

Come on!

Falling to pieces, I keep falling to pieces, falling to pieces over you.
