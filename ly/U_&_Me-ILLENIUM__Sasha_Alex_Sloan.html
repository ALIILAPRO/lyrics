		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe
Somewhere on the West Coast
Living on the ocean
With palm trees in the yard

Or maybe
Somewhere in the mountains
Living in a cabin
Where life ain't all that hard

We could run away together
Baby, let's get away fast
We could run away forever
Baby, let's never look, never look back

Let's leave the world behind us
A place that can't be found
Go somewhere only we know
Nothing can stop us now

Let's leave the world behind us
A place they'll never see
Go somewhere only we know
Somewhere for you and me

Maybe
Somewhere in the desert
Living in the valley
Where all the stars come out

Or maybe
Somewhere in the country
In the middle of nowhere
With no one else around

We could run away together
Baby, let's get away fast
We could run away forever
Baby, let's never look, never look back

Let's leave the world behind us
A place that can't be found
Go somewhere only we know
Nothing can stop us now

Let's leave the world behind us
A place they'll never see
Go somewhere only we know
Somewhere for you and me

Somewhere for you and me
