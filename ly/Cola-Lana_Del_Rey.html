		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I got sweet taste for men who are older
It's always been so, it's no surprise

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds
And he's making me crazy (I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds
And he's making me crazy (I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby, yeah

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icies
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side

Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, ah
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
Ooh, oh yeah
