		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're such a strange girl
I think you come from another world
You're such a strange girl
I really don't understand a word

You're such a strange girl
I'd like to shake you around and around
You're such a strange girl
I'd like to turn you all upside down

You're such a strange girl
The way you look like you do
You're such a strange girl
I want to be with you

I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love with you
With you
I think I'm falling
I think I'm falling in
I think I'm falling in love with you

You're such a strange girl
I think you come from another world
You're such a strange girl
I really don't understand a word

You're such a strange girl
I'd like to shake you around and around
You're such a strange girl
I'd like to turn you all upside down

You're such a strange girl
The way you look like you do
You're such a strange girl
I want to be with you

You're such a strange girl
The way you look like you do
You're such a strange girl
I want to be with you
