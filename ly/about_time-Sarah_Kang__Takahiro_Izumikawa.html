		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think about that summer day
When I went on my first date
We danced in an empty parking lot
To a song I since forgot
And the first time I held his hand
I thought this boy could be a man
We must've been watching a movie
I think it was Toy Story 3
As long as you remember me
And all the ways I used to be
A part of me will always be eighteen
And time keeps ticking on, it's true
She'll steal away our youth
But that's how I'll remember me and you
That's how I'll remember me and you
I didn't think much of you
'Til that autumn afternoon
I never would've guessed it would be you
And it was in January
When you finally kissed me
In a dorm room on York Street
And the rest is history
As long as I remember you
And all the things you used to do
A part of you will always be twenty-two
And time keeps ticking on it's true
She'll steal away our youth
But that's how I'll remember me and you
And that's the thing about time
You cannot press rewind
If remembering's all I can do
That's how I'll hold onto you
As long as you and I remember
All the times we shared together
A part of us will never get older
And time keeps ticking on it's true
She'll steal away our youth
But that's how I'll remember me and you
That's how I'll remember me and you
