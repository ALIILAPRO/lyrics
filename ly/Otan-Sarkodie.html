		  (M the one)
Yeah

Man, I've been fighting this battle with demons inside of me
I just want stay in my lane so nobody can bother me
Bitch, I'm too sensitive, nti m3n touchi me ego
Thought I had niggas and someone told me they gon' ride for me
All along all of them be jealous
Fake souls always make me nervous
Outta here, bitch, I'm on my purpose
Pull me down, still am breaking records
I'm on a thousand, but they wanna take me to zero
Realest nigga, only God is my hero

Let your angels cover me every day
Cover me every night
Na otan hunu adooso
I'm on the top and I keep on winning (yeah)
Higher we go
Highest we go dey

Uh, I'm on a different time, only God can judge
Ka me ko commit suicide, I was pushed to the edge
Anytime I smell my blessings, that be when the devil emerge (huh)
My spirit is broken, somebody come take me to church, ah
Mama told me, boy, I'm proud of you (woo)
Don't you let nobody lie to you (yeah)
Jehovah en blessing go carry you
Anywhere you go, the power go follow you
When I was losing the battle you told me to keep on (told me to keep on)
And then you gave me your shoulder to lean on (ah)

Let your angels cover me every day
Cover me every night
Na otan hunu adooso
I'm on the top and I keep on winning
Higher we go (yeah)
Highest we go dey

They counted me out but I came even harder
Ye pia me hy3 f3m but I been screaming louder (woo)
I made all this magic like abracadabra
Nia Ghana fo ay3 me but still aa manpaaba
Can't trust a person who sell out for dollar
Me value ko sro like a vintage Impala
Obiaa nny3 madanfo 'cause I know a lot you niggas be hating 
S3 me kura all this power
You can just stay in your feelings (woo)
Me, I just break all the ceilings (yeah)
I see all you people like miserable semens
Wasting my time just to fight all these demons, uh
Idols go turn to your rivals
Pray and just pick up your Bible
Y'all don't know why you can't get close to Michael (yeah)
Menma nipa mb3n just for my survival (yeah)

Man, I've been fighting this battle with demons inside of me (yeah)
I just want stay in my lane so nobody can bother me (woo)
Bitch, I'm too sensitive, nti m3n touchi me ego (huh)
Thought I had niggas and someone told me they gon' ride for me
All along all of them be jealous
Fake souls always make me nervous
Outta here, bitch, I'm on my purpose
Pull me down, still am breaking records (yeah)
I'm on a thousand, but they wanna take me to zero (take me to zero)
Realest nigga, only God is my hero
