		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I look out, you're warning me
Your thoughts devour my point of view (give it up now)
It's true, I cower when I will speak
So let's get 'round to why

I will be the first in line to open up
So I don't mind to give you up

So let's get 'round to why
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's not draw the line
'Cause I can't make my mind up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right

I will be the first in line to open up 
So I don't mind
I will be the first in line to open up
So I don't mind to give you up

So let's get 'round to why
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right now
So let's not draw the line
'Cause I can't make my mind up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right-

It's unintended but all in vein
It's what I found on my side
You knew I'd pass through, it's all the same
So let's get down to why

The one I need is tied up right now
So let's just wait a while
The one I need is tied up right-
