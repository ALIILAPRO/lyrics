		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time is never time at all
You can never ever leave without leaving a piece of youth
And our lives are forever changed
We will never be the same
The more you change, the less you feel
Believe, believe in me, believe

That life can change, that you're not stuck in vain
We're not the same, we're different
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, so bright
Tonight, tonight

And you know you're never sure
But you're sure you could be right
If you held yourself up to the light

And the embers never fade in your city by the lake
The place where you were born
Believe, believe in me, believe, believe
In the resolute urgency of now
And if you believe there's not a chance 
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, so bright
Tonight, tonight

We'll crucify the insincere tonight (tonight)
We'll make things right, we'll feel it all tonight (tonight)
We'll find a way to offer up the night (tonight)
The indescribable moments of your life (tonight)
The impossible is possible tonight (tonight)
Believe in me as I believe in you
Tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
