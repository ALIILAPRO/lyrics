		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think of me
Think of me fondly
When we've said goodbye
Remember me
Every so often
Promise me you'll try

On that day, that not so distant day
When you are far away and free
If you ever find a moment
Spare a thought for me

And though it's clear
Though it was always clear
That this was never meant to be 
If you happen to remember
Stop and think of me 

Think of August, when the trees were green
Don't think about the way things might have been

Think of me
Think of me waking, silent and resigned
Imagine me, trying too hard to put you from my mind

Think of me
Please say you'll think of me
Whatever else you choose to do
There will never be a day when 
I won't think of you

Flowers fade, the fruits of summer fade
They have their seasons, so do we
But please, promise me that sometimes
You will think 

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Of me
