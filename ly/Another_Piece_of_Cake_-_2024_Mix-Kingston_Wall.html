		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You read all headlines of the day n'wonder what
these papers want to say with news that only
take you away from your own thoughts in new taxes to pay

As long as these people don't smile
All these news are just a waste of time
No use for you to hesitate
'cauze in the end you're just another piece of cake

The wounds that bother you in the past
will follow you as long as you let them last
They were all just lessons for today n'if you
don't learn I'm sure they'll come again.

We cannot move forward if we're stuck in this
madness of bringing yesterday in today n'it's all
just a question of putting it all together and taking it as a lesson for today

No use for you to hesitate
cauz in the end you're just another piece of cake
No don't hesitate ...

And when the King's tone starts to speak
don't fear you're just about to get the key
