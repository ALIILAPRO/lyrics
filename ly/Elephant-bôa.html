		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I was to hold one hand over my face now
Would you know me?
Or would you see the other side of me?
And if you were to notice
There is a plan I've been devising
To go, to go now, far away from here
And I gonna be so brave
And I gonna go so far away

Where are the wise men?
Where have they all gone to
Did they follow the spirit children
Down the road that only they know?
And you and I know that the answer lies
Somewhere deep in the city of skies
We're gonna go there
We're gonna go there
We're gonna see the daylight
And I, gonna fly away now
And I, gonna go where the path runs high

Oh, I'm searching, Oh yeah.

I'm gonna go there, I'm gonna travel
I'm gonna see my through and
You can follow
We can go together
Trunk in hand we're gonna go

Isn't it touching the way the trees hold the leaves
Into the sky
And when the breeze blows
All you can see is the green and gold
You and I know that the city holds, the street night lights
And we're gonna find it
We're gonna find the gold that illuminates our lives
And I, gonna go so far away
And I, gonna see the stars up high

Hear me out, hear me out
I'm searching
Hear me out, yeah

We can go there, we can travel
Over the motorway, over the valley
All the way there with your gentle spirit
I am not afraid
With your gentle spirit
I am not afraid
I am not afraid
I am not afraid
I am not afraid
