		  (Ooh-ooh)
(Ooh)

I won't die if they put me in a casket
I'll be fine 'cause you know I'm always on my own
I'ma try just to get out what I'm trapped in
But my head goes on and it's all I ever known
And it's always so hard for me to put myself first
Can't let nobody take away anything that I deserve
So I'm tryin'
I got dry, but I've been feeling carsick
Hard to get a spotlight when you're in the darkness
Can't let it show, so I gotta stay heartless
Can't trust anyone when they all want this
Swear I'm always in a dark place
And you know it's hard to breathe when I drown again
And I always think about the worst case
Scared to fall behind, always on my mind

And you know that I've been down too much
Dark thoughts in my head won't win
But you know that I've been lost again
I've been wondering
Will this ever get easier?

Will this ever get
Will this ever get easier?
Will this ever get
Will this ever get
I've been wondering
Will this ever get easier?

When it hurts, I've been lyin', sayin' I'm fine
Don't wanna be a burden, but I think I'm losin' my mind
Sometimes it feels like I'm giving up
And when the stress piles up, I think I've had enough
And I can't live without the things I've done
I just wanna find help and peace of mind but life goes on

And you know that I've been down too much
Dark thoughts in my head won't win
But you know that I've been lost again
I've been wondering
Will this ever get easier?

Will this ever get
Will this ever get easier?
Will this ever get
But you know that I've been lost again
I've been wondering
Will this ever get easier?

(Will this ever get easier?)
(Will this ever get easier?)
