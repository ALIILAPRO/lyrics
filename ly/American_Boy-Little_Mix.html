		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy
(Singing, singing, singing)

I met him back when I was out in California, hey
He was playing in a band and she was dancing on a stage
And he says that I'm the one
But she's the one that got away
And he never knew her real name

Oh, and I don't mean to get so caught up
And insecure 'bout all the things you say (say, say, say, say)
Oh, and I don't mean to be jealous
It's just careless me, boy
I must drive you mad

Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy
Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy, my american boy

American, 'merican, 'merican boy
Know it's my American boy
American, 'merican, 'merican boy
Know it's my American boy

So I wanna know who's on your phone
Making me paranoid, making me bad
Making me sad, making me crazy
Making me feel like I needed to ask
I wanna know if you're at home
And if you're at home, baby, are you alone?
Are you alone, answer phone
Oh, baby, no no no

And I don't mean to get so caught up
And insecure 'bout all the things you say (say, say, say, say)
Oh, and I don't mean to be jealous
It's just careless me, boy
I must drive you mad

Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy
Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy (singing, singing, singing), my american boy 

American, 'merican, 'merican boy
Know it's my American boy
American, 'merican, 'merican boy
Know it's my American boy

Singing ooh la la, ooh la la
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
He do

Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart (my American boy)
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy
Singing, singing, singing
Ooh la la, he breaks my heart
I know he thinks about her when he plays guitar
And ooh la la, my American boy (boy, boy)
My American boy

American, 'merican, 'merican boy
Know it's my American boy
American, 'merican, 'merican boy
Know it's my American boy
