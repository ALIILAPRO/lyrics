		  The Gathering Of The Clouds

Searched the whole world
Found I can't compare

(But we're here 'cause we're here
We're here 'cause we're here)
Searched the whole night long
(And there's nothing to fear
No, there's nothing to fear)

(But we're here cause we're here
We're here 'cause we're here)
Found out what's been going wrong
(And there's nothing to fear
No, there's nothing to fear)

Time is not what it would seem
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
The life we live is like a dream
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
Release belief, let it wash over me
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
Let love reveal what I feel
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
What I feel, what I feel, what I feel

Searched the whole world
(Fight for what you believe in
Dare to live your dream
In this life don't be afraid of yourself
Don't be afraid)
Found I can't compare
(Fight for what you believe in
Dare to live your dream
In this life don't be afraid of yourself
Don't be afraid)

Searched the whole night long
(Fight for what you believe in
Dare to live your dream
In this life don't be afraid of yourself
Don't be afraid)
Found out what's been going wrong
(Fight for what you believe in
Dare to live your dream
In this life don't be afraid of yourself
Don't be afraid)

Time is not what it would seem
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
The life we live is like a dream
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
Release belief, let it wash over me
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
Let love reveal what I feel
(All that I've seen, all that I feel
All I could be, is happening to me)
What I feel, what I feel, what I feel
