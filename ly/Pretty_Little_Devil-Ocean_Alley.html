		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was a pretty little liar
Her panties were on fire
When she took your life and tried
To burn it to the ground
And he was too na√Øve to see
The crazy lady she could be
His world was too small to be
Crowded by these lies and trickery

She had a plan to steal his mojo
Her credit's were in Slow-Mo
Moving through the darkness and the
Shadows of the night
And he escaped so gracefully
And who knows who this boy could be
Without this pretty little devil on his back

So run, run, run as fast as you can
The devil woman's coming
And she's gonna make you her man
She's gonna make you her man

There's no escaping what she wanted
And in his head she haunted
Every thought and moment that
He wanted for himself
And she knew just the place you'd be
And so she'd sneak dishonestly
To find the way to tempt and
Fool him in the dark

So run, run, run as fast as you can
The devil woman's coming
And she's gonna make you her man
She's gonna make you her man

She's been talking to herself
And moves on to someone else
She'll be backing off the day
Pretty devil's out to play
