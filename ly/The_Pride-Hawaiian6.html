		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many nights did
I stayed up all night long?
There was a night
I couldn't stop
my thrill There was a night
I was crushed by anxiety
that I couldn't hold on
All the things that made me mad
And all the stupid things
I laughed 'til lose my voice
Every single thing
now it's all a part of what I am
And I'm sure I just can't forget
All the things I have been seen
with my own eyes
all through my life
And all the things
I've been broken with
my own hands through my life
I still have it all inside me
Until today and from now on
It's all so important for me
I won't let go
I just can't forget
There's a bridge can't cross
with no tears
And there's a story can't tell
with no tears
When I close my eyes
I see it all comes back
to me like yesterday
And maybe I guess this song
will be my proof of life
Many bonds are made between
Many lives are made between
And many stars are
gone so far awawy
I'll never gonna forget
what they said
They'll be my pride forever
And forever
I won't forget their pride
I won't forget what they said
That's my pride
There's a bridge can't cross
with no tears
And there's a story can't tell
with no tears
When I close my eyes
I see it all comes back
to me like yesterday
And I guess this life
will be my pride
There's a night can't spend
with no tears
And there's a story can't laugh
with no tears
It wasn't an easy way
But I had some greatest days
I'm still on my way
But my life will be my pride
That's my pride
