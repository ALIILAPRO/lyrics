		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash) yeah
Yeah (go, go)

Yeah, I'm on a whole 'nother vibe
I'm on a whole 'nother high
I've accepted what it is
Fuck it, I'm ready to die
They on a whole 'nother side
No, they ain't in my gang
Can we do somethin' real for once?
Please, just call me my name
Sick and tired of the fame
Sick and tired of the stage
Sick and tired of the shame
Sick and tired of the blame
I got my own fuck-ups
It's generational shit
These marks on me, they permanent
There's no erasing this shit
Got no faith in a bitch
For that, I might blame my mom
I got sweat in my palms
Hope these meds make me calm
Ain't too much that I'm sold on
Can barely see, I'm so gone
Please love me despite me
Baby, just keep

Yeah, keep holdin' on (keep holdin' on)
Whoa, whoa, keep holdin' on (holdin' on)
Whoa, whoa keep holdin' on (keep holdin' on)
Whoa, whoa, keep holdin' on (let's go, let's go)
Yeah, tryna hide how I feel
Way too high off pills
I can't tell what's real
You can tell I'm ill
You can tell I'm hurt
You can tell I'm damaged
If there's anything left
I promise you can have it

There I go with the same shit
Wonder why I'm in the same fit
'Cause I can't never stop workin'
Baby, that's when the pain hits
Say a bar, make the game shift
New heights on the same cliff
I keep promising to change
But all I ever do is shapeshift (let's go, let's go)
Yeah, in my room and I'm pacin'
Take the pills, try to space em'
I don't mean to leave you waitin'
Baby, yeah, I'ma need your fuckin' patience
This a dragon I'm chasin'
And this the Devil I'm racin'
Yeah, I can show you how to shut down
I can show you how to get tough
But askin' me for affection
I'm sorry, baby, that's too much
Plenty tears on my shoulder bone
Keeping hope, I'm gettin' close to home
I'm always right where I should be
So I guess I'll keep

Yeah, keep holdin' on (keep holdin' on)
Whoa, whoa, keep holdin' on (holdin' on)
Whoa, whoa keep holdin' on (keep holdin' on)
Whoa, whoa, keep holdin' on (let's go, let's go)
Yeah, tryna hide how I feel
Way too high off pills
I can't tell what's real
You can tell I'm ill
You can tell I'm hurt
You can tell I'm damaged
If there's anything left
I promise you can have it

Keep holdin' on
Whoa, keep holdin' on
Keep holdin' on (yeah)
Whoa, keep holdin' on
