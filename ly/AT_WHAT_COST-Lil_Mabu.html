		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hahaha

Say no more and all good things end, we all heard that one before
Whoever said that shit better prepare for a war
'Cause I'm good, I'll pass it on to generations and more
As I should, 'cause I'm here, it ain't no stoppin' of course
I started dancin' with my pen, I made the paper my floor
I'm 'bout to be carryin' the game, I better strengthen my core
Are you happy where you at? I said "No bueno, se単or"

If I knew my time was comin', then I'd be waitin' too (I'd be waitin' too)
Dead or alive, I swear to God I'll make it through (I'll make it through)
I lost my brothers to this shit, look to the sky and I salute
I look my brother in his eyes, I almost cried, I miss you too (I miss you too)
I needed help, they slammed the door
Now I don't need shit, they offer favors like I'm poor (favors like I'm poor)
I'm speedin' fast, hope I don't crash
I see red lights and I don't slow (lights and I don't slow)
I hope I make it home
Can't help but look around say this where I, this where I belong
Yeah, but at what cost
Should I have spent time with friends instead of bein' a boss?
Should I have put down the mic and maybe take up lacrosse?
I been tryin' to find myself, and now my childhood's lost
Wish I could put myself in ice, hope I never defrost
I try to call my younger years, but they won't answer my call at all
I love my fam, but it's not showin' at all
I ain't playin' catch with pops or chasin' after a ball, oh God
Wait a minute, I do this for myself
I do this for the people who ain't wanna wish me well
So, I, I gotta stay focused, I can't get knocked off my track
I do this for my so called friends, hatin' behind my back
And those same people been congratulatin' me lately
"Oh my God Mabu, it's so impressive, you've been goin' crazy"
I just smile and shake they hand, it's kinda funny man
Always knew my biggest haters would be my biggest fans

Say no more and all good things end, we all heard that one before
Yeah, whoever said that shit better prepare for a war
'Cause I'm good, I'll pass it on to generations and more
As I should, 'cause I'm here, it ain't no stoppin' of course
I started dancin' with my pen, I made the paper my floor
I'm 'bout to be carryin' the game, I better strengthen my core
Are you happy where you at? I said "No bueno, se単or"

I said "No bueno, se単or"
Are you happy where you at? I said "No bueno, se単or"
