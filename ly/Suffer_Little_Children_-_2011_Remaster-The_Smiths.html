		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over the moor, take me to the moor 
Dig a shallow grave 
And I'll lay me down 

Over the moor, take me to the moor 
Dig a shallow grave 
And I'll lay me down 

Lesley-Anne, with your pretty white beads 
Oh John, you'll never be a man 
And you'll never see your home again 
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for 

Edward, see those alluring lights ? 
Tonight will be your very last night 

A woman said : "I know my son is dead 
I'll never rest my hands on his sacred head"

Hindley wakes and Hindley says : 
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says : 
"Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone"

But fresh lilaced moorland fields 
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death 
Fresh lilaced moorland fields 
Cannot hide the stolid stench of death 

Hindley wakes and says : 
Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says : 
"Oh, whatever he has done, I have done"

But this is no easy ride 
For a child cries : 

"Oh, find me...find me, nothing more 
We are on a sullen misty moor 
We may be dead and we may be gone 
But we will be, we will be, we will be, right by your side 
Until the day you die 
This is no easy ride 
We will haunt you when you laugh 
Yes, you could say we're a team 
You might sleep 
You might sleep 
You might sleep 
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM ! 
Oh, you might sleep 
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM ! 
You might sleep 
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM !" 

Oh Manchester, so much to answer for 
Oh Manchester, so much to answer for 

Oh, find me, find me ! 
Find me ! 
I'll haunt you when you laugh 
Oh, I'll haunt you when you laugh 
You might sleep 
BUT YOU WILL NEVER DREAM ! 
Oh... 
Over the moors, I'm on the moor 
Oh, over the moor 
Oh, the child is on the moor
