		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fade away, let's get lost
You don't have to worry, baby
Let's get lost
Slip away, it's just us
You don't have to worry, baby
Let's get lost

And when the well is drying up
To the bones, to the very last drop
There's no one left, that's on our side

Nothing in the world can tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
When it all comes crashing down 
And our lives are buried underground
Still nothing in the world can tear us apart

Break away, let's get lost
Something's in me calling lately 
I hear it loud
So give tonight one more try
Because nothing lasts forever, baby
So let's get lost

And when the streets are emptied out
We lose our way walking into the dark
The cross we bear is all we've got

Nothing in the world can tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
When it all comes crashing down
And our lives are buried underground
Still nothing in the world can tear us apart

Times can get lonely 
Out in the cold
As long as you're near me
I need you to know

Tear us apart, tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
Nothing in the world can tear us apart
When it all comes crashing down
And our lives are buried underground
Still nothing in the world can tear us apart

Fade away, let's get lost
You don't have to worry, baby
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
