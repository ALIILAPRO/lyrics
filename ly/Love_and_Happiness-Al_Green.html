		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love and happiness, yeah
Something that can make you do wrong, make you do right

Love 
Love and happiness
But wait a minute
Something's going wrong
Someone's on the phone
Three o'clock in the morning, yeah
Talkin' about how she can make it right, yeah
Well, happiness is when, you really feel good with somebody
But nothing wrong with being in love with someone, yeah
Oh, baby, love and happiness
Love and happiness
Love and happiness (love and happiness), oh

I have to say
Love and happiness (love and happiness)
Love and happiness (love and happiness)
You be good to me
I'll be good to you
We'll be together, yeah
We'll see each other
Walk away with victory, yeah, yeah, oh, baby
Love and happiness (love and happiness)
Love and happiness (love and happiness), oh

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Make you do right, love'll make you do wrong
Make you come home early, oh
Make you stay out all night long
The power of love

Wait a minute
Let me tell you
Oh, the power
Power of love
Power of love, power
Make you do right, love'll make you do wrong
Ha, yeah
(Love and happiness, love and happiness)
Say love
(Love and happiness, love and happiness)
Make you want to dance
Love and happiness

Love is, wait a minute, love is
Yeah, walkin' together, yeah, talkin' together
Say it again, say it together, yeah
Say wanna moans
Moan for love, say, hmm
Moan for love, hmm
Moan for love
Talkin' 'bout the power, wait a minuite
