		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hello, girls (hello, Beyoncé)
Hello, fellas (you're pretty swell)
Those petty ones can't fuck with me (why?)
'Cause I'm a clever girl, we snappin'
(Pretty please) toms, please
We wanna welcome you to the Beyoncé Cowboy Carter: Act II, ah
And The Rodeo Chitlin' Circuit
We gon' make it do what it do, ya-ya
Put them hands together

We clappin'
We drummin' 
(Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya) oh, ya-ya-ya 
(Oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya) oh
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya (oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
Ya-ya-ya-ya (oh, ya)
(Ya-ya) B-E-Y-I-N-C-É, ya

My family lived and died in America, hm
Good ol' USA (good ol' USA), shit
Whole lotta red in that white and blue, huh
History can't be erased, ooh-oh
Are you lookin' for a new America? (America)
Are you tired, working time and a half for half the pay? 
Ya-ya (half the pay, ooh-oh)
I just pray that we don't crash
Keep my Bible on the dash, we gotta keep the faith
Wildfire burnt his house down
Insurance ain't gon' pay no Fannie Mae, shit
So hold this holster, pour more liquor, please
Hardworkin' men ain't got no money in the bank, ha, ya-ya
Turn up the vinyl and the radio (radio)
He can't watch the news nowadays, oh (nowadays)
I just pray that he don't crash
Keep this pistol on the dash, he gotta keep the faith

She's pickin' up good vibrations
He's lookin' for sweet sensations
Ladies? (yeah?)
Fuck it

We shakin' (ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
We swimmin' (oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, a-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
We jerkin' (oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, a-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
We twerkin' (oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
You wanna touch it, don't ya?
Come get this genie in a bottle (ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
Come rub it, won't you? (Oh, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
I pop it
I walk it like I talk it (ya-ya-ya-ya-ya)
I got your spurs sparkin'
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya, oh

Let loose
Do what you do, baby, good God
I don't wanna hear no ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
I got you daydreamin'
Put your lips on my lips
And strum me like a guitar
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, you got me movin', boy
You got me, ooh-in', you might know what you're doin'
Put them babies to bed
We sweat out the sheets
Got you up all night and now you don't wanna leave
I can soothe your pain, yeah
When I'm long gone you'll call my name, yeah
World of wind got you insane, yeah
It's givin' me the faith

I'm pickin' up good vibrations, ooh
He's givin' me sweet sensations, oh
(B-E-Y-I-N-C-É, ah)
We gon' bust it down
From Texas (from Texas)
To Gary (to Gary)
All the way down to New York City (New York City)
Give me a kiss
Big daddy, you so pretty (so pretty)

Got these slugs in my mouth when I die don't take 'em out
(Got these slugs in my mouth when I die don't take 'em out) ooh
Baby, if you ain't got no grits, get the fuck up out the South
(If you ain't got no grits, get the fuck up out the South)
Life is comin' at me fast, keep my Bible on the dash
Pistol in my seat just in case I gotta blast
I just wanna shake my ass (have a blast)
Ooh
I just wanna shake my ass (have a blast)
Ooh, we vibratin'
And, lover boy, you're so fine
Ooh, you got me losin' my mind
But you gotta keep the faith
Ohh
We gotta keep the faith 
Oh, vote
Oh, whoa
