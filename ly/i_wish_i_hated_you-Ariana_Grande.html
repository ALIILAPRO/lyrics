		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hung all my clothes in the closet you made
Your shoes still in boxes, I send them your way
Hoping life brings you no new pain

I rearrange my memories
I try to rewrite our life

But no matter how I try to (mm)
And no matter how I want to (mm)
And no matter how easy things could be if I did
And no matter how guilty, I still feel saying it
I wish I hated you
I wish that weren't true
Wish there was worse to you
I wish you were worse to me
Yeah, I wish I hated you

Our shadows dance in a parallel plane
Just two different endings, you learn to repair
And I learn to keep me in one place

So close (so close) and yet so far (so far)
If only we had known from the start

But no matter how I try to (mm)
And no matter how I want to (mm)
And no matter how easy things could be if I did
And no matter how guilty, I still feel saying it
I wish I hated you
I wish that weren't true
Wish there was worse to you
I wish you were worse to me
Yeah, I wish I hated you
