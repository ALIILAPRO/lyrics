		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you in this shit for life? (All of you)
I'll backstab you with a fuckin' knife (All of you)
Don't it just feel right? (And I realized)
Don't you just feel good? (All of you)
Better than you know you should
Even if it's for the night
You wish you could pause time and live this section your whole life

You know that feeling that you said you hate?
Everything great, I push away
Ask an alien to show me the way
And I'm not even from this Earth, I can't stay
Yeah, I wish I could stay
I wish I could stay
I could give you something so great
I could take it away
It's all inside of my hands
But it's all out of my control
And it's something that I hear my soul saying
So I'ma let it take me overboard, if you
Try to tell me something I didn't like, if you
Tell me you did something I didn't like, if you
Keep on telling me a fucking lie, if you
I'ma wish the motherfucker had died, if you
Keep on playing with my fucking time, if you
Chasing that warm feeling inside of you
Always playing both sides, I'm fucking tired of you
You a schizophrenic, I realized it's nine of you

I realized it's nine of you
And I realized you couldn't handle none of this shit
So I'ma give you it anyway
Fuck what the critics say
Fuck what you bitch said
Gemstones like Tuesdays
I'ma take you to the end, I'ma
Take you to the end
Push you to the edge
You way in over your head when you
Go and try to live like this
So I'ma take it to the end
But I can't be you friend
So I'ma show you the other way
That's the way of dead men
