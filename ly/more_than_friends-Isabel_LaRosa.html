		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that we're more than friends
Friends, friends

Crazy
You make me think that I'm crazy
Maybe
Just let your fingertips trace me

My heart's racin' now, I just can't take a breath
I'm catchin' you starin' again
I swear all this shit isn't just in my head
I know that we're more than

Friends, friends, friends
I know that we're more than
Friends, friends, friends

I need
Need your hands on my waist, please
Save me
God, don't let me die waitin'

My heart's racin' now, I just can't take a breath
I'm catchin' you starin' again
I swear all this shit isn't just in my head
I know that we're more than

Friends, friends, friends
I know that we're more than
Friends, friends, friends

Can't keep waitin', bitin' my tongue
Holdin' my breath stuck in my lungs
Feel us changin', comin' undone

Friends, friends, friends
I know that we're more than
Friends, friends 
(I know that we're more than)

Friends, friends, friends
I know that we're more than
Friends, friends, friends
