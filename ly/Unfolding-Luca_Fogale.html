		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me out, the wires are all showing
Sleight of hand is slowing
Everything explained
Further now, from anything absolving
Nothing left to solve and
Nothing left to say

In time, untraced
Any part of this still holding
I am not breaking
I am not broken
I am unfolding
I am not breaking
I am not broken
I am unfolding

Settle in, the ordinary sequence
Scatter all your reasons
And leave the rest behind
Lost to win, everything believed in
Trust the sense to bleed in
Carried to the light

In time, untraced
Every part of this still holding
Cause you are not breaking
You are not broken
You are unfolding
You are not breaking
You are not broken
You are unfolding
You are not breaking
You are not broken
You are unfolding
No, no, you are

You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are
Not breaking
You are, you are
You are, you are
You are, you are
Not breaking
