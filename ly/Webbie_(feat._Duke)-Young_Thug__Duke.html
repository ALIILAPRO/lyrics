		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thugger!
I roll me one, smoke to the face
I roll me one, smoke to the face
Roll up a blunt and I'mma face it (King Slime)

They politickin' 'bout these cases
I told her roll me up a blunt and I'mma face it
Choppa make a man
I've been shootin' out with my neighbors, yeah
My lil niggas tryna trap it out in the vacant, yeah
Patek Philippe they got my wrist and they don't play with that
She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah

Pass me the mothafuckin' lighter
Lil mama overseas, I might Skype her
Nigga checkin' out the squad, tryna bite us
But my hand is way different got the Midas
They do a dream with me, aye do some things with me
Bae drink your lean with me, bae fall asleep with me
Ayy fall asleep, we drive
Just like your life or mines
Let me fuck one more time
And I'll help you write your rhymes

They politickin' 'bout these cases
I told her roll me up a blunt and I'mma face it
Choppa make a man
I've been shootin' out with my neighbors, yeah
My lil niggas tryna trap it out in the vacant, yeah
Patek Phillipe they got my wrist and they don't play with that
She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah

Bad, bad, bad
I'm a player, player, player
I'll pop at your man, man, man
I'll do what I can, know what I'm sayin'?
Guess I'm geeked up
Like an astronaut, I'm off Earth
I'm way in the moon, kickin' shit without a broom
My mama can't lose
I'mma keep her in a fresh car
And I'mma put on them shoes
I'mma keep her so froze up
Yeah I'mma keep her in some jewels
I'mma go 'head and nut in my bitch
I'mma gon' and give her juice
She did two times now, I done told her that was rude
They don't wanna see you win
Nah they want you always to lose
They gon' always want you be stuck with them
They'll never wish you good luck on them
And they'll never wish bad luck either
And I don't know what the fuck to think either
Got a foreign car like a wife beater
Actin' like she like people
Knowin' they don't give two fucks if they're still here
They'll leave her

This politician is so fake
They politickin' 'bout these cases
I told her roll me up a blunt and I'mma face it
Choppa make a man
I've been shootin' out with my neighbors, yeah
My lil nigga been tryna trap out of the vacant, yeah
Patek Phillipe they got my wrist and they don't play with that
She been suckin' dick way before a nigga made it, yeah

Got on mines and I got tired of waitin'
Mama say, "You gonna make it, you gotta be patient"
Came out the hood, trap out the stove out that vacant
Now we flyin' different places, fuckin' bitches all kind of races
I did this shit that they thought I wouldn't do and I made it
I was so down, man it's so fucked up, couldn't make over 80
I lost some friends, that was so fucked up and I know that they hate me
Thugger, he gave me a chance and I had to take it
Used to chop on the block with the .380
Now when I pull up they gotta pay me
I came from nothing more than the 80s
These niggas actors like Patrick Swayze
I gotta get it, I can't be lazy
Didn't have a dime so my mama crazy
Ran up a sack with Thugger, baby
Man this shit so amazing

Patek Phillipe
Cost a hundred bands, man
Clip missin' on it
Then I went and seen Elliott and iced out my Pigalle, you dig
That's on Big Duck, that's on all 6, know I'm sayin'?
I got like a 170, 180 thousand dollar watch, bro
And it glow up green at night
And when the sun hit it on the plane
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I used to do this shit to maintain
'Til I started usin' 14% of my brain
And that left me with 5 stars worth of stains, you dig?
Thugger!
