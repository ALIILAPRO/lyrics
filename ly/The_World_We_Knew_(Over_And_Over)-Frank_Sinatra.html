		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Over and over, I keep going over the world we knew
Once when you walked beside me
That inconceivable, that unbelievable world we knew
When we two were in love

And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold

Now over and over, I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me

And every bright neon sign turned into stars
And the sun and the moon seemed to be ours
Each road that we took, it turned into gold
But the dream was too much for you to hold

Now over and over, I keep going over the world we knew
Days when you used to love me

Over and over, I keep going over the world we knew
