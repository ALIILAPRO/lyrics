		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, (I said) then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby

Boy, look at me in my face
Tell me that you're not just about this bass
You really think I could be replaced
Nah, I come from outer space
And I'm a classy girl, I'ma hold it up
You're full of something but it ain't love
And what we got, straight overdue
Go find somebody new

You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye

I know you lie (lie)
'Cause your lips are moving (moving)
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass), you gave me sweet talk (sweet talk)
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie (lie) 
'Cause your lips are moving (moving)
Baby, don't you know I'm done? (Hey)

If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby (hey)
If your lips are moving, if your lips are moving
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin', baby (hey)

Hey, baby, don't you bring them tears
'Cause it's too late, too late, baby, oh (hey)
You only love me when you're here
You're so two-faced, two-faced, babe (oh)

You can buy me diamond earrings and deny-ny-ny, ny-ny-ny, deny-ny
(Yes, you can, babe)
But I smell her on your collar so goodbye-bye-bye, bye-bye-bye (hey)

I know you lie (lie)
'Cause your lips are moving (moving)
Tell me do you think I'm dumb?
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid) (no, no)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass), you gave me sweet talk (sweet talk)
Saying how I'm your number one
But I know you lie (know you lie) (lie)
'Cause your lips are moving (moving)
Baby, don't you know I'm done?

Come on, say

If your lips are moving (hey, hey), if your lips are moving (hey, hey)
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin'
If your lips are moving (alright now), if your lips are moving
(I wanna hear y'all sing it with me)
If your lips are moving, then you're lyin', lyin', lyin' (here we go)

I know you lie (lie)
'Cause your lips are moving (moving)
Tell me do you think I'm dumb? (oh)
I might be young (young), but I ain't stupid (stupid) (no)
Talking 'round in circles with your tongue
I gave you bass (bass) (you're lips are moving)
You gave me sweet talk (sweet talk) (you're lips are moving)
Saying how I'm your number one (you're lips are moving)
But I know you lie (know you lie) (lie) 
'Cause your lips are moving (moving) (you're lips are moving)
Baby, don't you know I'm done?
