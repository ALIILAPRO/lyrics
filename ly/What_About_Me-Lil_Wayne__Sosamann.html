		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you saw me, would you understand?
That I can't stand you with another man
I see you happy where your life is at
I see you smile, I can't live with that

'Cause what about me? Yeah
I stayed up all night for you
Girl, girl what about me? Yeah
I shut down my life for you
Now you run around with him, and him, and him
How you do that?
How you act like I never held you every night
And now you never call back, please
Girl, girl, what about me?

Oh, tell me do you ever think about it?
Those lonely nights when you 'bout lost it
The only time that you would call
Was just to tell me it's my fault
I let you cry, I let you worry
I let you yell, I let you hurt me
I gave you everything you needed
And now you're gone, gone, gone
Tell me, how you do that to me? Yeah

Girl what about me? Yeah
I stayed up all night for you (yeah)
Girl, girl what about me? Yeah (girl, what about me?)
I shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)
Now you run around with him, and him, and him
How you do that?
How you act like I never held you every night 
And now you never call back, please (please)
Girl, girl what about me?
Oh girl, girl, girl what about me? Me?

Didn't think about me
When I'm flying OT, I be up in them streets
You tellin' me that you gon' leave
Hittin' my phone with the beep
Knock it out, baby, creep
Oh, 'cause I just wanna see you smile
Did none of them tears ain't for you, baby
Them they ain't matchin' yo' style
I'm kickin' this flav with yo' sauce
And counting up loot
Plus, I'm thinking 'bout you
And all of the things that we used to do
And all of the shit we went through
Girl I don't want you with no other dude

Girl what about me? Yeah (girl, what about me?) 
I stayed up all night for you (I stayed up all night) 
Girl, girl what about me? (what about me, girl? Yeah, what about me, girl?)
I shut down my life for you (I shut down my life)
Now you run around with him, and him, and him
How you do that? (how, girl?)
How you act like I never held you every night 
And now you never call back, please (please)
Girl, girl, girl what about me? Me? (yeah, what about me?)
Oh-ho-oh
