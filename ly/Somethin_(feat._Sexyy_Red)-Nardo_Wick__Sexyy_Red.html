		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's somethin' about ya, girl
That just makes my head wanna twirl
Oh, you got me wantin' to tell all them other girls
"There's nothin' else better on this world"
The moment I seen her-

It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it

That lil' shit got my head twirlin', what she tryna do to me?
Real short shorts, I see the dimples in her booty meat
And she not no borin' one, what she do excite me
Is you her lil', "Whoopty-whoop," uh, bitch, I might be
It's somethin' 'bout her swag
It's somethin' 'bout her ass
It's somethin' 'bout when we fuck, the way she call me dad
It's somethin' 'bout her- (uh)
It's somethin' 'bout her- (yeah)
It's somethin' 'bout her super grippin', take a nigga breathe
I want the cookies in yo' cookie jar, come and give me kiss (mwah)
That 'oochie make a nigga sing, "La-la-la"
I got that 'oochie in a headlock (yeah)
Run away (yeah), won't get far (yeah)
And I go to war 'bout it, fire, fire, fire, fire (go Sexyy, go Sexyy, go Sexyy)

It's somethin' 'bout me that he loves
Save my number as, "Sexyy Thug"
Real Northside bitch, all my life been chuckin' Blood (on Blood)
Squeeze my booty cheeks every time he go to give me hugs (ooh)
I don't play about my man, any bitch can catch a slug (grraow-baow)
Let me meet his mama, yeah, my baby really fuck with me
Never had a bitch better than me, and he in love with me (mwah)
Real deal killer, but I got the nigga cuddlin'
Ass super fat and my titties sittin' lovely (it's Sexyy)
His lil' "Whoopty-whoop," my lil' "Yeah-yeah" (that's my bae)
Dick fire and a nigga got some fire head (it go crazy)
Niggas tryna holler at me, tell 'em, "Go to bed"
And he ain't cheatin' on me, all you bitches dead (ho)
Have a hood nigga singin', "Fa-la-la"
Let him hit the coochie like, "Grrah, grrah, grrah"
Swervin' all in traffic gettin' freaky in the car (yoom)
If he try to leave me, then it's, "Bop, bop, bop"

It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
It's somethin' 'bout my bitch I love, I can't put my finger on it
