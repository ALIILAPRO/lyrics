		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was at a house party and Marshmello showed up
He was acting crazy, he started all these moshpits
And then he took his helmet off
Underneath his helmet, he's a cyclops

Marshmello
Yeah
Subtronics

I was at a house party
And Marshmello showed up

Subtronics
Yeah
Bullseye

I was at a house party and Marshmello showed up
He was acting crazy, he started all these moshpits
And then he took his helmet off
Underneath his helmet, he's a cyclops
