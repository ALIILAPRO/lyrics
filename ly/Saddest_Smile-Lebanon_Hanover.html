		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People say they like me
But how can I believe
When they also like you
And you're exactly the one I hate
People sometimes say that I'm quiet creative
But it's so confusing
They say it to you as well

I will stay forever alone
In my deep and dark thoughts
In the corner of the bar
Waiting for a good talk
And at some point, you ask me why
I'm the one with the saddest smile
I'm the one with the saddest smile
I might come across very disillusioned
But I do crossword searches all night
You're living your lives beneath
The LCD light
Where real love serves you day by day

The lack of sensitivity in you is so ugly
So ugly it makes you so ugly
So ugly you're so ugly
So ugly and I know

I will stay forever alone
In my deep and dark thoughts
In the corner of the bar
Waiting for a good time
And at some point, you ask me why
I'm the one with the saddest smile
I'm the one with the saddest smile
I'm the one with the saddest smile
I'm the one with the saddest smile
