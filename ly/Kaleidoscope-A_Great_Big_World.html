		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My life
My life was black and white and I believed it
I believed it
My eyes
My eyes looked at the world but couldn't see it
I couldn't see it

You're like the thing that makes the universe explode
Into the colors of a world I've never known
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

Violets and purples
Diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute
You've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope

Hey la nah nah oh
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Hey la nah nah oh
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

Tonight
The stars are in your eyes and I surrender
I surrender
Tonight
Our hands against the wind, we are forever
We are forever

It all looks better when I see it with you here
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

Violets and purples
Diamonds and circles
You're my kaleidoscope
I love every minute
You've got me in it
You're my kaleidoscope

Hey la nah nah oh
You keep turning, keep turning my life around
Hey la nah nah oh
You keep turning, keep turning my life around

I closed my eyes to the orange skies
Living all of my days the same
Then you came along, and you sang your song
And the whole world around me changed
