		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

All this jewelry ain't no use when it's this dark
It's my favorite part, we see the lights, they got so far
It went too fast, we couldn't reach it with our arms
Wrist on a wrist, a link of charm (oh yeah)
Laying, we're still a link apart
It's like we could die here all young
Like we could dye hair all blonde
If we could see in twenty twin
Twice we could see it 'til the end

Put that spotlight on her face (spotlight)
Put that spotlight on her face (ah, yeah)
We gon' pipe up and turn up (pipe up)
We gon' light up and burn up (burn up)
Mama too hot like a (like what?)
Mama too hot like a furnace (furnace)
I got a hundred G's in my Goyard (G's)
My diamonds gon' shine when the lights dark (shine)
You and I take a ride down the boulevard (yeah)
And your friends really wanna break us apart
Good Lord

(Offset!) Good gracious
Starin' at my diamonds while I'm hoppin' out a spaceship
Need your information, take vacation to Malaysia
You my baby, the paparazzi flashin' crazy
She swallowed the bottle
While I sit back and smoke gelato
Walk in my mansion, twenty thousand painting, Picasso
Bitches be dippin', dabbin' with niggas like a nacho
Took off her panties, diamonds dancin' like Rick Riccardo
She havin' it
Went to college workin' on her bachelor
I know you got a past, I got a past, that's in the back of us
Average, I'mma make a million on the average
I'm ridin' with no brain, bitch, I'm out of it

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this?
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear

I might empty my bank account (ooh)
And buy that boy with a pipe (ooh, yeah)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might (slide)
Empty my bank account (ooh, slide)
And buy that boy with a pipe (slide, yeah)
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might
