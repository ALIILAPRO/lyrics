		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Round and round
Round we go
Where it stops?
Nobody knows it yeah

Side to side, baby
Back and forth
God above and the devil below him

You've got your reasons
And I've got my wants
Still get that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Yes, too old to die young now
Still the good lord might lay me down

Round and round
Round we go
What it stops?
Nobody knows it

Side to side, baby
Down and crawl
God above and the devil below him

You've got your reasons
And I've got my wants
Still got that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Yes, too old to die young now
Still the good lord might lay me down

To lay me down
To die young now

Too old to die young now

Above or below the ground

Still the good lord might lay me down
