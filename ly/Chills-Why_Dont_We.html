		<p>
		  Coat laying on the floor
Long december nights are what I've been waitin' for
Pull my hand close to the fire

Shiverin', I'm shiverin', I can't stop
Give me the look, you know the one I want
I've been waiting for
It's so cold, it's so cold, yeah

I got chills when you walk
Chills when you talk
Chills every time you say my name
It's the way that it feels when we touch
I can't get enough
Love got me frozen in place

Baby, I got (chills)
Ooh, baby, I got (chills)
Ooh, baby, I got chills

Arms wrapped around my neck ('round my neck)
You keep me warm
You are the spark igniting me again
Oh, I can't get enough of you, I'm (you, I'm)

Shiverin', I'm shiverin', I can't stop
Give me the look, you know the one I want
I've been waiting for, ooh
It's so cold, it's so cold, yeah (it's so cold, it's so cold, yeah)

I got chills when you walk
Chills when you talk
Chills every time you say my name

It's the way that it feels when we touch
I can't get enough
Love got me frozen in place

Baby, I got (chills) (baby, I got chills)
Ooh, baby, I got (chills) (ooh, baby, I got chills)
Ooh, baby, I got chills (I got chills, I got)

I think about you every second of the day
My heart used to be so cold, the world used to be so grey
And I know seasons change but it felt like you never would
No one seemed to understand me but you understood
We could be royalty, I'll be your prince, yeah
Give you that loyalty, don't matter the distance
I'mma love you for who you are 'cause I like that you're different
Tell me anything you wanna say and I'll sit back and listen

And I know we're living busier days
And life is moving so fast, I feel like everything's changing
But when we kiss, I feel a jump in my heart
The same feeling that I felt from the start
Yeah, baby, I got

I got (chills) (I got chills, no, oh no no, oh no no)
Ooh, baby, I got (chills) (ooh yeah, I got chills)
Ooh, baby, I got chills (ooh yeah, I got chills)
(Oh woah, oh woah)

Ooh-ooh
Ooh, baby, I got chills
