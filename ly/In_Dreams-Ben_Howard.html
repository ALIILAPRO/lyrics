		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always a riddle in the world she said
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing to wonder the way we come to be
Oh, it's a big old place for me, yeah, it's a big old world indeed
Everyone is killing me and everything conspires

Oh, in dreams I have watched it spin
Seen a violent crack of atoms where all light comes in
Oh, in dreams I have lain in sin
Just to be the cracked and the cared for

How can I ask, ask for more?

Always a riddle in the world she said
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing to wonder in the way we come to be
Oh, it's a big old place for me, yeah
It's a big old world indeed
Kicking my heels and wondering how I've been here so long

Oh, in dreams I have watched it spin
Seen a violent crack of atoms where all light comes in
Oh, in dreams I saw Aesop's kin
Just a carcass of a man, I belong inside his skin

Mmm

Where to, where to begin?

I live alone, I live a lonely life without you

And I may be troubled but I'm gracious in defeat
Oh, I may be troubled but I'm gracious in defeat
