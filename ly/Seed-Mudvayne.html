		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fall down
Can't pick myself up off the ground
Head down
I see catastrophe 
And it's right in front of me

Mother, father, please don't me choose between you
I love both of you
Mother, please, all I want to be is just little me
Father, please, all I want to be is you're son
No fair

Trespass the tiny mind of a child
Despair
In my world surrounds me
It's immerse me
Rips right through me
Remember

The day they told me, I'm so scared
Suffer
My wounds not healing
Mother, please, all I want to be is just little me
Father, please, all I want to be is your son

Sometimes
In dark my mind will roam
To a time 
I spent alone
As a child, as a small boy
As a child, as a small boy

I remember times as a child I knew
As for my love, I still see it
I remember times as a child I knew
Too many moralisists in my life
I knew times as a child I know
I looked into my father's eyes
I remember times as a child when I looked
And I screamed

I still scream, and I say
Look at what you did to me 
See what you did to me 
Look at what you did to me
See what you did to me
Look at what you did to me 
See what you did to me
Look at what you did to me
See what you did to me
Look at what you did to me
See what you did to me
Look at what you did to me 
See what you did to me
Look at what you did to me
See what you did to me

I died that day
All I want to say

Mother, please, all I want to be is a little deep inside of you
Father, please, all I want to be is a little back inside of you

What now?
Fuck you!
What now?
Fuck you!
What now?
Fuck you!
What now?
Fuck you! 
What now?
Fuck!
