		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now

Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends

Ooh, babe
Don't leave me now

How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

Ooh, babe, don't leave me now

How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe
Why are you running away?
Ooh, babe
