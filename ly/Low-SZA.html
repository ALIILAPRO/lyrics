		  (Tell 'em to shoot)
(I'm out the loop, I'm out of range)
(Oh, I stay out the way)

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet
Keep it on the lowski, on the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit

I need you to get the fuck out my space (yeah)
Replacement's on the way, please don't play
That pussy's feelin' like a great escape (oh-oh)
I need a new trick, old dogs don't change
I'm fuckin', I ain't makin' love no more (pussy)
You got a new bitch, what the fuck you cryin' for?
I'm movin' selfish, callin' all my favorite hoes

You know how to reach me every time that it plays in your mind
With a rush that feels like, we're commitin' a crime
Know where you belong, I'm gon' save you a spot
You can't be outside, 'cause the block is too hot
And I'm all on your mind
Wherever you are, don't call me (let's go)

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin' (alright)
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence (yeah, yeah)
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent (oh, yeah)
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet (ooh)
Keep it on the lowski, on the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit (let's go)
Keep it on the lowski, on the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit

I need total confidential, privacy (yeah)
Don't want no one thinkin' I'm a groupie (it's lit)
Time zones changed, now we on the first class jet (straight up)
Don't work my nerves, you know I get moody
We fuckin', we ain't makin' love no more
You talk that talk, but it don't match up with your stroke

Wherever you are, whatever you need
Don't call me, don't worry 'bout me

Got another side of me, I like to get it poppin'
But these bitches in my business got me outchea choosin' violence (alright)
If you see me out in public, you don't know me, keep it silent
In the bedroom, I be screamin', but outside, I keep it quiet
Keep it on the lowski, on the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit
Keep it on the lowski, on the lowest of the lowest
Wanna see if you can keep it like nobody know shit (let's go)

Fuck you, real shit
I wasn't even on, "Fuck you"
But you tryna make me look stupid
I'll slap the dog shit out you, stop playin' with me
