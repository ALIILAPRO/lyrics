		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a feeling, being's believing
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life

All alone I have cried
Silent tears full of pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

First when there's nothing
But a slow glowing dream
That your fear seems to hide
Deep inside your mind

What a feeling (what a feeling), being's believing (being's believing)
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion (what a feeling) and make it happen (being's believing)
Pictures come alive you could dance right through your life

Now I know, I got the chance
To reach the top, is so intense
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Now I hear the music
Close my eyes I am rhythm
In a flash it takes hold
Of my heart

What a feeling (what a feeling), being's believing (being's believing)
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion (what a feeling) and make it happen (being's believing)
Pictures come alive you could dance right through your life

I feel the passion, deep inside
I got strength, I got pride
In a world made of steel
Made of stone

Dancing, till the end of this night
Like now or never, got strength and pride
When I feel the music I'm losing control
Of my mind, my body, my heart and my soul
Let's go, make this dream come true
For me and for you, we can dance right through
You can have it all, there's no price to pay
Your feelings will show you the way

What a feeling (what a feeling), being's believing (being's believing)
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life
Take your passion (what a feeling) and make it happen (being's believing)
Pictures come alive you could dance right through your life

What a feeling (what a feeling), being's believing (being's believing)
What a feeling (what a feeling), being's believing (being's believing)
What a feeling 
I can have it all now I'm dancing for my life
What a feeling
