		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Only you would do this
On the one night out with my friends
While pretending you don't exist, there you are (are, are)
When you showed up unexpected, you envisioned it romantic
In reality it's the last thing that I want (want, want)

You drove a hundred miles then start to cry
Why?
To tell me that you've really changed this time

You want me back?
Oh, not again
I count one, two, three, four, five times, that you need a second chance
You wanna laugh? (Ah, ah)
And make amends? (Ah, ah)
I did one, two, three, four, five times, but I won't let you back in
Oh, not again (ah, ah)
Not again (ha)
Not again (again)

Only would act like
You don't deserve every goodbye
Maybe we should do a deep dive in our past (our past)
Should we start with the fact, I wasn't your one and only?
I refused to see the truth every time you would've showed me
Every conversation made about yourself
You're only interested now that I'm with somebody else

You lied and tried to hurt me deep inside
Why?
This just so ironic, I can't help but smile

You want me back?
Oh, not again
I count one, two, three, four, five times, that you need a second chance
You wanna laugh? (Ah, ah)
And make amends? (Ah, ah)
I did one, two, three, four, five times, but I won't let you back in
Oh, not again (ah, ah)
Not again (ha)
Not again (again)

Don't think I don't think about us
That summer we spent, kids playin' with water
Don't think I don't still reminisce
'Cause the story is good
But we all know how it ends

Now you're back, let me guess
You'll say the past is in the past
And maybe this time's different

You want me back? (Ah, ah)
Oh, not again (ah, ah)
I count one, two, three, four, five times (times), that you need a second chance
You wanna laugh? (Ah, ah)
And make amends? (Ah, ah)
I did one, two, three, four, five times, but I won't let you back in
Oh, not again (ah, ah)
Not again (ha)
Not again (again)

Oh, not again (ah, ah)
Not again (ha)
Not again (again)
