		<p>
		  Hey, mm

We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright, yeah

Now, you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now, you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hunnid isn't enough
Yeah, a hunnid just isn't enough

Oh hey, lucky girl, okay
What you want? Andal√©
Got ice on the way
Put stones in your face
Calamari, ocean lake
Split a millions four ways
My pavilion, Saint-Tropez, yeah, alright
Why is it so hard for you to cry when we rich?
I put the sideline in front 'cause I can't argue 'bout shit
I told God, protect my life 'cause I'm gon' come in that shit
You know I, you know I
She won't fasten up her seatbelt when we ride
Bought the girl a two-story penthouse in the Big Apple like a pie
She was tryna tear me down with all her words, but they were lies
But I let her get away with it 'cause sometimes she wanna die, yeah, yeah

We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (alright, alright)
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (alright, alright), yeah

Now, you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now, you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hunnid isn't enough
Yeah, a hunnid just isn't enough

I'm on my own
Get high with me, we'll levitate
Get high with me for brighter days
Oh, smile, let me spy the frame
I'm so lit, it could start the campfire
Shorty, where your man? Let me stand by ya
Well, mister esquire
seen a fresh attire do a spin-out in my fresh tire
Red stones, I'm a vampire, it might petrify ya
Uh, whole city goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Whole city goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Uh, new semi goin' dump, dump, dump
Four-fizzy on the pump, pump, pump

We got forty-five bitches just livin' it up (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Been too damn long without a sip of my cup
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (alright, alright) (yeah)
Don't worry 'bout 12, no, they ain't showin' up
Rocky came with the shots, Thug came with the blunts (just livin' it up)
Sayin' one's too many, hunnid isn't enough, alright (alright, alright), yeah

Now, you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Now, you see we goin' dumb, dumb, dumb
Yeah, one's too many, hunnid isn't enough
Yeah, a hunnid just isn't enough
