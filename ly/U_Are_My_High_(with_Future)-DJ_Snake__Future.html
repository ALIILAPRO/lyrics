		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (Pluto, Hendrixx)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (DJ Snake)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (Freebandz Gang)

You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?
You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?

I needed space, baby
Go up to space, baby (high)
I'ma need space, baby
I'm goin' out to space, baby (baby)
I need you arrogant, I need you confident
And I need your promises, babe
I've been searchin' for the right one
Introduce you to Jimmy Choos shoes
Happy belated, yeah
Check the commodity, hottest commodity
Biggest whoever, whenever
She the baddest in the city
Know what comin' with it
Stackin' the liberty, tall as the Statue of Liberty
Hand you the Benz key, hand you the Lamborghini
You elevated, physically, spiritually
I'm tryna love you, tryna boost your confidence
I'm tryna spoil you, girl
I put the big rocks on the seven figure
Bubble bath in the tub, I see you, I see you

All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (you, you are my high)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (do you hear me, love?)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (you, you are my high)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (do you hear me, love?)

All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (you, you are my high)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (do you hear me, love?)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (you, you are my high)
All these girls in the club I got my eyes on you (do you hear me, love?)

You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?
You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?
You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?
You, you are my high
Do you hear me, love?

('Cause baby, long time)
(Long time, long time)
(Whoa, whoa-whoa)
(Long time, long time)
(Long time, long time)
(Whoa, whoa-whoa)

All these girls in the club
All I see is you, all I see is you (you)
All these girls in the club (high)
I see you, I see you (do you hear me, love?)
All these girls in the club (you)
All I see is you, all I see is you
All these girls in the club (high)
I see you, I see you (do you hear me, love?)

Sprung out on these baddies and money (you, high)
Sprung out on bad bitches and money (do you hear me, love?)
Sprung out on bad bitches and money, money (you, high)
Sprung out on bad bitches and money (do you hear me?)
