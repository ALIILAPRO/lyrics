		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was off the drugs, I was off the drinks, I was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, that shit is nice

It just don't look like this
If you living carefree then you probably don't look like us
Damn nigga let me cook right quick, on the beach
Couple niggas we was cool and it's just about dusk
Shawty never smoked kush like this
On fire, it's music playin', grindin' on me
You know I had to push right back, reflex, respect
No suspect shit, came late
Goofy niggas missed the sunset
We ain't even give a fuck got the backwoods though
Dropped those niggas would've been upset
Only hit it two times 'cause I know that the papers more of her speed she could fuck with
And I like that shit, she don't duck shit but we was cool
And I said we the one smoke some when the cops popped up
It was pop smoke, niggas proceeded to get on that fuck shit
I ain't worried 'bout dyin' for speaking my mind, they keep on callin' it tough shit
I ain't do too much, just rough shit
Whole time that really is way too much shit
Playin' that shit right, it's some tough shit
And they know just which one to fuck with
It's just some shit we stuck with

We was off the drugs, we was off the drinks, we was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, will you ride or die

Damn nigga, let me breathe
Damn nigga, let me cook
Damn family, give me space
So quick to shoot, no Devin Booker
Can't even look me in my face
Can't play it straight, these niggas crooks
They player hate, I'm on my shit
Pulled me over 'bout my whip
Like "How you get it?"
Bitch I bought it, took my ticket for the tints
That might not seem too intense
But I ain't with this in two months
The first day back, they on some shit
I can't let 'em steal my joy
See who my niggas is fuckin' with
Heard the whole squad at the beach
Guessin' we'll pull up and shit

We be off the drugs, we be off the drinks, we be off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, be with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, that shit is nice
Damn

We was off the drugs, we was off the drinks, we was off the vibes
Got nothin' to hide, I'm with the squad, don't make me throw it up
She by my side, we bonafide, will you ride or die?

Damn nigga, let me breathe
Damn nigga, let me cook
Damn nigga, give me space
Damn nigga, let me breathe
Damn nigga, let me cook
Damn family, give me space
Quick to shoot, no Devin Booker
Can't even look me in my face
