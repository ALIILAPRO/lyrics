		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Having a problem, turn on the TV
Got too much money, give it to me.
I'll say what you wanna hear,
Do what you think I should.
'Cause I'm on your side,
Don't be misunderstood.
Will I retain my sanity?
Or tumble into vanity?
Effect all of Humanity,
You will pay.

Reach out for something, escape reality.
Insane suicide, pay the penalty.
Don't see what's the final move,
On how to play the game.
Don't think you'll end up like them.
Don't think that you're the same.
Will I retain...

Murder you justify, so your hands are clean.
Carry out the task you set,
Homage to the green.
Taking life without a care,
Sadist of a kind.
Making you into a man,
A man without a mind.
Will I retain...

Do I control my destiny,
Or there's a higher authority,
That commits atrocity.
I fear for humanity.
