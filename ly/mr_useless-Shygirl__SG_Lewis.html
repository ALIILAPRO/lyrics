		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never needed you
Never needed all these pieces of my heart
Never needed you
Never needed Mr. Useless from the start

So don't waste your time or your energy
I'm the best I've ever been and I'll ever be
If I cross your mind, just don't think of me
Taking care of anything that I need, baby (lovin' insane)
So don't waste your time or your energy
I'm the best I've ever been and I'll ever be (lovin' insane)
If I cross your mind, just don't think of me (lovin' insane)
Taking care of anything that I need, baby (lovin', feel it now)

Never needed you
Never needed all these pieces of my heart
Never needed you
Never needed Mr. Useless from the start
Never needed you
Never needed, just a healing from my love
Never needed you
Never needed, promise me you're goin' far

So don't waste your time or your energy
I'm the best I've ever been and I'll ever be
If I cross your mind, just don't think of me
Taking care of anything that I need, baby

Never needed you
Never needed all these pieces of my heart
Never needed you
Never needed, promise me you're gonna call
