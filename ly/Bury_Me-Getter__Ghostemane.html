		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But I bet you motherfuckers rep, no set
No "rata tat tat"
But I'm 'bout to take life back
Never turn my back and never
Let you run it back
I'd rather be a fuck up all for
Saying that I never moved for that
Ayy (Ayy) , Ayy (Ayy)
Fuck the face with the mace off
A God who fell from grace
Watch me burning at the stake, ayy (Ayy)
I don't really want to be the one to tell
You but I really gotta say you a lame
Boy you want to beat me? give me way
Fuck faith throw my body up in a
Volcano I'm liable to incinerate
(Liable to incinerate)
Psilocybin' melt my mind, it make me think
(It make me think)
Left everything, Blackmage
I will end up a name by Crowley

I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna s–gun cocking
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight

Damn know I, know I flex ouu
Ye- yeah, ouu damn
Watch me burning at the stake ye- yeah, ouu

Ro-ro-rope on my neck, no set to rep
Fuck my breath
Jump to my death, broke my neck
Snap back, crack promise you won't bury me
Nail me up and light me
Watch me light the night up
With the fire up in the sky
I want to let it out
Re-ready to die (Ready to die)
Better my life and tell
Myself I'm really living
When the people they'd all
Make it some misery, ayy
Take me back to putting tabs upon my tongue
I'm losing sleep, but that's okay
I got nowhere to go

I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna s–gun cocking
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight
I don't wanna sleep tonight

Damn know I, know I flex ouu
Ye- yeah, ouu damn
Watch me burning at the stake ye- yeah, ouu
