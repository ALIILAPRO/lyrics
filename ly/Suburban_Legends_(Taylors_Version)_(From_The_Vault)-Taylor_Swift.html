		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turning out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion walking in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries with the pages ripped out
I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium and I can still see you now

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
I know that you still remember
We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

Tick-tock on the clock
I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore
I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore
And my whole life's ruined
Tick-tock on the clock
I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash to the shore
I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore
And I always knew it
That my life would be ruined
