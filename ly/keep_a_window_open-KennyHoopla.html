		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fog of war lingers from past souls
And a blanket of static down your throat
You know, the dog wakes up only when you do
Kinda sad to die this young, I know

But a secret
Is a secret

Keep your humility and wet dreams of community
As you walk into a grand applause
Oh, I smell a sitcom
Laughing at my own jokes
'Cause I'm lonely when I'm not alone
It's goodbye at hello, just keep a window open for me

Hey babe, I know it's just business
You promised me it's mental illness
Smells just like teen spirit
No more original thoughts

And a collared shirt is timeless you'd say
Another day, a different heavy suitcase
I just happened to dodge the kicks with my face
I will cry if I blink

Talkin' about real life
Wanna talk about real life

Keep your humility and wet dreams of community
'Cause you walk in to a grand applause
Oh, I smell a sitcom
Laughing at my own jokes 
'Cause I'm lonely when I'm not alone
It's goodbye at hello, just keep a window open for me

Keep a window open for me
