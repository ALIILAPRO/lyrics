		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the savages
Eating you alive
The original
Villains in the night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We are the savages, we are the savages

Out on the cringe of society's where we lie
Because we're lethal liabilities 'til we die
Won't heed the call of the law won't follow the pack
Because the sound of the saw is our soundtrack

Hey, hey, hey
This is our battle call
(Mess with the horns and you get the devil)
Hey, hey, hey
You're not invincible
(Mess with the horns and you get the devil)

We are the savages
Eating you alive
The original
Villains in the night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We are the savages, we are the savages

Along the cringe of society is where we lie
We're lethal liabilities 'til we die
Stay on your side of the tracks if you know what's good
Because you won't make it out of our neighborhood

Hey, hey, hey
This is our battle call
(Mess with the horns and you get the devil)
Hey, hey, hey
You're not invincible
(Mess with the horns and you get the devil)

We are the savages
Eating you alive
The original
Villains in the night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We are the savages, we are the savages

We are the savages
Eating you alive
The original
Villains in the night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We are the savages, we are the savages

We are the savages
Eating you alive
The original
Villains in the night
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
We are the savages, we are the savages

Hey, hey, hey
This is our battle call
(Mess with the horns and you get the devil)
Hey, hey, hey
You're not invincible
(Mess with the horns and you get the devil)
