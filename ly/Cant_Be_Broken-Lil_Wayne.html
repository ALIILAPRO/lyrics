		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken

They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I waive the deuce
In 1982, my momma take me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw
Twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down and I can't hit the brakes for you (err)

You cannot break down what can't be broken
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen (yeah)
When all of the lights, they get low (low)
And all of the curtains they close (they close)
You cannot break down (you can't) what can't be broken

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code
(Can't be broken)

I ain't finna break or fix the brakes
You hear me late, I'm laughing in your face
Now, fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking 'icky, watching Ricky Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q & A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

You cannot break down what can't be broken (G-code)
Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains they close
You cannot break down what can't be broken (Uhh)

G-code, G-code, we can't break the G-code
We bros (can't be broken)
We bros, we bros, we can't break for these hoes, G-code
(Can't be broken)
