		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love dies young and there's no resuscitation
Once it's done, no regeneration
It's a losing game that'll make you play
Your hand against your chest
Love dies young

Love dies young and there's no reanimation
Once it's gone, no regeneration
It's a bitter kiss that'll make you wish
You never had a taste

Love dies young, oh
Love dies young, oh
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love's so dumb so what's the fascination
Leaves you numb with a nasty reputation
When you lose your head and lights go out
You'll never be the same

Love dies young, oh
Love dies young, oh
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Never-ending cemeteries, funeral parades
All your dreams are buried in their place

Love dies young, oh
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love dies young, oh
Love dies young, oh
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
