		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My reputation says that I fall too fast
They try to twist it, try to make it sound bad
But I don't care, no I don't care
I've broke some hearts and had my heart broken too
And that's the risk I took when I fell for you
But I don't care, no I don't care

This is just the way I am

Sorry I call again when you don't pick up
And tell you you're beautiful but probably too much
I tried but I can't treat ya like the rest of LA
Oh, it's just not in my DNA to love you only halfway

I wanna hold your hand in front of my friends
Say what I'm feelin' and not have to pretend
That I don't care, no, I don't care
I wanna brag about you when you're not around
Hear your name next to mine 
'Cause I like the way it sounds

I'm sorry I call again when you don't pick up
And tell you you're beautiful but probably too much
I tried but I can't treat ya like the rest of LA
Oh, it's just not in my DNA to love you only halfway
Love you only halfway (I know)
Love you only halfway (oh)
Love you only halfway

This is just the way I am

I'm sorry I call again when you don't pick up
And tell you you're beautiful but probably too much
I tried but I can't treat ya like the rest of LA
Oh, it's just not in my DNA to love you only halfway
Love you only halfway (I know)
Love you only halfway (oh)
Love you only halfway
