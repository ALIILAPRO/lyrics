		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""I live surrounded by cherished memories I have a weakness for collecting them Alphabetize As far as I recall my childish rituals Icons of that world Always filled my shelves and heart  Now I shelter from the rain Hole up in my cage You don't have to think too much today They filled in for your brain  Curled up Deprived Curled up Deprived I shut away  In a world of synonyms And handwritten notes My own puppet performances Endless bedtime stories I could touch the moon And switch off the sun I could have my dreams And dream about better times  Now I shelter from the rain Hole up in my cage You don't have to think too much today They filled in for your brain  Curled up Deprived Curled up Deprived I shut away Please don't call my name""
