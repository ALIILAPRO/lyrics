		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A spotless bedroom
Spends quiet nights
Pilates mornings
And she's good with wine
She wakes at the right time
Sets the right vibes
She's funny but never too much
Mysterious but always in touch
I wonder what you see
When you see someone like me
Do you see her?
Won't you rather touch marble instead of limestone
All I wish to be is someone deserving
Of the comfort that you bring

'Cause deep inside I wanna be her
She takes the hit but never shows you
Where it hurts
Bathes you in spring sunshine
Wipes tears dry
And says I love you twice
Seasons change
Say you'll stay the same
봄 가을 겨울도
Look my way, look your way
Say okay, I'm okay
눈꽃이 녹아도 넌 피어나도록

In seven years time will I look back and wonder
Why was I such a mess
Unable to relax
날마다 불안불안해 내 마음이
무대 위에선 chill 내려와선 녹지
남몰래 애써 장착해 내 red carpet의 착장
장난 같지만 나름 진지해진 대화
거울 속에 넌 명작의 초상화
매번 말해서 진부해지겠지만
널 잃을까 봐 두려운 건 똑같아
No matter what you see
Can your eyes please stay on me?
빛바래도 제일 빛난다고 해줘

'Cause deep inside I wanna be her
She takes the hit but swings back stronger than before
Bathes you in spring sunshine
Wipes tears dry
And says I love you twice
Seasons change
Say you'll stay the same
'Cause I love you
Look my way, look your way
Say okay, I'm okay
피어나도록
I'll say I love you twice
