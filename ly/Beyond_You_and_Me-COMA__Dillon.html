		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cll i want to be is you and me
How can i suppose to know 
How to let go let go
Of every day and every night
When i just want you by side

When i find time for clarity
I know this is not meant to be
I can't let go
I must hold on 
I must let go
I must move on

Go out tonight
Hope you 'll find 
What you long to see
Beyond you and me 
Go out tonight
Hope you are fine 
What you long to see?
Beyond you and me

Now i realize 
It's not what i want
Got over it and moved on
To another one
Now i can see there is a way
It's not tomorrow its today
When i find time for clarity
I know this not meant to be
I can't let go
I must hold on 
I must let go
I must move on
