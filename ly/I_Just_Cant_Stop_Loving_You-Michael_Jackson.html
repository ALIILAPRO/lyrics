		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer

I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing

You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

I just can't hold on

I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

'Cause I just can't stop loving you

At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true

When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me?
I'll wait for you

You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying
"I do"

"I do"
This thing can't go wrong

This feeling's so strong

Well, my life ain't worth living

If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you

We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do

I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
Then tell me, just what will I do
