		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't do a thing about it
Thinking about it wasting your time
It's all in your head 

You worry about your lows so long
Forget you ever had any highs 
It's all in your head 

Oh Vangelis!
Today has been hell for us
Literally dangerous, this decadence 
And suffering your main character vibe 
We're all in your head

What's so hard about being more kind to yourself?
What's the devil want with you more than anyone else?

Oh Vangelis!
Today has been hell for us
Literally dangerous this decadence 
And suffering your main character vibe 
We're all in your head
