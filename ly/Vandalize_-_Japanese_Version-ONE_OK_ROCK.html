		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sound the alarm
Shatter me like glass
Covered in scars
But roses are coming through the cracks

Time that you killed
You promised to help me rebuild
You caught me off guard
Sound the alarm

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearing me down
Am I laid to waste
Now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

Fuck the pain away
My bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins
Don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

Did we make a work of art 
Just so you could deface it?
Did you let it fall apart
Just so you could replace it?
Tag your name on the side of a burning bridge
Watch it fade when the smoke rolls in (rolls in)

Time that you killed
You promised to help me rebuild
Feels like you planned it
Took us for granted, oh

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearing me down
Am I laid to waste
Now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart

Fuck the pain away
My bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins
Don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark (come and leave your mark)
Vandalize my heart

Oh you're fucking crazy hate me, love me
Hate me, love you breaking bottles on the pavement
Just to watch them crash

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearing me down
Am I laid to waste
Now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark
Vandalize my heart (vandalize my heart)

Fuck the pain away
My bed is in ruins
Need you in my veins
Don't know how you do it
Come and leave your mark (come and leave your mark)
Vandalize my heart

Said you'd keep me safe
Now you're tearing me down
Am I laid to waste
Now that you're not around?
Come and leave your mark (come and leave your mark)
Vandalize my heart
