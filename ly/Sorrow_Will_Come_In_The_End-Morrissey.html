		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Legalized theft 
Leaves me bereft 
I get it straight in the neck 
(Somehow expecting no less) 
A court of justice 
With no use for truth 
Lawyer...liar 
Lawyer...liar 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
Q.C.'s obsessed with sleaze 
Frantic for fame 
They're all on the game 
They just use a different name 
You lied 
And you were believed 
By a J.P. senile and vile 
You pleaded and squealed 
And you think you've won 
But sorrow will come 
To you in the end 
And as sure as my words are pure 
I praise the day that brings you pain 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't close your eyes 
A man who slits throats 
Has time on his hands 
And I'm gonna get you 
So don't close your eyes 
Don't ever close your eyes 
You think you've won 
Oh no
