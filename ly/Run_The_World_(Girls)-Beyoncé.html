		  Girls, we run this mutha (yeah)

Some of them men think they freak this
Like we do, but no they don't
Make your check, come at they neck
Disrespect us, no they won't
Boy, don't even try to touch this (touch this)
Boy, this beat is crazy (crazy)
This is how they made me (made me)
Houston, Texas, baby
This goes out to all my girls
That's in the club rocking the latest
Who will buy it for themselves and get more money later
I think I need a barber (barber)
None of these niggas can fade me (fade me)
I'm so good with this, I remind you, I'm so hood with this
Boy, I'm just playing
Come here, baby
Hope you still like me, F you, pay me

My persuasion 
Can build a nation
Endless power
With our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run this mutha? Girls
Who run this mutha? Girls
Who run this mutha? Girls
Who run this mutha? Girls
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)

It's hot up in here, DJ, don't be scared to run this, run this back
I'm repping for the girls who taking over the world
Help me raise a glass for the college grads
41' Rollie to let you know what time it is, check
You can't hold me (you can't hold me)
I work my nine to five, better cut my check
This goes out to all the women getting it in, you on your grind
To all the men that respect what I do, please accept my shine
Boy, you know you love it
How we smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children (children)
Then get back to business
See, you better not play me (me)
Oh, come here, baby
Hope you still like me
F you, pay me

My persuasion
Can build a nation
Endless power
With our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
Who run the world? Girls (girls)
