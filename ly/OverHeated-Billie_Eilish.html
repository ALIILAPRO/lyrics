		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't really even know how it happened
I started talkin', they started laughin'
I don't really even know how it happened
I started watchin' them photographin'
I don't really (I don't really) how it happened
Instead of stoppin', they still were flashin' (I don't really)
I started walkin' (I don't really), gave no reaction
(No reaction)

I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
I'm overheated

I don't really wanna know why you went there (why you went there)
I kinda don't care (kinda don't care), you wanna kill me (you wanna kill me)
You wanna hurt me (mm), stop bein' flirty
It's kinda workin'
Did you really think this is the right thing to do?
(Is it news? News to who?)
That I really looked just like the rest of you, mm

I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated

And everybody said it was a let down
I was only built like everybody else now
But I didn't get a surgery to help out
'Cause I'm not about to redesign myself now, am I?
(Am I?) Am I?
All these other inanimate bitches
It's none of my business
But don't you get sick of
Posin' for pictures with that plastic body?
Man

I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't un-believe it
I'm overheated, can't be defeated
Can't be deleted, can't be repeated
I'm overheated
