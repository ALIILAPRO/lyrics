		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  So, so now, now, so now, so now
So, so now, now, so now, so now
You're too, you're too precious, precious

You're too, you're too precious

So, so now, now, so now, so now
So, so now, now, so now, so now
It looks, it looks like, like, like
it looks, it looks like, like, like

You're too, you're too precious
You're too, you're too precious

I don't think they deserve you
I don't think anyone could
I'd take the calls you don't want to
I'd take the hair in your food

Now, now, so now, so now
So, so now, now, now
You're too, you're too precious, precious
So now, so now
So, so now, now, so now, so now

You're too, you're too precious, precious
So now, so now
So, so now, now, so now, so now
It looks, it looks like, like, like
It looks, it looks like, like, like

Now, now, so now, so now
So, so now, now
You're too, you're too precious, precious
So now, so now
So, so now, now, so now, so now

I'll be a bubble
I'll make myself useful
I'll be a bubble
I'll make myself useful

Dive into diamonds
Scratched and you're smiling
No thought to sirens
Scratched and you're smiling

So now, so now
so now, so now
It looks like, it looks like
You're too, you're too precious, precious
