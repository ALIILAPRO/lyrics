		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-huh, this my shit
All the girls stomp your feet like this

Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit

I heard that you were talking shit
And you didn't think that I would hear it
People hear you talking like that, getting everybody fired up
So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
That's right, put your pom-poms down, getting everybody fired up

Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit

So that's right, dude, meet me at the bleachers
No principals, no student-teachers
Both of us wanna be the winner, but there can only be one
So I'm gonna fight, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
That's right, I'm the last one standing
Another one bites the dust

Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit

Let me hear you say, this shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S
This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S
Again this shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S
This shit is bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S

Few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
Ooh, this my shit, this my shit
