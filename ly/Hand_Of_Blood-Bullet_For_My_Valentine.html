		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh
There goes my Valentine again
I'm soaked in red for what she said
And now she's gone
Oh my God, have I done it again?
There's a pulse that is deafening
I can't help what I hear in my head,
It's the switch that I flip (when you said)

Hand of blood
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
I don't want to see, my life is burning

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing
(I saw you run)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing

There's a stain on my hand and it's red
Oh my God, am I losing it?
I can't help what I've done or I've said
It's a button I push (when you say)

Hand of blood
I don't want to feel, my heart is breaking
Hand of blood
I don't want to see, my life is burning

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing
(I saw you run)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?

I saw you look away
Is what you've seen too much to take
Or are you blind and seeing nothing
(I saw you run)
I saw you run away
Is what I've done too much to take
Or are you scared of being nothing?
