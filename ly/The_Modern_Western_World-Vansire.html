		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  From turnpikes to highways
And gravel into dust
From soybeans to silhouettes 
Advancing in the dusk
Sky above I fell in love 
While I was sitting still
The rate at which the Rust Belt fades 
To Appalachian hills, oh

Drive south as history unfolds
The awe-inspiring death-defying metamodern world (oh)
Take my word I think we'll be alright
Lost myself along the way but had the greatest time
I'll pass you somewhere in the night

A stranger out in Utah gestures towards the muddy car
He said, "Hey are you nomads? Did you come from somewhere far?"
I said, "I don't know, man, but it feels that way today"
This highway is the last breath of an empire in decay, oh

Drive south as history unfolds
The all-providing, soon expiring modern western world (oh)
Take my word I think we'll be alright
Lost myself along the way but had the greatest time
I'll pass you somewhere in the night
