		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There goes the siren that warns of the air raid
There comes the sound of the guns sending flak
Out for the scramble, we've got to get airborne
Got to get up for the coming attack
Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
Remove all the wheel blocks, there's no time to waste
Gathering speed as we head down the runway
Got to get airborne before it's too late

Running (running), scrambling (scrambling), flying (flying)
Rolling (rolling), turning (turning), diving (diving), going in again
Running (running), scrambling (scrambling), flying (flying)
Rolling (rolling), turning (turning), diving (diving)

Run 
Live to fly
Fly to live
Do or die
Won't you run?
Live to fly
Fly to live
Aces high

Move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
Let off a sharp burst and then turn away
Roll over, spin 'round to come in behind them
Move to their blindsides and firing again
Bandits at eight o'clock move in behind us
Ten ME-109s out of the sun
Ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
Heading straight for them, I press down my guns

Rolling (rolling), turning (turning), diving (diving)
Rolling (rolling), turning (turning), diving (diving), going in again
Rolling (rolling), turning (turning), diving (diving)
Rolling (rolling), turning (turning), diving (diving)

Run 
Live to fly
Fly to live
Do or die
Won't you run?
Live to fly
Fly to live
Aces high
