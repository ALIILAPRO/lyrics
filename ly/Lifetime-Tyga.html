		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, thinkin' 'bout times, huggin' and fuckin' you
When I'm laid up alone and it's nothin' to do
Got a lot on my mind, got a lot to prove
Tryna balance, keep you a priority too
But every day I'm wakin' up, and it's bad news
When you in love, gotta be thinkin' for two
I know I'm selfish at times but I be needin' to
Be what I wanna be, I want everything
And you just what I need, and it's medicine
But I need to fuck up to get better again
Fast life, might crash, how I'm pedallin'
Tryna retrace steps, can't go back again
Another tattoo of you covered on my skin
In relationships, man, I'm like 0 and 10
But I feel like my next one a big win

Gotta manifest, gotta be best friends
Gotta be movin' P, gotta tap in
Gotta take you overseas, gotta trust me
But it's things in my life I don't want you in
And I know that's a problem, gotta fix it
But I'm still young and I got a hitlist
I be in deep thought, I be vibin'
I be talkin' to myself like, "Why me?"
Baby, you deserve better and I'm not him
But I know when we happy, we be locked in
And it's some shit I just can't comprehend
Maybe I deserve better and you not her
Wish I could reverse time and say I had you first
I was late, I ain't partyin', I'm puttin' work
God gave me purpose, put me on the Earth
I be readin' all the signs, put me on alert
I be in Palm Springs lookin' at the stars
And I never thought that I'd get this far
'Bout to be a couple hits then they write me off
But I keep reinventin', that's real talk
Reflectin' life in real time (real time)
Got me missin' you when it's bedtime
Can I be with one soul for a lifetime? (Lifetime)
Maybe in another lifetime (lifetime)

Thinkin' 'bout times, huggin' and fuckin' you
When I'm laid up alone and it's nothin' to do
Got a lot on my mind, got a lot to prove
Tryna balance, keep you a priority too
But every day I'm wakin' up, and it's bad news
When you in love, gotta be thinkin' for two
I know I'm selfish at times but I be needin' to
Be what I wanna be, I want everything
And you just what I need, and it's medicine
But I need to fuck up to get better again
Fast life, might crash, how I'm pedallin'
Tryna retrace steps, can't go back again
Another tattoo of you covered on my skin
In relationships, man, I'm like 0 and 10
But I feel like my next one a big win (big win)
My next one a big win (big win)

Thinkin' 'bout times, huggin' and fuckin' you
Love will make you do crazy things
Reflectin' life in real time
Can I be with one soul for a lifetime?
