		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hurts every time
When I think of the smile on your face
Lump in my thought
When I hear the sound calling your name
I've really tried and I've tried to get over these fears
But I'm really taking my words back, taking them

Feels so lonely
Wish you would call me

I know I called it quits
It was up to me
Whether we should be friends or just stay the same
It feels so lonely
Lonely without you

Reading the last words you said to me back in October
These memories keep coming round and around
And they leave me regretting
The smell of these walls keep on fading
Forgetting the scent that you left
But I'm really taking my words back, taking them

Feels so lonely
I wish you would call me

I know I called it quits
It was up to me
Whether we should be friends or just stay the same
It feels so lonely
Lonely without you

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Lonely without you
Oh, oh, oh, oh
