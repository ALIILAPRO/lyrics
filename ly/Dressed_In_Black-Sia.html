		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had given up
I didn't know who to trust, oh
So I designed a shell
Kept me from Heaven and Hell, oh
And I had hit a low
Was all I let myself know, yeah
Yeah I had locked my heart
I was imprisoned by dark (I was imprisoned by dark)

You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses

I was down for the count
Yes I was down, I was out, oh ooh
And I had lost it all
Yes I was scared, I was torn oh
And I took to the night
I'd given in to the fight oh ooh
And I slipped further down
I felt like I had drowned

You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses

I was hopeless and broken, you opened the door for me
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in and now I see
That you do for the wounded, what they couldn't seem to, you set them free
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key yeah

You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses

Covered my heart in kisses
