		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So ya
Thought ya
Might like to
Go to the show

To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you, sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're going to find out where you fans really stand

Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get 'em up against the wall (get them up)
Now, there's one in the spotlight
He don't look right to me
Then get him up against the wall (get them)

Now, that one looks Jewish
And that one's a coon
Who let all this riffraff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint 
And another with spots

If I had my way, I'd have all of them shot
