		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What the fuck did I tell you?
Baby, I'm toxic
All this smoke in the air got you so nauseous
Oh, I like it when you're aggressive
Oh, baby, don't be so passive
Ride for me, then you'll never need no casket
I know you never seen nothing like it
Oh, I like it when you're aggressive
Oh, baby, don't be so passive

Stir, I stir it up
'Cause you know I like it rough
Want your hands wrapped up around my neck
You tried to play it off like you ain't give a fuck
I know the type of shit that you be playing
'Cause I'm bad enough, I'm grown enough (oh, yeah)
You got all the tools, you got all the tools
That's why I'm never worried bout
What they been telling you
I'll make a grown man cry, but behave for you
I heard you kill shit
Boy, I got some shit for you (na, na, na)
So when you get this
You should know just what to do (na, na, na)

Fuck taking it slow
Give it to me right now
Baby, I cannot leave you alone
Because I don't want to wait anymore

What the fuck did I tell you?
Baby, I'm toxic
All this smoke in the air got you so nauseous
Oh, I like it when you're aggressive
Oh, baby, don't be so passive
Ride for me, then you'll never need no casket
I know you never seen nothing like it
Oh, I like it when you're aggressive
Oh, baby, don't be so passive

Baby, you toxic
Rumors and gossip, but them other bitches is not shit
Go head baby and back it up, and don't you stop it
Like that new Fendi, baby, I'm just trying to cop it
Fuck your red light, ooh, now I'm 'bout to
Have it my way, you could have it my way
Fuck all that talking If you looking at me sideways
My way to you, I'm speeding ninety on a highway
So be ready when I pull up in your driveway like (na, na, na)
'Cause when you get this
You should know just what to do (na, na, na)
Fuck taking it slow, give it to me like
Rewind, need that back, need you back again
Last time, told me that, that I'm just a friend
That's fine, I'ma get, get you back again
Lay down, hit me up when you need a friend

What the fuck did I tell you?
Baby, I'm toxic
All this smoke in the air got you so nauseous
Oh, I like it when you're aggressive
Oh, baby, don't be so passive
Ride for me, then you'll never need no casket
I know you never seen nothing like it
Oh, I like it when you're aggressive
Oh, baby, don't be so passive
