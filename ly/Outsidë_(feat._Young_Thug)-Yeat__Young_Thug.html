		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Outside, uh (yeah)
Pullin' up in Tonkas, bitch, we learned just how to finesse (uh)
Big body, got the big Tonk (Tonka)
Turnt shit up, my song (Luh Crank)
Half a Perky, I'm right in my zone
I'm shoppin' on the way back home (go)
I'm puttin' on for the west, so I'ma bust a nut on her chest
Hope you got bulletproof vests on, told 'em I do it the best
Turnt shit up my theme song, I might run out of gas
High as a ten with the beams on, bitch, I been way out of space (yeah)
Please better watch your tone, YSL, feel like cologne
Why you be callin' my (bitch)
I don't even mean by (you)
Rollie flooded (flooded), diamonds flawless (flawless)
Bad thotties, big bodies (skrrt, yeah)

Watch yourself, told you that I want you, I don't need you (yeah)
I could tell, you don't got no money, that shit see through (ha)
Outside (ayy)
I'm just outside, I'm just outside (ayy, ayy)
Yeah, and we turn up (ayy)
Flawless diamonds on me, bitch might burn us
I just called up all my twizzies, my brothers
Yeah, we had pulled up on yo' wifey, said they love us (yeah)
No, no, you can't be no twizzy rich, 'cause you don't know us
I just peeped inside the Lamb', you not rich, you bogus (skrrt)
Racks, hey, yeah
Pullin' up in big ol' bodies, we big like it's a parade
I can't trust a soul, can't trust nobody, but that's my way
I don't be goin' to sleep, I wake up at night and geek up all day

Outside, uh (yeah)
Pullin' up in Tonkas, bitch, we learned just how to finesse (uh)
Big body, got the big Tonk (Tonka)
Turnt shit up, my song (Luh Crank)
Half a Perky, I'm right in my zone
I'm shoppin' on the way back home (go)
I'm puttin' on for the west, so I'ma bust a nut on her chest
Hope you got bulletproof vests on, told 'em I do it the best
Turnt shit up my theme song, I might run out of gas
High as a ten with the beams on, bitch, I been way out of space (yeah)
Please better watch your tone, YSL, feel like cologne
Why you be callin' my (bitch)
I don't even mean by (you)
Rollie flooded (flooded), diamonds flawless (flawless)
Bad thotties, big bodies (skrrt, yeah)

(Sex)
Oh you rich? Yeah
I just gave my ex a million 'cause I'm big fair (woah)
Twenty-six Rollies and they not Rick Flairs
I was in the club and hit the opp with a chair (ayy)
Bad lil' bitch, put Chanel in your ear
I just got a check and got my dog repaired
Ridin' in the Bentley, don't do no talkin', yeah
Giuseppe Zanotti with snakes when I'm walkin', yeah
Uh-uh, patty-cake, I just got my wrist out the bowl, yeah
Frosted flakes, I just checked my wrist, it's still cold, yeah
I don't play, you can put your tricks in the commode, yeah
I don't flake, I keep it so real with my hoes, yeah (Sex)
You do diss songs, you get big blazed (brrt)
I get millions in like six ways (brrt)
You stay on your toe, it's a big blade
Fuck her with the mask on, she can't see me (Sex)

Outside, uh (yeah)
Pullin' up in Tonkas, bitch, we learned just how to finesse (uh)
Big body, got the big Tonk (Tonka)
Turnt shit up, my song (Luh Crank)
