		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once again we'll look for you
Do you know you hurt us too
(And everythings is gone)
And everythings is broken
Beat the fear you pretty boy
That's too much you will destroy
(And everythings is gone)
When everythings is broken
Oh, a new day,
Oh, another river
You'll swim, you'll sing
Oh, a new day
Oh, another river
You'll swim, you'll sing
I don't want to blame it on you
I don't want to blame it on you
Once again you've left the clan
How to find a troubled man
(And all we need is light)
And all we need is daylight
Build the boat you stubbern boy
Fight the water, feel the joy
(And all we need is light)
And all we need is daylight
Oh, a new day
Oh, another river
You'll swim, you'll sing
Oh, a new day
Oh, another river
You'll swim, you'll sing
I don't want to blame it on you
I don't want to blame it on you
I don't want to
Oh, a new day
Oh, another river
You'll swim, you'll sing
I don't want to blame it on you
I don't want to blame it on you
I don't want to
I don't want to blame it on you
I don't want to
