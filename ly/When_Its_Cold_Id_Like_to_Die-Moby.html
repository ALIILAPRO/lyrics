		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where were you when I was lonesome?
Locked away with freezing cold
Someone flying only stolen
I can't tell, this lights so old

I don't wanna swim the ocean
I don't wanna fight the tide
I don't wanna swim forever
When it's cold I'd like to die

What was that my sweet, sweet nothing?
I can't hear you through the fog
If I holler, let me go
If I falter, let me know

I don't wanna swim the ocean
I don't wanna fight the tide
I don't wanna swim forever
When it's cold, I'd like to die
I don't wanna swim forever
I don't wanna fight the tide
I don't wanna swim the ocean
When it's cold, I'd like to die

I don't wanna swim the ocean
I don't wanna fight the tide
