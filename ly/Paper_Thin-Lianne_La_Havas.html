		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Paper-thin
God only knows the pain you're in
But the future's bright
You've got God on your side, He's listening

Love yourself
Or else you can't love no one else
I know your pain is real
But you won't let it heal

Paper-thin
If you're trying to lose, you'll never win
It's your life
But you're not the only one who's suffering
That's enough, I know you're made of better stuff, baby
You gotta roam free, please
Don't forget about me

Oh, give me the other key
Oh, your heart's wide open
There must be another key
Left your heart wide open
Just give me the other key
Your heart is an open door
So let me love you
I just wanna love you

Paper-thin
You understand the pain I'm in
Slipping in and out 
Of such confidence
And overwhelming doubt
But if I love myself
I know I can't be no one else, oh no
Don't go
'Cause I need you so

Oh, give me the other key
Oh, your heart's wide open
There must be another key
Left your heart wide open
Just give me the other key
Your heart is an open door
So let me love you
I just wanna love you

They say they're scared of you
I'm like, "Me too, me too"
("Me too, me too") "Me too"

You say you're scared of me
We both just want to be free
(Be free, be free) Be free

Oh, give me the other key
Oh, your heart's wide open
There must be another key
Left your heart wide open
Just give me the other key
Your heart is an open door
Let me love you, uh

Your heart's wide open
Your heart's wide open (just give me another key)
Your heart's wide open 
(Just give me another key)
Your heart's wide open

Just give me another key
Your heart is an open door
So let me love you
I just wanna love you
