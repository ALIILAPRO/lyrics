		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So much these days I can't process
Familiar guilt bubbles up
I cant get over myself
Cannot make myself be enough

I
Should
Be
Glad
That I'm
At
Least
There
But I'm so fucking tired

Grey matter replaced with bile
Memories just feed it
Trying to be better and
Take a step foreward
Dull the edge, ignore, repeat
Pheonix reborn in piss and
Soaked in regret, atrophied

Admiration feels insulting
Because I think I'm not doing
Anything that warrants looking
I just sit around all day and let the world around me spin

Am I just a ghost (Dissapear)
Am I going down the same path I
Saw as a young Icarus
Before my wings were devoured

Every
Promise I make
Feels more hollow than the last I'm
Embarrassed by how I live
Close to better, become Sisyphus

React in anger again
Feeling overwhelmed again
Isn't deserved. I should be collected but I'm

Unable to progress
Unwilling to change my habits
