		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I said I needed you
You said you would always stay
It wasn't me who changed but you and now you've gone away
Don't you see that now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you and beg you to come home

You don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me, believe me, I can't help but love you
But believe me, I'll never tie you down
Left alone with just a memory
Life seems dead and so unreal
All that's left is loneliness, there's nothing left to feel

You don't have to say you love me, just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me, believe me
You don't have to say you love me just be close at hand
You don't have to stay forever, I will understand
Believe me, believe me
