		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The warmest night I ever felt
I spent with you (you)
The fireflies they multiply
Escape from view (view)
You say you don't know me
You don't say
But could you ever see me that way
You say I don't know now
That's ok
If you're the rock
I'm the ricochet

I'm the ricochet
If you're the rock
I'm the ricochet

The coldest night I ever felt
I spent with you (you)
The fire died
Our hearts were pried
They split in two
You say you don't love me
I'm too plain
You could never see me that way
You say I don't know now
That's ok
If I'm the rock
You're the ricochet

You're the ricochet
If I'm the rock
You're my ricochet

I never want to hurt you (want to hurt you)
I never want to hurt you or bring you pain
I never want to hurt you (want to hurt you)
I never want to hurt you or bring you pain

You're the ricochet
You're the ricochet
If I'm the rock
You're my ricochet
You're the ricochet
You're the ricochet
If I'm the rock
You're my ricochet
