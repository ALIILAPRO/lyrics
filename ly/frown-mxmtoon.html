		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The trees look cold, all the leaves fell off
Maybe I should give them my sweater
The flowers say, "Hey, where is a sun today?"
As if I determin the weather

Yeah, the world's got its worries
Life's got us all in a hurry
Stuck on a loop overthinkin' all of our pain

It's okay to frown, smile upside down
Feeling kinda blue like the sky right now
No way (no way), we're gonna work it out
It's a feelin' that I'm havin', and I'll have it right now
It comes and goes away
In time, my scars will fade
The look that's on my face
Is temporarily upside down
It's okay to frown

Cruisin' on a cloud like an ocean wave
Don't feel bad 'bout the matter
Fallin' to the ground like November rain
Sinkin' like a brick but I'm light as a feather

The world's got its worries
Life's got us all in a hurry
Stuck on a loop overthinkin' all of our pain

It's okay to frown, smile upside down
Feeling kinda blue like the sky right now
No way (no way), we're gonna work it out
It's a feelin' that I'm havin', and I'll have it right now
It comes and goes away
In time, my scars will fade
The look that's on my face
Is temporarily upside down
It's okay to frown

Oh my, aren't we just fine?
Don't pay no mind
I'm just temporarily upside down

Good morning
The weather forecast today is showing a slight chance of sunshine and sadness
It's another perfect day to not feel that perfect

It's okay to frown, smile upside down
Feeling kinda blue like the sky right now
No way (no way), we're gonna work it out
It's a feelin' that I'm havin', and I'll have it right now
It comes and goes away
In time, my scars will fade
The look that's on my face
Is temporarily upside down
It's okay to frown
