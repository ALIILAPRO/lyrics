		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took, you still couldn't breathe
No matter how many nights that you lied wide awake to the sound of the poison rain
Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go?

(Heartbeat, a heartbeat, I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)

Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die, I will never forget
No matter how many lives I live, I will never regret
There's a fire inside this heart and a riot about to explode into flames
Where is your God? Where is your God? Where is your God?

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want? (Heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me? (I need a heartbeat, a heartbeat)
Do you really want me dead? (You know I gotta leave, I can't stay)
Or alive to live a lie? (I know I gotta go, I can't stay)

Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

You say you wrong, you wrong, I'm right, I'm right
You're wrong, we fight
Ok, I'm running from the light, running from the day to night
Oh, the quiet silence defines our misery
The riot inside keeps trying to visit me
No matter how we try, it's too much history
Too many bad notes playing in our symphony
So let it breathe, let it fly, let it go
Let it fall, let it crash, burn slow
And then you call upon God
Oh, you call upon God

Tell me would you kill to save for a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you're right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane's chasing us all underground

Oh, whoa
This hurricane (oh, whoa)
This hurricane (oh, whoa)
This hurricane (oh, whoa)

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead?
Or alive to live a lie?

Running away from the night
Running away from the night
Running away from the light
Running away to save your life
