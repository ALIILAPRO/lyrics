		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that

Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps

Don't let it in with with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it
Honey don't feed it, it will come back

You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that

I know who I am when I'm alone
Something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

Don't let me in with with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me
Honey don't feed me I will come back

Can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't avoid!
I want you baby tonight, as sure as you're born

You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling babe?
Don't you hear me howling
Don't you hear me howling
Don't you hear me howling babe?
