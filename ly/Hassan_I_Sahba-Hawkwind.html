Death unto all infidels in oil
Guide us o thou genie of the smoke
Lead us to a thousand and one nights
In the perfumed gardens of delights

Petro dollar, petro dollar
Petro dollar, petro dollar
Petrol d'Allah, petrol d'Allah
Petrol d'Allah

Hashish hashin, hashish hashin
Hashish hashin, hashish hashin
Hashish hashin, hashish hashin

Death unto all infidels in oil
Guide us o thou genie of the smoke
Lead us to a thousand and one nights
In the perfumed garden of
In the perfumed garden of
In the perfumed garden of delights

It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
In the soul of the desert
It is written
In signs in the stars
It is written
In the sands of the hour-glass
It is written
It is written
In the eye of the falcon
It is written
In the shade of the scorpion
It is written
In the wealth of the sun
It is written
It is written
Man's truth is a mirage
It is written
That death's an oasis
It is written
For all unbelievers
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written
It is written

Hashish hashin, hashish hashin
Hashish hashin, hashish hashin
Hashish hashin, hashish hashin
Hashishin

Death unto all infidels in oil
Guide us o thou genie of the smoke
Lead us to a thousand and one nights
In the perfumed garden of 
In the perfumed garden of
In the perfumed garden of delights
