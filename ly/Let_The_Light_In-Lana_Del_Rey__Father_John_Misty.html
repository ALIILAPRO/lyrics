		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick you up at home, quarter to three
Ask you if you want somethin' to eat
Drive around, get drunk, do it over again
Wake you up at night, quarter to one
I can never stop, wanna have fun
Don't be actin' like I'm the kinda girl who can sleep

'Cause every time you say you're gonna go
I just smile, 'cause babe, I already know
You know I got nothin' under this overcoat

Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I, back at it again

Pick you up around quarter to two
Usually we got nothin' to do
Screw it, maybe you should go and record some other songs
Got my dress on tight 'cause you know that I
Look shinin' in the light, there's so much ridin'
On this life and how we write our love song

Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and I back at it again

'Cause I like to love, to love, to love, to love you
I hate to hate, to hate, to hate, to hate you
Put the Beatles on, light the candles, go back to bed
'Cause I wanna, wanna, wanna want you
I need to, need to, need to need you
Put the TV on and flowers in a vase, lie your head

Ooh, let the light in
At your back door yelling 'cause I wanna come in
Ooh, turn your light on
Look at us, you and me back at it again
