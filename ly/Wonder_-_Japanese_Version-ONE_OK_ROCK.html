		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take, take all the risk I don't wanna play safe, safe
Gotta live bend the rules today
Break, break
I got the world on the palms of my hands

Run away, away on a path couple dreams I'm gonna make, make
See me walk, I don't talk just for the sake, sake
Step aside 'cause I'm making my plans

Yeah, home is home and where we go
'Cause life is beautiful

Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love
Pull you out the deep end
Don't you ever wonder?

Restart やり直してさ 前へ前へ
前進 行け もっと先 遥か先
そうさ 見上げた空 7つ星

Yeah, home is home and where we go
'Cause life is beautiful

Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love
Pull you out the deep end
Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love
Pull you out the deep end
Don't you ever wonder?

Sing it!
Wonder
Wonder
Wonder

Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love
Pull you out the deep end (deep end)
Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love (one love one love)
Pull you out the deep end

Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love
Pull you out the deep end
Don't you ever wonder?
If you only had one breath
Tell me would your one love
Pull you out the deep end
Don't you ever wonder?
