		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits it shakes me to the core
And makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust
But will you stand with us?
Can you feel it?
Make it real and

I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting it's not just rotting

Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
But survival is a must
So will you stand with us?
Can you feel it? 
Make it real and (make me feel it)

I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting it's not just rotting

Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started, man, we ain't gon' stop
We gon' turn it out 'til it gets too hot
Everybody sing, hey-o
Tell 'em turn it up 'til they can't no more
Let's get this thing shakin' like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call
