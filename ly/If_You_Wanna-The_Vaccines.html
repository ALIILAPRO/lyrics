		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well I don't want to wake up in the morning
But I've got to face the day
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say

I don't want to do things independently
But I can't make you stay
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say

But if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back to me

Well I don't want to see you with another guy
But the fact is that I may
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say

Well give it just another couple months or so
Then you'll be okay
That's what all the friends I do not like as much as you say

All alone, all alone
I, I am on my own
Alone, all alone
I, I am on my own

But if you wanna come back it's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back to me

But do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back
Do you wanna come back? It's alright, it's alright
It's alright if you wanna come back to me
