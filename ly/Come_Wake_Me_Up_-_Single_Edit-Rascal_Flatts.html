		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can usually drink you right off of my mind
But I miss you tonight
I can normally push you right out of my heart
But I'm too tired to fight

Yeah the whole thing begins
And I let you sink into my veins
And I feel the pain like it's new
Everything that we were,
Everything that you said,
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do
Plays through tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With everyone it grows higher and higher
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up

Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice
But I can't forget
Now I'm all out of ideas
And baby I'm down to my last cigarette

Yeah you're probably asleep deep inside of your dreams
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to sleep
Yeah wherever you are baby now I am sure you've moved on
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With everyone it grows higher and higher
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming

I know that you're movin' on
I know I should give you up
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip and fall back in love

Time's not healin' anything
Baby this pain is worse than it ever was
I know that you can't hear me but baby I need you to save me tonight

Tonight your memory burns like a fire
With everyone it grows higher and higher
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Oh I'm dreaming
Come wake me up
Oh, I'm dreaming
