		<p>
		  It's Ovi Wood
Don't say you love me if you don't love yourself
And don't try to fix me, I do not need your help
If you're gon leave me, that's like everyone else
You're an angel from Heaven but this shit hurts like Hell
Cause I need you, baby, baby
I need you, save me, save me
I need you, baby, baby
I need you, I need you
I had a bad life
Baby, I've been going through some bad times
Then you came fast
Changed everything, made it alright
Now you're trynna let me go, you're doing it again
I'm trynna be your lover, I can't just be your friend
Don't move on, baby why you leaving
Begging you and you know that I'm pleading
Need you here but you can barely see it
Getting hard and I've been barely breathing
I can't lie, hate it when we go back and forth and we argue
Cause you're the love of my life and I don't wanna lose you
Don't say you love me if you don't love yourself
And don't try to fix me, I do not need your help
If you're gon leave me, that's like everyone else
You're an angel from Heaven but this shit hurts like Hell
Cause I need you, baby, baby
I need you, save me, save me
I need you, baby, baby
I need you, I need you
You been, all in your feelings lately
I know it hurts but you don't need me, baby
All that effort I gave you on the daily
You stabbed my back and took advantage, you played me
Used to call you my angel from heaven
You hurt me first that's why I'm raising hell
All them days I was burning inside cause that shit you did and you couldn't even tell
I was down bad bitch you really made me hate myself
Used to love myself too much
If I could go back I would do it to protect my health
Would've never gave you my trust
You blame it on the drugs
The drink thats in your cup
You told me you would quit because u hate the shit it does
You blame it on the alcohol that wasn't what it was
If I'm keeping it a hundred u just never had love for me, baby na
Don't say you love me if you don't love yourself
And don't try to fix me, I do not need your help
If you're gon leave me, that's like everyone else
You're an angel from Heaven but this shit hurts like Hell
Cause I need you, baby, baby
I need you, save me, save me
I need you, baby, baby
I need you, I need you, ya
