		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-aaaah.
Ah-aaaah, tonight.
I need your sunshine, tonight.

If you don't know.
Want you for me.
Don't leave me alone tonight.
If you don't go.
I let you see.
What there is in my heart?

If you say no
I'll feel alone,
I need your sunshine, tonight.
If you stay on,
I'll give my all,
I'll be your star.

If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star

Ah-aaaah.
Ah-aaaah, tonight.
I need your sunshine, tonight.

If you want love,
Then come with me
Stay by my side tonight
If you want love,
I'll make you rise,
Like the moon in the night
If you say no,
I'll feel alone,
I need your sunshine, tonight.
If you stay on,
I'll give my all,
I'll be your star.

If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star
If you love me, if you love me now,
I'll be your star.

Ah-aaaah.
Ah-aaaah, tonight.
I need your sunshine, tonight.
