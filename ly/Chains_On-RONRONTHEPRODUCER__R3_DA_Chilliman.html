		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miss you made this
Ron Ron do that shit
She Took her clothes off, she got nothing but my chains on
My hobby stackin' dough thats why my pape long
Pick her up in black trucks, I'm on some boss shit
Diamonds pure water, I'm chili faucet
Gun on my hip, & my paper, in her Chanel purse
Deep in her guts cause I been takin' all these perks
Left mom's house at 15 but I'm a shit now
If you playin' with some pape, bust your bitch down
She want me all up in her face, broke niggas lame to her
Lil baby play her part, might give a chain to her
Got no time to play around, I'm chasin' pape
In a black truck with my bitch and a drake
He ain't never blowin' back inside of Neiman's
I drive V12 Benz like they demons
The money got rubber bands tied around it
Tryna quit the pink tens but I'm wildin
Broke niggas pocket watchin' me cause they motion dry
If a nigga reach for pieces, that's a homicide
Big dawg, heavy Cuban, Not no lil' shit
Her ex still want her but he broke, He gotta get a grip
Blew 5,000 on the fit, but what's that to me
Her pussy good, I'm sayin' uhh like Master P
Hit the mall, blew my pocket, I got more though
It's Louis V and Dior all in her wardrobe
She Took her clothes off, she got nothing but my chains on
My hobby stackin' dough thats why my pape long
Pick her up in black trucks, I'm on some boss shit
Diamonds pure water, I'm chili faucet
Gun on my hip, & my paper, in her Chanel purse
Deep in her guts cause I been takin' all these perks
Left mom's house at 15 but I'm a shit now
If you playin' with some pape, bust your bitch down
