		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to be away
From the one you love
And the days seem slowly driftin' by
But, my darling, I'll be home
In your arms where I'll belong
So I'm sending you this poem from my heart

Dream of me when you're lonely
Dream of me when you're sad
'Cause, darling, I want you only
You're the nicest, nicest love I ever had

Although we are many, many miles apart
You are always in my achin' heart
But, my darling, I'll be home
In your arms where I belong
So I'm sending you this poem from my heart

Dream of me when you're lonely
Dream of me when you're sad
'Cause, darling, I want you only
You're the nicest, nicest love I ever had

Dream of me when you're lonely
Dream of me when you're sad
'Cause, darling, I want you only
You're the nicest, nicest love I ever had

Dream of me when you're lonely
Dream of me when you're sad
'Cause, darling, I want you only
