		<p>
		  Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 A.M., summer night
Hands on the wheel, uh-uh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uh-uh fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uh-uh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel

Life for me is just weed and brews
See the hoes flock to you when your name is Q
Am I over-faded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on, ain't no limit to what I can do
See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'mma fuck the world
I'mma be on tunes 'til God re-furls
You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself
I love drunk driving, man I'm something else
Heat on my side, you're more than welcome to melt
I'm 'bout to finish a pound, you're more welcome to help (ay)

Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight

Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel

Wait hold up, back in this mothafuckin' bitch once again
It's the pretty mothafucka with a 40 ounce of brew
My nigga Q and we drunker than a bitch
We getting millis mothafucka, yeah, uh
Nigga, weed and brews, unbelievable
Got a freak or two, in my vehicle
Got the purple drink, got the yellow drink
Then we mix it up, call it Pikachu
With a little bit of crack, little bit of dope
Little bit of smoke, little coke, little weed, when they on them (pills)
Little bit of E, little bit of shrooms
Little bit of deuce, what it do, hand on the (wheels)
And I keep the illest, trillest bitches while I'm swagging it
(Crush a bit, little bit) that's my pursuit of happiness

Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight

Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel

If I fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
If I fucked her twice, I might change her life
If I change her life, she might hit my weed
We could have a some and we could round it off with three
Her, Mary and me, I'll keep it strictly G
My philosophy upon living right
Nigga weed and brews, and head every night
Hope the pussy nice, 'cause I'mma fight the bitch
Beat it down and shit, I be clowning with
Black Hippy crew, how swag am I
Be the reason why, she wanna drown my dick
But I soon realized, she was super dry
No paper planes, the Vega's will fly
Don't act surprised, too much Loc inside
Let's get stupid high, to where I can't reply
Love smoking dope, I won't compromise

Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
Yeah
Bitch, gimme the disc
