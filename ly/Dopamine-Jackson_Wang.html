		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I'm so caught up in the moment, I know
There's so much in my head can't put it down, I know
Too much on my chest, shoulders tight
Getting heavy, turn on the light

I need a little smoothing out the rough (need)
I want relief, I want to feel your touch ('lief)
I want release, a little something in the cut
Ahh, ha

I came here to get some dopamine
Ahh, ahh-ah
Make it go all night, no gasoline
Ahh, ahh-ah
Yes, I know you've been waiting for me (I need)
Ahh, ahh-ah (I need, I need)
I came here to get some dopamine (dopamine, I need)
Ahh, ahh, ahh (I need dopamine)
I came here to, uh, uh

You telling me sweet nothings, got me all right
Ain't no time for talking when we're tongue-tied
Holding on my head, close my eyes (close, close)
When it's raining, you're my sunshine

I need a little smoothing out the rough (I need, I need)
I want relief, I want to feel your touch ('lief)
I want release (release), a little something in the cut
Ahh, ha

I came here to get some dopamine
Ahh, ahh-ah
Make it go all night, no gasoline
Ahh, ahh-ah (ooh, ooh)
Yes, I know you've been waiting for me (I need)
Ahh, ahh-ah (I need, I need)
I came here to get some dopamine (dopamine, I need)
Ahh, ahh, ahh (I need dopamine)
I came here to, uh, uh

I came here to, uh, uh (ahh, ahh-ah)
I came here to
I came here to, uh, uh
I came here to, uh, uh
I came here to, uh, uh (ahh, ahh-ah)
I came here to
I came here to, uh, uh

(I need, ooh)
