		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
NLE, top shotta
Baby Mexico Chapo
Yeah, what we on Blueface?
How we comin'?
Yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a hoe

Pull up with the gang, you know that we bangin'
What is your set, nigga? What is you claimin'?
I am a beast, you cannot tame it
Don't point a finger, this shit can get dangerous
These niggas hate, these niggas plottin'
Ooh, he got money? I'm runnin' his wallet
You say you a killer, lil' nigga stop it
In a shoot out your gun was droppin'
You really a hoe
You pull up, I let that bitch blow
And just like some tissue, we wipin' your nose
I was on stage with the strap at my show
If you playin' my bro, put a tag on yo' toe
Run a nigga up, send 'em straight to the doctor
Two bullets in his chest make a fuck nigga holla
I'm a big dog, Great Dane, nigga, you a toddler
Bitch nigga, you my son so they make me a father

I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a hoe (Huh?)

Blueface, baby
Yeah, yeah, aight
Bitch, I'm a Loc, MAC with the scope
I am big homie, one phone call they go
Pick the wrong side, Glock put him court side
Now he watchin' this shoot from the flo'
Ooh, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, let me switch the flow
Choppa got a choppa, make a wrong move, bet he pop ya'
Bitch call me daddy, bitch call me papa
That boy baloney, bitch, I'm vegan
You now if I hit it, then it was on camera
Hopped off the bus then hopped in a Porsche (Panamera)
Forgi's, sittin' on a four piece with a biscuit
I play with fire, sometimes I burn bridges
Bet you ain't ever met a nigga love swimmin'
Pull up like Tracy McGrady from the Pistons
Gotta keep a pistol for a fuck nigga dissin'
Bet this choppa make him dance like a disco

I am a menace, keep me a rack just like tennis
I'm with the shit like I'm Dennis
I started this shit I'ma finish
Niggas be hatin', tryna blemish my image
Who want the smoke? .223 came with the scope
Extended clip long as a rope
We wipe his nose, just like he had him a cold
I knew that boy was a hoe

I might just OD, Percs killin' me slowly
Feelin' like I'm Kobe, can't nann nigga hold me
If he wanna run up on me, shoot 'em like Ginobili
And I'm with the shit, lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, yeah
And I'm with the shit, lil' homie, yeah, like I'm Toby, yeah, bitch
(Like I'm, Toby, yeah, like a school shooter named Toby)
Yeah, yeah yeah
Keep all that Tay, yeah
Ay Tay, keep all that
Keep all that, yeah, yeah
