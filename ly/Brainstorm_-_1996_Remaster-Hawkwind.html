		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing on the runway
Waiting for takeoff
I wanna fly
Wanna watch me flake off
I can't move 'cause 
The man has a rake off
You gotta help me
Help me to shake off

This body of mine
I wanna get out of this void
(Body of mine) and I don't wanna be destroyed
(Body of mine) I don't wanna turn android
(Body of mine) You gotta help me avoid that

Brainstorm, here I go
Brainstorm, flying low
Brainstorm, I wanna miss it
Brainstorm, you'd bet I'd kiss it

I can't get no peace 
Until I get into motion
Sign my release from 
This planet's erosion
Paranoia police have 
Sussed out my potion
You gotta help me or 
There'll be an explosion

In this body of mine 
I wanna get out of this void
(Body of mine) and I don't wanna be destroyed
(Body of mine) I don't wanna turn android
(Body of mine) You gotta help me avoid that

Brainstorm, here I go
Brainstorm, flying low
Brainstorm, I wanna miss it
Brainstorm, you'd bet I'd kiss it

I'm breaking up
I'm falling fast
I'm floati~ing aw~ay...

I can't get no peace 
Until I get into motion
Sign my release from 
This planet's erosion
Paranoia police have 
Sussed out my potion
You gotta help me or 
There'll be an explosion

In this body of mine 
I wanna get out of this void
(Body of mine) and I don't wanna be destroyed
(Body of mine) I don't wanna turn android
(Body of mine) You gotta help me avoid that

Brainstorm, here I go
Brainstorm, flying low
Brainstorm, not gonna miss it
Brainstorm, you'd bet I'd kiss it
