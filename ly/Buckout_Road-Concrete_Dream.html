		  BUCKOUT ROAD

In the whip of her man she was rolling a blunt of the strong
In the dark of the night on a trip that was taking too long
He was messing around with her saying they ran out of gas
Shorty said don’t fuck around or tonight you ain’t getting this ass
He said baby just chill the highway’s just over the hill
You’re being ungrateful all night i’m just trying to show you a thrill
This ain’t her kind of place this ain’t her kind of fun
Emotions take control she feels like she needs to 

Run
For your life
From the knife
Now’s the time in the dead of the night I said

Run
For your life
Through the night
Now’s the time in the dead of the night

Run
Run and hide
No disguise
Scream and cry or you’ll meet your demise I said

Run
Run and hide
No disguise
Scream and cry or you’ll meet your demise

She choked up, she hesitated and stood still
Still loves him still trusts him maybe shouldn’t still
She’s always texting her friends
I wish the date would just end
I’m always checking her friends
That’s when the problems began
He told her put it down she wouldn’t hear it
He grabbed it from her palm and disappeared it
She blacked out, she lashed out and then turned the wheel
Going off the road going to crash now when the tires peel

Someone will blame this on me
Thinking I bashed in her teeth
There’s blood on the seat
Plus there’s a trunk full of weed
Going to end this bitch right now
Going to end this bitch right now
Going to leave her right here
And then I know I have to

Run
For your life
From the knife
Now’s the time in the dead of the night I said

Run
For your life
Through the night
Now’s the time in the dead of the night

Run
Run and hide
No disguise
Scream and cry or you’ll meet your demise I said

Run
Run and hide
No disguise
Scream and cry or you’ll meet your demise

BREAKDOWN:
Through the trees and the dirt
Through the leaves and the bush
Run
Through the dead of the night
Run
‘Til the full moon rise

I’m fuckin’ lost and this bitch fucked me over
The cops are going to fucking lock me up
I’m going to lose it I don’t know where the fuck I’m going
This fuckin’ bitch got me all fucked up
It’s fuckin’ cold outside
I got no weed
I got one fuckin’ shoe
And my fuckin’ car all fucked up
I’m bleeding out the side
I’m probably going to die
Should’ve listened to fucking Juan
Juan said “Don’t go driving down on Buckout no one ever drives on Buckout”
I was like “No I’m going to take a ride on Buckout, smoke a blunt we’re gonna chill”
Now I’m fuckin’ stuck here
I got fuckin’ birds, mosquitos, fuckin’ trees
Fuckin’ wind’s blowing
Mother fuckin’ Blair Witch Project and shit
I’m from the fuckin’ projects
Get me the fuck out of this bitch
Man, what the fuck?
