		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking in the eyes of a broken dream
Another new plan torn at the seams
(And) I don't know if it's all been me
Or someone else pulling at my strings
Living everyday like it's on repeat
Another played out dead end routine
Stuck in place as the walls close in
Plotting out my escape again

Crawling my way from a prison cell
No one can save me but myself
I know there's something more that I'm missing
(Hoping to find my place somewhere)

Staring right into the sun
Looking for the ending before it's begun
I just need a reason to bleed
It feels like my heart's going numb

I'm losing my place when I gave it all
It's Pushing my back up against the wall
When it takes everything to survive
It's hard enough just to feel alive
Every new scar that I try to hide
I need a way out but I'm out of time
I know there's something
holding me here at the bottom
(Hoping to find my place somewhere)

Staring right into the sun
Looking for the ending before it's begun
I just need a reason to bleed
It feels like my heart's going numb

The hues quickly change in my eyes
Kaleidoscope visions invade my mind
Leaving perception behind
Going blind now
Turn the lights out

Turn the Lights out as it fades to black now
I can't breathe help me crawl my way back out
This silence keeps screaming so loud
Going blind now, turn the lights out!

Staring right into the sun
Looking for the ending before it's begun
I just need a reason to bleed
It feels like my heart's going numb

Staring right into the sun (Staring right into)
Looking for the ending before it's begun (The ending before it's begun)
I just need a reason to bleed
It feels like my heart's going numb

Hearts going numb.
