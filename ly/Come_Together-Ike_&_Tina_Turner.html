		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

Here come old flat top
He come groovin' up slowly
He's got ju-ju eyeball
He one holy roller
He's got hair down to his knee
He's got to be a joker
He just do what he please

Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

He wear no shoeshine
He's got toe jam football
He's got monkey finger
He shoot Coca-Cola
He says I know you, you know me
It's one thing I can tell you is
You got to be free
Come together, right now
Over me

Shoot me
Shoot me
Shoot me

He bag production
He's got walrus gumboot
He's got Ono psycho
He one spinal cracker
He's got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his arms 'til
You can feel his disease
Come together, right now
Over me

Shoot me

Shoot me

He roller coaster
He's got early warning
He's got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He says one and one and one is three
Got to be good looking
'Cause he's so hard to see
Come together, right now
Over me

Shoot me
Uh
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
