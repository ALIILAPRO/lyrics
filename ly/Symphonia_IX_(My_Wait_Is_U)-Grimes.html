		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I try and try to make you cry
And make you love me
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say yes

The need to be the best before the need to rest
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say yes

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait
(To be in a dark side, be in a deep mind)

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait
(To be in a dark side, be in a deep mind)

To make the pain defuse the flame can be trying
But I would say yes, oh I would say yes
So as you fade away alive, I lay dying
Oh I would say yes
Oh I would say!

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait
(To be in a dark side, to be in a deep mind)

See, my wait is you
My wait is you
My wait is you
My wait
(To be in a dark side, to be in a deep mind)
