		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never learned from my mistakes
Until I'm too late to do anything
A screen glows in a dark room
Laptop talk of a change that never came
Oh no, no, no

So console me
Just what to do and how to fix it, I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh, they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along, oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends

I'm just reading about flaws that I didn't know I had
Watching ads for things I didn't know I need
Oh no, no, no
Pour a drink just to stop the shakes
Blowing smoke until my eyes bleed
Mm, mm, mm, mm

Oh console me
Just what to do and how to fix it, I'm lonely
Sitting in this crowded room

All of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh, they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along, oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends

Sometimes you gotta leave that city to love that city and start all over again
But it doesn't look so pretty to get your hands dirty and start all over again
You gotta leave that city to love that city or else you might get trapped
Oh, you might get trapped
Just like all of my
Just like all of my

Ooh!
Oh, just like all of my best friends
Like to go and get fucked up
Then they talk about all the lives they never got to live
Oh, they're still waiting for some sort of invitation
It's never coming along, oh no, you'll get just what you give
Getting high with your best friends
