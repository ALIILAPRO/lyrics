		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Keep it rockin', doin' the same thing
And we get high on the breakdown
And we're just watching from the same time
But that don't change what I think now
And we were talking 'bout the same crime
No, we don't hide when it rains now
I learned my lesson at the same time
Ooh, where did it

Go, back on 74 (when I noticed you)
Call this place my home
Never gonna cry anymore
Where did it all

Keep it rockin', doin' the same thing
And we get high on the break down
And we're just watching from the same time
But that don't change what I think now
And we were talking 'bout the same crime
No, we don't hide when it rains now
I learned my lesson at the same time
Ooh, where did it

Go, back on 74 (when I noticed you)
Call this place my home
Never gonna cry anymore
Where did it all

Go, let it go
Let it go
Ooh, let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Ooh

Go, back on 74 (when I noticed you)
Call this place my home
Never gonna cry anymore
Where did it all

Go, let it go
Let it go
Ooh, let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Where did it all

Go, back on 74 (when I noticed you)
Call this place my home
Never gonna cry anymore
Where did it all
Go, back on 74 (let it go, let it go)
Call this place my home (ooh, let it go)
Never gonna cry anymore (let it go, let it go)
Where did it all (ooh)

Go, back on 74
Call this place my home
Never gonna cry anymore
Where did it all
