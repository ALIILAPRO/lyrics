		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anytime I need to see your face 
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings
Take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight 
And if it happens again
I may move so slightly 
To the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to, I want to

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you 
When I get to you

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (ooh I, ooh I)

I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy getting perfect is what I live for
But a look and then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor
And I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place in the interaction
Of a lover and a mate but the time of talking
Using symbols, using words can be likened
To a deep sea diver who is swimming with a raincoat

Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you 
When I get to you

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (ooh I, ooh I)

(Ooh) Yeah, yeah
(Ooh) Yeah, yeah

Anytime I need to see your face 
I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place
Where your crystal mind and magenta feelings
Take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight 
And if it happens again
I may move so slightly 
To the arms and the lips and the face
Of the human cannonball that
I need to, I want to

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (ooh I, ooh I)
(So can we find out?)

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (ooh I, ooh I)

Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (I'd die to find out)
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but (gonna kill me by now)
Ooh, I'd die to find out (ooh I, ooh I)
