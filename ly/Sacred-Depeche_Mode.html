		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sacred, holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
But it's my duty
I'm a missionary

So here is my confession
It's an obsession
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I've made my decision
This is religion
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout

Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

Sacred, holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground
But it's my duty
I'm a missionary

Spreading the news around the world
Taking the word to boys and girls
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I will go down on my knees
When I see beauty
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout

Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

Sacred holy
To put it in words
To write it down
That is walking on hallowed ground 
But it's my duty 
I'm a missionary

Sacred, holy
Sacred, holy
Sacred (to put it in words, to write it down)
Holy (that is walking on hallowed ground)
Sacred (to put it in words, to write it down)
Holy (that is walking on hallowed ground)
Sacred (to put it in words, to write it down)
Holy (that is walking on hallowed ground)
Sacred (to put it in words, to write it down)
Holy (that is walking on hallowed ground)
Sacred (to put it in words, to write it down)
Holy (that is walking on hallowed ground)
Sacred (to put it in words)
