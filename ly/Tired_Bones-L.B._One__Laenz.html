		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's not like the other boys
He was taught to act like them
Damn his luck, he never could belong

Racing cars was not his thing
Not an actor that could sing
But it was something that he felt so strong

Hey child, live now
If you free your mind you'll fly higher than the sun
Lay ground, go out
Change the world to fly higher than the sun

Well on your way
You'll be the change
Of everything that you disliked before
And on your way
You'll make mistakes
The only lessons that you learn are when you fall

Now he's older and he knows
Being different made him strong
Flying solo was the way to go
Finally coming to his own
Ain't no shade can touch his soul
He is home wherever he may go

Hey child, live now
If you free your mind you'll fly higher than the sun
Lay ground, go out
Change the world to fly higher than the sun

Well on your way
You'll be the change
Of everything that you disliked before
And on your way
You'll make mistakes
The only lessons that you learn are when you fall
