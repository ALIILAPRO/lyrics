		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The more you wait, the more you break
The longer that it takes to undo
All the knots that you've been tying
On cherry stems and black barbed wire too

You work all day to find religion
And end up standing in your kitchen
Wondering 'bout the way it's always been

I'm a firefighter and I can't stop it
They fan the flames higher than rockets
And leave you standing on an open plane

Begging for rain, oh
Begging for rain

I feel it all and I can't stop it
Wish that I could turn my faucet loose
And all my friends who keep on calling
Like nothing's wrong and asking me what's new

And I try my best to not be bitter
Give my rage a babysitter
Stop waiting for the adults to come home
It's a firework and you can't stop it
I'm cutting holes in all the pockets
Of everyone that's calling me insane
Waiting for rain, oh

Begging for rain

I keep waiting
I keep waiting
I keep waiting
