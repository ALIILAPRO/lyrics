		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder how your body tastes
Inside of someone else's place
Pull away your eyes it's nothing left to heal
I'm alone, but I know everything you feel

And you waited all the rain
For tears my heart has caged
And we fall from fate
But we raise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Tell me how you close the door
Knowin' nobody can love you more
Telling all your friends that this love is just made for bleeding
Hung up underwater but still keep on, try to breathe in

And you waited on the rain
For tears my heart is caged
And we fall from fate
But we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run

Our laws are fading
Tied up and changed
And you waited on the rain
For tears my heart is caged
And we fall from fate
But we rise and rise again

And I run, run, run, run, run
And I run, run, run, run, run
I run, run, run, run, run
I just run, run, run
