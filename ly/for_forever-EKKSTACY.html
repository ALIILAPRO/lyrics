		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I keep way too much in my head
And I know that, and I know that
I stay away from things I should love
And I know that, and I know that
When I love, they always go
And I know that, and I know that

Oh, oh oh, oh

I keep way too much in my head
And I know that, and I know that
I stay away from things I should love
And I know that, and I know that
When I love, they always go
And I know that, and I know that

Oh, oh oh, oh
