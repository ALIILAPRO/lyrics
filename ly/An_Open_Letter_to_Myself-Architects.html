		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always the one with a face on
Always the one with never enough
He was the boy that broke your trust
Because he was never around enough
We sit around and hear these stories
Wishing we were somewhere else
How I wish that I could find the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

I was the one with the face on
I was the one with never enough
I was the boy that broke your trust
Because I was never around enough
I sit around and tell these stories
Wishing I was somewhere else
Oh how I wish I found the words to save this

My so called friend
My so called friend

I wish I found the words to save this
I'm pushing it out, out
Find the words to save this
I'm pushing it out, out, out

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again

My so called friend
My so called friend
When will we see you again
When will we see you again
