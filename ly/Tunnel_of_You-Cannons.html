		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, why don't you come around, I miss you, babe
Stay, and lift me up, don't let me hit the ground
'Cause I've been walking past midnight
And I've been talking to the moon about you

Ooh, There's nothing I can do
I'm falling into the tunnel of you
Into the tunnel of you
Ooh, there's nothing I can do
I'm falling into the tunnel of you
Into the tunnel of you

Cry, I'll save my tears for when the summers dry
Over you, you hurt me most when I am close to you
A thousand storms that rage in my heart
A million more to break out love apart

Ooh, there's nothing I can do
I'm falling into the tunnel of you
Into the tunnel of you
Ooh, there's nothing I can do
I'm falling into the tunnel of you
Into the tunnel of you
