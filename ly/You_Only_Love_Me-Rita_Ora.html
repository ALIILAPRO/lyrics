		  (Rita, it's me)

I'm outside your house again, freezing in the cold
Waiting for the moment I learn to let go
I've been messed up a thousand times with tears in my eyes
But all the pain, it fades away, when you say it right

I try, I try and I try
To tell myself it's alright
'Cause I'm terrified

You only love me when the
Whiskey's pouring
Four in the morning
You only love, you only love
You only love me when the
Night is over
No one to hold ya
You only love, you only love
You only love me when the

The, you're the
The, you're the
The, you're the
You only love me when the
The, you're the
The, you're the
The, you're the
You only love me when the

I can't believe you look at me the way I look at you
'Cause no one's ever loved me like the way that you do
I've been messed up a thousand times, but you make it right
And even on my darkest days, you show me the light

I try, I try and I try
To tell myself it's alright
'Cause I'm terrified

You only love me when the
Whiskey's pouring
Four in the morning
You only love, you only love
You only love me when the
Night is over (yeah, yeah)
No one to hold ya (whoa, whoa)
You only love, you only love
You only love me when the

The, you're the (Ah, yeah)
The, you're the
The, you're the
You only love me when the
The, you're the (oh, yeah)
The, you're the (oh oh
The, you're the

You only love me when the
Whiskey's pouring
Four in the morning
You only love, you only love
You only love me when the
Night is over
No one to hold ya (yeah, yeah)
You only love, you only love
You only love me when the

(This is how I am, and this is how you are)
