		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  IT'S BEEN YOU AND ME FOREVER
HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
WE WERE INNOCENT AND TENDER
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE 

EVERYTHING IS AN ILLUSION
TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS TO LOVE
IS THERE ANY RESOLUTION
COULD HE TRULY BE THE ONE

I DON'T WANT TO BE WITHOUT YOU
AM I MEANT TO BE ALONE
DO YOU WANT TO BE WITHOUT ME
DO YOU WANT TO BE ALONE
