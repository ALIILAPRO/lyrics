		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you…
Can you be mine?
You need someone like me in your life
And I been thinking about time
So we can make some plans tonight
What you wanna do
Cause I can take you anywhere you want to go
Want to go…
And you been in my dreams
That's why I been thinking that you're the one
And I hate..
That your not with me right now
And I can't push myself I'm just confused
At least this time you don't leave you
Tell the truth
Can you be mine?
You need someone like me in your life
And I been thinking about time
So we can make some plans tonight
What you wanna do
Cause I can take you anywhere you want to go
Want to go…
And you been in my dreams
That's why I been thinking that you're the one
And I hate..
That your not with me right now
And I can't push myself I'm just confused
At least this time you don't leave you
Tell the truth
Tell the truth
Ooo….
