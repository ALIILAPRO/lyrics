		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let me tell you a secret
Put it in your heart and keep it
Something that I want you to know
Do something for me
Listen to my simple story
And maybe we'll have something to show

You tell me you're cold on the inside
How can the outside world
Be a place that your heart can embrace
Be good to yourself
'Cause nobody else
Has the power to make you happy

How can I help you?
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain 
That you're feeling inside
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine

He must have really hurt you
To make you say the things that you do
He must have really hurt you
To make those pretty eyes look so blue

He must have known
That he could
That you'd never leave him
Now you can't see my love is good
And that I'm not him

How can I help you?
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
Don't you let me inside?
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine

Won't you let me in
Let this love begin
Won't you show me your heart now
I'll be good to you
I can make this thing true
Show me that heart right now

Who needs a lover
That can't be a friend 
Something tells me I'm the one you've been looking for
Oh, if you ever should see him again
Won't you tell him you've found someone who gives you more
Someone who will protect you
Love and respect you
All those things
That he never could bring to you
Like I do 
Or rather I would
Won't you show me your heart
Like you should

How can I help you?
Please let me try to
I can heal the pain
That you're feeling inside?
Whenever you want me
You know that I will be
Waiting for the day
That you say you'll be mine

Won't you let me in
Let this love begin
Won't you show me your heart now
I'll be good to you
I can make this thing true
And get to your heart somehow
