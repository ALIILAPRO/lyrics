		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down the coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
(With my eyes on you)
With my eyes on you
(With my eyes on you)

Speakin' of the coast, remember Pfeiffer Beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God I saw
All I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you
(With my eyes on you)
Yeah, with my eyes on you
(With my eyes on you)

And don't you remember Times Square?
And people countin' down everywhere
Two thousand whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause, baby, you were there
And once again
Couldn't help but stare

No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you

Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you

Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
