		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got the news just last month
That I am exhausting and you're not in love
Didn't say it in those words
But I know how your tone works
You're MIA, running so free
Calling your ex, forgetting 'bout me
But I know you could never
Yeah, I know you remember

So, I'm feeling and I'm dealing with the heart you broke
While you do press-ups and repress us and take off her clothes, oh
I'm hurting but I'm certain it's still true
I'm the best thing that almost happened to you

I know I'm obsessed and
Right now, I might be a mess but
One day, you're gonna wake up
And, oh shit, you lost the breakup
I'll smile and you'll have to face it
I'm the greatest love that you wasted
But, by then, I'll be far away (uh)
And, oh shit, you lost the breakup

But for now, I'm out in the dust
Falling apart
Oh, is she just like me? Yeah, I reckon
You got two types, Country and Western

So, I'm feeling and I'm dealing with the heart you broke
While you do press-ups and repress us and take off her clothes, oh
Here's something if nothing else is still true
I'm the best thing that almost happened to you

I know I'm obsessed and
Right now, I might be a mess but
One day, you're gonna wake up
And, oh shit, you lost the breakup
I'll smile and you'll have to face it
I'm the greatest love that you wasted
But, by then, I'll be far away (uh)
And, oh shit, you lost the breakup

Oh shit, you lost the breakup

You're gonna walk into some underground bar
You'll see a pretty little thing catching eyes in the dark
And it's me, I'll see you too, I'll wave
And I'm dancing over to you in the corner and you'll say
"Wow, hey, it's been forever
Do you wanna get a drink, like together?"
I say, "I'm kinda busy but like, stay in touch?"
I think, oh shit, I won the breakup

I'll smile and you'll have to face it
I'm the greatest love that you wasted
But, by then, I'll be far away (uh)
And, oh shit, you lost the breakup

And, oh shit, you lost the breakup
