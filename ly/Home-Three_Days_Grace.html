		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be coming home just to be alone
'Cause I know you're not there
And I know you don't care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a home

By the time you come home
I'm already stoned
You turn off the TV
And you scream at me
I can hardly wait
'Til you get off my case

No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a home

I'm better off alone

No matter how hard I try
You're never satisfied
This is not a home
I think I'm better off alone
You always disappear
Even when you're here
This is not my home
I think I'm better off alone
Home, home, this house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a 
Home, home
This house is not a home
