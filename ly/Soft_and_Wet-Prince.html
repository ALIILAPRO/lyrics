		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane
That I want to lose in you
Baby can you stand the pain
Hey, lover, sugar don't you see?
There's so many things that you do to me
Oh baby

All I want to see is the love in your eyes (hey, lover)
And all I want to hear is your sweet love sighs
All I want to feel is burning flames (hey, lover)
Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same
Tell me that you feel the same way I do
Tell me that you love me girl

We'd be so lost, in our mouths, the best, I feel it everyday (every way)
You feel so wrong, be alone, if you just follow somebody someday

Soft and wet
Soft and wet

Ah
Soft
Soft and wet

Every time I'm with you, you just love me to death
Oh wee, baby, you leave me without
Breath, ooh, baby, oh, yeah

You're just as soft as a lion tamed (hey, lover)
You're just as wet as the evening rain
How will I take it when you call my name? (hey, lover)
Your love is driving me
You're driving me insane
Crazy, baby
Oh, girl
Crazy 'bout your love

Soft and wet (you know)
You are soft and wet (oh, sugar)
Your love is soft and wet
Ooh, soft and wet
Ahh
