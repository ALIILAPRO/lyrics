		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can just hear them now
"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

(Feel like a brand new person)
But you'll make the same old mistakes
(I don't care, I'm in love)
Stop before it's too late
(I know, feel like a brand new person)
But you'll make the same old mistakes
(I finally know what it's like)
You don't have what it takes
Stop before it's too late
(I know) There's too much at stake
Making the same mistakes
(And I still don't know why it's happening)
Stop while it's not too late
(And I still don't know)

Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
The point is, I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

(Feel like a brand new person)
But you'll make the same old mistakes
(I don't care, I'm in love)
Stop before it's too late
(I know, feel like a brand new person)
But you'll make the same old mistakes
(I finally know what it's like)
You don't have what it takes
Stop before it's too late

Man, I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain't so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as a guess
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets

Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking that the only option)
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
(Stop thinking that the only option)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking that the only option)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking that the only option)
So how will I know that it's right?
