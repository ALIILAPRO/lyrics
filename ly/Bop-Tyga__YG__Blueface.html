		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bitch, you's a bop
I heard you be fuckin' with the opps
Heard you give it up on spot
I heard on the dick, you do the squats, yeah
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, you should already know though
And everybody know we give a fuck about no ho though

Bye, bye, bleed 'em
Ho, mistreat 'em
Only time I call 'em, for the threesome (gangs)
My own mama say I don't need 'em
Never turn a bop down, let her have freedom (yeah, yeah)
Got a grown man sleeping on your couch
They in, that's out (that's out)
Leaving your house, wit' your tracks coming out
They in, that's out (that's out)
I can't lie, girl you thugging (thugging)
You living life so rugged (so rugged)
Since you turned twenty-one, you be clubbing
Girl, how you supposed to get a hubby?
How you supposed to raise some kids 
And pay that light bill? (Light bill)
Cheating on your baby daddy in jail (in jail)
Hope the judge let him make bail
When he get out, he raising Hell

Bitch, you's a bop
I heard you be fuckin' with the opps
Heard you give it up on spot
I heard on the dick, you do the squats, yeah
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, you should already know though
And everybody know we give a fuck about no ho though

Bitch, you's a bop, bop, thot, thot
You always hoppin' on a new cock
Bitch, I'm a boss (boss), Ross (huh?)
Young nigga gettin' paid, Young Dolph (cash)
Hundreds in the vault, nigga, I'm a GOAT (whoa)
You don't want none, I'm the pope (phew)
Married to the money since a younging, we eloped
All about a loaf, for this bread get you toast (bow)
Bitches want to have a baby by me, it's a no (it's a no)
Bitch are you dumb? (Whoa) go (go)
Anyway, can I fuck your friend on the low? (Low)
When she hit the bathroom, slide me your phone
Slide on my knob (bop, bop, bop, bop, bop)
Bopper, spent a half a mili' on the watch
Got your nigga want to lock
And I heard you got new ass shots
If you can't fuck now, give me top

Bitch, you's a bop 
I heard you be fuckin' with the opps (bitch)
Heard you give it up on spot (hey)
I heard on the dick, you do the squats, yeah
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, you should already know though
And everybody know we give a fuck about no ho though

Blueface, baby (yeah aight)
Yeah aight, ooh, this a bop (ooh)
I hate a square bitch, I love me a thot (thot)
I'm a loc-ester, I stay on a bitch
Neck like two shows, five star, fettuccine
This bitch a boppalini, FN on me
I ain't talkin' Fendi, Bird Box, diamonds suicidal (suicidal)
Let a nigga reach and this bitch goin' viral
Forty popping like a thot on the 'Gram goin' viral
Bitch, you's a bop, on the gang (on the gang)
Beating up her guts while I'm throwing up the gang
On the gang (on the gang), on the

Bitch, you's a bop
I heard you be fuckin' with the opps
Heard you give it up on spot
I heard on the dick, you do the squats, yeah
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, bitch, you's a bop
Bitch, you's a bop, you should already know though
And everybody know we give a fuck about no ho though
