(La-la-la-la)

Fuck sick, apathy
You're way too good for me
You're better off all by yourself (you better off all by yourself)
Dark, cold, losin' sleep
You're way too cool for me
You're probably with somebody else

It's bad, bad blood
Livin' on in my veins
I don't know how I've changed, I don't
But that's bad blood
Drinkin' up on my pain
Whenever I hear your name, oh you're
Bad, bad blood (la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Bad, bad blood

Was I enough for you?
Doin' everything I was told to do
You never, ever seem to call (back, babe)
Am I not good for you?
'Cause I cried for help, and you still refused
You know you could've had it all

It's bad, bad blood
Livin' on in my veins
I don't know how I've changed, I don't
But that's bad blood
Drinkin' up on my pain
Whenever I hear your name, oh you're
Bad, bad blood (la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Bad, bad blood (la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)

What would it be?
Don't play with me (la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
A-B-O-B
Bitch, I don't bleed (bitch, I don't bleed)
Bitch, I don't bleed (la-la-la, la-la-la)
Girl, take a seat
Don't make a scene
Bitch, that might be, just what you need (just what you need)
Is that what you need?

It's bad, bad blood
Livin' on in my veins
I don't know how I've changed, I don't
But that's bad blood
Drinkin' up on my pain
Whenever I hear your name, oh you're
Bad, bad blood (la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
Bad, bad blood (la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)
