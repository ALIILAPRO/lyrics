		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay
Let's go

I'm a nutcase, bullets in your dead brains
Sucker left the ground all full of bowels and the blood stains
Shovel-up days, stuck up with that dumb gaze
Sick, I run away from all the problems I cannot face

I fucking hate flex, I'll kill your bitch next
See a bully, piece of fuck, I'm 'bout to break and slit necks
You pussy drop back, you wanna combat?
Put you in a grave, motherfucker, never come back

It's the Krueger in the speakers, now you all be calling Micah's, uh
Coming with that dagger, bitch, I cuff up all the fuckers, uh
Pop, drop, it's a motherfucking genocide
Coming out the cemetery, coming out to blow your mind
I'm the master of the puppets, bullets in my pockets
Looking for the pain, I kill so many, breaking records
My fucking neck hurts, killing with the daggers
Say my fucking name, bitch, I'm the beast among the wreckers

Now give me some scissors, I'm in the mood to do some surgery
Don't give a fuck 'bout you and don't give a fuck if you heard of me
It's gizmo the gremlin, I'm here to share my piece of mind
Motherfucker, you behind, I'm ahead, I skip the line
Beat it and suck it, then get up on my dick and fuck it
I pull out and bust it a hundred times into a bucket
Then I make a bitch chug it up out a motherfucking pitcher
She better hold it down just like some motherfucking liquor

In the mood to abuse, I beat a bitch 'til she puke
The violent nature amused, the way I act and I move
Death is all around me, all up on me it's glued
Ain't no way you'd ever last a single day in my shoes
In the mood to abuse I beat a bitch 'til she puke
The violent nature amused, the way I act and I move
Death is all around me, all up on me it's glued
Ain't no way you'd ever last a single day in my shoes

Deep inside of your grave

You think it's easy, fool
Try to look into my eyes
All this shit we've been through
Feel like an Antichrist
I'm 'bout to drown in pool
I see coming demise
I'm becoming the ghoul
I think I'm scared of the lights
