		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Verse 1]
Bitch, I'm taking off, I'm floating out of space (Out of space)
Spent too many racks, designer on my waist (On my waist)
Shawty said she feeling me, wanna ride my wave (Wanna ride my wave)
She could be my everything, she just wanna be saved (she wanna be saved)
I don't need no new friends I'm cooling with my gang (My gang)
Bitch, I'm all about my money I don't play (Don't play)
Said baby please don't leave, she want me to stay (Want me to stay)
Shorty fell in love with me, I just want that cake (Just want that cake)

[Chorus]
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)

[Verse 2]
Niggas switched up for some views (Some views)
I can see the way they move (move)
I just stay away from my blessings
Don't got nothing to prove (prove)
You really wifing that hoe? (that hoe)
She just finished up the crew (crew)
Imma take over the world
You gon' see me on the news (the news)

[Interlude]
They showin fake love but its cool
I shine in the dark like a jewel
I'm dripping, she wet like a pool
I got this shit right out of school
I'm taking off I'm floating out of space (Out of space)
Too many racks designer on my waist

[Chorus]
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
Just know (Just know, just know, just know)
