		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got all the lights on me
Blinded, I can barely see
Know that's where I wanna be
Right here next to you
In this crowded room

I don't wanna lose it tonight
Lose it tonight
Lose this feeling

I don't wanna know what it's like
Know what it's like
To lose this feeling

Lose this feeling

I don't wanna lose it tonight
Lose it tonight
Lose this feeling

I don't wanna know what it's like
Know what it's like
To lose this feeling

Finally I found a place
Makes me feel my heart won't break
All I know I'm gonna stay
I'm gonna stay with you

I don't wanna lose it tonight
Lose it tonight
Lose this feeling

I don't wanna know what it's like
Know what it's like to
Know what it's like to
Know what it's like to
Lose this feeling

Lose this feeling

I don't wanna lose it tonight
Lose it tonight
Lose this feeling

I don't wanna know what it's like
Know what it's like
To lose this feeling

I don't wanna lose it tonight
Lose it tonight
Lose this feeling

I don't wanna know what it's like
Know what it's like
To lose this feeling
