		  Mmh-da-da-da
Mmh-da-da-da-da
Mmh-da-da-da-da
And it's sad, da-da-da-da
And it's sad, da-da-da-da
And it's sad, da-da-da-da
And it's sad, da-da-da-da
Mhm-hmm-hmm
Mhm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Hmm, hmm

Oh, my heart is soarin' (soarin')
Oh, I hear you callin' (hmm)
Put your hands all on me (on me)
Fallin', I'm fallin' (hmm)
Touch my skin so softly (hmm)
You're the sweetest melody (oh)
Thank God I found you

These things inside, you know them now
I see you, you see me
Ignite the love
I see you, sweet ol' love of mine
A love story by
It's just you and I

Hmm, ooh, I need your body
Ooh, let me have you please (yeah)
Leave that stress behind ya
Ooh, you said to me (woah)
Hmm, been waitin' for so fuckin' long (come on)
Fallin' from the sky to me, angel wings (yeah)
Let's dream away, we in a special zone (uh)
Got you close to me, it's just the little thing

These things inside, you know them now
I see you, you see me
Ignite the love
I see you, sweet ol' love of mine
A love story by
It's just you and I (you and I)

(You and I)
