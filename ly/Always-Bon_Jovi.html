		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This Romeo is bleeding but you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see, I've always been a fighter
But without you, I give up

Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me

Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always

I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always

Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh
Some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye

What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
Touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers, try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man

When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words
You've been needing to hear, I'll wish I was him
'Cause those words are mine, to say to you
'Til the end of time

And I will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always

If you told me to cry for you, I could
If you told me to die for you, I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you

Well, there ain't no luck in these loaded dice
But baby, if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams and our old lives
We'll find a place, where the sun still shines

Yeah, I will love you, baby
Always and I'll be there
Forever and a day, always

I'll be there 'til the stars don't shine
'Til the Heavens burst and the words don't rhyme
I know when I die you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you always
Always
