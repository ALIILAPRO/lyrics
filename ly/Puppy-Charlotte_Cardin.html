		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Foot down heavy like I'm tryna crash
I let the pictures of us fly off the dash
Watch the rear view mirror fade into black
I'm tryna run from a version of me stuck in the past

It's a new sensation
I got no expectations
Sick of your suffocation
You pushed me over the edge
I'm holding onto the ledge

But it's alright
I'm in a good state of mind
Like a puppy at the window
I just wanna feel the wind blow
Yeah, it's alright
I'm in a good state of mind
Already cried all I could cry for
You couldn't faze me if you tried, boy

I'm seeing brand new colors and I'm watching 'em melt
Into a distant future I painted myself
And I can barely reach you, but I know that it's there
Because tonight's my last night gasping for air

It's a new sensation
I got no expectations
Sick of your suffocation
You pushed me over the edge
I'm holding onto the ledge

But it's alright (yeah, it's alright)
I'm in a good state of mind (good state of mind)
Like a puppy at the window (it's alright)
I just wanna feel the wind blow (oh)
Yeah, it's alright (alright, it's alright)
I'm in a good state of mind (good state of mind)
Already cried all I could cry for (it's alright)
You couldn't faze me if you tried, boy (oh)
It's alright

Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
Puppy in the air
It's alright (puppy in the air)
You pushed me over the edge (puppy in the air)
I'm holding onto the ledge (puppy in the air)

But it's alright
I'm in a good state of mind
Like a puppy at the window
I just wanna feel the wind blow
Yeah, it's alright (it's alright)
I'm in a good state of mind (good state of mind)
Already cried all I could cry for (it's alright)
You couldn't faze me if you tried, boy (oh)
It's alright
