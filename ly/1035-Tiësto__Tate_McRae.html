		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me

Every day, I go places in my head
Darker thoughts are harder now, they look like monsters under my bed
And every time, it's like a rocket through my chest
The TV make you think the whole world's about to end

I don't know where this night is going (going)
But I know that you and me got something (something)
So many things that I'm afraid of (I'm afraid of)
But right now, I ain't scared of nothing
('Cause all I know is)
('Cause all I know is, all I-, all I-)

'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry, just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me

Every night, I go places in my dreams
So many never-ending alleyways, I don't know what it means
But this is it, I know the sun'll wake me up
Tell me I'd be dumb to not get what I want

I don't know where this night is going
But I know that you and me got something
So many things that I'm afraid of
But right now, I ain't scared of nothing
('Cause all I know is, all I-, all I-)

'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thanking, thanking God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry (yeah), just pass the bottle (oh)
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me

Oh-oh, oh
It's 10:35, oh-ooh
10:35, oh
Know it's 10:35 (oh)
Know it's 10:35 (oh)
