		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no,
Here it is again
I need to know
When I will fall in decay

Something wrong
With every plan of my life
I didn't really notice that you've been here

Dolefully desired
Destiny of a lie

Set me free
Your heaven's lie
Set me free with you love
Set me free

Oh no,
Here it is again
I need to know
Why did I choose to betray you

Something wrong
With all the plans of my life
I didn't realize that you've been here

Dolefully desired
Destiny of a lie

Set me free
Your heaven's lie
Set me free with you love
Set me free

Set me free your heaven's lie
Set me free with you love
Set me free
