		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Always think about you, always
Thought I had a life I could grow with you
But as time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feeling like a shockwave without you
Always think about you, always
Thought I had a life I could grow with you
But as time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feeling like a shockwave without you

Always think about you, always
Thought I had a life I could grow with you
As time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feeling like a shockwave without you

Feeling like a shockwave, shockwave, shockwave, shockwave
Shockwave, shockwave, shockwave, shockwave

Ooh yeah, babe, get 'em with the shockwave
Ooh yeah, babe, get 'em with the shockwave

Shockwave without you
Shockwave without you

Always think about you, always
Thought I had a life I could grow with you
But as time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feeling like a shockwave without you
Always think about you, always
Thought I had a life I could grow with you
But as time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feeling like a shockwave without you

Always think about you, always
Thought I had a life I could grow with you
As time fades, crazy how our lives changed
Feeling like a shockwave without you

Feeling like a shockwave, shockwave, shockwave, shockwave
Shockwave, shockwave, shockwave, shockwave

Ooh yeah, babe, get 'em with the shockwave

Shockwave without you
Shockwave without you
