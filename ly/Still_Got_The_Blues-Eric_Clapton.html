		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It used to be so easy, give my heart away
I found out the hard way
There's a price I have to pay
I found in that love is no friend of mine
I should have known better, time after time

It was so long, so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

It used to be so easy, fall in love again
I found out the hard way
It's a road that leads to pain
I found then that love was more than just a game
I was playin' to win
But losin' just the same

It was so long, so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

So many years since I've seen your face
Here in my heart there's an empty space
Where you used to be

Well, it was so long, so long ago
But I've still got the blues for you

Though the days come and go
There is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you
