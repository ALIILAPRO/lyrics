		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been looking so long for you 
Now you won't get away from my grasp
I've lived so long in hiding
In hiding behind that false mask
And I know that you know 
That I ain't got long now to last
My looks and my feelings 
Are just the remains of my past

I'm standing in the wings there
I wait for the curtain to fall
In knowing the terror and holding 
I have on you all
Yeah, you know that I'm going to scratch you 
And maim you and maul
And you know you're helpless 
From my mesmerizing catcall

Keep your distance, walk away
Don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away
Watch your step, he's out to get you
Come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way

You're running and hiding 
In dreams, I'm always there
I'm the phantom of the opera
I'm the devil, I'm just out to scare
I damaged your mind and your soul
It just floats through the air
I haunt you, I taunt you
I torture you back at my lair
