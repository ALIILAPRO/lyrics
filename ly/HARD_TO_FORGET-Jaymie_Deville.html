		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess we'll never know
All of things we could be I guess we'll never know
You didn't know what you had, well maybe now you know
Baby, you're no good for me, gotta let it go
(Gotta let it go)
Yeah, you were the one I used to call
Everyday back then
I be in and out for hours never wanted it to end
You were staying at your parents
I was living with a friend
You were the one I used to call everyday back then
Couple hundred in the club
Didn't matter in the end
Cause, I never needed anyone but you by my side
I gave it up, I gave it all for you, woman
I gave it up so I could always there for you
I'd buy you things even though I can't afford it
Cause, there ain't nobody that ever came before you.
I put my friends and my family aside
I ran away just to stay another night.
My ex-friends think I live another life.
It's just the way,
The way you look at me
I see your other side
It's just the way
The way you look at me
I see your other side
And it makes you hard to forget
All around in my head
And, I will never regret
Baby, when we first met, yeah
Party with a room full of women
Got a room full of women
You're hard to forget baby
Believe it when I say it,
I had to pretend that you were one of them
Pop-a-bottle with a room full of woman
I pop another and I know I'm gonna regret it
I'll be up late and there's no doubt about it
Yeah,
It's what you do to me
You can't lie to a man
Then expect him to really understand, huh?
This is what you do to me
You can't turn and round leave
Then get mad if he does my own thing, huh?
This is what you do to me
You can't run the same play
Cause, the last time
You gave it all away now
This is what you do to me
Yeah
It's just the way
The way you look at me
I see your other side
It's just the way
They way you look at me
I see your other side
Yeah
Yeah
I guess we'll never know
Yeah
Yeah
And it makes you hard to forget
