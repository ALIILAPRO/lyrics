		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me that I'm your anchor
Your metre of platinum
That I'm just a way you can measure
The changes that happen

Keep me inside of your cage
While you go floating away
You'll miss me some of these days
Anny

Write me a letter from London
And we'll meet in Paris
We'll be much fatter by then
From keeping old habits

Keep me inside of your cage
While you go floating away
You'll miss me some of these days
Anny

I will just go on existing
From a distance
Writing about all the ways
I made no difference

Keep me inside of your cage
While you go floating away
You'll miss me some of these days
Anny
