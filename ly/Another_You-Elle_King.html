		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know what you have 'til it's gone
Best I ever had to the worst that makes me mad
From moving way too fast to moving on
Whispers of the past, like scars that ever last

And then you send me that shit
Why'd you send me that message?
Won't you show some respect
To that chick you tryna mess with
Baby, don't you remember
Only took you 'bout a minute
To go make a bad decision

Maybe you ain't heard the news
Now I got another you
Only took about a week or two
It wasn't hard to fill your shoes
Now I got another you

I don't need to hear anything
'Cause all your second chances, you just took advantage
Oh boy, there's a damage helping hands
Now I gotta admit it, but man, it did my head in

When you send me that shit
Why'd you send me that message?
Won't you show some respect
To that chick you tryna mess with
Baby, don't you remember
Only took you about a minute
To go make a bad decision

Maybe you ain't heard the news
Now I got another you
Only took about a week or two
It wasn't hard to fill your shoes
Now I got another you
Now I got another you

I hope you find another me someday
Hope you find another love that's great
I hope you find another me someday
Hope you find another love that's great
I hope you find another me someday (someday)
Hope you find another love that's great
And when you find another me someday (someday)
You'll probably fuck it up the same old way

Maybe you ain't heard the news
Now I got another you
Only took about a week or two
It wasn't hard to fill your shoes
Now I got another you
Now I got another you
Now I got another you
