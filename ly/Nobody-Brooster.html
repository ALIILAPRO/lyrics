		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy (nobody)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better than you

Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy (nobody)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better than you

Ain't nobody

Ain't nobody

I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song

You filled my heart with a kiss
You gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy (nobody)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better than you

Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better (loves me better)
Makes me happy (nobody)
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody (nobody)
Loves me better than you

Ain't nobody

Ain't nobody
