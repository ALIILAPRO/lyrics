		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know its late now
I shouldn't call but
It's kinda got to me tonight
I'm feeling numb but
It's alright cuz
I know my words wont matter much
You got me thinking bout those times
When it was me and you
You got me tripping all night
And its hard for me too
You got me messing up mind
it aint right
But its true
I dont want to
But I need ya
So where are you
Where are you
Is there anybody out there
I'm second guessing
But I confess that
My heart wont stop refusing you
Back to the shoreline
And through the dark times
I know its hard to face the truth
When I need you the most
Every-time you're just gone 
So now I'm sitting at our place trynna write you this song
And I wont pick up the phone
Cuz I'll face it all wrong
Where are you
Where are you
So where are you
When I need you the most
Got to carry this load without ya
(I'm lost without ya)
And I'm sorry for
All the shit we went through
And the nights that I should've hold ya
I should've told ya
So where are you
So where are you
So where are you
