		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I pull up weed scented
Blowin' trees all in it
Look, it's still all good if you
Ain't seen me in a minute
West coast livin', west coast women
Midwest nigga doin' west coast business
I done seen it all see me off the net
Look like you seen a ghost
My niggas been down since day one
I gotta keep 'em close
I'm good with numbers
I can count it backwards
Ain't talkin' hood bitches when they
Pull up with the ratchets
I know the game like the back of my hand
Just gotta stick to the plan
Keep it clean, it's lower chances at jam
Roll another one
How can I fold? I'm my mother's son
Could never be convinced to take another run
You fuckin' dumb? Guess so
She don't wanna let go
Nigga, you can't roll if you
Ain't pinchin' on a petrol
No shorts on the money
You gotta make it right
Bought so many one time
The plug told me "Make the price"
Nigga, nice

While you talkin' it, I don't
Got time for that, i'm out here livin' it
(Oh woah)
And you know that we doin' them thangs
'cause we out here gettin' it
I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang i rep the gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, oh woah

Damn, it feel good to see Taylors up on it
And bringin' real ones to the forefront
My car filled up with smoke
2021 controlled by remotes
Them haters don't come close
Used to be hard to celebrate birthdays
Now it's champagne toast
Placin' bets, racin' jets
Pick a time to land
Five hundred grand to whoever
Get there the closest
Those are points of success when you
Put the plan in motion
You got one foot in, one out, I got both in
Able to hold shit down with more spin
Everybody got free will 'long as you
Willing to deal with the consequences
Lot of players at my dinner
That's a lot of dishes
And you the ones that gotta clean it

While you talkin' it, I don't
Got time for that, i'm out here livin' it
(Oh woah)
And you know that we doin' them thangs
'cause we out here gettin' it
I rep the gang, gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang i rep the gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang, oh woah
Everything is real, exactly how we claimed
Just got another strain, I just gotta name it
She used to smoke joints to "The Kid Frankie"
Wizzle got wings, Wizzle got everything
Ask Chevy Woods money good, can't complain
Real niggas ain't goin' out of style
We gon' stay here
