		  Junya Watanabe on my wri' (wri')
Junya Watanabe on my wri' (wri')
Tell 'em this, did he miss?
Junya Watanabe on my, mmh
I can't really see, where did I miss? (Mmh, mmh)

Ex-strippers (mmh, mmh)
New killers (mmh, mmh)
Chi' n- tell 'em (mmh, mmh)
This on Donda (mmh, mmh)
On my mama (mmh, mmh)
Made a promise (mmh)

Junya Watanabe on my wri'
Junya Watanabe on my wri'
Tell 'em this, did he miss? 
Junya Watanabe on my, mmh
I can't really see, where did I miss? (Mmh)
Junya Watanabe on my wri' (mmh, mmh)
Junya Watanabe on my

All summer (mmh, mmh)
All summer (mmh, mmh)
.45 gunners (mmh, mmh)
In pajamas (mmh, mmh)
They piranhas (mmh, mmh)
Buy out the store in hours like we planned it

Junya Watanabe on my wri'
Junya Watanabe on my wri'
Tell 'em this, did he miss?
Junya Watanabe on my, mmh
I can't really see, where did I miss? (Mmh)
Junya Watanabe on my wri'

For five summers, hold up, uh
For five summers, hold up 
For five summers, hold up, uh 
For five summers, hold up, uh 
We took over, hold up, uh 
We took over, hold up 
We took over, hold up 
We took over, hold up 

Born in Atlanta (mmh, mmh)
Not Montana (mmh, mmh)
'Scuse my manners (mmh, mmh)
I got standards

Uh, yeah, 'scuse my manners (mmh, mmh)
I got standards (mmh, mmh)
I got status (mmh, mmh)
You don't want static (mmh, mmh)

See more comments (mmh, mmh)
Than I see commas (mmh, mmh)
They going dummy (mmh, mmh)
We going Donda (mmh, mmh)
Let me be honest (mmh, mmh)
Let me be honest (mmh, mmh)
I won with the bucks, boy
Let me Giannis (mmh, mmh)
I won with the bucks, boy (mmh)
The spirit is on us (mmh, mmh)
The spirit of Donda

God's time can't fit on a wrist
Junya wanna have me on my wri', wri', wri', wri'
Move out of the way of my release (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tryna get me off my Qs and Ps (yeah, yeah, watch it)
Why can't losers never lose in peace? (Yeah, yeah, watch it)
Ain't nobody 'round me losing sleep
Better find God 'fore he find me
Tell the Devil good night, go to sleep
