		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why do people like stars, 
They're so far away
They're always there and safe to look at, 
Wish upon one
I could have been you in that fantasy, 
Far away from here

I love my man, could it be he takes me there
All those stars lighten up my head
Here it comes again, that uneasy feeling
I could have been you in that fantasy
So smile real big and wish upon one
Let it take you far away from here
Far from here, far away from here, 
Far away from here

I could do about anything
Great excuses make it easier to forget 
That awful feeling
So smile real big, oh precious moment
In this vague world full of fantasy like my man
Could it be he takes me there 
Anywhere far away from here
Far away from here, 
Far away from here, 
Far away from here
I could do about anything.
