		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Don't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Don't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Yeah, I don't cry no mo'
I don't look to the sky no mo'
'Cause I got it on me
I got it on me 
I got it on me
You can run up if you want (fuck is you talking 'bout?)

Look
It's Pop Smoke, niggas know me
Keep two fours like I'm Kobe
Is you ridin' or you hidin'?
If you slidin', then you owe me (owe me)
Run up, catch cold feet
Niggas act tough then call police
I don't make friends, yeah, I make bands
Want some Ray-Bans 'cause I'm a OG
This AR be my trophy
Shoot first, nigga, shoot back
'09, niggas woo back
Nigga automatic when the woo clap
Shoot first, nigga, shoot back
'09, niggas woo back
Nigga automatic when the woo clap
(Automatic when the woo clap)

Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Don't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Don't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Yeah, I don't cry no mo'
I don't look to the sky no mo'
'Cause I got it on me
I got it on me
I got it on me
You can run up if you want

Fifty shots up in this Glock, I won't let up
XD, niggas totin' Berettas
Shoot first and do yourself a favor
Report like I'm Craig Sager
Back out, niggas ain't with the bluffin'
Dread Woo, a nigga shoot you for nothin'
Ten toes on your block like I'm Drummond
SK'll have a blicky runnin' (it's Pop Smoke)
It's that nigga from the Floss, your bitch right back
And I don't politic 'cause niggas ain't like that
I drop a slip or two and get a light pack
And I don't care if you losin', still fight back

Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Don't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on me, have mercy on my soul
Don't let my heart turn cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Yeah, I don't cry no mo'
I don't look to the sky no mo'
'Cause I got it on me
I got it on me
I got it on me
You can run up if you want

Mercy on me
