		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Ah, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinking 'bout all I've wasted on you

All of this time and all of this money
All of these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet

Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been
Wasted on you

All of this time, and all of this money 
All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you

Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you
Wasted on you

All of this time, and all of this money 
All of these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you 
Wasted on you
Wasted on you 
Wasted on you
