		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

(Alright)
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me (oh no, alright)
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty (yeah)
And love don't make sense when it's empty (alright)
Oh no (yeah)

I've driven almost every car (alright)
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars (alright)
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky will be so dark now without you
Yeah, oh, baby

It don't make no sense (alright)
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense (aright)
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you, oh
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it (alright)
In every line, my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it (alright)
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me (alright)
All I wanna do is you, ooh
I mean that so literally (alright)
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now (alright)
Without you, whoa (alright)

It don't make sense, no (no sense, no sense)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Cause I'm doing it with you, baby (no sense, no sense)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way (no sense, no sense)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Going way up, way up) with you
It don't make no sense (way up, way up)
'Less I'm doing it with you (way up, way up, yeah)
(Yeah, slow down, stay up, stay up, stay up) with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you

Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl, I ain't the man
Could never be all I could be
You over stand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, you gotta know I hate that
How am I supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that (yeah-yeah)
Double down, you would made it back
Be patient (yeah, straight up)
Won't you pull up to me now, I'm forever young
It's amazing
I don't wanna sleep 'less you at home

It don't make sense, no (no sense, no sense)
It don't make no sense 
'Less I'm doing it with you, ooh (no sense, no sense)
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Woo, oh-oh
Ooh-oh
Ooh-oh, ooh-oh-oh
It don't make no sense
It don't make no sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
(Alright)
(Yeah)
(Alright)
