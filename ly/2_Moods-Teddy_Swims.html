		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Two moods, ooh

Mood swing like a Gemini
Promise I can handle both sides
Up and down on a wild ride
But that's just what we are

Step it up when we get comfortable (yeah)
At least we keep it unpredictable (ah-ah)
It's chaotic and it's wonderful
How can there be more?

I'd rather sleep on the sofa tonight (ooh)
So I can slide back in
And make it all alright

Only got two moods
Either makin' love to you
Or goin' out and blowin' my fuse
Yeah, there's no in-between
We only do extremes
We got two moods
Yeah, we probably got some screws loose
But that's the only way I want you
It's passion and the flames, girl, I need it that way (that way)
(Two moods, ooh)

Got emotions like dominoes
One wrong move, it all hits the floor
I know it sounds irrational (ooh)
But tell me, who it gotta makes sense for?
Girl, what we got, would make most go insane
Nothin' this good comes from playin' it safe

I'd rather sleep on the sofa tonight (ooh)
So I can slide back in
And make it all alright

Only got two moods
I'm either makin' love to you
Or goin' out and blowin' my fuse
There's no in-between
We only do extremes
We got two moods
Yeah, we probably got some screws loose
But that's the only way I want you
It's passion and the flames, girl, I need it that, that way
Two moods, ooh
