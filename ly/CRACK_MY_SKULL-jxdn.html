		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If Cinderella couldn't look better
I just met her, I'm such a loser
Put my heart inside a blender
I swear I love her, swear I love her

Handcuff me, don't leave me
Locked up, I'm guilty

I wanna crack my skull when I'm with you
'Cause I'm lame as fuck, too lame for you
Crack my skull to be with you
I wanna crack my skull to be with you
I dug this grave for the two of us (I wanna)
Crack my skull to be with you
I wanna crack my skull to be, to be with you

(Yeah)
You're so perfect, I'm still healing
My life sucks when you don't hear me
Shitty movies, happy endings
I swear I love her, swear I love her

Handcuff me, don't leave me
Locked up, I'm guilty

I wanna crack my skull when I'm with you
'Cause I'm lame as fuck, too lame for you
Crack my skull to be with you
I wanna crack my skull to be with you
I dug this grave for the two of us (I wanna)
Crack my skull to be with you
I wanna crack my skull to be, to be with you

Handcuff me, don't leave me
Locked up, I'm guilty
Handcuff me, don't leave me
Locked up, I'm guilty

I wanna crack my skull when I'm with you
'Cause I'm lame as fuck, too lame for you
Crack my skull to be with you
I wanna crack my skull to be with you
I dug this grave for the two of us (I wanna)
Crack my skull to be with you
I wanna crack my skull to be, to be with you

I wanna crack my skull to be with you
Crack my skull to be with you
Crack my skull to be with you
Crack my skull to be, to be with you
