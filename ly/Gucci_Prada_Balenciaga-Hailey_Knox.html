		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a different boyfriend for each one of my moods
I want a Birkin bag for my wrist to hula hoop
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
My CC cha-cha slide need it's own grip tape
Lamb for the weekend Bentley on the weekdays
Give me sparkling cause I hate the way that still taste
Only private flights cause I don't like my bags misplaced
Money right
Money right
Gotta get my money money
Money right
Money right
In my dreams
I can have whatever I want
Anything I want
I want a different boyfriend for each one of my moods
I want a Birkin bag for my wrist to hula hoop
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
It's 20k for a verse once this shit drops
A&R's flooding my phone but always get blocked
Back then they didn't want me
Now I'm hot and they all on me
Back then I was supalonely
Back then was back then
Cause right now I'm getting money I love the sound the counter makes
Isn't it fucking lovely when everything falls into place
In my dreams
I can have whatever I want
Anything I want
I want a different boyfriend for each one of my moods
I want a Birkin bag for my wrist to hula hoop
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
All I, all I, all I really want
All I really want
All I really want
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I really want
All I, all I, all I really want
I want a different boyfriend for each one of my moods
I want a Birkin bag for my wrist to hula hoop
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
I want a different boyfriend for each one of my moods
I want a Birkin bag for my wrist to hula hoop
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
Gucci, Prada, Balenciaga
Ah Ah Ooo
