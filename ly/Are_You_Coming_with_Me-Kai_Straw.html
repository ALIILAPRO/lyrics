		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll be underneath, she said
Save it for me, she said
Her eyes had please in them
I could hear in her breathing
What she needed

Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
Because I'm ‘bout to leave
And I want you coming with me
And I want you coming with me

I want you in me, she said
Slip it in from beneath, she said
I'll be your treat, she said
I could hear in her breathing
What she needed

Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
Because I'm ‘bout to leave
And I want you coming with me
And I want you coming with me

I can hear you, no need to speak
I can read you, I see the calligraphy
In the way you lean into me
The way you bring me to your wisdom teeth
Slip off your clothes
I'll get you gripping the
Sheets with your toes

Are you coming with me?
Are you coming with me?
Because I'm ‘bout to leave
And I want you coming with me
And I want you coming with me
