		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Bout to take my lady Selfridges
New drip on the way, uh-huh
Rap nigga still sellin' bricks
Half a cake on the way, uh-huh
Take a flight, she wanna take a Lyft
Phone the molly man, he's on the way, uh-huh
I might take her to Shard, I might take her to Ritz
It don't matter, baby, I'm straight, uh-huh

Feel like I'm in Prince's house
Purple paint all on the walls, uh-huh
Sittin' down on this fancy couch and I can't see straight
I'ma stay, uh-huh
Twenty-two I'm in Paris, baby
Got strippers tits in my face, uh-huh
Pull up in a Bentley
I want Christian, I want Fendi

I want Prada, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I already make that paper
I don't need to chase no clout, wow
I don't usually pipe up
But don't like how you runnin' your mouth, wow
I already make that paper
I don't need to chase no clout, wow
I don't usually pipe up
But don't like how you runnin' your mouth, wow
You're a side piece from east end
I'm a bad bitch from south, wow
Baby, baby
I got more money comin' in than goin' out

'Bout to take my lady Selfridges
