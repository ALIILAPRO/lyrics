		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These streets are like an ol' jean jacket
Feels good anytime
What have I been waiting for?
It's high time that I dust off the magic
Put my face back in the crowd
And find somebody new

My phone used to ring but I just wasn't ready
The smell of the smoke and the tunes too heavy
One memory would tear down the levy
But tonight I don't feel a thing

Finally, yeah, I've made it through the rebound
The past ain't dragging me down
I'm back to who I was before you
On a perfect night
There's no telling where or what I might
Find before the morning light
Starts a brand new day

Even that autumn air feels sweeter
Filling up my chest
There's a comfort in the cold
And somehow the taste of these Budweiser's
Fit just like a friend
They welcome me to lean

Yeah, you live and you learn and you try to do better
She wanted to go and I finally let her
But broken hearts like wood will splinter
Tonight I don't feel a thing

Finally, yeah, I've made it through the rebound
The past ain't dragging me down
I'm back to who I was before you
On a perfect night
There's no telling where or what I might
Find before the morning light
Starts a brand new day

Finally, yeah, I've made it through the rebound
The past ain't dragging me down
I'm back to who I was before you
On a perfect night
There's no telling where or what I might
Find before the morning light
Starts a brand new day

Yeah, starts a brand new day
Yeah, you live and you learn
You live and you learn and you try to do better
She wanted to go
Just trying to be better

My phone used to ring but I just wasn't ready
The smell of the smoke and the tunes too heavy
One memory would tear down the levy
Just like a friend

Yeah, you live and you learn and you try to do better
She wanted to go and I finally let her
Yeah, I finally let her go
