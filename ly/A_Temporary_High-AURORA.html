		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It seems like we
Like to be living dangerously
Our heart sings a temporary lie
It seems like her
Madness could be endlessly
Her love is a temporary high

And you're running to the shore
Howling at the waves
Howling back at you

When you're ahead, she's coming after
And when you run, she's running faster
And when she loves you better hope her 
Love is not a temporary high

Your body was warm
When she was cold you would long for love
Her storm was a temporary light
And I guess you froze
When the storm blew away her clothes
And you never got warm again

Your hands as blue as ice
You reached towards the sky
Reaching back at you

When you're ahead, she's coming after
And when you run, she's running faster
And when she loves you better hope her 
Love is not a temporary high

And when you run, she's running faster
And when she loves you better hope her 
Love is not a temporary high

Your hands as blue as ice
You reached towards the sky
Reaching back at you

When you're ahead, she's coming after
And when you run, she's running faster
And when she loves you better hope her 
Love is not a temporary high

And when you run, she's running faster
And when she loves you better hope her 
Love is not a temporary high

You better hope that her love is not a temporary
You better hope that her love is not a temporary
