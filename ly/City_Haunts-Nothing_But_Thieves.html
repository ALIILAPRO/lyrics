		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  City haunts been hauntin' me
Changes keep draggin' me
Sleazeballs eyeballin' me for too long

Hackney prick askin' for a light
They need me in the bathroom, okay
Sold a dream, I was circlin' down the drain (yeah)
It's your money, girl, or it's your lust
My body's just run out of space
If they lie it for certain got displaced

City haunts been hauntin' me, ah-ah-ah
Changes keep draggin' me, ah-ah-ah
Sleazeballs eyeballin' me for too long (yeah)

Why don't ya just fade into the night?
I've got the embassy on the phone
Best believe that you're so damn good for the soul
And it's a cruel part of town, honey
One more round and we're gone

City haunts been hauntin' me, ah-ah-ah
Changes keep draggin' me, ah-ah-ah
Sleazeballs eyeballin' me for too long (yeah)

Can you do that thing to me? Ah-ah-ah
Sweet song, yeah, sing to me, ah-ah-ah
'Cause you're so hella fine, a common mind around here
Around here

City haunts been hauntin' me, ah-ah-ah
Changes keep draggin' me, ah-ah-ah
Sleazeballs eyeballin' me for too long

Can you do that thing to me? Ah-ah-ah
Sweet song, yeah, sing to me, ah-ah-ah
'Cause you're so hella fine, a common mind around here
Around here
