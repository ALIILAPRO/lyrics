		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes you find
What you didn't know
You were always looking for
Sometimes a broken heart
Is just a window closed
That leads you to an open door

Sometimes you trip on a four-leaf clover
Sometimes a good time ends hungover

'Cause life goes like that
You try not to grow up
You fall in and out of love
Nah, it ain't always gonna look like what you dreamed of

You're gonna take some wrong turns to the right place
You're gonna have short years and long days
So, raise your cup up, and make it last
'Cause in a Polaroid flash
Life goes like that

Na, na, na, na, na
Life goes like that
Na, na, na, na, na

You pray like hell
You pay them bills
You call momma anytime you can
You fly away just to come back home
Wasn't where you thought you'd land
But God smiles when you make them plans

'Cause life goes like that
You try not to grow up
You fall in and out of love
Nah, it ain't always gonna look like what you dreamed of

You're gonna take some wrong turns to the right place
You're gonna have short years and long days
So, raise your cup up, and make it last
'Cause in a Polaroid flash
Life goes like that

Na, na, na, na, na
Life goes like that
Na, na, na, na, na

Take a breath, take a sip, and take a tip back
'Cause you're gonna catch yourself moving too pedal-down fast

And life goes like that
You try not to grow up
You fall in and out of love
And it ain't always gonna look like what you dreamed of
(What you dreamed of)

You're gonna take some wrong turns to the right place
(You're gonna take some wrong turns)
Gonna have short years and long days
So raise your cup up, and make it last
'Cause in a Polaroid flash
Life goes like that

Na, na, na, na, na
Yeah, life goes like that, yeah
Oh it goes, oh it goes, oh it goes like that
Na, na, na, na, na
Oh it goes, oh it goes, oh it goes like that (life goes like that)
Na, na, na, na, na

In a Polaroid flash
Life goes like that
