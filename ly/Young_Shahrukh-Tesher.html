		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got 500 dollars in cash in case they don't take AMEX
She wanted to see me so now I'm headed to The Annex
Sorority house, she snuck me in, she tried to
Keep quiet - couldn't hold it in
I mean the bed was too spring-ey, the room was too dingey
You really can't blame me, I found her on Hinge-y
Life is a movie but the
Only acting I do is acting on impulse - no stress pimples
Young boy vibin' I would
Like to thank Tim Cook for taking out the headphone jack on the iPhones
Now we only pluggin' in my phone
I'm talking Baby Bash - Cyclone
Tall, dark, and handsome
I move steady, stack dubs
I am the one your new girl, still loves
Negotiating a deal that'll pay me too much
My name uttered in rooms that my feet haven't touched
Know I got it

Tryna make a play, tryna make it happen
I can see my bars all up in her captions
I'm not Keith Urban, I won't put you in a song
Worldwide Don, yeah I feel like Shahrukh Khan

Yeah, feel like Shahrukh Khan
20 thousand fans on my lawn
I could never do no wrong
Yeah, world in my palms
Knew I was the greatest all along
Yeah I feel like Shahrukh Khan
Feel like Shahrukh Khan
20 thousand fans on my lawn
I could never do no wrong
Run it up from Bombay to Milan
See me when you turn your TV on
Yeah I feel like Shahrukh Khan

(Yeah) Run it like a marathon
You running on a Pelaton
Yeah you standing in the same place
Giving me that stank face (Aye)
I hope you I won't respond
I got Ranis in the back
On my way to King street
Uber Black doing 80 in a 50
You can hear me coming way before I'm near you
Bass so loud it shook the Khanda on the rear view
Yeah, I'm a big screen banda
All i see is green
You don't see colour
Yeah, and my drink real tanda
Bought another bottle for my brothers
Know I got it

Tryna make a play, tryna make it happen
I can see my bars all up in her captions
I'm not Keith Urban, I won't put you in a song
Worldwide Don, yeah I feel like Shahrukh Khan

Yeah, feel like Shahrukh Khan
20 thousand fans on my lawn
I could never do no wrong
Yeah, world in my palms
Knew I was the greatest all along
Yeah I feel like Shahrukh Khan
Feel like Shahrukh Khan
20 thousand fans on my lawn
I could never do no wrong
Run it up from Bombay to Milan
See me when you turn your TV on
Yeah I feel like Shahrukh Khan
