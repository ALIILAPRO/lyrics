		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There'll be no darkness tonight
Lady our love will shine
Lighting the night
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise
Now is the time girl
You're every wonder in this world to me
A treasure time won't steal away

So listen to my heart
Lay your body close to mine
Let me fill you with my dreams
I can make you feel alright
And baby through the years
Gonna love you more each day
So I promise you tonight
That you'll always be the lady in my life

Lay back in my tenderness
Let's make this a night we won't forget
Girl, I need your sweet caress
Reach out to a fantasy
Two hearts in the beat of ecstasy
Come to me, girl

And I will keep you warm
Through the shadows of the night
Let me touch you with my love
I can make you feel so right
And baby through the years
Even when we're old and gray
I will love you more each day
'Cause you will always be the lady in my life

Stay with me
I want you to stay with me
