		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy

Bad boy, you gotta run that
Run it back, baby, why you got that gun?
Bad boy, you gotta run that
Run it back, baby, why you got that gun?
Sometimes you get the back wet
Big bad boy, you your father's son
Sometimes you make the sky fall
Fallin' on me, wanna get me some

Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any (bad boy)
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy (bad, bad boy)
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any (bad boy, bad, bad, bad, bad)
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy (bad boy, bad, bad, bad, bad)
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any (bad boy, bad, bad, bad, bad)
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy (bad boy, bad, bad, bad)

Bad, bad, bad, bad, run that, run that
Run it back, baby, why you got that gun, that?
Bad, bad, bad, bad, run that, run that
Run it back, baby, why you got that gun, that? (Bad boy)

I am tired and my bitches are weary
There's a rope around my pussy just to hold me to kiss me (bad boy)
I am tired and my bitches are weary
There's a rope around my pussy just to hold me to kiss me
I wait hours for my master in my mink and my bunny
He a bad boy but he feed me milk and the honey
And I never wear panties, I don't get in cars for candy
So don't think that you can have me 'cause you'll never be my daddy

Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any (bad boy)
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy (bad, bad boy)
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any (bad boy, bad, bad, bad, bad)
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy (bad boy, bad, bad, bad, bad)
Don't want any, any, any, any, any, any, any (bad boy, bad, bad, bad, bad)
Any, any, any, any, any, bad boy (bad boy, bad, bad, bad)
