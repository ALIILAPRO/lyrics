		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She lives in the shadow of a lonely girl
Voice so quiet you don't hear a word
Always talking but she can't be heard

You can see it there if you catch her eye
I know she's brave but it's trapped inside
Scared to talk but she don't know why

Wish I knew back then
What I know now
Wish I could somehow
Go back in time and maybe listen to my own advice

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be

Little me

Yeah you got a lot of time to act your age
You cannot write a book from a single page
Hands on the clock only turn one way

(Yeah)

Run too fast and risk it all
Can't be afraid to take a fall
Felt so big but you looked so small

Wish I knew back then
What I know now
Wish I could somehow
Go back in time and maybe listen to my own advice

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be, oh
Little me

Little me

Tell you one thing I would say to her

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be (little me)

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be

I'd tell her to speak up, tell her to shout out
Talk a bit louder, be a bit prouder
Tell her she's beautiful, wonderful
Everything she doesn't see

You gotta speak up, you gotta shout out
And know that right here, right now
You can be beautiful, wonderful
Anything you wanna be

Little me
