		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history between us two
We knew someday that we would have regrets
But we just ignored them the night we met
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touch me and it's almost like we knew
That there will be history

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other

I wish I could make the time stop
So we could forget everything and everyone
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in to what we want
'Cause when I got somebody, you don't
And when you got somebody, I don't
I wish that the time would line up
So we could just give in

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other

We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
We just dance backwards into each other
Trying to keep our feelings secretly covered
You touched me and it's almost like we knew
That there would be history

There's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other
There's no way that it's not going there
Every second with you I want another
But maybe we can hold off one sec
So we can keep this tension in check
But there's no way that it's not going there
With the way that we're looking at each other

(We just keep on dancing right into each other)
(We just keep on dancing right into each other)
