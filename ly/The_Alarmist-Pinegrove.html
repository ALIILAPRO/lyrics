		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You left gleaming
A green rectangle around the door
Please be careful
What you wish for

I whisper to myself, then I'm spinning it half around
Like an echo, a far away sound
Singing "Be good to me"
Be good to me
 
Marigold in the garden
My heart is out in the garbage
I am being an alarmist
'Cause for as far as I see
It's terrible territory
And there's no one to reassure me
 
So it would be good to talk
For my sanity
Now do what you feel like you gotta do
But be good to me
 
Now, when you walk away
You still exist and I feel good knowing it
If it hurts me why I rely so much on in the first place
If its happening then why this feeling taking over me?
 
Can I believe in the me before I knew you beautifully?
Can I believe in the me before I knew you beautifully?
Can I believe in the me before I'm lost on yesterday?
Can I believe in the me before I knew you beautifully?
