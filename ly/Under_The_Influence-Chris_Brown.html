		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get up, get up
Kiddominant on the beat, better run it back

Fuckin' Robitussin
I don't know why this shit got me lazy right now, yeah
Can't do Percocets or Molly
I'm turnin' one, tryna live it up here right, right, right

Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like
"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place

You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body language speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body language speaks to me

(Rain on it)
(Yeah)
(Yeah)

I can make it hurricane on it
Hunnid bands, make it rain on it
Tie it up, put a chain on it
Make you tattoo my name on it, oh
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's GoPro and make a video, yeah
Make you cry like a baby, yeah
Let's GoPro and make a video
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
Bring it over to my place
And you be like
"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
Bring it over to my place

You don't know what you did, did to me
Your body language speaks to me
I don't know what you did, did to me
Your body language speaks to me

(Rain on it)
(Rain on it)
(Rain on it)

Baby, you can
Ride it, ooh, yeah
And you be like
"Baby, who cares?"
But I know you care
