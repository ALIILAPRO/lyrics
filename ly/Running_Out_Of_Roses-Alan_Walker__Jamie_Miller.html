		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm all by myself, seen this show like a thousand times
It's a side effect, loneliness without no reply
In my mind I just keep pretendin' it's a big ol' lie
Big ol' lie, big ol' lie

Dancin' on the tables, city full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces, ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone

Oh my God, did we go too far?
Did we waste it all like we're running out of roses
Plastic cups, did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us now that everythin' is over

Oh my God, did we go too far?
Did we waste it all like we're running out of roses
Plastic cups, did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us now that everythin' is over

On a night like this
All I know is what I should've said (ooh)
And the life I've lived, all the things I wanna do again
When the silence sings, swear I'll never let a day go by
Day go by, day go by (oh)

Dancin' on the tables, city full of angels
Dreams of diamonds and gold
All the different faces, ones I used to hate
I miss them now that they're gone

Oh my God, did we go too far?
Did we waste it all like we're runnin' out of roses
Plastic cups, did we laugh enough?
Lookin' back on us now that everythin' is over

Oh my God, did we go too far?
Did we waste it all like we're runnin' out of roses
Plastic cups, did we laugh enough?
Looking back on us now that everythin' is over
