		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we'll make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speeding so fast, felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle, that's the way it is
Said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speeding so fast, felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
Be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
