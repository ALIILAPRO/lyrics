		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see your faces and I do not understand why
Each time I dream you're standing there, right by my side
Why do you make me? You take my pride and in my eyes
You come and rape me inside

I have no
Place to run and hide
I have no
Place to hide, which I like

Some who look at the time, I looked back into my life
You wanna touch me to see what's in my eyes
Why do you make me remember my hate, all this shame?
Don't you hate me sometimes?

I have no
Place to run and hide
I have no
Place to hide, which I like

I have no place to run, so come and follow me
I have no place to run, so come and follow me
I have no place to run, so come and follow me
I have no place to run, so come and follow me

I have no place to run, so come and follow me
I have no place to run, so come and follow me
I have no place to run, so come and follow me
I have no place to run

Which I like, I like
Which I like, I like
Which I like, I like
Which I like, I like

Which I like, I like
Which I like, I like
Which I like, I like
Which I like, I like

I have no
Place to run and hide
I have no
Place to hide, which I like

I have no
Place to run and hide
I have no
Place to hide, which I like
