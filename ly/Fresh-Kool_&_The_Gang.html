		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Conversation is going 'round
People talking 'bout the girl who's come to town
Lovely lady, pretty as can be
No one knows her name she's just a mystery
I have seen her 
Maybe once or twice
One thing I can say 
Ooh, she's very nice
She's a lady 
One I really want to know
Somehow I've got to let my feeling show

(She's fresh, fresh) exciting
She's so exciting to me
(She's fresh, fresh) exciting
She's so inviting to me, yeah

I've been thinking about the way you walk
Baby (ouh) I like the way you talk
Tell you something I really can't hide
Heaven must have sent you to be by my side
Fresh and lovely (fresh)
Like a dream come true
I'll give anything to spend the night with you
What a feeling and I can't stop it baby
Miss frisky lady take me away

(She's fresh, fresh) exciting
She's so exciting to me
(She's fresh, fresh) exciting
So inviting to me, yeah

Fresh as a summer breeze
She'll take you by surprise
She means so much to me
I'll do whatever 
To make her mine, baby
Oh, yeah

Ooh, la la la la la, to me, she's fresh
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
Fresh as a summer breeze
(She's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
She means so much to me, yeah (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
I wanna take her her hand (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
And pray she'll understand (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 

'Cause I love the way she walks(she's fresh, she's so fresh) 
And ooh baby I love the way she talks (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
I've got something and I hope she'll understand (she's fresh, she's so fresh) 
Miss frisky lady (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh) 
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
She's so fancy and I love that lady (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 

(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
Oh how I love her so (she's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh)
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh)
(She's fresh, she's so fresh) 
(She's so fresh, she's so fresh)
(She's so fresh)
(She's fresh, she's so fresh)
