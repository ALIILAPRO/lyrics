		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lied to myself, but I
Don't believe a word, and I
Tried to sabotage you, but
But when you're gone it hurts, and I

I used to get cold feet
I'd never go too deep
I was scared of the sound of a heartbeat

But it's undeniable
What I feel for you
You know I've been wrong before
But you're undeniable
Oh

But it's undeniable
But you're undeniable

You pull me in
And I push you away (push you away)
'Cause I'm so paranoid
I got PTSD

I used to get cold feet
I'd never go too deep
I was scared of the sound of a heartbeat

But it's undeniable (oh baby)
What I feel for you (everything I feel for you)
You know I've been wrong before (so many times)
But you're undeniable
Oh, ayy

But it's undeniable
But you're undeniable

But it's undeniable
What I feel for you
You know I've been wrong before
But you're undeniable
It's undeniable
