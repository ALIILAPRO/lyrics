		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's hard to believe
That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

You told me my darling,
"Without me, you're nothing"
You taught me, to look in your eyes
And fed me your sweet lies!

Suddenly someone will stare
In the window.
Looking outside at the sky
That had never been blue...

Ahh!, there's a world without you
I see the light.
Living in a world without you.
Ahh!, there is hope to guide me
I will survive!
Living in a world without you.

It's hard to believe
That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

You put me together
Then trashed me for pleasure
You used me again and again
Abused me, confused me!

Suddenly naked I run
Through your garden.
Right through the gates of the
Past and I'm finally free...

Ahh!, there's a world without you
I see the light.
Living in a world without you.
Ahh!, there is hope to guide me
I will survive!
Living in a world without you.

It's hard to believe
That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

It's hard to believe
That it came to this,
You paralyzed my body
With a poison kiss
For forty days and nights
I was chained to your bed,
You thought that was
The end of the story
Something inside me
Called freedom came alive
Living in a world without you.

Ahh!, there's a world without you
I see the light.
Living in a world without you.
Ahh!, there is hope to guide me
I will survive!
Living in a world without you.

Living in a world without you [Repeat x4]
