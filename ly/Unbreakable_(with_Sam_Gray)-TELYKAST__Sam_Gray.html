		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Unbreakable, unbreakable)
(We're building something unbreakable)

Hanging on for my life, when you pulled me close
Saved me from falling
On the edge of the night, when it hurts the most
You're sunrise and mornings

Lift me out of the dark, put my mind at rest
I feel safe in your arms, wrapped around my chest
You found gold in my heart from the ashes and dust
Ashes and dust

When the world's on fire
And the sun burns cold
We're building something unbreakable
From the highest highs
To the lowest lows
We're building something unbreakable
Unbreakable, unbreakable
We're building something unbreakable
When the world's on fire
And the sun burns cold
We're building something unbreakable (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We're building something unbreakable (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We're building something unbreakable

All our hopes all our dreams could go up in smoke
We'll still be standing
Let it burn, we'll return in the afterglow
Just put your hand in mine

Lift me out of the dark, put my mind at rest
I feel safe in your arms, wrapped around my chest
You found gold in my heart from the ashes and dust
Ashes and dust

When the world's on fire
And the sun burns cold
We're building something unbreakable
From the highest highs
To the lowest lows
We're building something unbreakable
Unbreakable, unbreakable
We're building something unbreakable
When the world's on fire
And the sun burns cold
We're building something unbreakable (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We're building something unbreakable (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
We're building something unbreakable

When the world's on fire
And the sun burns cold
We're building something unbreakable
From the highest highs
To the lowest lows
We're building something unbreakable
