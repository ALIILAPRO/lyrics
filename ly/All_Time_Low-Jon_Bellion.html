		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was the knight in shining armor in your movie
Would put your lips on mine and love the aftertaste
Now I'm a ghost, I call your name, you look right through me
You're the reason I'm alone and masturbate

I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low

I was the prototype like 3 Stacks on that CD
An example of the perfect candidate
Now all your girlfriends say that you don't want to see me
You're the reason that I just can't concentrate

I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it

That I'm at an all time
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low

I (I, I), I've been trying to fix my pride
But that shit's broken, that shit's broken
Lie (lie, lie), lie, l-lie, I try to hide
But now you know it
That I'm at an all time
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
(Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low) lie, l-lie, I try to hide
(Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low) but now you know it
(Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low) 
I'm at an all time
Hey

Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low

Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
Low, low, lo lo low, low, low, low, low
