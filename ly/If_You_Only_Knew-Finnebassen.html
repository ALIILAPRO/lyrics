		  If
If
If
If, If

If your girl only knew
If your girl only knew
If your girl only knew
If your girl only knew
That I would want

If your girl only knew
That I would want
If your girl only knew
That I would want
(2x)

If your girl only knew

If your girl only knew
That I would want
to kick it with you,(if she knew thaaat)
And if your girl could only see
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me
(7x)

If your girl only knew
That I would want (if she knew that)
And if your girl could only see (if she knew that)
How you be calling me, getting fresh with me

If your girl only knew (5x)
