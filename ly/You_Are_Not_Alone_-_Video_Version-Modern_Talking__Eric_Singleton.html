		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you know what I feel
And if you feel the same way too
Just close your eyes
You're not alone
C'mmon!
C'mmon!

Wave your hands in the air!

If I took the time to put you in my rhyme
Let me tell you right there, you're a friend of mine
And I used to getting close if you catch me a time
We can do it like this with the twist of lime
Always on my mind, not the freak of the week
Take the words I speak, to every soul I reach
Hold tight with your touch on the microphone
As you're not just here, you are not alone!

You are not alone - I'll be there for you
You are not alone - anything I'll do
You are not alone - you're the one for me
You are not alone - it's no tragedy
You are not alone - you're the one for me
You are not alone - nothing comes for free

You are not alone
Wave your hands in the air
Let me hear you scream!

Come into my life, let me hold you, mold you
Got so many things that I prob'ly never told you
Never scold you, try to unfold you
Exlose you, someone's cast I even old you
If I told you I'm giving you my heart
You must have playing smart
Then you're tearing me apart
All night long to the early-early morning
Pick up the phone - you're not alone!

If you know what I feel
And if you feel the same way too
Just close your eyes
And feel me inside of you

Everybody in the house - c'mmon!

Yeah, it's a national thing
I wanna solve in your dream I'll offer a bill
That Thomas is cool, but I'm on your case
With your incredible pace
So when I entered the place
Meet you to see my face
We're making up all the hits
So baby, bottom o' your lip
I will be sinking your ship
Like gotta sliding a bit
Extra logic get time on the night perform
Baby, scratch to the bone - you're never alone!
