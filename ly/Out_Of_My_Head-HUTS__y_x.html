		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here we go again, you again, not again
Get out of my head

Why don’t you be honest
There’s no future with what we had, went too fast
Empty words that you promise
Too many apologies in our past
You can’t take them back

On and on
There was never an us, it was only you
On and on
You’re living a lie, never speak the truth

Here we go again, you again, not again
You promise all your lies and it fights with my head
You're less than a lover, but more than a friend
Get out of my head
Get out of my head

Here we go again, you again, not again
Stuck here in the middle
But when will it end
You're less than a lover, but more than a friend
Get out of my head
Get out of my head (Get out of my head)

Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head

Don’t know why you keep calling
Told you I wouldn’t pick up again, ignore all the texts you sent
Went for you, I was all in
Somebody else was behind that mask
Missed all of your red flags

On and on
There was never an us, it was only you
On and on
You’re living a lie never speak the truth

Here we go again, you again, not again
You promise all your lies and it fights with my head
You're less than a lover, but more than a friend
Get out of my head
Get out of my head

Here we go again
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
