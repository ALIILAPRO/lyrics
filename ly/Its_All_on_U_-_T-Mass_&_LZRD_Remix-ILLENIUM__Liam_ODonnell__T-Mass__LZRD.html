		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At first I didn't think that I was cut enough to bleed
Then I saw my secrets gettin' swallowed by the sea

Through a telescope
I saw a diamond glow
How you brought me home
I guess I'll never know

With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumpin' into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothin', now it's gold
And it's all on you
With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumpin' into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothin', now it's gold
And it's all on you

(Get my kicks from you)
(I get my kicks from you)

Can't see, dark road, drivin' up the hills
Lookin' at the girl, hand barely on the wheel

Got no where to go
We can take it slow
How you brought me home
I guess I'll never know

(Get my kicks from you)
(I get my kicks from you)

With God as my witness, never had it so good
Jumpin' into love, fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothin', now it's gold
And it's all on you

And it's all on you
(And it's all on you)
And it's all on you
(And it's all on you)
And it's all on you

From you
I get my kicks from you
