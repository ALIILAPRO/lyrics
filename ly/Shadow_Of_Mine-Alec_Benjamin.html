		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Booked a trip to Texas, thought I'd start again
Switched all my addresses and ghosted all my friends
Thought I could escape what I could not transcend
Found myself back in the same old place again

Everywhere I go, my shadow, it follows behind
Doesn't matter where I travel, my shadow, it finds me
Somethin' that I've come to realize after all this time
I can't escape my shadow, I can't escape my shadow

Maybe I'm the nexus, the common threat that binds
The problems in my head and the world that lives outside
I thought I could escape but it's fate, I've come to find
My devil is the devil that's inside

Everywhere I go, my shadow, it follows behind
Doesn't matter where I travel, my shadow, it finds me
Somethin' that I've come to realize after all this time
I can't escape my shadow, I can't escape my shadow

It won't ever let me go
It goes everywhere I go
It won't ever let me go
This shadow, this shadow of mine (shadow of mine)

We grapple, we battle, but we
Are shackled for eternity
We grapple, we battle, we're shackled
We're shackled, we're shackled

Everywhere I go, my shadow, it follows behind
Doesn't matter where I travel, my shadow, it finds me
Somethin' that I've come to realize after all this time
I can't escape my shadow, I can't escape my shadow

It won't ever let me go
It goes everywhere I go
It won't ever let me go
This shadow, this shadow of mine (shadow of mine)
