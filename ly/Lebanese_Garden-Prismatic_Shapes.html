		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the lebanese garden
A rose was born next to a sycamore 
Delicate as a charming jewel, something unusual 
A spanish rose was born
It's seems an illusion a rose below us

A spanish rose so far and so close 
A spanish rose was Juxtaposed 
A spanish rose that makes me doze 
Between the meadows
A spanish rose so far and so close 
A spanish rose that makes me doze 
A spanish rose is growing and belongs to us

In the lebanese garden passing the door
I forget everything I ignore 
In the garden I found
Sycamore trees and a spanish rose 
Delicate as a charming jewel
Something unusual 

A spanish rose was born it's seems an illusion
A spanish rose so far and so close 
A spanish rose was juxtaposed 
A spanish rose that makes me doze 
Between the meadows

A spanish rose so far and so close 
A spanish rose that makes me doze 
A spanish rose is growing and belongs to us
And belongs to us
