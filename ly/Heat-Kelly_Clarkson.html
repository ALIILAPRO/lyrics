		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm stumblin' through the darkness
There ain't no sign of a spark here
I'm used to feelin' that fire
You watered down that desire
I put my work in, day in, day out
Baby I deserve it, don't let me down
You used to make me feel like a diamond
Now it don't even seem like you're tryin'
So give me one good reason that I should need you

(Oh, whoa, oh)
Come turn this around
(Oh, whoa, oh)
No, no, don't let us down
I need more heat from ya, baby
Make me feel weak for ya, babe
(Oh, whoa, oh)
And I feel alive
(Oh, whoa, oh)
Like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from ya, baby
Make me feel weak for ya, babe

I'm slippin' out of your fingers
Keep coolin' down like November
I'm used to feelin' that fever
I wanna dive in you deeper
I put that work in, day in, day out
Baby I deserve it, don't let me down, no
Give me one good reason that I should need you

(Oh, whoa, oh)
Come turn this around
(Oh, whoa, oh)
No, no, don't let us down
I need more heat from ya, baby
Make me feel weak for ya, babe
(Oh, whoa, oh)
And I feel alive
(Oh, whoa, oh)
Like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from ya, baby
Make me feel weak for ya, babe

Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you
Better than that
Better than that
So come on love me
Better than that
Better than that
Oh we can do so much
Better than that
Better than that

(Oh, whoa, oh)
Come turn this around
(Oh, whoa, oh)
No, no, don't let us down
I need more heat from ya, baby
Make me feel weak for ya, babe
(Oh, whoa, oh)
And I feel alive
(Oh, whoa, oh)
Like my heart's in the wild
I need more heat from ya, baby
Make me feel weak for ya, babe

Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you
Better than that
Better than that
So come on love me
Better than that
Better than that
Oh we can do so much
Better than that
Better than that

Better than that
Better than that
You know I love you
Better than that
Better than that
So come on love me
Better than that
Better than that
Oh we can do so much
Better than that
Better than that
