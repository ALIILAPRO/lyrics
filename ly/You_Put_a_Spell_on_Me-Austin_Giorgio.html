		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You put a spell on me
I'm losing my mind
You better stop things
It's a matter of time
Before I hunt you down
Grab your chin
And kiss your lips
You bring me back
I lay you down
And grab your hips
And we lose all control
And before you know it
I put a spell on you
Now your mine
I've got a hold on you
At least for the night
You know I can't help myself when you ask tenderly
If I'd dim the lights as your hand brushes me
And the floor swallows your clothes
And your silhouette puts on a show
You put a spell on me
I'm losing my mind
You better stop these games
It's a matter of time
Before I hunt you down
Grab your chin
And kiss your lips
Then you bring me back
I lay you down
And grab your hips
And we lose all control
And before you know it
You give me fever
And drive me insane
You keep me going in circles with potions and bottles
And I can't escape
I can't escape
Oh I'm lost in your ways
Oh I can't escape baby
I put a spell on you
Now your mine
I've got a hold on you
At least for the night
At least for the night
Boo
