		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come waste your millions here, secretly she says
Another corporate show, a guilty conscience grows

And I'll feel a guilty conscience grow
And I'll feel a guilty conscience grow

She burns like the sun, and I can't look away
She'll burn our horizons, make no mistake

Come let the truth be shared, no one ever dared
To break these endless lies, secretly she cries

She burns like the sun, and I can't look away
She'll burn our horizons, make no mistake

And I'll hide from the world behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever, I can't face the shame

And I'll hide from the world behind a broken frame
And I'll burn forever, I can't face the shame
