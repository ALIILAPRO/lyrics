		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Awaken them from their slumber
Buried down under,
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, answer the call.

Hive Mind
Feed the Hive Mind
Hive Mind

 Rebith the swarm, we are infinite
 Consume the earth,
 Consume the earth

Hive Mind
Feed the Hive Mind
Hive Mind

Awakened from my sleep I turn the page
Escaping from my keep
With dormant rage

You
Will feel my anguish
You
Will feel my pain

Exhume the monarch
To see the light of day

I will lay their puny hearts on a scale,
Light as a feather, they shall prevail
Eons spent lurking in eternal halls
Serpent scriptures covering the walls.

Hive Mind
Feed the Hive Mind
Hive Mind

Awakened from my sleep I turn the page
Escaping from my keep
With dormant rage

You
Will feel my anguish
You
Will feel my pain

Exhume the monarch
To see the light of day

Ascending through the sand
I make my play
The grains of time and space
Have led the way

I
Will show you penitence
I
Will make you pay

The shah of time
Will rule the light of day:

The shah of time
Will rule the light of day
