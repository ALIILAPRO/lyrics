		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's something 'bout the way you look in my eyes
Like a starry night, you light up my sky
You lean in closer and my heart starts to pound
I heard you sigh, you know I love that sound

He's bouncing off my booty cheeks, I love the way he rides
I can hardly breathe when he's pumping deep inside
I kiss him on his neck and then he kisses on my bussy
Call him "Daddy" while I holler 
Man, that boy so damn good looking (looking, looking)

We made love and then he kissed me, I don't want it to end
Every day we spend together, I fall more into him
That boy he takes my breath away, I can't find the words to say
So I wrote this little note, kiss it, seal it, so you know
I've got some time, if you've got some time too
You've been on my mind baby, let me remind you while I lay you down
I can't get enough, I'm stuck in your love
That's fine with me, nowhere else I wanna be

He's bouncing off my booty cheeks, I love the way he rides
I can hardly breathe when he's pumping deep inside
I kiss him on his neck and then he kisses on my bussy
Call him "Daddy" while I holler
Man, that boy so damn good looking (looking, looking)

You can be my king, no, this ain't just a fling
I'm all in baby, I'm falling
You can be my king, no, this ain't just a fling
I'm all in, baby, I'm falling

He's bouncing off my booty cheeks, I love the way he rides
I can hardly breathe when he's pumping deep inside
I kiss him on his neck and then he kisses on my bussy
Call him "Daddy" while I holler 
Man, that boy so damn good looking (looking)

You've got that kind of love I've only felt in my dreams
Baby, oh you save me, you're my everything
Now take 'em off and let's get down to business
'Cause I hate wasting my time, just you wait and see
