		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you prepared for when life shifts?
That second of the light switch?
Are you prepared for how much is left after this?
Are you prepared for a life adrift?
A chapter when your soul shifts?
To something unrecognizable?
To something you don't know?

These dreams of light are fears of falling
You just know inside
That you're so far from your calling
And if all hope is lost
And everything is broken
Remember that the dark is a construct of hoping

If we're touched within
Our truths unfold
But if we're lost within
The truth is lost
But if you let it in
If you listen within
There's something identifiable
Something you really know 

These dreams of light are fears of falling
You just know inside
That you're so far from your calling
And if all hope is lost
And everything is broken
Remember that the dark is a construct of hoping

A gift to change the way we're thinking
To shift the pace our hearts were beating
And the speed our blood was pumping
It's time to start creating
So we will keep on growing
And make the space so much smaller
Between our source and ourselves

These dreams of light, our fears of falling
You just know inside
That you're so far from your calling
And if all hope is lost
And everything is broken
Remember that the dark is a construction of our hoping
