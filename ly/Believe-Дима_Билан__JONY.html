		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even when the thunder and storm begins
I'll be standing strong like a tree in the wind
Nothing's gonna move this mountain
Or change my direction
I'm falling off that sky and I'm all alone
The courage that's inside gonna break my fall
Nothing's gonna deem my light within

But if I keep going on
It will never impossible, not today

Cause I've got something to believe in
As long as I'm breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
Cause I've got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if just believe
And I believe in me

Even when the world tries to pull me down
Tell me that I can, try to turn me around
I wont let them put my fire out, without no!

But if I keep going on
It will never impossible, not today

Cause I've got something to believe in
As long as I'm breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
Cause I've got something to believe in
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if just believe

And I believe:
I can do it all
Open every door
Turn unthinkable to reality
You'll see - I can do it all and more

Believing
As long as I'm breathing
There is not a limit to what I can dream
Cause I've got something to believe in
Believing
Mission to keep climbing
Nothing else can stop me if just believe
And I believe me
