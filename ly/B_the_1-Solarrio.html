		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My ride or die, my confidant
Build me up when I am down
Would you stick around?
My PNC, my fantasy
The woman of my dreams
When will she come around?
I've been here before with
Intentions that were pure
Tired of drinking poison
Could you be the cure, oh oh oh
Could you really B the 1?
Could you B the 1 for me?
Could you really B the 1?
Give me your hurt
I'll give you mine
I need a partner
Not just someone to pass the time
Someone to hold
To share the ups and downs
Cause I've been searching far and wide
It seems she can't be found
Help me face my demons
When my confidence needs healing
Would you pledge allegiance?
Could you keep my secrets? Oh oh oh
Could you really B the 1?
Could you B the 1 for me?
Could you really B the 1?
