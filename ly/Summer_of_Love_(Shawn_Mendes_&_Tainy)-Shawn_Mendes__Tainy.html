		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kisses on your body were like heaven 
We were taking it slow
Tangled in the sheets until the evening 
There was nowhere to go, yeah
We were in a daze, learning each others shapes
Tracing shadows of rain down your back, oh
Kisses on your body in my memory baby nothing comes close

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love

Meditation and tequila
Calling you my senorita
Didn't know how much I need ya
Hate it when I have to leave ya
I've been taking mental pictures
For when I miss you in the winter
Staying up until the sunrise
Praying it won't be the last time

It was the summer of love
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love

Kisses on your body were like heaven 
We were taking it slow, yeah
Entangled in the sheets until the evening 
There was nowhere to go, no

It was the summer of love
(You were my summer of love)
A delicate daydream
And for a couple of months
It felt like we were eighteen, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love, yeah
It was the summer of
Lo-love
Lo-love
It was the summer of
