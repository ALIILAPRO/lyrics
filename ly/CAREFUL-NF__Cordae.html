		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stuntin' on me, you get exposed
I don't wanna pick then I buy both
Doesn't go plat', it'll go gold (go gold)
Keep it up upfront, I don't tiptoe (ayy)
I be at the house tryin' to lay low (lay low)
Duckin' and dodgin' the promo (promo)
Sit on my roof like J. Cole (ayy)
Yeah, sit on my roof like J. Cole (ayy)

Thinking about how I'm so thankful (woo)
Subpar songs, I don't make those (I don't make those)
Look at that car I paid for (I paid for)
Look at my life, I'm grateful (I'm grateful)
Hatin' on me, that's hateful (that's hateful)
You know I hit what I aim for (aim for)
Talkin' 'bout risks, I take those (I take 'em)
Didn't get here being careful (ayy)

Listen, ah
Talkin' 'bout risk, I take those
Millionaire still riding with the Draco
Courtside at the game Jumbotron got my name on it
That's how a typical day goes
I just left Nigeria, Lagos
I just met Kanye, Yesoz
I was talkin' to God, 'bout what's real or what's not
All he said was remain faithful

Okay, I get, I got it, I'm with it, I'm 'bout it
My crib is exotic I'm blessed, hey
We living chaotic, was high off narcotics
But that's when my life was a mess, hey
We come from the bottom, we still at the bottom
I get high to relieve the stress, hey
I don't think y'all get the message
This just world is built off misconceptions

Talkin 'bout greed
Talkin 'bout envy
Talkin 'bout money, then we talkin' 'bout plenty
Talkin 'bout dollars, or we talkin' 'bout pennies
Talkin' 'bout drinking, then we talkin' 'bout Henny
What we talkin' 'bout?
Lost souls at a crossroad, money coming in in large loads
I've been crossed, so my heart cold
That's all we know, yeah-yeah

Stuntin' on me, you get exposed
I don't wanna pick then I buy both (buy both)
Doesn't go plat', it'll go gold (go gold)
Keep it up upfront, I don't tiptoe (ayy)
I be at the house tryin' to lay low (lay low)
Duckin' and dodgin' the promo (promo)
Sit on my roof like J. Cole (ayy, ayy)
Yeah, sit on my roof like J. Cole (ayy, ayy)

Thinking about how I'm so thankful (woo)
Subpar songs, I don't make those (I don't make those)
Look at that car I paid for (I paid for)
Look at my life, I'm grateful (I'm grateful)
Hatin' on me, that's hateful (that's hateful)
You know I hit what I aim for (aim for)
Talkin' 'bout risks, I take those (I take 'em)
Didn't get here being careful (ayy)

Called up my dad and I told him I got you
You wanna retire, then do it, you're good
Called up my grandma and told her
It's time to move out of that basement, let's get you a crib
Called up my manager, told 'em get ready
It's 'bout to get busy this record is, ah
Called up to God and I asked 'em, "You watchin' my back?"
He ain't say nothin' back but I heard what He said
When you see how I'm livin' the answer is obvious ain't it
When you go from poverty stricken and stressing
'Bout buying the groceries to not even having to look at the total
You know you've been blessed
Sharing the wealth, ain't no point in me keeping this all to myself
I ain't taking this money with me to my grave
Yeah, I might as well bless all the people I love

We talking 'bout making a difference, I'm making one
Talking 'bout risks, I been taken 'em
Talking 'bout dreams, I been chasin' 'em
Talking 'bout lives, I been changin' 'em
Talking 'bout family don't play with 'em, whoa

That's a line you don't cross, no
Low blows can't respect those
Gotta keep the loved ones close
That's all we know, yeah

Stuntin' on me, you get exposed
I don't wanna pick then I buy both (buy both)
Doesn't go plat', it'll go gold (go gold)
Keep it up upfront, I don't tiptoe (tiptoe, ayy)
I be at the house tryin' to lay low (lay low)
Duckin' and dodgin' the promo (promo)
Sit on my roof like J. Cole (ayy, ayy)
Yeah, sit on my roof like J. Cole (ayy, ayy)

Thinking about how I'm so thankful (woo)
Subpar songs, I don't make those (I don't make those)
Look at that car I paid for (I paid for)
Look at my life, I'm grateful (I'm grateful)
Hatin' on me, that's hateful (that's hateful)
You know I hit what I aim for (aim for)
Talkin' 'bout risks, I take those (I take 'em)
Didn't get here being careful (ayy)
