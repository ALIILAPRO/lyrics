		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the fear and the fire
Of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, that all words in the fight fell to

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you

And I love too
That love soon might end
Be known in it's aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend
You are unbreaking
Though quaking
Though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And the day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
Then you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you

And I love too
That love soon might end
And be known in it's aching
But shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend
You are unbreaking
Though quaking
Though crazy
That's wasteland, baby

And when the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Not an end, but the start of all things that are left to do

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love
I'm in love with you

That's it
