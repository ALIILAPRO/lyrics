		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Monsieur Andre! Monsieur Firmin!
Dear Andre, what a splendid party
The prelude to a bright new year
Quite a night, I'm impressed

Well, one does one's best
Here's to us
The toast for the city
What a pity that the Phantom can't be here

Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you

Flash of mauve, splash of puce
Fool and king, ghoul and goose
Green and black, queen and priest
Trace of rouge, face of beast, faces

Take your turn, take a ride
On the merry-go-round in an inhuman race
Eye of gold, true is false
Who is who?

Curl of lip, swirl of gown
Ace of hearts, face of clown, faces
Drink it in, drink it up till you've drowned
In the light, in the sound but who can name the face?

Masquerade! Grinning yellows, spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you

Masquerade! Seething shadows breathing lies
Masquerade! You can fool any friend who ever knew you
Masquerade! Leering satyrs, peering eyes
Masquerade! Run and hide, but a face will still pursue you

What a night! What a crowd!
Makes you glad
Makes you proud
All the crème, de la crème

Watching us, watching them
All our fears are in the past
Three months of relief
Of delight, of Elysian peace

And we can breathe at last
No more notes, no more ghost
Here's a health, here's a toast
To a prosperous year

To our friends who are here
And may the splendor never fade
What a blessed release
And what a masquerade

Think of it, a secret engagement
Look, your future bride, just think of it
But, why is it secret? What have we to hide?
You promised me, no, Raoul, please don't, they'll see
Well then let them see, it's an engagement, not a crime

Christine, what are you afraid of?
Let's not argue
(Let's not argue)
Please pretend
(I can only hope)
You will understand in time
(I'll understand in time)

Masquerade! Paper faces on parade
Masquerade! Hide your face so the world will never find you
Masquerade! Every face a different shade
Masquerade! Look around, there's another mask behind you

Masquerade! Burning glances, turning heads
Masquerade! Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you 
Masquerade! Grinning yellows,spinning reds
Masquerade! Take your fill, let the spectacle astound you
