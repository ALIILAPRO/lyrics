		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Looking back, feeling envy for my past
Nothing lasts, just be glad that it happened

Magic-made, can't reclaim
'Cause it lays in the past (ooh)
Not the same, it all changed
And I feel the decay (ooh)

Stuck in yesterday
I cannot recapture the magic
Trying to relive the classic (ooh)
Thoughts that'll burn away
I'm trying to hold to a memory
A vision that's hollow and empty (ooh)
Disappearing like magic (ooh)
Disappearing like magic

Window stains, or a cobblestone path
What remains, of a long-distant past

Magic-made, can't reclaim
'Cause it lays in the past
Not the same, it all changed
And I feel the decay (ooh)

Stuck in yesterday
I cannot recapture the magic
Trying to relive the classic (ooh)
Thoughts that'll burn away
I'm trying to hold to a memory
A vision that's hollow and empty (ooh)
Disappearing like magic (ooh)
Disappearing like magic

Move on, get lost, but please don't wait
It's not coming back, it's not coming back, it's not coming back
Mind set offset with no regret
It's not coming back, it's not coming back, it's not coming back
