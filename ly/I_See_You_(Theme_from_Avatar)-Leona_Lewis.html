		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you
I see you
Walking through a dream
I see you

My light in darkness breathing hope of new life
Now I live through you and you through me
Enchanting
I pray in my heart that this dream never ends

I see me through your eyes
Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice

I live through your love
You teach me how to see
All that's beautiful
My senses touch your world, I'd never pictured

Now I give my hope to you
I surrender
I pray in my heart that this world never ends
I see me through your eyes

Breathing new life, flying high
Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life
I offer my love, for you

When my heart was never open
(And my spirit never free)
To the world that you have shown me
But my eyes could not division
All the colors of love and of life evermore

Evermore
(I see me through your eyes)
I see me through your eyes
(Breathing new life, flying high)
Flying high

Your love shines the way into paradise
So I offer my life as a sacrifice

And live through your love
And live, through your love
I see you
I see you
