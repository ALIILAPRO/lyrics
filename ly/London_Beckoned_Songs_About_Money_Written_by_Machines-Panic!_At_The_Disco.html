		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop stalling, make a name for yourself
Boy, you better put that pen to paper, charm your way out
If you talk, you better walk
You better back your shit up
With more than good hooks
While you're all under the gun
Start talking a sensationalist
Oh, he's slightly clever to just a certain extent
If you talk, you better walk
You better keep your mouth shut
With more than good hooks
While you're all under the gun

Panic, meet the press
It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us to take a chance
Panic, meet the press
It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us

Well, we're just a wet dream for the web scene
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word we wrote

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzine
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote

I'm burning and I'm blacking my lungs
Boy, you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue
If you talk, you better walk
You better back your shit up
With more than good hooks
While you're all under the gun
Start talking a sensationalist
Oh, he's slightly clever to just a certain extent
Oh, keep quiet let us sing like the doves
Then decide if it's done with purpose or lack thereof

Just for the record
The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
A indifference, or B disinterest in what the critics say

It's time for us to take a chance
It's time for us

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzines
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word we wrote

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzines
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote

Just for the record
The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
A indifference, or B disinterest in what the critics say

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzines
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote

Well, we're just a wet dream for the webzines
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don't approve a single word that we wrote

Just for the record
The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of
A indifference, or B disinterest in what the critics say
