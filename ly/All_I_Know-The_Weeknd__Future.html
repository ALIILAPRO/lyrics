		  Woo-ooh, woah-oh
Woo-ooh, woah-oh

The reasons I can't have you, are so easy to fix
I didn't really plan to, but I'mma do it for this
The reasons I can't have you, isn't so complicated
Baby if you let me I won't hesitate

All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

I know there's been stigma 'round me
I know you heard things about me
You sleep one eye closed
Too scared to get heartbroke 
Heard too many lies told
Don't make this shit unfold
I could tell why you would doubt me
I hit one time, you can't live without me
Girl I'm just peakin', I'm just tryna be on top of you
On top of you

All I know (All I know, all I know, all I know)
All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I know)
All I know (All I know, all I know, all I know)
All I know is this (All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know)
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
Is this, is this

Woo-ooh, woah-oh
Woo-ooh, woah-oh

Woo-ooh, woah-oh
Woo-ooh, woah-oh

Woo-ooh, woah-oh
Woo-ooh, woah-oh

S-s-sleep with one eye open (yeah)
I'm terrified to get my heart broke (hol' up)
Blood talkin' like a Piru (ay)
Fuck with me, nigga, gon' die slow (gang)
Lamborghini make you Crip walk (skrt)
I'm splashin' off with my side hoe (ay)
Full of these medicals, bitches, got several (yeah)
She eat the dick up, like it's an edible
Then I get back to my capital (pour)
I got the Glock on the passenger (pour up)
I got these tropical fantasies (woo)
They gon' remember my legacy (pour up)
Hang out the roof of the Ghost (yeah)
The cash in my pocket spill right on the floor (yeah-yeah)
The cash in my pocket spill out in the floor (hold up)
When the cash overflow, let the cash overflow
I done fucked a bitch that boogie (yeah)
Have you ever, ever fucked a bitch that boogie? Woah-oh (yeah yeah)
I done fucked a bitch that boogie
I done, I done, I done fucked a bitch that boogie, woah oh
I done fucked a bitch conceited
I done fucked a few, few bitches conceited (oh yeah)
We just wanna say we did it
We just wanna say we did it (XO)
I know like you know
I keep that trigger beside me (keep that trigger)
I know like you know
You just another body (Another body)
I know like you know
I keep that trigger beside me (I know)
I know like you know
You just another body
Have you fucked a bitch this pretty? (yeah)
Hit her on the first night and went and bought titties (yeah, yeah)
Have you fucked a bitch this pretty? (yeah)
