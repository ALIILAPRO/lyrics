		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at you in my t-shirt
Don't know how you look so good in the AM
Grab your phone and call in to work
You know you could just stay all day in my bed
If you gotta go, you gotta go
But if you gotta go, you gotta know

As soon as you leave, yeah the clock stops tickin'
You take the sun with you and the world quits spinnin'
Every second feels like waitin' on a green light
All I wanna do is rewind
You and me kissin', I'm wishin' there was no distance
Because the missing you starts hittin' me
As soon as you leave

Girl I know you might be thinkin'
I need some time, a night out with the boys
Let me share a little secret
All I need is, more of you
I'd be cool if you never left

As soon as you leave, yeah the clock stops tickin'
You take the sun with you and the world quits spinnin'
Every second feels like waitin' on a green light
All I wanna do is rewind
You and me kissin', I'm wishin' there was no distance
Because the missing you starts hittin' me
As soon as you leave, ooh as soon as you leave, yeah

As soon as you leave, yeah the clock stops tickin'
You take the sun with you and the world quits spinnin'
Every second feels like waitin' on a green light
All I wanna do is rewind
You and me kissin', I'm wishin' there was no distance
Because the missing you starts hittin' me
As soon as you leave, ooh as soon as you leave, yeah
