		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God knows it cuts like a dagger
That you think your heart doesn't matter
'Cause I do, yeah, I do
I know we burn like a phoenix
But I didn't want to believe it
'Cause I knew, that it's true

I didn't wanna let you down
Saying this is all that I want
It's everything I dreamed of
I didn't wanna let you down
So I said I could give you up
Thinking back on all that I've done
And on every road I'm on
A part of me has never stopped looking
For your face in a crowd

God knows I want to believe that
You were the love that I needed
But it's lost, and all 'cause

I didn't wanna let you down
Saying this is all that you want
It's everything you dreamed of
I didn't wanna let you down
So I said I could give you up
Thinking back on all that I've done
And on every stage I'm on
A part of me has never stopped looking
For your face in the crowd

In the crowd
In the crowd
In the crowd
In the crowd
Ooh, ooh

I didn't wanna let you down
Saying you are all that I want
You're everything I dreamed of
I didn't wanna let you down
So I said I could give you up

Thinking back on all that I've done
How did I get it so wrong
A part of me will never stop looking
For your face

Every airport, sidewalk
New train I board
A part of me will always be praying for your face in the crowd
