		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your dirty sweat
My sweetest potion
Your armpit swampy
Little oceans
Your fluffy butthole
A soggy cave
I put in my parts
And let them bathe

Call me freaky, call me sick
I like it sticky, I like it big (fat!)
I hate it skinny, I hate it flat
I don't need mini, I like it fat

People laughing about your size
We can fuck them on your French fries
When I break open your king size bra
Your giant boobs are just wunderbar!

So call me freaky, call me sick (fat!)
I like it sticky, I like it big
I hate it skinny, I hate it flat (fat!)
I don't need mini, I like it fat

Every night, I have this dream
I'm sliding down, a sloppy stream
Straight in your mouth, the smack is strong
I eat your lips, your furry tongue

You call me freaky, you call me sick (fat!)
I like you sticky, I like you big (fat!)
I hate you skinny, I hate you flat (fat!)
Don't need you mini, I love you fat (fat!)

So call it crazy or call it fate
Just with you I want, want to get laid
'Cause your holes are hard, so hard to find
It doesn't matter, I fuck you, fuck you from behind!
