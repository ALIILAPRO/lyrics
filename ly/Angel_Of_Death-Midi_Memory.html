		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The time is slipping away before it ever began
Don't know which way I should go
Or how to feel in the end
Time slipping away
Blackened eyes
That follow me
Can't slow down
Too numb inside

Draw me in
I know it's me that you want
Haunt me when I sleep at night
Darkness taken over the light
Step into the other side
I know it's me that you want
Haunt me when I sleep at night
Darkness taken over the light

I'm falling off of the edge
Long way down to the bottom
Under the shadow of death
Awake when you're in my dreams
The time is slipping away before it ever began
Don't know which way I should go
Or how to feel in the end
Time slipping away
Can't slow down
Top numb inside

Draw me in
I know it's me that you want
Haunt me when I sleep at night
Darkness taken over the light
Step into other side
I know it's me that you want
Haunt me when I sleep at night
Darkness taken over the light
