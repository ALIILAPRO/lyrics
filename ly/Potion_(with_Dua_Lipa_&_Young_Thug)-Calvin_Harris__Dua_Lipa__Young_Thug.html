		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the whip on a Tuesday night, got the music high
And you by my side, side
Top down and the moon is high and the mood is right
And you're by my side, side, yeah

Late night conversations, electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex, and it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin', mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal, and it's a moment
(Ah) yeah, (ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah) yeah

I been catchin' love off a backboard
Runnin' from your love, that's what this track for
Fuckin' every bitch and never tell 'em, no
I'm pushin' P, they black and white, a Oreo
I been catchin' love off a backboard
Runnin' from your love, that's what this track for
Buyin' niggas' bitches from the corner store
Thug, why you wanna do that? I don't need this love
Ball like Lebron James in the finals
We 14Hunna, just like a minor
I'm yellin' "Free Big Meech" with designers
Fifteen million hoes 'cause I'm undecided
I'm kickin' shit, karate, ooh
I'm servin' bricks somebody hood
Fucked a bitch, catch a charley, ooh
Gucci flip flops and joggers, ooh

In the whip on a Tuesday night, got the music high
And you by my side, side
Top down and the moon is high and the mood is right
And you're by my side, side, yeah (ah, ah)

Late night conversations, electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex, and it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin', mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal, and it's a moment
Yeah, yeah

Feelin' fly all night, yeah, yeah
Goin' with the motherfuckin' vibe, yeah
It's goin' down tonight, oh, yeah
But don't you leave, don't you move
Bada-bing, bada-boom 'bout you, whoa, oh

Late night conversations, electric emotions
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex, and it's a potion, yeah
Late night, bodies achin', mental stimulation
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal, and it's a moment
(Ah) yeah, (ah-ah, ah-ah, yeah) yeah

Sprinkled with a little bit of sex, and it's a potion, yeah
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal, and it's a moment, yeah

(Huh)
