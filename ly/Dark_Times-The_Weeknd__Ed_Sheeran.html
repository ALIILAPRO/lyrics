		  Mhm (mhm)
Mhm (mhm)
Mhm, mhm, mhm (mhm)
Mhm

Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should've seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark times (dark times)
In my dark times (dark times)

Light one up, let me bum a smoke, uh
Still coming down, dripping throat, uh
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could never make you believe
Running in circles that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times (dark times)
In my dark times (dark times)

In my dark times I've still got some problems I know
Driving too fast but just moving to slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go
Pulling me back every time

In my dark times (oh) taking it back to the street (oh)
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me

In my dark times taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark times this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times (dark times)
In my dark times, no (dark times)
In my dark times
