		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't forget
your words and dream.
We were weak and
have no will to push
Yes We were still a kids,
Yes we were Just a kids.
we talked are dream till dark
at under the big old tree.
A unbreakable pomise
is to be succeed.
The winter passed
again and again.
I got scared
when I got to know things.
You heart people
cause you don't know the pain,
empty eyes.
You said with a looking
of lost everything.
"Are you still in dream."
the memories
pass through my head.
Sun's falls down to edge of sea.
Gentle moon light.
You hit me and kick me
as hard as you can.
Hugged by a devil.
Bloody face, unfocus sight,
smashed into an
iced cold street.
Try to not think about it.
You grab my money away.
You changed a lot in every way.
Are promises fell
into a part as an block.
A tear drops, Cried out loud.
Felt sour. I believed in you.
please someone kill me.
Is there anything that
won't never and ever change.
Now I am waiting for your smile.
What is an endless dream.
Even the little birds
sings the killer's song tonight.
Passing time is so mean to me.
How come ever sunlight shine
to me.
Misery of all the world
is in my room, comes over me.
Damn dark to see.
Waiting for your smile.
What is an endless dream.
Even the little birds
sings the killer's song tonight.
