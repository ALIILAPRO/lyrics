		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I told you that my band started popping off
You told me that you played guitar
I knew that you had lied at the time you said it
But you could play my heart
It took a couple weeks, you were shredding
Playing like a rock 'n roll star
Holy goddamn, you were so annoying
But you had my heart

I guess I had to stay for something
I have stay for something good
I guess I had to stay for something
I have stay for something good

Tried to figure out why I stuck it out
Looking back, what the hell?
Five years losing my friends and family
I lost myself, oh

I guess I had to stay for something
I have stay for something good
I guess I had to stay for something
And I could stay for something

Good enough to keep me
Running to you arms
Telling everyone I know about
How smart I think you are, oh

I guess I had to stay for something
I have stay for something good
I guess I had to stay for something
I have stay for something

Good enough to know you
Was all I wished to be
It hurts when I remember
You were sometimes good to me

And they tell me I should hate you
Say you put me through it
Lord, I know I used to but I just can't do it
You're just some long lost baby
Hope you find what you're looking for
Hope you find what you're looking for, hey, hey

And they tell me I should hate you
Say you put me through it
Lord, I know I used to but I just can't do it
They tell me I should hate you
Say you put me through it
Lord, I know I used to but I just can't do it
They tell me I should hate you
Say you put me through it
Lord, I know I used to but I just can't do it

You're just some long lost baby
Hope you find what you're looking for
