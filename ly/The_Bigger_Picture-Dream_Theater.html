		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long before the colors start to bleed
I can see the painting come alive
Clever like an angel in disguise 
Moving in and out of reach 

If the candle lights this crooked path
Like a lighthouse peering through the haze
I will find the river through the rain 
And I'll reach the water's edge 

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I can't see 
Shed your light on me 
Be my guide so I can see
The bigger picture 

Like a moth burned by the fire 
And driven to the flame 
(Prophecies' a blessing and a curse) 
I must bare this cross alone
There's no one else to blame 
With each treasure found
Another shipwreck's washed ashore
I am carried by the current
On a slow and steady course 

Shed your light on me
Be my eyes when I can't see 
Shed your light on me 
Be my guide so I can see
The bigger picture 

What If caught in a moment 
I get lost and can't find my way
What if all along I was wrong 
In every turn, In every way 

Would you talk me off the ledge 
Or let me take the fall 
Better to try and fail 
Then to never try at all 

You look but cannot see
Talk but never speak
You live but cannot breathe
See but don't believe 

Wounds that never heal
A heart that cannot feel
A dream that's all too real 
A stare as cold as steel

I've listened to the stories of resentment and disdain
I've looked into the empty eyes of anger, fear, and shame
I've taken blood from every stone 
And traveled every road 

When I see the distant lights illuminate the night
Then I will know I am home
