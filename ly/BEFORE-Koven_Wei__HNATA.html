		  Intro:

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Been here before
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Been here before
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(shawty so divine)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
(shawty so divine)
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I been before

Verse 1:

Shawty so divine
Won’t you hit me on my line
Why you gotta play these games
But I ain’t winning shit
I cop her Gucci and Prada
Like silver skies and cabana
She got me going back in time
Like we first met
So oh-oh-oh,
Girl you’re so co-o-old,
She want a rolly, one of only, ice so fro-o-oze

Pre-Hook:

And I been setting the motions
Got you down in the moment
Swear my drink was so potent
It got me backwards I’m rolling like

Hook:

I’ve been here before-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I’ve been here before-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I been here before and I can’t take it anymore
Shawty why is you playing like can’t you open up that door?

After Hook:

Saying you hop in a function act like no new discussion
Got me so down bad, fuck you mad, turn something to nothing
Just like before, oh ohh
I swear to god its like before

Verse 2:

Been here before
They really ain’t gotta know
Just name the place and we’ll go
No hesitations yeah
Don’t stress
Toronto’s perfect hot mess
Highlight reel a top ten
Got me feeling that dress, baby what’s up?

Pre-Hook:

I wanna know
Tell me who’s keeping score
Tell me who’s keeping score

Hook:

I’ve been here before (been here before)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah
I’ve been here before-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-yeah
I been here before and I can’t take it anymore
Shawty why is you playing like can’t you open up that door?
