		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's over the house
I can't stop it growing
It's over my road
Each lamp post
Memories follow me
He will, he will, he will
You know, you know
He will, he will, he will

Those dusty amulets
Write chords and regrets
I cannot readjust
Into the life before I loved you

I see our fingerprints on household things
I'm too sad to touch
I feel your skin on human beings
I'm too sad to fuck

If I could write you back here
It would be my best work
If I could write you back here
It would be my best work

I can't readjust
Into the life before I met you
I can't readjust
I just want to forget you (To forget you)

I see your fingerprints on household things
I'm just too sad to touch
I feel your skin on human beings
I'm too sad to fuck

To forget you
To forget you
To forget you
To forget you

It's over the house
I can't stop it growing
It's over my road
Hides behind each lamp post
He will, he will, he will
You know, you know
He will, he will, he will
You know, you know
He will, he will, he will
You know, you know
He will, he will, he will, he will
