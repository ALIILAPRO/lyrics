		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  By the end of the summer, she was a lover
I saw her ex and he's dressing like me
Hair kinda messy like me
Nobody gets it like me
We made it to winter, naked at dinner
Standing on seats 'cause they playin' our song
The waiter's always takin' too long
Or maybe we're just stayin' too long (hey)

Ooh
I bet the boys back home are mad
I found an angel wearing plaid
You'll meet her soon (hey, hey, hey)
Ooh
I've never felt like this before
Can't pick myself up off the floor
That's something new, I'm stuck with you

Forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever, ever and more
Forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever, ever and more

It feels like I'm faded, she's gettin' naked
We went to a party and we're hiding upstairs
Your lady's telling you it ain't fair
You threw your phone, started tying your hair
She move like Madonna, do what she wanna
I put her on her back and I tell her she's mine (mine)
Wrote her name all over my spine
She don't pay rent, but she stay in my mind (hey)

Ooh
I bet the boys back home are mad
I found an angel wearing plaid
You'll meet her soon (hey, hey, hey)
Ooh
I've never felt like this before
Can't pick myself up off the floor
That's something new, I'm stuck with you

Forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever, ever and more
Forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever, ever and more

Forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever, ever and more
Forever, ever, forever, ever
Forever, ever and more
