		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty eyes
I'll be seeing you again
Yeah, I'll be seeing you in hell

So don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it a-comin' on
Don't cry to me oh baby
Had to know it was in your power
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end goal for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me oh baby
And now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Just shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in hell

Don't cry to me oh baby
Your future's in an oblong box
Don't cry to me oh baby
You should have seen it a-comin' on
Don't cry to me oh baby
Had to know it was in your power
Don't cry to me oh baby
Dead-end goal for a dead-end girl
Don't cry to me oh baby
Now your life drains on that floor
Don't cry to me oh baby

Die, die, die my darling
Don't utter a single word
Die, die, die my darling
Shut your pretty mouth
I'll be seeing you again
I'll be seeing you in hell
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
Die, die, die
Die
