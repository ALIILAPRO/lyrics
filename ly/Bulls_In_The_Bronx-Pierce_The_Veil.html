		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you know
I count your heartbeats before you sleep?
I bite my fingernails to bone
Now I crawl back under the stairwell
To a place I call my home

I really hope you enjoy the show
Because for me, it's just a big game
You need people like me to fail

Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue

You'll never know
I don't know where I'm going to sleep tonight
Just stay at hotels for cheap
And there's one down the street
But, oh don't you threaten me with a good time
I am over the God on the surface
I'm sorry, I can't see that you truly love me

Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue
I've been having this dream that we can fly
So maybe if we never wake up, we can see the sky

Oh, alright

Please don't take this out on me
'Cause you're the only thing that's keeping me alive
And I don't want to wait for the down-set date
'Cause I would rather end it all tonight
And if I mean anything to you
I'm sorry, but I've made up my mind

Maybe we're just having too much fun
Maybe you can't handle yourself
Staring at me with your lips and tongue

I've been having this dream that we can fly
So darling, close your eyes
'Cause you're about to miss everything (about to miss everything)
'Cause you're about to miss everything (about to miss everything)
