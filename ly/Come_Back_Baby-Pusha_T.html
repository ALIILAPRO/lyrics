		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna talk to all you addicts out there
That's got yourself a great big Jones
An' you done tried all the methadone
And you just can't leave that heroin alone
I wonder, have you tried

Dope just touched down, I'm so grateful
Numbers so low, bitch, be thankful
They say don't let money change you
That's how we know money ain't you
Bitch, I been had, bitches been bad
We buy big boats, bitch, I'm Sinbad
Downright sinful, bitch, we been full
All my dopeboys, we like kinfolk
Bmore burnt spoon, DC glass pipe
Va sent bales, 'bout that trap life
Blew through thousands, we made millions
Cocaine soldiers, once civilians
Bought hoes Hondas, took care children
Let my pastor, build out buildings
Rapped on classics, I been brilliant
Now we blend in, we chameleons, ahh!

Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darling to set me free
Come back baby, just find me one more time
Ooh baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—

Who else got the luxury to drop when he want 
'Cause nobody else can fuck with me?
What a showoff
Nigga wrist for wrist let's have a glow off
Fuck it, brick for brick let's have a blow off
If we go by connections made
I can still climb ladders when complexions fade (yugh)
White on white that's the tester
Black on black that's the Tesla
See these diamonds in this watch face?
All that shit came from pressure
They don't miss you 'till you gone with the wind
And they tired of dancing like a Ying Yang Twin
You can't have the Yin without the Yang my friend
Real niggas bring balance to the game I'm in (yugh)
Can't escape the scale if I tried, interstate trafficking's alive
Push

Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darling to set me free
Come back baby, just find me one more time
Ooh baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind

Still fresh off the boat niggas (I can't—)
Don't make me super soak niggas
Your life ends up a quote nigga
The good die young, all dogs go to heaven
It's really just mommas falling out on the reverend
I play musical chairs with these squares
Rich flair before they was Ric Flair's
Cocaine concierge, longest running trapper of the year
Stood the test of time like Dapper Dan
Season my sauce like Zatarain's
Is he still in the caravan? (No)
It's a mill' in in the caravan? (Whoa)
Richard Mille on a leather band (whoo)
Behind the wheel like an ambulance (go)
On my way up to Maryland

Never have I been locked up in a world of misery
I need you darling to set me free
Come back baby, just find me one more time
Ooh baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I can't—
Come back baby, just find me one more time
Ooh baby, I'm 'bout to go out of my mind
I-I can't—
