		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ahh ahh ahh

It's the simples things 
that you do to me
take a winners hand 
I got two on me
I wanna go to third base
Can't strike me out
your secrets save

Save me a lil piece on the middle east side
ATL shit been bitter sweet got a lil boo
in Beverly Hills
Ina clean polo fleece I'm throwing peace signs from the east side
Can you please stop?
Cause i hit it out the damn park
Swing batter batter
Bitch bald headed
777
porche 911
gold sunset
Oh what a world I'm living in
I would sign 500 Grand
I'm worth a mill
Several at that 
House on a hill
Several at that.

(You know I'm drinking orange Juice)

It's the simples things 
that you do to me
take a winners hand 
I got two on me
I wanna go to third base
ahh ahh 
Can't strike me out
your secrets save
