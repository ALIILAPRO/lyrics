		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These walls have been aging slowly
My body keeps aging fast
I wasn't made to be here
I wasn't built to last
And so I awoke at midnight
Sweat running down my cheek
I died in the hands of time

Can you rearrange my mind?

Can you rearrange my mind?

Can you rearrange my mind?

These walls have been aging slowly
My body keeps aging fast
I wasn't made to be here
I wasn't built to last

Can you rearrange my mind?
