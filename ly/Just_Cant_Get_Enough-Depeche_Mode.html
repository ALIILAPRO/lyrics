		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

It's getting hotter
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough

You're like an angel
And you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough 
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
