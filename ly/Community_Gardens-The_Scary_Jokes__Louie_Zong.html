		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Full disclosure, I am a monster
A creature of despair, not that that should be a cause for concern
If there's one thing I've learned in all my years here
It's that despair is less abundant in those who understand
How to plant their hearts in community gardens

You'll be fine, you honeycomb
Who could ever hurt you? Who could be so cold?
You'll be fine, oh honey pie
Who could ever hurt you? Who could be so unkind?

The culmination of man's mistakes came the day
The sun ran so hot, it turned the desert to glass
If there's something to be learned from all these losers
It's that the price that you pay
For arrogance and a false sense of immunity
Is to face the wrath of a dying star

You'll be fine, you honeycomb
Who could ever hurt you? Who could be so cold?
You'll be fine, oh honey pie
Who could ever hurt you? Who could be so unkind?

The years have been hard on this lonely heart
If you wanna know the truth
There's no more community gardens
So I guess I'll have to settle for you

(This is Dolly Parton, singing "Jolene"
Yep!
We should cover that
We should
1 2 3 4!)
