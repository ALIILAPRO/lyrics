		  Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
Whoa

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa

I always feel like, like, like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like, like, like (ooh, ooh, ooh)
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like, like, like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like
Whoa

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa

I always feel like, I always feel
I always feel like, feel like, feel like
I always feel like, I always feel
Somebody's watchin' me

Who's watchin'?
Tell me, who's watchin'?
Who's watchin'?
Tell me, who's watchin'?
Who's watchin'?
Tell me, who's watchin'?
Who's watchin' me?
Whoa

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa

I always feel like, like, like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like, like, like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like, like, like
Somebody's watchin' me
Whoa

I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
And I have no privacy
Whoa
I always feel like
I always feel
I always feel like
Feel like, feel like
I always feel like
I always feel
Somebody's watchin' me
Whoa
