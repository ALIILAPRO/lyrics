		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can’t remember when I got up and saw the light of day
I’m staring at these curtains, they’ve been shut since you walked away

I didn't know love could break you and make you bleed
Crush you then cut you deep
I can’t remember when I got up and saw the light of day

They say time is a healer
Life is a teacher
To show you
Show you the way

They say time is a healer
Making you stronger
Well if that’s the case
Then how am I still wounded

Time is a healer
Life is a teacher

Time is a healer

I still remember how it used to feel lying next to you
If only I could get you off my mind wipe away these blues

They say time is a healer
Life is a teacher
To show you
Show you the way

They say time is a healer
Making you stronger
Well if that’s the case
Then how am I still wounded

Time is a healer
Life is a teacher

Time is a healer
Making you stronger

They say time is a healer
Making you stronger

Well if that’s the case
Then how am I still wounded

Time is a healer
Making you stronger

Time is a healer
Making you stronger
