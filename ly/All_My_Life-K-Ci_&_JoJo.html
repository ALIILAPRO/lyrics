		  Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Ooh
I'm so glad

I will never find another lover sweeter than you
Sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you
Girl you are close to me you're like my mother
Close to me you're like my father
Close to me you're like my sister
Close to me you're like my brother (brother)
You are the only one my everything and for you this song I sing

And all my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

I said you're all that I'm thinking of, baby

Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
I really love you

And all (so much) my life (baby, baby) I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God (that I found you) that I finally found you
All my life (oh, girl) I've prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do, love me

You're all that I ever known
When you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow
You turned my life around, you picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known
When you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down, said
You're all that I ever known
When you smile my face glows
You picked me up when I was down
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too

All my life, I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too

And all my life, I've prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life I've prayed for someone like you
