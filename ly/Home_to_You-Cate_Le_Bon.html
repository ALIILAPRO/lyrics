		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Home to you
Is a neighborhood in the night kitchen
Home to you
Is atrocity in the town
Home to you
Is an impasse under hallway ceilings
Home to you
I'm a cross hair, stubborn, dream loving

And it's home, to you, oh
Home to you, oh

If we meet
And they drink from borrowed cups
You read the room to me
All the changing of the light is torture
Memories, ah
Outdoing
Memories, ah

Home to you, oh
Home to you, oh

Home to you, oh
Home to you, oh
Home to you
Home to you

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
Last time
Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
Last time
Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
Last time
Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone

Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah

Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
Last time
Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
Last time
Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
Last time
Last time for all time
Last time for all time gone
