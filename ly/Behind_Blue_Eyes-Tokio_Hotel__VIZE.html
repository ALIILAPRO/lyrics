		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I let you go
I'm holdin' on
I am here but you're long gone
You think you own me, you are wrong again

Blindin' lights, impoundin' veins
Tryin' to escape our fate
You're pourin' gas into the flame again

No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To tellin' only lies

But my dreams, they are just empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours
Only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free

No turning back
No moving on
In the end I'm on my own
But I don't wanna be alone again

No one knows what it's like to be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it's like to be hated
To be faded
To tellin' only lies

But my dreams, they are just empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours
Only lonely
My love is vengeance
That's never free
