		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
'Cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

'Cause I'm leaving in the morning
And I must see you again
We'll have one more night together
'Til the morning brings my train and I must go
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

Take the last train to Clarksville
I'll be waiting at the station
We'll have time for coffee-flavored kisses
And a bit of conversation
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

Take the last train to Clarksville
Now I must hang up the phone
I can't hear you in this noisy railroad station all alone
I'm feeling low
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

And I don't know if I'm ever coming home

Oh
(Ah)

Take the last train to Clarksville
And I'll meet you at the station
You can be here by four thirty
'Cause I've made your reservation, don't be slow
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no

And I don't know if I'm ever coming home
Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
Take the last train to Clarksville
