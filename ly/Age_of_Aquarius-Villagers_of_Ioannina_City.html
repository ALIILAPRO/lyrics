		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay close to the river and cry
And the river's gonna feel you're the god of rain
He's gonna worship you like god and creator for ages
And all the fairies of the forest will come
They wanna show you to the dance of night
This is the Age of Aquarius

oh

Stay close to the river and cry
And the river's gonna feel you're the god of rain
He's gonna worship you like god and creator for ages
And all the fairies of the forest will come
They wanna show you to the dance of night
This is the Age of Aquarius

Hey!

I'm coming out of river
Breathing out, I'm finally reborn

Rain is falling to the shore
Dawn is coming, the night is almost gone

I came from where the Leo is rising
I've travelled through the space for so long
A forest nymph is calling for me
Come along and I will guide where to go

Age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius

We ran to the mountain
We've found an ancient temple with my name
Then she bowed and said these words
We were waiting here a thousand years for you
Now you must do something
To bring the light
Now you must do something
To change the world

Age of Aquarius
Age of Aquarius

Returning again to mother earth
To set the fire and rain
I'm turning again the circles of time
To bring the sun back again
