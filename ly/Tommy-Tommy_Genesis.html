		  G-g-g-good Work Charlie
Bueno

She want a picture with Tommy
You know she come from the country
She drive a Ford, Tommy
She can't afford Tommy
You pay the bill like you want me
You fly me out like you found me
Can't find another girl, tell me
Can't find another girl, Tommy

She wanna know who's Tommy
Who's this girl Tommy?
She wanna know who's Tommy
All these bitches get off me
Nobody fuck like Tommy
Nobody talk like Tommy
Nobody walk like Tommy
All these bitches, get off me
You know I wear the Hilfiger
You know I stare when you with her
You know she hate me, you know that
You know she'd date me, you know that
I got a gun, Tommy
My dawgs, they run for me
I don't need you, nah
I don't need you, nah
This is my song, Tommy
Who made the beat? Charlie
What do you want? Oh, me
What do you need? Tommy

We got a movement like baby
We in this church, save me
I do not fuck with you, maybe
I don't know who you are lately

Bueno
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy

We got a movement like baby
We in this church, save me
I do not fuck with you, maybe
I don't know who you are lately
We got a moment like baby
We in this church, I save me
I do not fuck with you, maybe
I don't know who you are lately

She changed her name, Tommy
She got new game, mommy
She look the same
She look the same
She changed her name, Tommy
She got new game
She look the same
She look the same
Why, do you think I'm weak?
Why, why do you turn the cheek?
Why, why do you follow me?
But, boy, can you swallow me?

She want a picture with Tommy
You know she come from the country
She drive a Ford, Tommy
She can't afford Tommy
You pay the bill like you want me
You fly me out like you found me
Can't find another girl, Tommy
Can't find another girl, Tommy

Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
Tommy, Tommy
(Tommy, Tommy)
