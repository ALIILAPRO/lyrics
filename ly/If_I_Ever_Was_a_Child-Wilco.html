		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've never been alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child

I was tied up like a boat
On a button like a coat
Set free for the wild
I'd jump to jolt my clumsy blood
While my white, green eyes
Cry like a windowpane
Can my cold heart change
Even out of spite?

I saw
Behind my brain
A haunted stain
It never fades
I hunt
For the kind of pain
I can take

And I cry like a windowpane
Can my cold heart change
Overnight?
So I won't ever want to touch
Your heart too much
Or hold you too tight

I saw
Behind my brain
A haunted stain
It never fades
I hunt
For the kind of pain
I can take

I never was alone
Long enough to know
If I ever was a child
