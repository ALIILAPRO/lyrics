		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Praa
Blvcksheep for life, Blvcksheep forever
Odumodublvck, you get me?
Bigfoot, you get me?
Eh

Carry your own come, Lotanna
I get am for Chidera
She came to you in Bottega
The pressure na kpalava
I carry my bandana
Big man, who goes?
The M-O na kaluba
Big kala, komkpi
I no dey hear your lamba
Obrigado, na I don blow
Thanks, I want to shoot and go home
Bigfoot, who goes?
I want to shoot and go home
Bigfoot who-?
I want to shoot and go home

Back with the guys wey go brew your crew
Na we be the ones wey dey boost your boo
Give her money, spend on her
Flex and jolly oh, taste her uhm
Who and who?
I dey knack their babe, but they think I'm cool
Puss in boots
Anything I do, they go like go run am too
2 by 2
Come with pankere, flog these fools
Odumodublvck, I go pluck bamboo
Chop banku, kiss and tell
I no dey for cock and bull
Babes wey dey find me plenty
I no dey for kpekelemesi
Test me, Messi
I go dribble the bunda, this one no tiki taka

Carry your own come, Lotanna
I get am for Chidera
She came to you in Bottega
The pressure na kpalava
I carry my bandana
Big man, who goes?
The M-O na kaluba
Big kala, komkpi
I no dey hear your lamba
Obrigado, na I don blow
Thanks, I want to shoot and go home
Bigfoot, who dares?
I want to shoot and go home
Bigfoot who-?
I want to shoot and go home

Ojemba, show me workings
Uchenna tender billings
Ogboglogbo, my mantle
Desecrate every temple
Put in your way, the felony is so simple
Put it on Yahweh, who dey test my God?
1-2-3, I go cock my gun
Clean my sword
Dawn to dawn, for my flesh and blood
Okilika akube
E dey body oh, sotey
My mummy said I'm a big boy
Chikala dey my loca-
My chikala dey on cocaine
Your own, she dey on Caprisonne
Small, small boys, make we leave talk
If you carry one gun, I go carry pass your own

Carry your own come, Lotanna
I get am for Chidera
She came to you in Bottega
The pressure na kpalava
I carry my bandana
Big man, who goes?
The M-O na kaluba
Big kala, komkpi
I no dey hear your lamba
Obrigado, na I don blow
Thanks, I want to shoot and go home
Bigfoot, who goes?
I want to shoot and go home
Bigfoot who-?
I want to shoot and go home
