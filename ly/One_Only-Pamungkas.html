		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, there you are
Sittin' still, all stripes and lonely
Hidin', wishin', waitin'
While I'm, here I am
I'm standin' still stare at you only
Everythin' gets blurry

All I want is just to stay
You can't shake me
I would never dare let go
Through the talkin' and the walkin'
I will give you all of my lovin'

Start countin' all the days
Forever I will stay with you
With you, one only you
Go far and roam about
Come back and callin' out to me
To me, one only me

Oh, I'm in love
What did I do to deserve you?
You tell me, what did I do
To be with you, love?
To be the one you runnin' into
When the days do come through

All I want is just to stay
You can't shake me
I would never dare, oh no, let go
Through the talkin' and the walkin'
I will give you all of my lovin'
(All of my, all the good lovin')

Start countin' all the days
Forever I will stay with you
With you, one only you
Go far and roam about
Come back and callin' out to me
To me, one only me

Well, I'm luckiest
To be the one, be the one
To get you, to get you, to get you now
Well, I'm happiest
To found the one, found the one
Found the one only kinda love

Well it's you
One only you, yeah

Start countin' all the days
Forever I will stay with you
With you, one only you
Go far and roam about
Come back and callin' out to me
To me, one only me

I wanna follow you (ooh-ooh)
I wanna follow you forever (whoa, yeah)
With you, one only you
I wanna follow you
I wanna follow you forever
With you, one only you

Oh, I'm in love
What did I do to deserve you?
You tell me, what did I do?
