		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My lil bitch bad cant stay from
This love won't last let's make our peace
I'll call you back when I get free
But baby don't you go and wait forever no

My lil bitch bad cant stay from
This love won't last let's make our peace
I'll call you back when I get free
But baby don't you go and wait forever no
But baby don't you go and wait forever no

Sorry mommy I got body odys in my closet yeah
Origami made from all that rhymin in my pocket yeah
These days rather  be nothin instead of the frontin 
Shit isn't working anymore 
We've had mental eruption 
Was that over nothing
Was I over thinking about I don't know
Lies creep out your throat 
You say you aint know
Intuition that's sweet as gold 
Had to leave you in the cold
We've been down these dirt roads
I know you've been hurt before
So I wont be the reason why you broke, see

My lil bitch bad cant stay from
This love won't last let's make our peace
I'll call you back when I get free
But baby don't you go and wait forever no

My lil bitch bad cant stay from
This love won't last let's make our peace
I'll call you back when I get free
But baby don't you go and wait forever no
But baby don't you go and wait forever no
But baby don't you go and wait forever no

I came back but not to swim
In concrete water love me harder
Time went on I can't pretend
cause we've been farther 
Apart why bother
My bitch bad can't stay away from me
This here just won't last let's make our peace
Yes i've said this all before but still
