		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have a phobia 
A fear of the dark
Afraid to shoot strangers 
The animal talks

Guns scare me shitless
But love gun's my friend
The sentinel's coming
But is this the end

Riding on this crazy train
I'm going paranoid
Watch me lose my mind
And break the law

It's close to midnight and 
He's barking at the moon
The rainbow in the dark is shining

It's close to midnight and 
He's barking at the moon
The kings of metal ride the sky

Is this s:t anger
The ultimate sin
Or have I really
A black knight within

The gates of Babylon 
Are open and wide
Shout at the devil
There's nowhere to hide

Fighting for the world to keep 
The wild child in it's cage
Broke my metal heart 
Against the wall
