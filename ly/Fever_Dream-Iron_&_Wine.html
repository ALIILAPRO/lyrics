		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Some days her shape in the doorway 
Will speak to me
A bird's wing on the window 
Sometimes I'll hear when she's sleeping 
Her fever dream
A language on her face 

"I want your flowers like babies want God's love
Or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come" 

Some days, like rain on the doorstep 
She'll cover me
With grace in all she offers 
Sometimes I'd like just to ask her 
What honest words
She can't afford to say, like

"I want your flowers like babies want God's love
Or maybe as sure as tomorrow will come"
