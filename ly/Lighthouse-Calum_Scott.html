		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the dark of the night, not a star in the sky
I can feel your love pull against the tide
And I see you shining bright like a lighthouse
And the wind's got the water running wild
But I'll swim to you, swim for my life
And I pray I'll make it before the night's out

I won't let you go
I feel it in my bones
No matter where I go
You're where my heart belongs
All I know
I'll follow every road
'Til I find my way back home
You're where my heart
You're where my heart
You're where my heart belongs
You're where my heart belongs

I belong right there in your open arms
The world can try to tear us apart
But our love will guide us home like a lighthouse
Walk a thousand miles in the pouring rain
And a million years couldn't change the way
The way I feel, I feel 'bout you right now

I won't let you go
I feel it in my bones
No matter where I go
You're where my heart belongs
All I know
I'll follow every road
'Til I find my way back home
You're where my heart
You're where my heart
You're where my heart belongs
You're where my heart belongs

I won't let you go
I feel it in my bones
No matter where I go
You're where my heart belongs
All I know
I'll follow every road (every road)
'Til I find my way back home (way back home)
You're where my heart
You're where my heart
You're where my heart belongs
You're where my heart belongs
You're where my heart belongs
