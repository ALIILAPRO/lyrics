		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm waiting all alone
The way sun meets with her eyes
In the dusk, I know
It's hard to breathe right now
With all the feelings though
We're lost with no where to go
Where are you now?
I'm sorry you're waiting
For nothing, It's true
Forgive me 'cuz I know
I'm not good enough for you
These shadows around you
They follow me too
Tell the spirits in the air
I was nothing but good
Feel me up with love
'Cuz I don't have enough
Think I'll just collapse
Heart's beating too fast
I'm sorry you're waiting
For nothing, It's true
'Cuz I don't have that much to lose
Anymore
Forgive me now
Stuck in a lie
And I can't hide it
Until I die
Until I die
I don't wanna live without
The only thing that makes my life turn around
Drowning out the thoughts and the sounds
Forgetting what they do to us now
Do to us now
You're waiting
For nothing, It's true
Forgive me 'cuz I know
I'm not good enough for you
These shadows around you
They follow me too
Tell the spirits in the air
I was nothing but good
Feel me up with love
'Cuz I don't have enough
Think I'll just collapse
Heart's beating too fast
I'm sorry you're waiting
For nothing, It's true
'Cuz I don't have that much to lose
Anymore
