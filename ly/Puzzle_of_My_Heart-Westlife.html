		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the way she fills my senses
It's the perfume that she wears
I feel I'm losing my defenses
To the color of your hair

And every little piece of her is right
Just thinking about her takes me through the night

[Chorus]
Every time we meet the picture is complete
Every time we touch the feeling is too much
She's all I ever need to fall in love again
I knew it from the very start
She's the puzzle of my heart

It's the way she's always smiling
That makes people think she never cries
Feel like I'm losing my defenses
To the color of her eyes

And every little piece of her is right

[Chorus]

Like a miracle should meant to be
She became the light inside of me
Like a feeling like a memory from long ago

[Chorus]
