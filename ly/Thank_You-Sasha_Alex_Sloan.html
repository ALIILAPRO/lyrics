		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I have a bad dream
You stay up through the night
Calmin' me down, tellin'
Me I'm alright when I think that I'm dyin'
I've been known to be one who gives up
You save me, baby
I know I don't say this enough

Thank you for loving me when you don't have to
Right by my side when I get in my head or have a bad day
Straight from the heart, I wanna say thank you

When I feel insecure (when I feel insecure)
And I make it a fight (and I make it a fight)
You don't go slamming doors
You tell me it's alright 'cause you know that I'm trying
I've been known to blow little things up
You save me, baby
I know I don't say this enough

Thank you for loving me when you don't have to
Right by my side when I get in my head or have a bad day
You stitch me up when you could walk away
So thank you for loving me when I forget to
Right by my side when I'm falling apart and running on fumes
Straight from the heart, I wanna say thank you
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you

You can leave anytime you want
Grab your keys, baby, you'll be gone
You stuck around through the bad and good
I don't say this as much as I should

Thank you for loving me when you don't have to
Right by my side when I get in my head (get in my head)
Or have a bad day (have a bad day)
You stitch me up when you could walk away
So thank you for loving me when I forget to
Right by my side when I'm falling apart and running on fumes
Straight from the heart, I wanna say thank you
Thank you
Thank you
