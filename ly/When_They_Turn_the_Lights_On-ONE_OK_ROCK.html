		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been climbin' since I was young
Never stopped to look down
I lost track of the man I was
Took a fall to know how

Selfish, I've been
Oh, what I wouldn't give
To lose it all and find myself

I was broken (ooh), I was (ooh) caught up in the moment (ooh)
I know that I was wrong
But when they turn the lights on
I'll be stronger (ooh), I can stand a (ooh) little taller
The darkness will be gone
When they turn the lights on
Lights on tonight

I went swimmin' with heavy weights
I was holdin' my breath
(Ooh) I been drownin' in my mistakes (ooh)
In a sea of regrets

Selfish (ah), I've been
Oh, (ah) what I wouldn't give
To lose it all and find myself

I was broken, I was caught up in the moment
I know that I was wrong
But when they turn the lights on
I'll be stronger (ooh), I can stand a (ooh) little taller
The darkness will be gone
When they turn the lights on
Lights on tonight

Needed some reflection in my life
Never seen a vision quite as bright
I just want a second chance to make it better (better)
Better (better)
It's never enough

I was broken, I was caught up in the moment
I know that I was wrong
But when they turn the lights on
I'll be stronger (stronger), I can stand a (stand a) little taller (taller)
The darkness will be gone
When they turn the lights on
(Lights on)
光が暗闇を照らしていく
もう恐れるものはない
