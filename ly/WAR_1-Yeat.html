		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, let's go
Gotta wait for this pill to kick in hey
Yeah hey, hey yeah

Yeah, she wanna suck our dicks just
'cause she like what's popular
Yeah, we gon' ride with sticks at night
We ain't no travelers
Big ol' bag, that's a hundred G's
Count and swerve (Money)
Near 'bout every time that I
Speak I get some more
Told you we some different creatures
(Let's go)
Got a hundred missiles coming out that
Shit to come and get you
It's a hundred fifty, riding 'round
Wе gon' take this shit to war
I got hundreds
Fifties on mе and I'll take this shit to war
I got hundreds, fifties on me
We gon' take this shit to war
I got hundreds, fifties on me
We gon' take this shit to war (Let's go)

Twizzy sending shots just like he Curry
I'm confused
Why he wake up with some courage?
(Why? Why?) he thought he got a bad bitch
They steady curving him (No)
I'm gon' stay up in my lane
I am not merging them
This G Wagen, it's 2021
This bitch so perfect, yeah
(Swerve)
No, I'm not cumming inside that bitch
If there's no drug in her (Nah)
No, I ain't going into the booth
Unless I'm paid in there (yeah)
I don't understand why you're hating
When you're a millionaire (yeah)
I'm too underrated
Thought that they would leave me there
(yeah) got off the floor, I'm going
To the top, babe, you could meet me there
(Babe) i tried to save you in time
But you wanted to stay in there
You ain't never did nothing with none
Of your hate in your derrière
You need to go and get yourself some racks
You wanna be out of here
I forgot, you still working a job, yeah
That nine o'clock
I forgot you ain't smoking za
You smoking crack rock
I forgot, I was out of school on the blacktop
I forgot, I made fifty bands off this laptop
I forgot, your bitch over here twerking
She make the bands talk (yeah, yeah)
I forgot, I was getting bail date
I forgot, I was at the gym
Doing money weights
I forgot, all these labels call me every day
I forgot, I was broke, I ain't been this way

Yeah, she wanna suck our dicks just
'cause she like what's popular
Yeah, we gon' ride with sticks at night
We ain't no travelers
Big ol' bag, that's a hundred G's
Count and swerve (Money)
Near 'bout every time that I
Speak I get some more
Told you we some different creatures
(Let's go)
Got a hundred missiles coming out that
Shit to come and get you
It's a hundred fifty, riding 'round
Gon' take this shit to war i got hundreds
Fifties on me and I'll take this shit to war
I got hundreds, fifties on me
We gon' take this shit to war
I got hundreds, fifties on me
We gon' take this shit to war
