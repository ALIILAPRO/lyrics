		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
How'd ya like to spend the holiday away across the sea? 
How'd ya like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island? 
How'd ya like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree? 

How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do? 
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
You will never stray for everyday 
Your Christmas dreams come true

How'd ya like to spend Christmas
Without a turkey
On Christmas Island
Where is the mistletoe?
How'd you like to spend the holiday
Way across the sea?
Maybe for you, but not for me

How'd ya like to stay up late like the islanders do? 
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe 
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island 
You will never stray, for everyday 
Your Christmas dreams come true 
"What's the old boy gonna use for a chimney?"
You will never ever stray for every day
Your Christmas dreams come true, too true
