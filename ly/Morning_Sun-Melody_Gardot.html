		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There little babe, don't you cry
We got that sunny morning waitin' on us now
There's a light at the end of the tunnel
We can be worry-free
Just take it from me
Honey child
Let me tell you now, child

That morning sun is here to greet us
With her loving light so warm
That morning sun is here to meet us
Waitin' on the wakin' up of everyone

She ain't gonna quit 'till you're smiling now
Lemme tell you, child
Lemme tell you, honey child

That morning sun
Has come to greet ya
She's peekin' round the corner
Just waitin' just to meet ya
Shinin' down on all your troubles
Lemme tell ya, child
Lemme tell ya, honey child

'Cause this world was made for dreamin'
This world was made for you
This world made for believin'
In all the things you're gonna do
Ah, honey child
Lemme tell ya now, child
