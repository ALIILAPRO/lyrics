		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quiet airport
Deep echoes
I hear my steps
Down this terminal

Quite unusual
Not a soul
I’m in an airport
But all alone

Cause you are
The only
Arrival
And this place is empty

But I’ll stay
I’ll sit for
A while
Waiting for you my love

This vacant airport
Is a strange metaphor
But it’s all to say
My time is yours

Cause if you were
The only
Arrival
And this place was empty

Well I’d stay
I’d sit for
A while
Waiting for you my love

You have my forever
Whatever that may mean
Forever, whatever that may mean
Forever, whatever that may mean
Forever, whatever
