		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Many a sin I have witnessed 
And in many indeed I have been
Many a rat I have befriended 
And so many a thorn stood between

But of all the demons I have known
None could compare to you

Every day that you feed me with hate I grow stronger
Every day that you feed me with hate I grow stronger

Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light

Many a mind I have haunted 
And in many a way I have been
Often the one to have flaunted 
An image grotesque and obscene

But of all these dark roads that I roam
None could compare to you

Every day that you feed me with hate I grow stronger
Every day that you feed me with hate I grow stronger

Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light

Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light
Drink me, eat me
Then you'll see the light

Every day (Drink me)
That you feed me with hate (Eat me)
I grow stronger (Then you'll see the light)
Every day (Drink me)
That you feed me with hate (Eat me)
I grow stronger (Then you'll see the light)
