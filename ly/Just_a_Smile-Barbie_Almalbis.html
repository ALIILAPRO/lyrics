		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna tell you everything
Please reveal
Won?t you come up closer
I want to hear you breathe

I?m walking donw the street
I?m lost at sea
Out of the crowd you smile and
You?re all I see

chorus
You make me feel like I
Can get lost inside your eyes
I feel closer to the sky
When you save the day with just a smile

Just a smile

I wanna meet you someday soon
?Cause I know you in my mind
Everything will be different
When I have you right beside

You take the whole wide world
With your boyish charm
Even as you hold me close
I want to stay in your arms

chorus

When I looked for you in everyone
I thought I?d search the world in vain
Now you look at me and the search is done
We will never be the same, not the same

chorus

Oh you make me feel like I
Can get lost inside your eyes
I feel closer to the sky
When you save the day with just a smile
Just a smile, a smile
Just a smile
