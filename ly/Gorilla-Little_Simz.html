		  Sim Simma
Who got the keys to my bloodclaat Bimmer?
Big time driller, monkey to gorilla
Who is this woman that I'm seein' in the mirror?
Drink '42 and smoke cigar
Name one time where I didn't deliver
Silent figure
I was just on the ends, droppin' gems with my friends
I got a 3310 and a pack of blems
Then got the gold, full black, circle back again
Rappin' when nothin' progressive was happenin'
Ooh, pain tolerance, couldn't break us
Pay homage if you respect how we came up, cool (cool)
Tryin' to get to the paper
Hitter from Jamaica might do me a favor, true (true)
Big Simma dippin' ten toes in the ice cold river
Bank got bigger
Been a different species, tunes in the locker
Been waitin' to unleash these
It's a no show if you can't guarantee fees (no, no, no)
I ain't got one threat to consider
Heaven and Earth attached to one killer (one, one)
Rest in peace to Mac Miller, new Simz drop to shake the whole shit up
What's next? (Ayy) 
We'll be here for months talkin' about prospects
Stayin' about my job, yes sir
When rain is against her I'm weather-resistant 
On my polyester (grrah, grrah, grrah)
Run through the jungle, they should've never let her (woop, woop)
Cut and wounds, I hope never will fester
Mmh, yeah, big art collector, silent investor, film director
Beatin' on my chest goin' apeshit, put him in the grave shit
Fame life what you make it, yeah, it is

Cuttin' through the jungle in a all black fitted
Hat low, incognito livin'
Introvert, but, she ain't timid
My art will be timeless, I don't do limits (no)
Be very specific when you talk on who the best is
How can I address this?
Basically, the rest is almost like to me what a stain to a vest is
You ain't drop nothin' in my eyes I'm impressed with
Please, don't be offended (please)
But I'm not in the business for pretendin' (no)
I got lines if you wanna get rentin'
Go find the agony aunt and get ventin' (vent)
Stop floodin' my mentions with bullshit
Talkin' on Simz like she's someone you went school with, awkward (awkward)
From day, been a cool kid, rap star hopin', the faith, I'm restorin'
Don't ask my opinion on shit 
Cause to make you feel good about yourself is exhaustin'
I got bangers out in the world soarin'
And I got bangers in the vault I've been hoardin'
Yeah, true I got tennis in the mornin'
Before I start swingin' that man's gonna need a warnin'
Red light whenever I'm recordin'
Red light on the forehead of the informant
See, I'm the only one on gorilla
Simz is back here, just got realer, yeah
No choice now but to feel us
I know the streets will love it, like I brought Mike Skinner
Said, "Simmer down, little homie, simmer"
All that talk get you rubbed out quicker
I'm cut with a different scissor
From the same cloth as my dear ancestors
That's why this shit gives you the shivers, I'm that cold

Higher
Goin' higher
Higher
Goin' higher
Higher
Yeah, we are
Higher
Say what?

Hey, sound so special inside the world we live in
It's so rare to find it, huh
Huh, go peep that, yeah
It's about time
We got the just dues for the work
we put in over a decade in this bitch, you know
Yeah, man, woo

Say he never called another woman, "Mi Amor"
So, I opened up the way and now he adore
Did it on the wave, I don't play, get you sea sick
Charged up, fully bared up, I'm unleashin'
