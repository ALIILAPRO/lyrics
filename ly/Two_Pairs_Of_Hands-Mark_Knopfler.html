		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We got the roller coaster piling along
The power and the glory with the song
Holy moly, where did the time go?
I told you, baby, now you know

I'm keeping the balls in the air
When I'm up here on the band
There'll be a little bit here and there
Still be trying to understand

But they'll all be in the air
When I'm up here on the band
What it is, I'm juggling here
I've only got two pairs of hands

There's a pin-drop, they follow a thread
And a lone voice cries out overhead
When the thunder bursts in the velvet night
There's joy and wonder and delight

I'm keeping the balls in the air
Tryna keep up with the band
There'll be a little bit here and there
I might get covered by the drifting sand

But they'll all be in the air
When I'm up here on the band
What it is, I'm juggling here
I've only got two pairs of hands

They're back in the streets and into the bars
The trams and the trains and back in their cars
Holy moly, where did the time go?
I told you, baby, now you know

I'm keeping the balls in the air
Tryna keep up with the band
There'll be a little bit here and there
Might get covered by the drifting sand

But they'll all be in the air
When I'm up here on the band
What it is, I'm juggling here
I've only got two pairs of hands
