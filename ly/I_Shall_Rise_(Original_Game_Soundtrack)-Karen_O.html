		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I walk through frozen sands
Through the flames of burning lands
My feet are torn, they're torn to strands
I will not thirst

As I cross the raging sea
Waves are crashing over me
They drag me down, they drag me down
I will not drown

They'll know my name
After the storms are passing through
They'll know my name
When they've forgotten all about you
They'll know my name
After the storms are passing through
They'll know my name
When they've forgotten all about you

They're calling out, they're calling out my name
They're calling out, they're calling out my name

And I shall rise, oh well I shall rise
Again and again
I shall rise, oh well I shall rise
Again and again
And I shall rise, oh well I shall rise
Again and again
I shall rise, oh well I shall rise
Again and again

I shall rise, oh well I shall rise
Again and again
I shall rise, oh well I shall rise
Again and again
