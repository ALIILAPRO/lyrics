		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Tyler might've did somethin')

Please stop callin', you've been dishonest
I've been through enough
Two faced promise, scars and traumas
You put me through enough
Yeah, I've been through, through
Enough with you, you
Please stop callin', you've been dishonest
Stop, you've done enough

Yeah, I had to walk away from all the lies
Think that it's time for me to rise again, yeah
Yeah, I can't believe I wasted all my time
Just to tell another one goodbye, my friend
You already walked that line, you crossed it many times
Yeah you know how to get the best of me
You said you changed, you won't, I guess I should've known
You'll never get another chance with me

Yeah, like don't you think I've been through enough?
Baby, we've been fallin' in out of love
You shot me down, yeah, lost all my trust
Everything you promising is really a bluff

Please stop callin', you've been dishonest
I've been through enough
Two faced promise, scars and traumas
You put me through enough
Yeah, I've been through, through
Enough with you, you
Please stop callin', you've been dishonest
Stop, you've done enough

Memories all in my head
I've been playin' the same ones, been playing the same ones
Yeah, you gotta move on
Yeah, it's not gon' be the same it was once, the way it was once was
It's time to leave, you gotta go
Just let me be, I'm on my own
I'm sick of you and all your moods
And I ain't here to play no games, no

Yeah, like don't you think I've been through enough?
Baby, we've been fallin' in out of love
You shot me down, yeah, lost all my trust
Everything you promising is really a bluff

Please stop callin', you've been dishonest
I've been through enough
Two faced promise, scars and traumas
You put me through enough
Yeah, I've been through, through
Enough with you, you
Please stop callin', you've been dishonest
Stop, you've done enough
