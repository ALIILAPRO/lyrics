		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up
It's dare

It's dare

You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself, work it out

Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's dare

It's dare

You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare

Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself work it out

Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's dare
Never did no harm
Never did no harm
It's dare
It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up
It's coming up, it's coming up
It's dare

You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare

Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself work it out

You've got to press it on you
You've just been thinking
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down, dare

Jump with the moon and move it
Jump back and forth
It feels like you were there yourself work it out
