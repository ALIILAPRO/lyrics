		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can run with the headlights on
Till we got nothing to lose

We have, lifting from the ground
We go, never coming down

I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

Every day the weekend, I'm tryna be your best friend
Trying just to figure it out
Go on and let your gun burst
Living on the outskirts
Trying just to figure it out
Talking like a deadbeat, I just wanted you to see
Everything that I could see
Walking in the night sky, I'm always on your side
You are really saving me

We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance, we got nothing to lose

I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

We had, lifting from the ground
We go, never coming down

I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
I'll take you there
I'll take you there

Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know

Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know

Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know

Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know

(Throw me a bone)
Don't go wasting your time
(Don't be scared of what you don't already know)

(Throw me a bone)
Don't go wasting your time
(Don't be scared of what you don't already know)

(Throw me a bone)
Don't go wasting your time
(Don't be scared of what you don't already know)

Don't go wasting your time
Don't go wasting your time
