		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Searching for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Say that it's love, but to me it's looking counterfeit
I get done with one, and move right on to another bitch
Yeah

Uh, college educated, she graduated
Any bill she can't front, her parents paid it
The show was far, you the only one with a car
And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it
Most girls wanna hide the fact that the thrill, they chasin'
But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it
Value player, hotel room, meet you there

Walking on a dream
How can I explain
Talking to myself
(Just travelin' the world)
Will I see again
(Tryin' different drugs and girls)

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

And I'm addicted to champagne (champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at (planes at)

Yeah, uh
Wake up drunk, go to sleep fucked up
We both amazed at what we just done
Mixing drinks, knowing we'll regret this
Ain't been asleep yet, room service bringing us breakfast
All this money, darling, what else is left to do
But smoke and enjoy my presidential view
Got a swimming pool in my living room
On stage, interviews, tons of sour, let's consume

We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out and out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

And I'm addicted to champagne (champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at
And I'm addicted to champagne (champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at (planes at)

(Catch me I'm falling down)
Yeah, that's what it is
(Catch me I'm falling down)
Until I drop the next one

And I'm addicted to champagne (champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at
And I'm addicted to champagne (champagne)
Fuck the room, we buy the whole wing (whole wing)
Bitches I Taylor Gang that (Taylor Gang that)
They just wanna know where the planes at (planes at)

(Catch me I'm falling down)
(Catch me I'm falling down)
