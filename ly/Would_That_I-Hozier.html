		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
Willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicos
Over canopy dappled long ago

True that love in withdrawal was the weeping of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
Fretted fire but that was long ago

And it's not tonight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Where I'm set alight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
And I blink in sight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Your blinding light (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Where you hold me tight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Light it fire bright (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

With the roar of the fire my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago

With each love I cut loose
I was never the same
Watching still living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Laying waste to my lovin' long ago

And it's not tonight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Where I'm set alight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
And I blink in sight (ooh-ooh-oh)
Your blinding light (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
You hold me tight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
And the fire bright (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

So in awe there I stood
As you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
As long as amber of ember glows
All the wood that I'd loved is long ago

And it's not tonight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Where I'm set alight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
And I blink in sight (ooh-ooh-oh)
Of your blinding light (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
When you hold me tight (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
And the fire bright (ooh-ooh-oh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (ooh-oh-oh-oh)
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me
Oh, you're good to me
You're good to me
Oh, but you're good to me, baby
