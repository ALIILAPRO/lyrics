		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I feel lonely
Please, can you hold me?
I need a light in the dark, please light up my heart
Please, can you show me
How to be lovely?
Sometimes it's hard to be strong, I can't face it alone, no
 
Yeah, I crawled through the dirt, I was lost, I was hurt, oh love
I run alone through the night, I was searchin' a light in the dark
When I need to get up, I get stuck in the mud, I do
All this time I was lost, seems I wasted my love
 
Please, can you hold me?
I feel so lonely
I need a light in the dark, please light up my heart
Please, can you show me
How to be lovely?
Sometimes it's hard to be strong, I can't face it alone, no
 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
 
Say, is there someone who cares about me at all?
Give me your hand, baby, please, I don't want to fall
Everything seems to be fallin', fallin' apart
I just wanna hold you, and kiss you, and give you my love
 
Please, can you hold me? (hold me)
I feel so lonely (lonely)
I need a light in the dark, please light up my heart (heart)
Please, can you show me (show me)
How to be lovely?
Sometimes it's hard to be strong, I can't face it alone, no
 
Please, can you hold me? 
Hold me?
Hold me, please, can you hold me?
'Cause I feel so lonely
