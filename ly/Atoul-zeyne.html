		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eyes tell no lies
All is revealed
Tell me
Are we supposed to fall this deep, this quick?

All that’s on my mind 
Can’t be put into words 
Should I say what I’ve kept locked inside
I guess there’s no escape

Ya Habibi…

I never expected to fall for you so quickly
I never expected you to turn my world upside 
I never expected how much you’d change what I was used to
I never expected to fall for you so quickly

Cool the pace down, take a look at who’s in front of you
There’s no reason for us to be skipping steps
Then again, when I get lost in your eyes

I just break down
Try to cool down
What to do now?

But my heart simply won’t let me
Separate my logic from my longing
I’m worried my will power won’t hold out…

Ya Habibi…

I never expected to fall for you so quickly
I never expected you to turn my world upside 
I never expected how much you’d change what I was used to
I never expected to fall for you so quickly

Overnight, we became fools of this game called love 
How do I make sense of it all?

I never expected to fall for you so quickly
I never expected you to turn my world upside 
I never expected how much you’d change what I was used to
I never expected to fall for you so quickly
