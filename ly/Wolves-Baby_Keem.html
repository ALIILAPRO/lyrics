You gotta be the youngest nigga doin' it

Wrist, I might flip that, i might
Dare I say it, part Russian on my clip

Shoutout to Cardo)
Dare I say it, bitch, I'm Baby Keem
I don't have time for trends dare I say it

Ho? You kissin' on my friends dare I say it

Bullets in this bitch, we go up like Baghdad

Full clip, hundred bricks, I move sand
