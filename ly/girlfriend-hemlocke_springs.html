		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say, "I want to be your girlfriend"
It wasn't really in my plans
When you're around, I got arrhythmia
So in the end, I play pretend
You've got the (uh) of a cool dude
But you should know I like it hot
But if there's really no denying what this is
Then come on, let's give it a shot (can you hear me?)

Well, I know
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
You say, "I want to be your, your girl"
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"

Well, it all depends
You say, "I want to be your girlfriend"
But do you want to be my man?

I'll treat you like you are a carry on (carry on, carry on)
Like you're my one and only fan (oh my God, I love you)
My kindness is of a false pretense
I've got the ego of a God

But if you take me in your arms
Be confident
I commit a character fraud
Stop, stop, stop

Well, oh, oh
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
You say, "I want to be your, your girl"
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
It wasn't really in my plans
Eh, eh

Oh, oh
Oh
Two, three, four

Secretly I'm aiming for a rhythm that exceeds my expectations
Am I ever gonna get it?
Your girl is in the businesses so there's little room for idle contemplation
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
With you, oh

You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
You say, "I want to be your, your girl"
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
You say, "I want to be your, your girl"
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
You say, "I want to be your, your girl"
You say, "I want to be your, your girlfriend"
It wasn't really in my plans
