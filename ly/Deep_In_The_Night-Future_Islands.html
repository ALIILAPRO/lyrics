		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Deep in the night
You know I miss you more when I'm stuck inside
This room without you and you're still asleep
I'm like a prowling lion that's seeking pride
When the morning finds you

I belong to you
I belong to you
When you take my hand I understand where you end
And that's where I began

Deep in the night
You know I hear your voice when I cut the lights
And I see you there and you're sound asleep
And it's the only time when I find peace
When this ends I'll find you

I belong to you, it's true
I belong to you
When you take my hand I understand where you end
That's where I began
And all it took, one walk with you
And I knew that I belong to you

I belong
I belong, I belong to you
