		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This isn't goodbye
Even as I watch you leave
This isn't goodbye
I swear I won't cry
Even as tears fill my eyes
I swear I won't cry

Any other girl I let you walk away
Any other girl I'm sure I'll be okay

Tell me what makes a man want to give you all his heart
Smile when you're around and cry when you're apart
If you know what makes a man want to love you the way I do
Girl you gotta let me know so I can get over you

What makes us so right
Is it the sound of the laugh
That look in her eyes
When do you decide
She is the dream that you see
That falls in your life

And you apologize no matter who was wrong
Would you get on your knees if that would bring her home

Tell me what makes a man want to give you all his heart
Smile when you're around and cry when you're apart
If you know what makes a man want to love you the way I do
Girl you gotta let me know so I can get over you

Other girls that come along they always knew
But what's the point when all I ever want is you
Tell me

Tell me what makes a man want to give you all his heart
Smile when you're around and cry when you're apart
If you know what makes a man want to love you the way I do
Girl you gotta let me know, let me know, so I can get over you
