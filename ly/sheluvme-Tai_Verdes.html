		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh, I feel like Romeo (why?)
'Cause I know that she love me 'cause she told me so (oh)
I feel like dancin', I feel like do-si-do (woo)
Every night she ride me like a rodeo (wow)

I said (ooh)
Yes, God done blessed me, achoo
'Cause you're so sexy like (woo)
Girl, no one gets me like you

Ayy, it's a good day to be (day to be)
Anybody if your name is me (name is me)
Shout it from the rooftops shamelessly (shamelessly)
I love her and she love me
Ayy, it's a good day to be (day to be)
Alive, no lie, can't play with me (play with me)
If I died, I'd die happily
'Cause I love her and she love me

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da (she love me, she love me)
La-da-da, da-da-da, da (she told me, she told me)
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da (uh, yeah)
I love her and she love me

If you not real, it wouldn't surprise me
When I got you, I might've caught lightnin'
Right in the palm of my hand
Got me "Goddamnin'", no way that's random, ooh
I could never lose you, uh
I would never want to, uh
You the missin' piece, only thing I need, ooh
Got me prayin' to Jesus
We got the telekinesis
I want the neighbors to see us
Fuckin' in so many places
I can't even look in the face of the preachers
You creative with this shit, makin' up new positions
You got magic in them hips, don't let 'em tell you different (ooh)

Yes, God done blessed me, a (choo, God done blessed me)
'Cause you're so sexy like (ooh, you so sexy)
Girl, no one gets me like you (no one gets me like you)

Ayy, it's a good day to be (day to be)
Anybody if your name is me (name is me)
Shout it from the rooftops shamelessly (shamelessly)
I love her and she love me (woohoo)
Ayy, it's a good day to be (day to be, woohoo)
Alive, no lie, can't play with me (play with me, woohoo)
If I died, I'd die happily (happily, woohoo)
'Cause I love her and she love me

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da (she love me, she love me)
La-da-da, da-da-da, da (she told me, she told me)
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da (uh, yeah)
I love her and she love me

Da-da-da, da-da-da, da
La-da-da, da-da-da, da
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da
I love her and she loves me
