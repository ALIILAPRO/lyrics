		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (yeah)
(Listen to this track, bitch)
Ha

Like Tommy Lee and Pamela, I'm fuckin' on a camera
More stamina than animals, Gucci is no amateur
Jeru The Damaja can damage you, I'll handle ya'
Two girls on my bike, one on the back, one on the handle bars
Ferrari F-130 so I call that bitch, "Tarantula"
Got Canada on calendar so shout-out to my manager
I walked through in South Africa, I jumped in 'bout four Acuras
I flip it just like a spatula, so, suck me just like Dracula
(Listen to this track, bitch)
Polo like a college boy, no, I'm not a college boy (no)
I am a So Icy boy, I'm tatted like a biker boy
We are the So Icy Gang, tatted like a biker gang
Dreaded up, breaded up, wet it up, and bet it up
Bitch, you don't wanna bet, pull up in my Chevy 'Vette
Nah, you ain't ready yet, wetter than yo' girl get
Dolce 'Bana, Dolce shades, don't you wanna see the boy 
See the boy, see the boy?
Come and take a Polaroid, Polaroid
Camera flash, camera flash, I see yo' ass
Lookin' with yo' lookin' ass, so come and take a camera flash (ha)
Jewelry game amazin', car game crazy (brr, brr)
Gucci Mane LaFlare walkin' 'round the city, say cheese
(Listen to this track, bitch)

Ridin' with my broad (yeah), it's a photoshoot (brr)
When I hit the mall (mall, mall), it's a photoshoot (ha)
When I'm in the club (what? What?), it's a photoshoot 
Go on and get ya' camera phone on, it's a photo shoot
It's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
When I'm with ya' girl, every time it's a photoshoot (ha, verse two, it's Gucci)
Go on and get ya' camera phone on, it's a photoshoot 
(Listen to this track, bitch)

Photogenic chain, man, photo grabbin' memory
I can fuck yo' thang but I don't fuck hoes in industry (no)
Gucci Mane LaFlare, So Icy, you remember me? (So Icy)
Remember me from TV? Turnin' on yo' TV (ha)
Hip-hop police, say they lookin' after me (no)
How you lookin' after me? You know I had a murder beat
Yeah, I got a murder beef, I'm just tryna get somethin' to eat
Me and my lil' main squeeze, give a nigga a break please
Chain on Frigidaire, watches on the refrigerate
'Frigerate, refrigerate, I'm freezin' like a polar bear (brr)
Red carpet shawty and the paparazzi chasin' me (brr)
How they gon' catch me? I'm ridin' in a Lamborghin' 
(Listen to this track, bitch)

Ridin' with my broad (it's Gucci), it's a photoshoot (it's Gucci)
When I hit the mall, it's a photoshoot 
When I'm in the club, it's a photoshoot 
Go on and get ya' camera phone on, it's a photo shoot
It's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
It's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
When I'm with ya' girl, every time it's a photoshoot 
Go on and get ya' camera phone on, it's a photoshoot 
(Listen to this track, bitch)

Me and Boosie smokin' fruity, it look like a photo shoot
Shout out to my nigga Webbie, my hoes independent too
Me and Shawty Lo in a Duely smokin' purple 'dro
Me and Gotti in a Benz, man, you know we get it in
Me, Black, and Gorilla Zoe in the studio by Club Enzo
And Zone 6, Morning Avenue, Memorial Drive, you know for sure
Shawnna fine and Trina tight, I kill them girls like Killer Mike
Killer Mike, I kill the mic' so shout out to slick, Killer Mike (Killa)
Me and Plies, chinky eyes, back to back in Hummers so it's ten times
Double wide, thirty inches on you, guys
UGK my favorite group, for years been ridin' with them guys
8ball told 'em, "Lay it down", and I did that 'bout thirty times

Ridin' with my broad, it's a photoshoot
When I hit the mall, it's a photoshoot 
When I'm in the club, it's a photoshoot 
Go on and get ya' camera phone on, it's a photo shoot
It's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
It's a photoshoot
Girl, it's a photoshoot
When I'm with ya' girl, every time it's a photoshoot 
Go on and get ya' camera phone on, it's a photoshoot, ha (yeah)
(Listen to this track, bitch)
