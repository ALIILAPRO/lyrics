		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Place the gun to my heart
I don't care 'cause friday I'm in love
We had a plan
Don't make it weird
What I like baby it ain't clear

(So close)
I'm looking for a place to breathe
(So close)
Drain me of my everything
(Don't go)
I wanna, wanna trust you
(Don't go)
(Don't go)

All the cities that we burned down
Turns out I'm very hard to kill
After all the damage we've done
Turns out I'm very hard to kill

Birthday cards at the cornerstone
You grabbed a box of Slim's and said I want more
You're so cool, you hate yourself
Lying on the floor in a strangers house

(So close)
I'm looking for a place to breathe
(So close)
Drain me of my everything
(Don't go)
I wanna, wanna trust you
(Don't go)
(Don't go)

All the cities that we burned down
Turns out I'm very hard to kill
After all the damage we've done
Turns out I'm very hard to kill

So come and catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
Come and catch me if you can
Catch me if you can
Catch me if you can

All the cities that we burned down
Turns out I'm very hard to kill
After all the damage we've done
Turns out I'm very hard to kill
