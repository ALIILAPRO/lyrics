		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Air. Never ever seemed so far away.
And the eye of a hurricane, eyed. And I tried.
Death. Never have I seemed so touchable. 
I'm a dart caught in your cables eye. And I tried.

[Chorus:]
(I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't)
Keep yourself alive
(I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't)
Keep yourself alive
(I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't)
Keep yourself alive. 
(I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't)
For a minute...
(I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't leave, I won't)

So brave, will you wanna hurt your face tonight.
In a hall walking to the bright light, dissect belt.
Chafe me, cause you know it's not the end of us.
I'll be gone until you get it right.
Impossible, impossible, impossible.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

(I won't give, I won't give, I won't give, I won't.) 
Keep yourself alive
(I won't give, I won't give, I won't give, I won't.) 
Keep yourself alive
(I won't give, I won't give, I won't give, I won't.) 
Keep yourself alive. 
(I won't give, I won't give, I won't give, I won't.) 
For a minute...

[Chorus]
