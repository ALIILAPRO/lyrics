		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I said go away
Take a moment, think it over
I said not today
'Cause everybody sucks and I cannot relate
And everything is fucked and I cannot be saved

Maybe that's because I'm on the way
Took everything I had and threw it in the flames
Watch it burn while they're steady taking aim
I guess it came with repercussions
I've been in it for a minute, this is not up for discussion

Tell me that you hate me and I'll tell you that I fuckin' love it
Tell me you'll save me and I'll tell you that you're savin' nothin'
Tell me 'bout your demons and I'll tell you that I've got a dozen
I'll take 'em with me on my path to self destruction

We go twenty-four seven till we're six feet deep
Head in the clouds but our heart's concrete
Burn the whole thing down while they got cold feet
Yeah, they can try to copy but they can't compete

If you don't know the devil then you don't know me
Yeah, you don't know the devil then you don't know me

All the preconceived premonitions
From people who never listen
Creating all the division
Yeah, how can you live with yourself?
I'm the definition of coming to a collision
The old and the new edition
The hero becomes a villain

So tell me that you hate me and I'll tell you that I fuckin' love it
Tell me you'll save me and I'll tell you that you're savin' nothin'
Smile at the thought of my demise on the day of judgment
I pay the price on my path to self destruction

We go twenty-four seven till we're six feet deep
Head in the clouds but our heart's concrete
Burn the whole thing down while they got cold feet
Yeah, they can try to copy but they can't compete

If you don't know the devil then you don't know me
You don't know the devil then you don't know me
Now let me just tell you a little bit about the devil first

Yeah, I am the one
Alpha, omega, I won't be outdone
My power's limitless
You are like Icarus, you have been flying too close to the sun
I'm on the way like a destination
I clear your brain like a meditation
I'll change your mind like a revelation
So get out the way, get out the way
I see what's mine and I'm gonna take it
I do what I say, call it dedication
I built an army into a nation
Now karma is coming, you can't escape it

We go twenty-four seven till we're six feet deep
If you don't know the devil then you don't know me
