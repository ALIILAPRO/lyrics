		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watching in silence I hesitate
It was not in the plans
All of our lives we could only wait
It was out of our hands

And every war where we took the day
It was all in our heads
And though in the dark we dream at night
They were better unsaid

But this is the time
And this is the place
And these are the signs
That we must embrace

The moment is now
In all history
The time has arrived
And this is the one place to be, yeah, yeah

We placed our years in the hourglass
They were never unearned
And we seemed destined to watch them pass
It was never our turn

But this is the time
And this is the place
And these are the signs
That we must erase

The moment is now
In all history
The time has arrived
And this is the one place to be, yeah, yeah

This is the time
And this is the place
And these are the signs
That we must erase

The moment is now
In all history
The time has arrived
And this is the one place to be, yeah, yeah
