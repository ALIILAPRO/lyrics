		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You better treat me right
I'm a one in a million
Make that a zillion
Cos I'll make a boy cry
Doesn't matter if I stay or go
You'll be wanting more
I can get You real high
With sugar on my lips
All it takes is one hit
I'll leave You hypnotised
But don't worry I'll make sure You don't forget it

Brrr ra ba ba
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
Brrr ra ba ba
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
I'll make You scream and I'll make you want it
You can be my ride or die
Baby You'll never find a love like mine

You know I'm solid gold
Worship me at the altar
What You got to offer?
You better do what you're told
I ain't gonna say it twice
And I'm done with playing nice yeah
I'll let you take control
Put your hands on my hips
And We'll go baby go
So magical you won't ever want to think about tomorrow

Brrr ra ba ba
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
Brrr ra ba ba
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
I'll make You scream and I'll make you want it
You can be my ride or die
Baby You'll never find a love like mine

You got 24 hours in a day
I'm so good that I'll make you wanna stay up
I know you heard what they said
I might break Your heart
But it's a risk that you should take up
You got 24 hours in a day
I'm so good that I'll make you wanna stay up
I know you heard what they said
I might break Your heart
But it's a risk that you should take up

Brrr ra ba ba
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
Brrr ra ba ba
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
I'll make You scream and I'll make you want it
You can be my ride or die
Baby You'll never find a love like mine
