		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She doesn’t feel like she owes me, 
She doesn’t feel you don’t own me 
She just watches the TV
And slowly it starts to bore me

It’s all he ever wanted,
To feel like she’s wanted
And it’s all
She’s ever needed like she’s feel likes she’s needed

The girl with the fuck me eyes 
The girl who has to lie
The feelings and they want to die 
When it’s all over we cry

It’s all she ever wanted,
To feel like she’s wanted
And it’s all
She’s ever needed like she’s feel likes she’s leaving.

It’s all they ever wanted,
To feel like they wanted
And it’s all
She’s ever needed like she’s feel likes she’s leaving.
