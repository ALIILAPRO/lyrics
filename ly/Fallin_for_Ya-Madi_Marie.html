		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go through things 
I can’t explain. 

Look in my eyes
You see the pain.

All the lies 
Just all in my face.

I can’t sleep
I stay up to late. 


Lately I’ve been in a mood.
Cutting everybody, I don’t know what to do.
I still have dream about me and you.
Alone on a lonely night. 

I know that you cry.
You don’t have hide.
You don’t have to lie
I see the truth through your eyes.

You say you don’t love me 
We both know that’s a lie. 

Yeah

Am doing my own ting so please 
Do not disturb 

I’ve been on the roads like Lil, Lil Durk, 
Like Ri I’ve been busy putting work work work

Prim come through let me see that ass twerk twerk twerk
For a nigga.

Godamn. 
You freakier with me then your own man
Leave your boyfriend baby that’s God’s plan 
Ask T he my right man. 

I see you glowing.
Cause I take good care of you
You a demon when we alone
 In the bedroom
50 shades of grey
 When we alone in the dark  room

Damn you a bad one 
I’d put you in detention

 But we’d just end up fuckin in the classroom 

Switch 

Don’t want no sweet talk
She wonders why 
I don’t trust nobody 
Not ever her
