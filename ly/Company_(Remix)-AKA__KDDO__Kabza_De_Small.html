		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yeah
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
It's the multi-talented 
Just trust in me
(Kiddo on the beat, better run it back) again

Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece (let's go)
This world not enough for me
Kiss me on the cheek, say, "Mwah" for me (mwah)
Oh, close company (go)
Energy, feel no punch from me (go, yeah)
This luxury (woo)
R.i.p DJ Sumbody (sheesh)

Oh
The mommies wanna eat you
T-shirt, Off-White logo (you know)
Abu Dhabi, photo (mmh, yeah, yeah)
Sweets on my neck (oh yeah)
Diamonds say, "Gqim shelele"
I sleep when I'm dead (let's go)
(Aii, yeah)

Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece

One girl not enough for me
Two girls not enough for me
Three girls not enough for me
Not enough for me, not enough for me
Four girls not enough for me
Five girls not enough for me
Six girls not enough for me
Not enough for me, nah, nah (yeah)

I pull up in a Tonka truck
You either get bossed around or boss up
What's in the briefcase? The rands or dollars?
Don't be a cheap date, let's pop the bottles
Lames in a sec and I blame internet
Let's do the money dance, one thou' for a fade
Keep her in the fam and cop MaXhosa
The pillows in the M is selfless-moisture

Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece

Nivea defence to block the solar
Pass the Maryjane, this world my oyster, yeah
Los Angeles, give me more, more ambiance
BBC 1, smokin'
It's international motion
Let me do my dance
Eh-eh, let me cop my Benz
I'm thinkin' of a masterplan
Reprogramme, prrt, reset
Stay focused, revenge
Until then, foot on neck

Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece (let's go)
This world not enough for me
Kiss me on the cheek, say, "Mwah" for me (mwah)
Oh, close company (go)
Energy, feel no punch from me
This luxury (woo)
R.i.p DJ Sumbody (sheesh)

Oh
The mommies wanna eat you
T-shirt, Off-White logo (you know)
Abu Dhabi, photo (mmh, yeah, yeah)
Sweets on my neck (oh yeah)
Diamonds say, "Gqim shelele"
I sleep when I'm dead (let's go)
(Aii, yeah)

One girl not enough for me
Two girls not enough for me
Three girls not enough for me
Not enough for me, not enough for me

Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
Just trust in me
I'll build you a masterpiece
