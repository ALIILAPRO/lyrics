		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my love and devotion (all my-)
All my love and devotion

Oh-oh, since I've been meditatin'
From a distance, I've been movin' slow (slow)
You my one weakness
When around, you lose my self-control
Can we revisit this when night gets over? (It's over)
Feelin's I thought that I was over
Not me bein' wasted and open

It's not my decision, I fight
Submission, I try to act like I'm heartless
We both know that's nonsense
I'm convinced that it's right
A mission to find the light in your darkness
We both lost sense to causes
That won't stop me from givin' you

All my love and devotion (all my-)
All my love and devotion

If we do this one more time
Promise to me that it's gon' be one more time
'Cause my heart can't take this for real
I can't be jaded for real, we can't keep breakin' this deal (no, no)
After all this time, you still just as fine to me (oh, oh-oh-oh)

It's not my decision, I fight
Submission, I try to act like I'm heartless
We both know that's nonsense
I'm convinced that it's right
A mission to find the light in your darkness
We both lost sense to causes
'Cause that won't stop me from givin' you

All my love and devotion (all my-)
All my love and devotion
