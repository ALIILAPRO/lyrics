		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've told myself so many times before
But this time I think I mean it for sure
We have reached a full stop
Nothing's going to save us from the big drop

Reached our natural conclusion
Outlived the illusion
I hate being in these situations
That call for diplomatic relations
If I only knew the answer
Or I thought we had a chance
Or I could stop this
I would stop this thing
From spreading like a cancer

What can I say?
I don't want to play anymore
What can I say?
I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence

Leave in silence
Leave in silence

We've been running around in circles all year
Doing this and that and getting nowhere
This will be the last time
I think I said that last time

If I only had a potion
Some magical lotion
That could stop this, I would stop this
I would set the wheels in motion

What can I say?
I don't want to play anymore
What can I say?
I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence

Leave in silence
Leave in silence

Leave in silence
Leave in silence

Leave in silence
Leave in silence

Leave in silence
Leave in silence
