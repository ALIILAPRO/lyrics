		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There ain't no reason for us falling in love
I say (i say), you want (you want), you need (you need)
I couldnt give

Every time i mess up I aint man enough
all those memories i thought turned to dust
you said the only thing you want is me
Turned 'round and say we weren't supposed to be 

fucking you for hours, it wasn't love
plenty money showers, it's not enough
every time i try, you mess it up
this isn't love, this isn't love

either we sink or we gon' straight up drown
wanted to save your life. i was your lifeline
this aint the first time. We done this shit all before

Every time i mess up I aint man enough
all those memories i thought turned to dust
you said the only thing you want is me
Turned 'round and say we weren't supposed to be 

fucking you for hours, it wasn't love
plenty money showers, it's not enough
every time i try, you mess it up
this isn't love, this isn't love
fucking you for hours, it wasn't love
plenty money showers, it's not enough
every time i try, you mess it up
this isn't love, this isn't love

fucking you for hours, it wasn't love
plenty money showers, it's not enough
every time i try, you mess it up
this isn't love, this isn't love
fucking you for hours, it wasn't love
plenty money showers, it's not enough
every time i try, you mess it up
this isn't love, this isn't love
