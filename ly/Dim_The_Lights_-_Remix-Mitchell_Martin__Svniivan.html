		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh when I first met you I did not think it would ever lead to this
No I did not think I’d have ever got the chance to witness this
No but here we are and you just closed the door to your room
And now we’re alone
Black boots, tight jeans, blonde hair, red lips, those looks could kill
I can’t stop myself from staring standing so still
The way you look at me with that smile and those eyes
And next thing I know you start to dim the lights
Oh I don’t think you know how good you look right now caught me off guard
Oh as you walk towards me I can feel my heart it beats so hard
Oh you start to get so close now I can smell your perfume
And now we’re alone
Black boots, tight jeans, blonde hair, red lips, those looks could kill
I can’t stop myself from staring standing so still
The way you look at me with that smile and those eyes
And next thing I know you start to dim the lights
Black boots, tight jeans, blonde hair, red lips, those looks could kill
I can’t stop myself from staring standing so still
The way you look at me with that smile and those eyes
And next thing I know you start to dim the lights
Black boots, tight jeans, blonde hair, red lips, those looks could kill
I can’t stop myself from staring standing so still
The way you look at me with that smile and those eyes
Next thing I know you start to dim the lights
Next thing I know you start to dim the lights
Next thing I know you start to dim the lights
