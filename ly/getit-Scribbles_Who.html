		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm too hot to touch
Too cold to love
I'm on a roll, lover
'Cause it's not enough
I'm counting up
I need control of it
Sweet brown sugar in a white world
I ain't even trying to be a nice girl
It ain't really love get ya money up
Talking about a dream
I'm living huh
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I got it, I flaunt it
All mine
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I want it, I need it
All mine
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I got it, I flaunt it
All mine
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I want it, I need it
All mine
And it's making me wild
It's making me wild inside
I want it
I get it then
I get it to flip it
Just to, want it and get it
Oh this life that I'm living
I'm too black to fold
Too sure too hold
I'm on fire baby
Never seen before
I'm one not more so
I'm not wasting my time
Sweet brown sugar in a white world
I ain't even trying to be a nice girl
It ain't really love get ya money up
Talking about a dream
I'm living huh
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I got it, I flaunt it
All mine
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I want it, I need it
All mine
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I got it, I flaunt it
All mine
I want it, I get it
Oh I
I want it, I need it
All mine
And it's making me wild
It's making me wild inside
I want it
I get it then
I get it to flip it
Just to, want it and get it
Oh this life that I'm living
