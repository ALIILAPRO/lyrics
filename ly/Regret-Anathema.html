		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As I drift away
Far away from you
I feel all alone in a crowded room
Thinking to myself
"There's no escape from this
Fear
Regret
Loneliness"

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

I wish I didn't know now that
I never knew then
Flashback
Memories punish me again
Sometimes I remember all the pain that I have seen
Sometimes I wonder what might have been

Visions of love and hate
A collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter
Echoes of silent cries

And sometimes I despair
At who I've become
I have to come to terms
With what I've done

The bittersweet taste of fate
We can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer
A strength I never lost
I know there is a way
My future is not set
For the tide has turned
But still I never learned to live without regret
