		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Think it´s time to put an end to it
Try to clean my head again
Start to resuscitate my engine
Try to walk back where I ran

Keep control
Of me
Try to keep the frequency [Repeat: x 2]

I break up all the things behind me
Goin´ on the other way
Try to find myself again slowly
To move on the other day

All the nights I get my eyes open
All the days I try to sleep
Wish away the troubles around me
Did not see I fell too deep

Keep control
Of me
Try to keep the frequency [Repeat: x 2]

Something new has moved into my life
An essential missing part
Takes control of my as addiction
And [unknown] makes my heart

Keep control
Of me
Try to keep the frequency [Repeat: x 2]
Keep control
