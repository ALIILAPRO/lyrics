		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cyanide near the fire side
She cut me open inside of my mind
Red lips, I know she's sort of mine
But I know I'm sort of blind

She whispered to me that she can't decide
How to tell the lie she tried to hide
Blood stains until she's satisfied
But I know I'm fucked inside

Cyanide near the fire side
She cut me open inside of my mind
Red lips, I know she's sort of mine
But I know I'm sort of blind

I see the ashes driftin through time
While I'm sifting thru the chances I'll make it alive
I feel a shiver drippin down my spine
I know the Devil isn't far behind

She whispered to me that she can't decide
How to tell the lie she tried to hide
Blood stains until she's satisfied
But I know I'm fucked inside
