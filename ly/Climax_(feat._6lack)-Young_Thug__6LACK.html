		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You said no interest (tsh-tsh-ah)
Said you found a better climax (tsh-tsh-ah)
You said he's swagged out (tsh-tsh-ah), you leave (tsh-tsh-tsh)
It's like a shot to the back of the lungs with the Devil weed (tsh-tsh-ah)
Don't wanna go, but leave, like it's nothing (tsh-tsh-ah)

You said no interest, said you found a better climax
You said he's swagged out, you leave
It's like a shot to the back of the lungs with the Devil weed
Don't wanna go, but leave, like it's nothing (we got London On Da Track)

I just be watching my words (words)
You say whatever the fuck (fuck)
I think I take what I get (get)
And say whatever to love (love)
This might hurt for days
Now I can't find my way (ay)
Sike, know I'm just playin'
Onto the next like I'm okay
Aye, this is pimping can't you tell? (Tell)
She like, "No I can't what the hell?"(hell)
Well then pull up baby, in a spell
Came out new hair, new nails
She take my heart then drive back
One, two, three, four, five, damn (yeah)
Deletin' pictures on the gram
You forgot who I am
From the front seats to the nosebleeds
That's for actin' like you don't know me
Damn, my new bitch, she a trophy
And she love me for the old me
Yeah, the cold me, yeah, the old me (old me, yeah)
She the homie, cop her a Rollie (Rollie, yeah, yeah)

You said no interest (tsh-tsh-ah)
Said you found a better climax (tsh-tsh-ah)
You said he's swagged out (tsh-tsh-ah), you leave (tsh-tsh-tsh)
It's like a shot to the back of the lungs with the Devil weed (tsh-tsh-ah)
Don't wanna go, but leave, like it's nothing (tsh-tsh-ah)

Hu-uh, hu-uh, she r-i-i-ide
She wanna ride, ooh-oh-oh
My shawty better than that
Can't complain about nothin' (can't complain about nothin'!)
How the fuck am I ever gon' go turn myself in?
Got it stacked up on the Seroquel
Bitch it's Bentley can't you tell? (Yeah)
This is pimping, can't you tell? (Yeah)
This shit look fishy, I don't wanna see
Emergency, I'm tryna go to sleep
Money cut down a load of trees
Sauvage Dior, this ain't no creep
My dog got a deal, he back on the street
This bitch is so real, she as bad as can be
I had bitches around they was backstabbing me
I went straight to them racks like a Hemi in me
Good energy, I invest in my queen
I can ride on this hoe like a new 12 speed
My bitch, bad, tragedy
Bitch, bad, tragedy

You said no interest (tsh-tsh-ah)
Said you found a better climax (tsh-tsh-ah)
You said he's swagged out (tsh-tsh-ah), you leave (tsh-tsh-tsh)
It's like a shot to the back of the lungs with the Devil weed (tsh-tsh-ah)
Don't wanna go, but leave, like it's nothing (tsh-tsh-ah)

You said no interest (tsh-tsh-ah)
Said you found a better climax (tsh-tsh-ah)
You said he's swagged out (tsh-tsh-ah), you leave (tsh-tsh-tsh)
It's like a shot to the back of the lungs with the Devil weed (tsh-tsh-ah)
Don't wanna go, but leave, like it's nothing (tsh-tsh-ah)

I'm in London got my beat from London
