		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And the crowd is spinning in a lush dance 
From secrets and rumors 
From misery and tumors
Pure hearted 
With tumors
Only stone cold stone
Stone cold hearts

And I hear that 
In the sound of your voice that is way
And I hear that
In the sound of your voice that
And I hear that 
In the sound of your voice that is way
And I hear that
In the sound of your voice that is way

You look dirty donâ€™t say all those words
From secrets and rumors 
From misery and tumors 
Pure hearted with tumors 
Only stone cold stone 
Stone cold hearts 

And I hear that 
In the sound of your voice that is way
And I hear that
In the sound of your voice that is way
And I hear that 
In the sound of your voice that is way
And I hear that
In the sound of your voice that is way more to tell me

And I hear that
And I hear that
And I hear that
And I hear that
In the sound of your voice that is way
