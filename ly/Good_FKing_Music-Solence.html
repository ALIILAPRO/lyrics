		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all the trouble and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright

You’ve had a rough week
A rough month
It seems like nothing goes your way nah

You want some music
A good song
That makes you forget all the trouble
Just put your headphones on
Come on, singalong

All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all your problems and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright

All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all your problems and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright

You’ve had some heartache
Some bad thoughts
Everything seems problematic

You want a break when
It all stops
A minute when you can forget it

We got the medicine you looking for
We got the medicine to help your soul
Just put your headphones on and come on and sing along

All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all the trouble and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright

All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all the trouble and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright

Alright alright alright x6

All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all the trouble and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright

All you need is just some good fucking music that you headband to
To forget all the trouble and what’s bothering you
So come on raise the volume it will soon feel good
Alright alright alright
