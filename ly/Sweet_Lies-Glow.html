		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna disappear
Runaway to him
Nobody can be saving us
From all the thoughts, we must

Get away from here
You can’t keep me near
I gotta feel his love right now
I’ve never been this down

Oh, I need your body on me,
I, I’m feeling so lonely
I gotta feel his love right now
I’ve never been this down

Oh, I need your body on me,
I, I’m feeling so lonely
I gotta feel his love right now
I’ve never been this down

Promise
I will stay forever
Forever in your sweet lies
Whenever you seem to need
Fallin
To pieces forever
Forever in your sweet lies
Whenever you need me here

Take away my pain
Fight it all the way
I couldn’t see the truth behind the feelings we must hide
Love’s been caught in space
Tears that run in waves
I wanna freeze the time right now, I’ve never been this down

Oh, I need your body on me,
I, I’m feeling so lonely
I gotta feel his love right now
I’ve never been this down

Oh, I need your body on me,
I, I’m feeling so lonely
I gotta feel his love right now
I’ve never been this down

Promise
I will stay forever
Forever in your sweet lies
Whenever you seem to need
Fallin
To pieces forever
Forever in your sweet lies
Whenever you need me here
