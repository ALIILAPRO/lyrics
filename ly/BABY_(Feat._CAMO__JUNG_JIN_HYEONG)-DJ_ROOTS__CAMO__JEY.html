		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Call me baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Runnin' around jet
Choke that neck
Fuck your ex
Sign those checks
Screamin' out max
Spreadin' those legs
Dice a hex
Gimme some, gimme some

Call me baby, yeah
Like that time when you did before
Like that time when I felt alone
Yeah, call me baby, yeah
Hop out of that island
I want you back now
I know I'm better than her
She gone mad now

Call me baby
Yeah, shit's so brazy, I know, I know
But call me baby like before
This shit's so brazy, I know, I know

Yeah, she gone mad now
She be on shopping spree
She know that cashy a bee
Just tryna get that honey
She mixin' that juice with Henny, yeah
She crazy, I know why she brazy
I'm still on your feed ain't lately
Still callin' me when you boozy, yeah-yeah

Just call me baby like you did last time
Leave that scenery making you cry
Say it to her now, goodbye
It's gonna worth every single fight
You don't have to do it, but at least just try
I know you still want to hop on this tide
I know you want to come again on this ride
It ain't just me, no

Runnin' around jet
Choke that neck
Fuck your ex
Sign those checks
Screamin' out max
Spreadin' those legs
Dice a hex
Gimme some, gimme some

Call me baby, yeah
Like that time when you did before
Like that time when I felt alone
Yeah, call me baby, yeah
Hop out of that island
I want you back now
I know I'm better than her
She gone mad now

Call me baby, like before
Shit's so brazy, I know, I know
Call me baby, like before
Yeah shit's so brazy, I know, I know

I'll call you baby
지금 부터 baby call me daddy
On my way to you, where are you baby?
알잖아 내 style, don't make me say it twice
가끔은 참지 못해 난 baby
Baby, don't test
Baby, don't ask, just spread your legs
기나긴 race 지나친 pace
Can't take it no more, nah

Runnin' around jet
Choke that neck
Fuck your ex
Sign those checks
Screamin' out max
Spreadin' those legs
Dice a hex
Gimme some, gimme some

Call me baby, yeah
Like that time when you did before
Like that time when I felt alone
Yeah, call me baby, yeah
Hop out of that island
I want you back now
I know I'm better than her
She gone mad now

Call me baby, like before
Shit's so brazy, I know, I know
Call me baby, like before
Yeah, shit's so brazy, I know, I know, oh
