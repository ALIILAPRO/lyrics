		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stepped in the party like my name was "that bitch"
All these haters mad because I'm so established
They know I'm a beast, yeah I'm a fucking savage
Haters you can kill yourself, uh
In my space shuttle and I'm not coming down
I'm a stereo and she's just so monotone
Sometimes it's just me and all my bottles all alone
I ain't coming back this time

I can't believe it, it's so amazing
This club is heating, this party's blazing
I can't believe it, this beat is banging
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

(Hey) Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
(Yeah yeah, I'm feeling it now)
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out

Step up in the party like my name was Mr. T
All these hating naggers ain't got natin' on me
Honestly, I gotta stay as fly as I can be
If you Wiki Willy then you get super O.G.
Honeys always rush me 'cause I'm fly, fly, fly
Dummies they can't touch me 'cause I'm floating sky high
I stay swagger-ific you don't need to ask why
You just gotta see with your eyes

I can't believe it, it's so amazing
This club is heating, this party's blazing
I can't believe it, this beat is banging
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

(Hey) Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
(Yeah yeah, I'm feeling it now-ow)
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check this mother-fucker out
It got me in the club, in the club
Just rocking like this, oh, oh

The DunDun
The sun done
Yep, the sun done
Came up, but we still up in dungeon
The DunDun
Yep, in London
Competition, why yes I would love some
How the fuck they get mad 'cause they run done?
Mad 'cause I'm getting money in abundance
Man I can't even count all of these hundreds
Duffle bag every time I go to SunTrust
I leave the rest just to collect interest
I mean interest
Fuck my nemesis
Exclamation just for emphasis
And I don't sympathize, 'cause you a simple bitch
I just pop up on these hoes on some pimple shit
And put the iron to your face you old wrinkled bitch

Oh, we just had to kill it
We on the radio hotter than a skillet
We in the club making party people holla
Money in the bank we be getting top dollar
I'm a big baller,
You a little smaller
Step up to my level
Need to grow a little taller
I'm shot caller
Get up off my collar
You a Chihuahua
I'm a Rottweila'

I can't believe it, it's so amazing
I can't believe it, this beat is banging
I can't believe it, it's so amazing
I can't believe it, I can't believe it

(Hey) Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
(Yeah, yeah, I'm feeling it now)
Check it out
Check it out
Check it out
