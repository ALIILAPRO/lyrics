		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't nothin' wrong with it

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L.O.V.E and affection

Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want
Baby, come hold me tight and when I'm drowning save me
Give it to me on a daily

If I'm your girl, say my name, boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
I I I, won't play around
I I I, I wanna lay you down
I I I, I need you now, I need you now
Ooh, ooh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L.O.V.E and affection

Boy lately, you been stingy with your time
Got me wondering, I'm wondering if I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
You say I'm the one you want so come express it

Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push upon it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this? (Ah)
Don't put it down (ah)
Don't fuck around (ah)
I want you now, I want you now, ooh

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L.O.V.E and affection

Can you love me for poor? (You already know)
I'm searching for my soul (rockstar)
Whoever turned you cold (peep this)
You need to let him know (yeah yeah)
I can work miracles (what's up?)
I work it physical (physical, turn up)
And when I love you close (ayy)
You can feel my heart beating through my clothes, ooh

Future

I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection, no
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Love, love, love, love and affection
Love, love, L.O.V.E and affection
