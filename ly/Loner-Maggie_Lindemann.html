		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say avoidance never heals but this sure feels good
Gonna stay here a couple more minutes than I should
Gonna take a couple shots and numb my feelings
'Stead of dealin' with my problems, I'll just stare at the ceiling
Avoidance never heals but this sure feels good

I know I said I'd stop before I drown
But I don't like the thought of coming down

Yeah, I'm a loner
And I like it that way
I like a dark room
With nobody but pain
And I don't need permission to feel sad
And don't need no witness to have my back
'Cause I'm a loner
And I like it that way
And I like it that way

I'm always by myself 'cause that's what feels right
And when I'm in a crowded room, I try to stay out of sight
Always show up to the party hours early
'Cause I'm bored of everything by 7:30
I'm always by myself 'cause that's what feels right

I know I said I'd stop before I drown
Just took a couple pills, now I'm on the ground

Yeah, I'm a loner
And I like it that way
I like a dark room
With nobody but pain
And I don't need permission to feel sad
And don't need no witness to have my back
'Cause I'm a loner
And I like it that way
I like it that way

Yeah, I'm a loner
Yeah, yeah

Yeah, I'm a loner
And I like it that way (that way)
I like a dark room
With nobody but pain
And I don't need permission to feel sad
And don't need no witness to have my back
'Cause I'm a loner
And I like it that way
I like it that way
