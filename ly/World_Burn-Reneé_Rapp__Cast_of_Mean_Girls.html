		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My name is Regina George
And I am a massive deal
I will grind you to sand
Beneath my Louboutin heel
This is what I get for helping
Helping someone lame fit in
Cady Heron, enjoy your temporary win, mmm

My name is Regina George
This girl is a fugly cow
Hey Cady, how you like me now?

I wanna watch the world burn
I brought the gasoline
I wanna watch the world burn
And everyone get mean
I wanna watch the world burn
I got the gasoline
I wanna watch the world burn
And everyone get mean

Cady, time to watch your back
Cady, time to turn and cough
Because you took me down
But you didn't finish me off
My name is Regina George
And in case you're keeping score
Cady may have won the battle
But I will win the war

I wanna watch the world burn
(Trang Pham is a grotsky biotch)
I got the gasoline
(Ms. Norbury's a drug pusher)
Mm, I wanna make the world burn
(Janis is a pyro les)
Regina is a fugly cow
Regina is a fugly cow
You wrote this 
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa

I wanna watch the world burn
I brought the gasoline
I wanna watch the world burn
And everyone turn mean
Mean
Mean

I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna make the world turn
So mean
I wanna watch the world burn
