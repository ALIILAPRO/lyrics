		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me
Playin' pretend that I'm available emotionally
I'm off a Benz, goin' 'round bends could be the death of me
I'm not ready, I'm not ready

Maybe I'm the best mistake you ever made
It sounds so fuckin' beautiful when you say my name
I'm praying to a God, a God I don't believe
The more I hide my scars, the easier I bleed

But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse

Could you love me at my worst?
Could you love me even though that, that it hurts?
Could you love me? Could you love me?
Could you love me at my worst?

Yeah
Don't try to call, do not disturb, I do not want to speak
This is the end, demons are friends, angels are enemies
I'm just a fool, stuck in the past, your worst memories
I'm not ready for you to forget me

I know that I'm the best mistake you ever made
It sounds so fuckin' beautiful when you say my name
I'm prayin' to a God, a God I don't believe
I showed you all my scars that I let nobody see

But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse

Could you love me at my worst?
Could you love me even though that, that it hurts?
Could you love me? Could you love me?
Could you love me at my worst?

This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me
This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me

But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse

Could you love me at my worst?
Could you love me even though that, that it hurts?
Could you love me? Could you love me?
Could you love me at my worst?

But maybe I'm the worst, the worst you ever had
Tell you you're beautiful, then stab you in the back
You're prayin' I'm the one, but maybe I'm a curse
The more you try to fix me, the more you make it worse
Could you love me at my worst?

This is the end, this is the end, this is the end of me
