		  The Cult of Dionysus

Yesterday I heard you say
Your lust for life has gone away.
It got me thinking, I think I feel a similar way,
And thatâ€™s sad (thatâ€™s sad).

So letâ€™s make a decision, start a new religion.
Yeah, weâ€™re gonna build a temple to our love.
Orgiastic dances, nymphs in trances,
Yeah, weâ€™ll be the envy of the Gods above.

Iâ€™m feeling devious,
Youâ€™re looking glamorous.
Letâ€™s get mischievous,
And polyamorous.
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus.

We could take a Holiday in the month of May
Run free and play in fields of flowers
Pass the hours making love is how weâ€™ll pray.

Or start a secret society for the wild and free,
Our ideology is â€œYou can do what you want,
Too much is never enoughâ€. 
We are the Life, we are the light, 
we are the envy of the Gods above.

Iâ€™m feeling devious,
Youâ€™re looking glamorous.
Letâ€™s get mischievous,
And polyamorous.
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus.

Run, run, run away.
Just take my hand and weâ€™ll abandon this world.
Weâ€™ll wash those tears away,
Youâ€™re young and beautiful, and Iâ€™ll love you always.
We got no time for pain,
when itâ€™s just you and me in ecstasy.

What is with the world today,
The wicked games that people play.
The wars the greed they waste away
Itâ€™s sad (itâ€™s sad).

So letâ€™s spread the word across the land,
Yeah one by one, baby hand in hand.
We got a message of hope
 we got mission of love.
Soon everybody, everywhere will be
The envy of the gods above.

Iâ€™m feeling devious,
Youâ€™re looking glamorous.
Letâ€™s get mischievous,
And polyamorous.
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus.
