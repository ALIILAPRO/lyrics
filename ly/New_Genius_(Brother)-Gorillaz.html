		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dream on my world
I live on my world
Going off my head down to
Somewhere
Goin' on the best of tune
And pressure today
I blew a bad man away today
Had to go
Had to be told
I blew the man away

Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet

Yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep

Dream on the street
People passing through me
Yes they do
Well my friend
Oh my heart bends
Gonna bring it all back

(She walked out tomorrow) brother, sister too
(Like a corner, yeah) do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet

Yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep 
That the river ain't deep 

(She walked out tomorrow) brother, sister too
(Like a corner, yeah) do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet
Yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep 

Do what you ought to do
Ooh my baby they say
The river ain't deep
But it's in the dark

The river ain't deep

Ah, the river ain't deep
Ah, the river ain't deep
