		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love the season, walking through the snow
Everybody is turning off our phones
Open up, shut the world out
Staying up, slow the town down
Pouring drinks, setting up the tree
Everybody lighting up the street
Bring our friend down to my house
Sharing love is what is all about

Life gets so crazy sometimes
We start to lose sight
Of what really matters

Just you and me, locked in like family
Nothing else matters when we go home
Glistening in our own snow globe
Just you and me, nowhere I rather be
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe like
La-la-la-la-la
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe, yeah

All our problems, watch them fade away
Press pause for the holiday
Turn it up, spinning records
Cozied up in our sweaters
Haven't seen you in a long time
But being with you always feels right
Holding on to the moments
Until we go, yeah I know is

Just you and me, locked in like family
Nothing else matters when we go home
Glistening in our own snow globe
Just you and me, nowhere I rather be
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe like
La-la-la-la-la
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe like
La-la-la-la-la
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe, yeah

Life gets so crazy sometimes
We start to lose sight
Of what really matters
Just you and me, locked in like family
Nothing else matters when we go home
Glistening in our own snow globe

Just you and me, nowhere I rather be
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe like
La-la-la-la-la
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe like
La-la-la-la-la
And staying in while the fire glows
Glistening in our own snow globe, yeah
