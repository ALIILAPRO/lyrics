		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't be afraid to feel this way
Gonna make you understand
It's not about you, 'cause I am the fool
Building castles in the sand

If I am crazy, just don't care
It doesn't mean I don't want you near
This is the story 'bout me and you
And it's called

Faith
Right beside you is where I'll stay
Oh, Faith
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith

So many times and so many ways
I didn't know just where to go
You gave me a sign and opened my eyes
That's the reason why I know

That you are different, you're still here
I guess you figured me out right then
Now I believe that we can make it through
And that's called

Faith
Right beside you is where I'll stay
Oh, Faith
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith 
Have faith

So don't be afraid, to feel this way
Just hear me out
Stay

And that's called

Faith
Right beside you is where I'll stay
It's not too late
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith (have faith) 
In me

(Right beside you is where I'll stay)
Oh, yeah
(Count on me)
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith
