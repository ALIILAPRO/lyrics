		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm writing this so I can take you off my mind
I've helped you time after time
but you still take advantage and think it's alright

This doesn't get any easier to stomach
You step on your friends who wish you were dead
You could be getting better, but you leech instead

Selfish, I can't stand to see you suffer
when it's not even worth it
Some people just aren't worth your time
(and most times, they never will be)

So why waste your breath on dead weight
that holds you down and keeps you on the ground?
Don't let your self-doubt ruin you
it's gonna be up to you to see it through

We could break the earth and then rebuild it for ourselves
We could make our own lives, say goodbye to this blank hell
(We won't listen to anyone else), just you and me, as proud as I could ever be

I'd go through hell to never hear your name
I hope you never find a way to get in the way again
Just turn and leave, just turn and leave and then forget me

I thought the burden was mine
to help you out of this hole
you've been sucking yourself inside your whole life
Is all this worth just a little peace of mind?
Looks like you're running out of time
You'll never take what's mine

Always over-stepping the line, you'll never take what's mine
I'm sick of starving just to feel alive

That's the way it feels on the outside
often making sacrifices so other people feel fine
Then we look at our own lives
we gave 'em all our time and yet we struggle to thrive
Nothing left but to sacrifice
I'll find the light, and make things right

It's time to let out the potential you hide
We could break the earth and then rebuild it for ourselves
We could make our own lives, say goodbye to this blank hell

We won't listen to anyone else
Just you and me, as proud as I could ever be
I'd go through hell to never hear your name
I hope you never find a way to get in the way again
Just turn and leave, just turn and leave and then forget me
Cause now I know I just can't be alone
But I'm the first one to get in my own way
After all this time you still decide to walk away
Turn on me and leave my heart and soul so incomplete
I'm just a failure scraping truth from your lies
You left my soul suffering
No more secrets, a family left in pieces, gone!

I'd go through hell to never hear your name
I hope you never find a way to get in the way again
Just turn and leave, just turn and leave and then forget me.
