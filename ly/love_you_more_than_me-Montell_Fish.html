		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl, I love you more than myself
You should know I'd give up anything for you
And girl, I love you more than myself
You should know I'd give up anything for you
And gir-

You're messin' around i know the sound
I've been there before
Somehow I still adore you
And even though you cheat on me
Still I love you more than me
You're messin' around, around
But still I'm around for you

Girl, I love you more than myself
You should know I'd give up anything for you
And girl, I love you more than myself
You should know I'd give up anything for you
And gir-

Anything i'd give it all
Hang on your cross
Just to share my love for you
