		  [Jesse to self] All my life 
Lost in a dream 
Through my eyes 
A world no one sees 

All my life 
No place for me 
Through me eyes 
A child no one needs 

I can't take it no more 
Can't take it no more 
What spirits come from my soul 

Can't wait any more 
Can't hate any more 
Last steps to freedom I go 

Can't take it no more 
Forsaken for sure 
My wishing well's 
For washing the lost 

Can't wait anymore 
My pain is too much 
No one hears me 
There ain't no love 

No shame no more 
No blame for sure 
My wishing well is 
Calling me home 

[Jesse to Sister Sadie , His mother , Judah and The Disciples] Please don't touch me 
Please don't touch me 
Please don't fuck me 
Please don't touch me 
Please don't touch me
