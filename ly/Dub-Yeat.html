		  (Ayy, Geo got them bands, huh?)

I just caught a dub with some thugs, rock Balenci' (yeah, hey)
I just caught a dub with some thugs, rock Balenci' (hey, yeah)
I just poured it up in my cup, shit got icky (yeah)
She pullin' up, she suckin' on the dick, this shit got sticky (yeah)
I stab you in your back if I don't fuck with you like Ricky (fuck 'em)
I can't trust a soul, I keep this stick on me, lil' blicky
I just went and peeled off, GLE, 'cause shit got shifty
Bitch, I need to geek up, get a lil' higher or I'ma get a lil' pissy

(Hey, hey) Where the problem at?
(Hey, hey) I'm spinnin' off these Percs like I'm a laundromat
(Hey, hey) Bitch playin' with my wood, she a lumberjack
(Hey, hey) Ayy, I just touched an M but I doubled that

We heard you a snitch, yeah, how you proud of that? (Ack)
I just took lil' cranky, bitch, I'm outta here (lil' crank)
I'm sippin' on this mud, lil' bitch, I don't sip no beer (no way)
What you said? What you owe? (Owe)
I'm full of red from head to toe (from head to toe)
Yeah, I thought I was dead, had to let you know (you know, uh)
Yeah, my demons said, "No, don't let go"
Yeah, diamonds flooded
Walking on this beat, then I scrub it
This bitch went brush her teeth, and she love it
Yeah, smoke 'em like some sheets, the clip hold .40's
My pockets got obese, ginormous
Bitch boy on the cross (cross), I got them Forgis
Can't buy you none of this sauce, you couldn't afford it (no way)
I'm rich 'cause I'm a boss, I been on Forbe's list (yo)
Diamonds glistenin', I just flossed (flossed), flossed
Seen you walkin' down the street, yeah, before you crossed
I got killers on my team and they get you lost (get you lost)
Take the Perc, mix with the bean, yeah-yeah, that's my sauce (that's my sauce, mix it up)

I just caught a dub with some thugs, rock Balenci'
I just caught a dub with some thugs, rock Balenci' (hey, yeah)
I just poured it up in my cup, shit got icky
She pullin' up, she suckin' on the dick, this shit got sticky (ha)
I stab you in your back if I don't fuck with you like Ricky
I can't trust a soul, I keep this stick on me, lil' blicky
I just went and peeled off, GLE, 'cause shit got shifty
Bitch, I need to geek up, get a lil' higher or I'ma get a lil' pissy

(Hey, hey) Where the problem at?
(Hey, hey) I'm spinnin' off these Percs like I'm a laundromat
(Hey, hey) Bitch playin' with my wood, she a lumberjack
(Hey, hey) Ayy, I just touched an M but I doubled that
