		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Excuse me for a while
While I'm wide-eyed and I'm so down caught in the middle
I've excused you for a while
While I'm wide-eyed and I'm so down caught in the middle

And a lion, a lion
Roars would you not listen?
If a child, a child
Cries would you not give them?

Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong
Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong

Excuse me for a while
Turn a blind eye with a stare caught right in the middle
Have you wondered for a while
I have a feeling deep down, you're caught in the middle?

If a lion, a lion
Roars would you not listen?
If a child, a child
Cries would you not give them?

Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong
Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong

Excuse me for a while
While I'm wide-eyed and I'm so down caught in the middle
Have you wondered for a while
I have a feeling deep down you're caught in the middle 

Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong
Yeah, I might seem so strong
Yeah, I might speak so long
I've never been so wrong
