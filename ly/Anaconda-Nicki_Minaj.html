		  My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had 'em pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way (hey), what he say? (Hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep tellin' me to chill (hey)
He keep telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (hey)
He say don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag', and I hit him with the jab like (hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (hey, hey)

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt (damn, damn)
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (damn, damn)
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (damn, damn)
(Look at her butt) (damn)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt

This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang Cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say? (Ooh, hey)
He can tell I ain't missing no meals (hey)
Come through and fuck him in my automobile (hey)
Let him eat it with his grills, he keep telling me to chill (hey)
He keep telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal (hey)
He say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab (hey)
So I pulled up in the Jag', Mayweather with the jab like (hey)
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun (hey, hey)

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh, look at her butt (damn, damn)
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (damn, damn)
Oh my gosh, look at her butt (damn, damn)
(Look at her butt) (damn)
Look at, look at, look at
Look, at her butt

Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
Little in the middle but she got much back
(Oh my God, look at her butt)

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun
Don't, my anaconda don't
Don't want none unless you got buns, hun

Oh my gosh (little in the middle but she got much back)
Look at her butt (damn, damn)
Oh my gosh (little in the middle but she got much back)
Look at her butt (damn, damn)
Oh my gosh (little in the middle but she got much back)
Look at her butt (damn, damn)
(Look at her butt) (oh my gosh)
Look at, look at, look at
Look at her butt

Yeah, he love this fat ass, hahaha!
