		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're the whisper of a summer breeze
You're the kiss that puts my soul at ease
What I'm saying is
I'm into you
Here's my story and the story goes
You give love, you get love
And more than Heaven knows

You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love
Right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh baby, baby, please

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry, lover, come to me
Rush, rush
I wanna see, I wanna see ya get free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Ooh, what you do to me

And all I want from you is what you are
And even if you're right next to me
You're still too far away
If I'm not inside your arms
I get dramatic, baby, yes, I know
But I need you, I want you
Oh, man, I love you so
Ooh, ooh

You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Ooh baby, baby, please

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover come to me
Rush, rush
I wanna see, I wanna see ya get free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Ooh, what you do to me

When you kiss me
Up and down
Turn my senses all around
Oh, baby, oh, baby
I don't know just how or why
But no one else has touched me
So deep, so deep, so deep inside

You're gonna see
I'm gonna run, I'm gonna try
I'm gonna take this love right to ya
All my heart, all the joy
Oh baby, baby, please

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover come to me
Rush, rush
I wanna see, I wanna see ya get free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Ooh, what you do to me

Rush, rush
Hurry, hurry lover come to me
Rush, rush
I wanna see, I wanna see ya
Get free with me
Rush, rush
I can feel it, I can feel you all through me
Rush, rush
Ooh, what you do to me

Rush, rush
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Rush, rush
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Rush, rush
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
Rush, rush
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na-na
