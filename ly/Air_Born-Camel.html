		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  High flying diver, spread your wings
Flying high on a cloud
Born on the air, spiral around
So easy making circles
You never touch the ground

You see the sea, feel the sky
Don't know where you're going
You don't, you don't know the answers
To what's in my mind
Riding on the wind and turning with the tide

Light takes you up, it brings you down
Change is the things that to me
Is chained to the frost, the wind and the rain
And everyone keeps staring up
You'll be back again
