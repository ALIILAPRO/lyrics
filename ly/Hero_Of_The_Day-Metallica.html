		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama, they try and break me
The window burns to light the way back home
A light that warms no matter where they've gone
They're off to find the hero of the day
But what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?

Still the window burns, time so slowly turns
Someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, do you feel your name?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

Mama, they try and break me
Still they try and break me

Excuse me while I tend to how I feel
These things return to me that still seem real
Now deservingly this easy chair
But the rocking stopped by wheels of despair

Don't want your aid
But the fist I've made for years can't hold or feel
No, I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feel

But now the dreams and waking screams (now the dreams)
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl (so build a wall)
And hide until it's light
So can you hear your babies crying now?

Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?

But now the dreams and waking screams (now the dreams)
That ever last the night
So build a wall, behind it crawl (so build a wall)
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?

Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me (mama, they try and break me)
Mama, they try and break me (mama, they try and break me)
Mama, they try and break me (mama, they try and break me)
Mama they try, mama they try
