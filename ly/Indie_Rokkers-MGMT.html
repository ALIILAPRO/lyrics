		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the line between your belly and your thighs
The smell of your hair
The sparkle in your eyes
The smoke in your breath
The breathing hard and heavy
The back of your neck
The shine on your Chevy
The moon was so big when I drove it to the levy, girl

I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I was young and in my prime
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on bleedin'

The clean dreams, the sexy limousine
Jason's (?) got the energy he used to be a coke fien
The skinny brown arms coming round in your shirt
Heart is in the right place brain is in the dirt
You live life like everyone's an enemy

I found blood and I saw stars
All in the backseat of your car
And I told you it was love
But you don't wanna know the truth
I was young and in my prime
With my heart still filled with fear
And it goes on bleedin'
