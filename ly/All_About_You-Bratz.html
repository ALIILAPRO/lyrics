		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got style looking so sharp
Rocking hot smile you're gonna go far
Just believe in yourself

You don't need to be who you're not
All you need is all that you've got
Just believe in yourself

You should know what you are
Money can't buy
'Cause you should know
It's all about you

It's not about the money you make
It's not about the little mistakes
It's not about the people you know
You'll be fine on your own

It's not about the clothes you wear
It's not about the car I swear
It's the little things you say and you do
It's all about you

Have fun in all that you do
Listen to your heart it's always so true
We believe in you

You can't stop reach for the stars
Time will tell tell people who you are
We believe in you

You should know what you are
Money can't buy
'cause you should know
It's all about you

It's not about the money you make
It's not about the little mistakes
It's not about the people you know
You'll be fine on your own

It's not about the clothes you wear
It's not about the car I swear
It's the little things you say and you do
It's all about you

(Ahh) If things are spinning around
(Ahh) We'll pick you up when you're down
(Ahh) You don't have to worry my friend
You should know it's all about you

It's not about the people you know
It's not about the seats at the show

It's not about the money you make
It's not about the little mistakes
It's not about the people you know
You'll be fine on your own

It's not about the clothes you wear
It's not about the car I swear
It's the little things you say and you do
It's all about you
