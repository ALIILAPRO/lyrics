		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seeds of life
Survival is the way
Loss of understanding, loss of a lifeform
Fall in love with this world
Loss to lost
Water
This time I think we've got it right
Fall in love with this world
I think we've got it right
These are cruel times, there's so much we can do
Loss to lost
Hope, hope, hope

Decisions we make, for goodness sake
I think we've got it right
And choices make the world go round
A choice is a choice
The being of equal
We only get one chance
These are cruel times, there'so much we can do
Hope, hope, hope

For some, it's a battle
Forgive me, my friends
Turn left if you want to, a message it sends
How long will it last before it all dries up
The water is precious
I need another cup
