		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll never know how you feel
Couldn't even see it through a telescope
You're so far when you're near
I'll be circlin' your sphere forever through

Maybe we're star crossed, maybe we're cursed
All of the science says it won't work
Maybe it kills me, maybe it hurts
But it's out of my control

Oh
My world's spinnin' around you
I never get close
I can't quite figure out how to
I'm tryin' but
These invisible forces are pullin' me back
Keepin' me in your orbit
I wish you'd let go
But my world keeps spinnin' around you

If I ever broke through
Would it be like gettin' too close to the sun?
Or would it undo my universe
And make a better one?

Maybe we're star crossed, maybe we're cursed
What if it works out, there's always a first
Maybe it kills me, maybe it hurts
But it's out of my control

Oh
My world's spinnin' around you
I never get close
I can't quite figure out how to
I'm tryin' but
These invisible forces are pullin' me back
Keepin' me in your orbit
I wish you'd let go
But my world keeps spinnin' around you

Couldn't leave if I wanted to stand at the summit
Wait for the sun to go down
Couldn't leave if I wanted to stand at the summit
Hopin' you'll come back around
Couldn't leave if I wanted to stand at the summit
Wait for the sun to go down
Couldn't leave if I wanted to stand at the summit
Hopin' you'll come back around

Oh
My world's spinnin' around you
I never get close
I can't quite figure out how to
I'm tryin' but
These invisible forces are pullin' me back
Keepin' me in your orbit
I wish you'd let go
But my world keeps spinnin' around you
