		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Eleven carats, that's a Bugatti, I dropped a million in my ear
My bitch fuckin' on a boss, still made her pussy top tier
Niggas'll put you in the cross, a thousand shots be on the Lear
In a Ferrari pullin' off, a double R sittin' in the rear
Solitaire, bust it down, it got the watch crystal clear
It's a skeleton Audemars, but it still got emeralds in the face
Gotta go crazy with the cake
Call the plug, I'm pushin' weight
Sippin' on mud just ease the pain
The coupe go Porsche, just blow the brain
Trained to go, they ready to stain
Plush the seats inside the plane
Crank the charter, we goin' to Spain
We was starvin' before the fame
Totin' a carbon, don't explain
Exotic packs, we own the strain
Transactions, foreign exchange
Knowin' damn well they ready to bang
Pluto go crazy 'bout the gang
Until the opps done totin' they flame
Ain't gon' spare no nigga who play
Ain't no love when niggas fake
Ain't no love

Ain't no love, ain't no love
Can't show love when niggas fake
Sellin' drugs, just tryna be great
Sellin' drugs, sellin' drugs, sellin' drugs
It ain't no love when niggas fake

Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no
Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no
Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no
Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no

Posted on front street, now I'm the plug
Steppin' in Ricky, I know I'm goin' far
Wanna got to war, gotta send out a slug
Nigga caught lack, niggas sprayin' up the car
Mind on point, nigga gotta stay geeked
Seventy-five carats and it ain't no compete
Eliantte, got a mill' in receipts
Send out an invoice and sweepin' your street
Fuck all that marketin', I'm on the block
You got your bitch, I treat her like a dog
Said she wan' bite, gotta fuck on my broad
One of a kind, I'm shittin' on 'em all
Jumped in the 'Rari, I jumped in the jaw
Stand on the gas, ain't on no stallin'
I'm blockin' hoes, I'm doin' the ballin'
I get 'em molded, the carats flawless

Ain't no love, ain't no love, ain't no love
Can't show love when niggas fake
Sellin' drugs, just tryna be great
Sellin' drugs, sellin' drugs, sellin' drugs
It ain't no love when niggas fake

Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no
Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no
Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no
Ain't no love, ain't no love, it ain't no

Eleven carats, that's a Bugatti, I dropped a million in my ear
My bitch fuckin' on a boss, done made her pussy top tier
Eleven carats, that's a Bugatti, I dropped a million in my ear
My bitch fuckin' on a boss, done made her pussy top tier
