		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The boatrides we would take
 The moonlight on the lake
 The way we danced and hummed our favorite song
 The things we did last summer 
 I'll remember all winter long
 The midway and the fun
 The Kewpie dolls we won
 The bell I (you) rang to prove that I was 
 (you were) strong
 The things we did last summer 
 I'll remember all winter long
 The early morning hike
 The rented tandem bike
 The lunches that we used to pack
 We never could explain 
 That sudden summer rain
 The look we got when we got back
 The leaves began to fade 
 Like promises we made
 How could a love that seemed so right go wrong? 
 The things we did last summer 
 I'll remember all winter long
