		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All my life I′ve been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not ok, i dont feel safe

I dont feel safe (oooh)

Left Broken, empty and in despair
Wanna breathe, can′t find air
Thought you were sent from up above
But you and me never had love
So much more i have to say
Help me find a way

And I wonder if you know
How it really feels,
To be left outside alone
When it's cold out here
Well maybe you should know
Just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone


I tell you,

All my life I've been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It′s not ok, I dont feel safe

I need to pray.

Why do you play me like a game?
Always someone else to blame
Careless, helpless little man
Someday i might understand
Theres not much more to say
But i hope you find a way

Still i wonder if you know, how it really feels
To be left outside alone, when its cold out here
Well maybe you should know, just how it feels,
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone


I tell you,
All my life I′ve been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not ok, i dont feel safe

I need to pray.
Ooh Pray
Heavenly father (oooh)
(Please) Heavenly father (Save me) Oh save me
Oooooh...

And I Wonder If you know
How it really feels
To be left outside alone
When its cold out here
Well maybe you should know
Just how it feels
To be left outside alone
To be left outside alone

All my life I′ve been waiting
For you to bring a fairytale my way
Been living in a fantasy without meaning
It's not ok, i dont feel safe

I Need to Pray...
