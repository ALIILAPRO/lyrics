		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't call it a comeback
I've been here for years
I'm rocking my peers
Puttin' suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowerin'
Over the competition I'm towerin'
Wrecking shop when I write these lyrics
That'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin' the price

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just gettin' warm
Just like Muhammed Ali
They called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
That you know I've beef with
Why do you riff with me
The maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy get ready
Cause I might go Blaw!
How you like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get with Mr. Swift or Rift,
Listen to my gears shift
I'm blasting, I'm blasting
Kinda like shaft, so you can say I'm shafting
Oh, English filled my mind, and I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Shadow boxing when I heard you on the radio, UH
I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw
But now I gotta new tour
I'm going insane
Startin' the hurricane
Releasin' pain
Lettin' you know
You can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name
Rippin'
Killin'
Diggin' and drillin' a hole
Pass the Old Gold

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill at will
The man of the hour, tower of power
I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I gotta jammy in my hand
Damn!
Oh!
Listen to the way I slay
Your crew
Damage
Damage
Destruction, terror, and mayhem
Pass me a sissy so sucker I'll slay him
Farmers (what)
Farmers (what)
I'm ready (we're ready)
I think I'm gonna bomb a town
Get down
Don't you never, ever
Pull my lever
Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock Hard

I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
I'm gonna knock you out
Mama said knock you out
