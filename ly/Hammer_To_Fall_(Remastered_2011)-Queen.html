		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hammer To Fall"

Here we stand, here we fall
History don't care at all
Made the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
Yeah, and it's time for the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face the Western way
Build your

Tow the line and play their game
'Til the anesthetic covers it all
'Til one day they call your name
When it's time for the hammer to fall

Rich or poor or famous 
For your truth it's all the same
(Oh no, oh no)
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane
(Oh no)
Baby, now your trouble's all in vain, yeah

For you who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
Just wanna scream it louder and louder and louder

What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
Just got time to say your prayers
Then it's time for the hammer to, hammer to fall

Yeah, to fall

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, yeah
One more time

Waiting for the hammer to fall

Give it to me one more time
