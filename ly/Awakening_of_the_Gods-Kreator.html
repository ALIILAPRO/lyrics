		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Was it a vision or was it a dream
The trust of the mankind has never been real
Gods of pleasure gods of pain
Gods of terror of life and of hate
Mortality is endless when gods start to pray
Life becomes worthless by nuclear death
The're watching from above it could happen every daywatching their terror and
care in no way
No one can imagine where you will be
Where you have been before your birth you will see
Planned and controlled is your life in every way
Watched and controlled on every single day

See their eyes filled with lies
Watch the slaughter endless night
Can make your scream can make you cry
You know you're helpless till the end of time
Awakening of the gods

Burning ambitions your lusts and your wills
Your plans of life goals and your thrills
Days of laughter days of crime your living to your fate on foretold time
Nothin' has worth nothing is real nothing is important no way you
Feel this can't be the only life it could begin when you die

See their eyes...

Manipulated by human feelings
You're passing through this life searching for the meaning of all
But that's something you will never find
Accept all what happens to you
Be prepared for torture and pain you know there ain't nothing
You can do only death will close the reign

You've seen the good sides but you've also seen the bad
Damned to mortality damned is your life for death
Created for a mystery why is this your fate
Only the future will show
Or maybe you will never know
