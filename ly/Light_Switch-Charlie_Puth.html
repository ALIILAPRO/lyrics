		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Why you callin' at 11:30
When you only wanna do me dirty? (Uh)
But I hit right back
'Cause you got that-that, yeah, uh
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each others' (uh)
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and

All the sudden, I'm hypnotized
You're the one that I can't deny
Every time that I say
I'm gonna walk away

You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (no)
You know how to just make me want
You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (yeah)
You know how to just make me want you, baby

Do you love it when you keep me guessin'? (Me guessin')
When you leave and then you leave me stressin' (me stressin') (uh) (uh)
But I can't stay mad
When you walk like that, no, uh
Why you always wanna act like lovers?
But you never wanna be each others' (uh) (uh)
I say, "Don't look back"
But I go right back and

All the sudden, I'm hypnotized (hypnotized)
You're the one that I can't deny (can't deny)
Every time that I say
I'm gonna walk away (yeah)

You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this (no)
You know how to just make me want
You turn me on like a light switch (switch)
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip (grip)
You know how to just make me want you, baby

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on and show me how you do (you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want
You wanna keep me wantin' you (me wantin' you, girl)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on and show me how you do (how you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want
You wanna keep me wantin' you

You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
Now, I don't wanna fight this
You know how to just make me want to

You turn me on like a light switch
When you're movin' your body around and around
You got me in a tight grip
You know how to just make me want you, baby

Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on and show me how you do (how you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want
You wanna keep me wantin' you (wanna keep me wantin' you, baby)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on and show me how you do (how you do)
You want, you want, you want, you want
You wanna keep me wantin' you
