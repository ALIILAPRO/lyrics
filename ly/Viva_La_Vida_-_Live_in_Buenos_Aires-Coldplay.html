		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Let's go)

Canta con nosotros, let's go 

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king

One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
I'm just a puppet on a lonely string
Whoa, who would ever want to be king

Now, I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
Missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

Turn the lights off in the stadium 
Ahora vamos a cantar juntos
MÃ¡s fuerte que nunca, go

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Oh, I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be my mirror, my sword and shield (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
My missionaries in a foreign field (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
For some reason I can't explain (oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh)
I know Saint Peter won't call my name 
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world
When I ruled the world, world, world, world, world
World, world, world
