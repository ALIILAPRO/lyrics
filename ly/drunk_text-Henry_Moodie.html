		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  5th of November
When I walked you home
That's when I nearly said it
But then said "Forget it, you fool"
Do you remember?
You probably don't
'Cause the sparks in the sky
Took a hold of your eyes while we spoke

Yesterday, drank way too much
And stayed up too late
Started to write but I wanna say
Deleted the message, but I still remember it said

I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

April the 7th
And nothing has changed
It's hard to get by
When you're still on my mind every day
Sometimes I question
If you feel the same?
Do we make stupid jokes?
Trying to hide that we're both too afraid to say

I wish I was who you drunk texted at midnight
Wish I was the reason you stay up 'til 3
And you can't fall asleep
Waiting for me to reply
I wish I was more than just someone you walk by
Wish I wasn't scared to be honest and open
Instead of just hoping
You'd feel what I'm feeling inside

Oh, and here we go again
Destroy myself to keep my friend
Hiding away 'cause I was afraid you'd say no
I wonder if I cross your mind
Half as much as you do mine
If I tell you the truth
What will I lose?
I don't know

I wish I'd sent you that drunk text that midnight
I was just scared it would ruin our friendship
But I really meant it
I wonder how you would reply
