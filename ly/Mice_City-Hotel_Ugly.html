		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that you're no good for me
But tell me why I love the way you make me feel
I just want to blow it all
The feeling that you're giving me is so surreal

I don't know the reasons why you do those things to me
And baby, I don't have the answers
But I do know what you need
But I, I don't know why you get me
I met you and I lost myself
And now I'm holding on
I took it too far
I waited too long
You get me too high
I'm waiting to fall
Took it too far
I waited too long
I'm waiting to fall

You say that you're no good for me
But tell me why I love the way you make me feel
I just want to blow it all
The feeling that you're giving me is so surreal

I don't know the reasons why you do those things to me
And baby, I don't have the answers
But I do know what you need
But I, I don't know why you get me
I met you and I lost myself
And now I'm holding on
I took it too far
I waited too long
You get me too high
I'm waiting to fall
Took it too far
I waited too long
I'm waiting to fall

You say that you're no good for me
But tell me why I love the way you make me feel
I just want to blow it all
The feeling that you're giving me is so surreal
