		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Voices in my head again
Trapped in a war inside my own skin
They're pulling me under

I've swallowed myself but the fever remains
I'm numb to the pleasure but still feel the pain 
If I showed you my soul, would you cover your eyes?
If I told you the truth, would you dare me to lie? 

I keep it all inside because I know that man is every thing but kind 

Voices in my head again
Beating me in a war I can't win 
I can hear them now
Trapped in a game inside my own skin
And I don't know myself anymore
They're pulling me under
Voices

As I walk through this valley of shadows and death 
I curse not the wicked, I praise not the blessed
If I told you the truth, you'd beg me to change
If fear were a currency, you'd own the bank 

I don't want to live so calloused and frozen, ugly and hopeless
I don't want to live forever, I just want to live right now
You can't take me, from me 

I keep it all inside because I know that man is everything but kind
