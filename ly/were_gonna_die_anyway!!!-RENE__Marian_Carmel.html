		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE 1
Picture a place where there is sun every day
Never a cloud in the sky
Plenty of room, plenty of room for you
As soon as you turn thirty five

PRE-CHORUS 1
But until then 
we can be bestest of friends
Or the closest of roommates 
If you're down to pretend

Word to the wise 
We could put on a disguise 
But who cares what we do
Coz what else could we lose?

CHORUS 1
So let's hold hands on the train
They're gonna stare anyway 
Head on my shoulder 
Love how i hold her 
I'd do this any day 

Forget what you knew
We're gonna die anyway
Got nothing to prove
Got nothing we can't do 
If we don't live by their rules 

VERSE 2
Know I can't go on one knee for you like they do
We're on the pavement, same thing, but you're tying my shoes 
Walking your dog at the neighbourhood park
Apartments surrounding us, a reminder that this is just our luck

PRE CHORUS 2
And I don't know how
We're gonna figure it out 
Tiny versions of us
Just running around

But in the end 
They probably won't have a good time 
We both know the world's
Gonna burn to the ground

CHORUS 2
So let's hold hands on the train
They're gonna stare anyway 
Head on my shoulder 
Love how i hold her 
I'd do this any day 

Forget what you knew
We're gonna die anyway
Got nothing to prove
Got nothing we can't do 
If we don't live by their rules 

BRIDGE
Holding hands on the train
They're gonna stare at us anyway 
Couldn't care less what they have to say

CHORUS 3
So let's hold hands on the train
They're gonna stare anyway 
Head on my shoulder 
Love how i hold her 
I'd do this any day 

Forget what you knew
We're gonna die anyway
Got nothing to prove
Got nothing we can't do 
If we don't live by their rules 

Got nothing to prove
Got nothing we can't do 
If we don't live by their rules
