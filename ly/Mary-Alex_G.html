		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mary is the girl that I wanna kiss
She's got big red eyes and big red lips
She's got big sharp teeth and big fat hips
Mary is the girl that I wanna fuck
She's got leather heart and leather gloves
She's the only girl that I wanna love

Listen to me, baby, I don't mind
I wanna be with you and waste my time

Give it to me, baby, I feel good
I wanna feel whatever you think I should

Sing it for me, baby, play my song
I wanna hear your daddy sing along

Mary is the girl that leaves you to rot
She says, "I am real and you are not"
She says, "I am real and you are not"
