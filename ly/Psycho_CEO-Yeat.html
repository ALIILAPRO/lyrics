		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, my diamonds jump (ah, ah)
Yeah, my diamonds talk, yeah, my money long (ah, ah, yeah)
Yeah, my money tall, huh, heard it's tall as God (ah, ah)
Heard you tryna come rock with us, we don't know who you are (ah, ah)
Let's get disrespectful, let's get disrespectful (ah, ah)
You better have some respect when you talk to me (ooh, ah, ah)
I'ma cut you off, cut you off when you talkin' to me (ah, ah)
Cut you out my car, cut you out my life (ah, ah)

Where my scissors at? Where my twizzies at? (Yeah)
Where my motherfuckin' army when I need that? (Ah, ah, yeah)
I'm the realest in this game, you know I bleed that (ah, ah, yeah)
When we pull up, we courtside, yeah, where your seats at? 
I'm in 2093, where your life at? 
Wear your diamonds clean like me, but can you wipe that? 
I don't need to have my gun, you know I slice that 
Yeah, I push up on this beat, I fuckin' knife that

Yeah, we got G-wagons, big money, big boss (yeah)
Went to Europe for the week, I just took off (yeah)
I keep my foot on the gas, no, I don't take it off (shh)
We so clean, yeah, we at Nike, uh
I like being number one hypebeast (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, when you fuck with me, then, then you might be, uh (yeah, yeah)
I just poured a planet in my IV bag (yeah, yeah)
You ain't got no money, it's obviously sad
I'm the psycho CEO, ha (I'm that psycho CEO)
Mr. Worldwide on his coat (yeah, yeah)
And my diamonds hopping, I just spent a night on that boat
You was lame, what happened? Now we laughing back at all these jokes (ha, ha)
You could say you don't like my shit, but then I know you lyin'
I'm done wastin' time, I'm done waitin' in line
And on top off all that shit, you always lyin'
On top off all that shit, I stood just fine (yeah)

Yeah, yeah, my diamonds jump (ah, ah, yeah)
Yeah, my diamonds talk, yeah, my money long (ah, ah, yeah)
Yeah, my money tall, huh, heard it's tall as God (ah, ah)
Heard you tryna come rock with us, we don't know who you are (ah, ah, yeah)
Let's get disrespectful, let's get disrespectful (ah, ah)
You better have some respect when you talk to me (ooh, ah, ah)
I'ma cut you off, cut you off when you talkin' to me (ah, ah)
Cut you out my car, cut you out my life (ah, ah, yeah)

Where my scissors at? Where my twizzies at? (Yeah)
Where my motherfuckin' army when I need that? (Ah, ah, yeah)
I'm the realest in this game, you know I bleed that (ah, ah, yeah)
When we pull up, we courtside, yeah, where your seats at? (Yeah)
I'm in 2093, where your life at? (Ah, ah, yeah)
