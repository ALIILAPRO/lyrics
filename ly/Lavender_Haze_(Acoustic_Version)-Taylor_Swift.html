		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I been under scrutiny, yeah, oh yeah
You handle it beautifully, yeah, oh yeah
All this shit is new to me, yeah, oh yeah

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
Is a one night or a wife
I find it dizzying, yeah, oh yeah
They're bringing up my history, yeah, oh yeah
But you weren't even listening, yeah, oh yeah

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
