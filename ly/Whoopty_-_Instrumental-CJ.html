		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loyalty over royalty, y'all niggas know the vibes
(Pxcoyo killed this beat, bitch)

Whoopty 
Bitch, I'm outside it's a movie (whoopty, huh)
Blue cheese
I swear I'm addicted to blue cheese
I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf (huh?)
Bitch, I'm 'bout my chicken like it's a two-piece
You can have your bitch back, she a groupie
She just swallowed all my kids in the two-seat (skrrt)
Swagged out
For Milly, we bringin' them gats out (gang, gang)
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house
Off the '42, I'm blowin' her back out (blowin' her back out)
I'm back on my bullshit, swing back with a full clip
They say I'm movin' ruthless
And my shooters, they shootin'
I won't take her to Ruth Chris (and my shooters they shootin')
(Shooters they shootin', ayy)

I get the breesh, then it's adiós
If I'm with your treesh then she's givin' throat (yeah)
When I see police, then we gettin' low (when I see police)
That's another piece, that's another Zoe
Ice in the VV's, now she's down to get treeshy (ice in the VV's)
I got all this water on me, like Fiji
Bitch, I'm posted up with Hats and the Sleezys (gang)
Smokin' the Zaza, it goes straight to the māthā
Then I'm uppin' the choppa
Hittin' the cha-cha, open his lata
Then he dancin' bachata

(Smokin' the Zaza, it goes straight to the māthā)
