		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Guess I got what I deserved
Kept you waiting there too long, my love
All that time, without a word
Didn't know you'd think that I'd forget
Or I'd regret
The special love I had for you
My baby blue

All the days became so long
Did you really think I'd do you wrong?
Dixie, when I let you go
Thought you'd realize that I would know 
I would show
The special love I have for you 
My baby blue

What can I do? What can I say?
'Cept that I want you by my side
How can I show you? Show me a way
Don't you know the times I've tried?

Guess that's all I have to say
'Cept the feeling just grows stronger everyday
So just one thing before I go
Take good care, but baby, let me know
Let it grow
The special love you have for me 
My Dixie dear
