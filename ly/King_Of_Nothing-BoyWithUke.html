		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hear the church bells ring?
Here he comes, it's the king of kings
Can you hear the church bells ring?
Here he comes, it's the king of kings
His hotel burns, made of ash and strings
He's got all he wants, and lost everything

Tell me, how to stop, I wanna get off
Nervous when I talk about it
See, I'm strugglin' with thoughts
What I used to love
Losin' patience and the passion
Used to think about my younger self
Before I had the wealth
Back when we got donations
Just a kid feelin' what he felt
Dealin' with the issues that he manifested
Tried his best with what he got
But he got lost in what he's not
No, he's not a singer and he doesn't talk
He just got caught in a sub-plot
Soon the shot was over, turned into a loner
Started losin' power in his own songs
He was just a poser, losin' his composure
Lookin' for the closure that he never got

Can you hear the church bells ring?
Here he comes, it's the king of kings
His hotel burns, made of ash and strings
He's got all he wants, and lost everything

Everything about this life
Don't feel the same as it has no eyes alone
I would rather be at home
And I could laugh, and I could try, and live this life for a thousand times
I know, I would rather be at home
