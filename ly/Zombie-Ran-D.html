		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
When the violence calls in silence
Who are we mistaken

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting

With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are crying

In your head
In your head
Zombie, zombie
Zombie-ie-ie

What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie
Zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence calls in silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since 1916
In your head, in your head
They're still fighting

With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are dying

What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie
Zombie-ie-ie

What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie
Zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?

What's in your head?

What's in your head?

What's in your head?
