		  I, yeah, yeah-uh
I, yeah, yeah, yuh
I, yeah, yeah, yuh
I

(I pulled up inside of the Tonka, that bitch not a Chevy)
I pulled up inside of the Lamb', this bitch got machetes (shh, yeah)
No, I ain't fuckin' your friend, but I did it already (phew, ack)
I ain't fuckin' with none of these pussies, these pussies not ready (no way)
Yeah, just got off the phone with Uzi, he told me it's ready (my twizz)
Yeah, choppin' the top off the car man, it chop like spaghetti (skrr)
Yeah, every time I'm in the pussy that bitch like the wettest (no cap, yeah)
Bitch, I just be on these drugs I feel like I'm dead (I'm dead)
Ran it up, I touched an M, I told them I'm ready (buh, buh, buh)

Bitch, I went touched me an M so how can I lose? (Ha, how?)
Nah, I ain't rockin' with flukes, yeah, don't rock with no crews
Yeah, get the hell up out your seat and jump out the juice (luh drank, yeah)
Bitch, I ain't pickin' no side, no, I don't ever lose (no choosing)
Sideways off this dranky (phew)
Ridin' in the whip I told my mama that I'm cranky (woo)
Took another Perky, bitch, I'm cranky like I'm janky (woo, luh jank)
Woke up on the Lamb', I took a crushed up Perc, a kranky (yeah, a crank)
I don't be sniffin' shit, but I'm gon' always keep the hanky (yeah, a hank)
Walk inside the building, put my pinky ring on tankie (yeah, a tank)
I'm flashin' all my jewelry, you fuckin' on some skankies (yeah, a skank)
I got yo' lil' mama wanna text me, said, "Come spank me" (yeah, ha)
I pulled up, bust a nut, and then she thank me (yeah-uh, ha)
Matter fact, she ain't been sippin' on nut, she just been drankin' me (yeah-uh, ha)
Y'all boys really be pussy, cap, don't cap like I got a blank in it (oou-ouu, ouu-hoo)
Used to be shippin the za, I'ma send this shit out like wrapping a blankety (yeah, hoo)
Told you, (mm), to leave me 'lone (woo)
Why you call my phone? I'm home alone, don't, I'm in my zone (woo)
Making all these hits, I made a GRAMMY on my own (woo)
Calling up my mama, told her we made, it fuck these phonies (woo)

I, yeah, yeah-uh
I, yeah, yeah, yuh
I, yeah, yeah, yuh
I

(I pulled up inside of the Tonka, that bitch not a Chevy)

Bitch, I just be on these drugs I feel like I'm dead (I'm dead)
Ran it up, I touched an M, I told them I'm ready (yeah, yeah)
