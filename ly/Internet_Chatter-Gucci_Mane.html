		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Had to take a breath of fresh air
Murda, Guwop
(Murda on the beat so it's not nice)

Only two choices you got, dead or in prison (huh)
That's what my folks told me but I still didn't listen
Everything gravy 'til them folks start snitchin'
You can't stand the heat than get your ass out the kitchen
These rappers go broke and have to do a dummy mission
Don't be a crash dummy and go out like French
Every day ain't promised the trap ain't got no pension
It must be Fentanyl because he can't stop twitchin' (wow)
She talk too much, the bitch won't stop bitchin'
I seen a nigga in Terre Haute and the boy turned Christian (well, damn)
These niggas be hoes and get treated just like some bitches
How niggas gettin' extorted when y'all niggas got got switches? (How?)

I'm not bothered by the internet chatter (no)
I'ma make the haters get madder (get mad)
Lately my pockets gettin' fatter and fatter (gettin' fat, gettin' fat)
And lately to me that's all that matter (that's all that)
I'm not bothered by the internet chatter (naw)
I'ma make the haters get madder (get mad)
Lately my pockets gettin' fatter and fatter(gettin' fat, fat, fat)
And lately to me that's all that matter (go)

Y'all remember Gucci with the big ol' gut? (Big ol' gut, huh)
Down bad, Wright Street, 901 (well, damn)
Some niggas tried to jump me five on one
You gotta stand on your ten and there ain't got no gun 
Free my nigga Shiest' I know it ain't no fun (free him)
Locked down, rich, still ain't got no bond
Hateful comments act like I don't see it
Gucci got long money that's no secret (long)
Big booty rich bitch who I sleep with (huh)
Niggas think they slick they wanna be me, I peep it
My bank account's a beast and it keep gettin' fatter (fat, fat)
And lately to me that's all that matter (Wop)

I'm not bothered by the internet chatter (no)
I'ma make the haters get madder (get mad)
Lately my pockets gettin' fatter and fatter (gettin' fat, gettin' fat)
And lately to me that's all that matter (that's all that)
I'm not bothered by the internet chatter (naw)
I'ma make the haters get madder (get mad)
Lately my pockets gettin' fatter and fatter (gettin' fat, fat, fat)
And lately to me that's all that matter (go)
