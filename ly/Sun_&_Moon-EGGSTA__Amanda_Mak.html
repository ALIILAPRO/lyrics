		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold me close when I can't see
The road ain't as clear as I'd want it to be
Maybe we can be each other's guides to infinity
When morning comes
Will you be my sunshine?
When I'm down would you be the light?
And I will be your moonlight
Even in the darkest hour
I'll hold you all night
Would you be the light?
And I'll hold you tight
Could I be your light?
While you hold me tight
And in the days when our love is quiet
The stars will remind us of who we used to be
When our love was still young
And we hoped we could be each other's sun and moon
When morning comes
Will you be my sunshine?
When I'm down would you be the light?
And I will be your moonlight
Even in the darkest hour
I'll hold you all night
Would you be the light?
While I'll hold you tight
Could I be your light?
While you hold me tight
All of the lights lead back to you
See our love shine and blaze out in the night
All of the lights lead back to you
See our love shine and blaze out
In the night
Out, in the night
When morning comes
Will you be my sunshine?
When I'm down would you be the light?
And I will be your moonlight
Even in the darkest hour I'll hold you all night
Would you be the light?
While I'll hold you tight
Could I be your light?
While You hold me tight
