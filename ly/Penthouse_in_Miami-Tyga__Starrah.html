		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Got a hotel room at the London
I'll put you up in
That's how you know that you the
Type I wanna fuck with
Took you out in public, so fuck a budget
It ain't trickin' 'cause you
Push the right buttons
Especially when you bussin' it
I get to fuckin' it
Now throw it back and tell them
Niggas who you fuckin' with
Now tell me how you lovin' it
How you lovin' it how you lovin' it
Got a penthouse suite in Miami
You understand me?
Get a lil' tan on your body, wet, sandy
Taste like candy, what's her fancy?
A lil' fancy, mm
Especially when you bussin' it
I get to fuckin' it
Now throw it back and tell them
Niggas who you fuckin' with
Now tell me how you lovin' it
How you lovin' it
How you lovin' it (yeah, yeah)

Baby, let me put it in, let me dip it in
Tell me how you lovin' it, mm
Throw that ass on the bed
When you spread your legs
Tell me how you lovin' it, mm

Yeah, and I'm so tapped in, get you tapped in
And you thought you was in love
That was back then
I'ma put you on cold, now you might kick
(Kick)
Have you drippin' so hard, gotta wipe it
(Wipe it) and you know I treat you better
(yeah) but you won't admit it (No)
Looked you in the eyes first
Time that we did it (yeah)
You know I'm a player
So hard to be committed (yeah)
But I get in my feelings
Every time your name mentioned, uh
Okay (Okay) , foreplay (Foreplay)
Champagne (Champagne) , lingerie, yeah (Lingerie)
I'm fuckin' with you, this can
Go the long way, yeah
Fuck them other bitches
They can't say they got me (No)
Good weed (Uh) , Heartbeat (yeah)
I'm here to serve
(Serve) your body, uh (Body)
Feelin' on your little body-ody, mami

Got a hotel room at the London
I'll put you up in
That's how you know that you the
Type I wanna fuck with
Took you out in public, so fuck a budget
It ain't trickin' 'cause you
Push the right buttons
Especially when you bussin' it
I get to fuckin' it
Now throw it back and tell them
Niggas who you fuckin' with
Now tell me how you lovin' it
How you lovin' it how you lovin' it
Got a penthouse suite in Miami
You understand me?
Get a lil' tan on your body, wet, sandy
Taste like candy, what's her fancy?
A lil' fancy, mm
Especially when you bussin' it

How you lovin' it
How you lovin' it (yeah, yeah)

Baby, let me put it in, let me dip it in
Tell me how you lovin' it, mm
Throw that ass on the bed
When you spread your legs
Tell me how you lovin' it, mm
