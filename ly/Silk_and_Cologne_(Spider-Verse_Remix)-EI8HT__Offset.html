		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a party, uh
He call me shawty 
Whiff on me candy 
You think you love me 
Got he on silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne

Sweet like sweet bread
Dolly like dolly, see me pon he telly, mmm
Snow come, let me teh
How he lookin' at me, mumblin' he dumb lucky, mmm
Stick around for a whole lotta ish
Whole lotta ish, and the ish don't miss, yeah
Stick around with me and come kick
Oh my when I click a finger got a whole lotta it (oh, oh)

Took over 'Merica
Tell driver send my card
I show them how it done
They take it how it come (oh, oh)
Three thirty in the club, sweat all over my clothes (oh, oh)
Sweat through my Margiela, my Margiela

There's a party, uh
He call me shawty 
Whiff on me candy 
You think you love me 
Got he on silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne

I could be a fronter, I could give a lot of money
I could be an umbrella, and when the storm comin'
Stamps on your passport, country after country
Back then I would have to grind it out the dungeon
I turned nothing into somethin'
Visions of me winning, man, I knew that they were comin'
Felt it in my stomach, it was always in my conscious
I could see my future when nobody seen it coming
I don't eat for nothin'
Ride with me, slide with me
Man, I hope you don't get tired of me
Lookin' in your eyes, they look like you a bride to me
It's a party, have you ever been in LaFerrari?
Show me that it's real, you a part of me
I need you close, don't go far from me
And I feel better when you talk to me
So come and talk to me

There's a party, uh
He call me shawty 
Whiff on me candy 
You think you love me 
Got he on silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
There's a party, oh
He call me shawty 
Whiff on me candy 
You think you love me 
Got he on silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne
Silk and cologne, silk and cologne, yeah

(How are you even cooler under your mask?)
I was this cool the whole time
