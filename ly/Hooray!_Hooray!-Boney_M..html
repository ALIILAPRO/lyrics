		  Digge ding ding ding digge digge ding ding
Hey di, hey di, hoh
Digge ding ding ding digge digge ding ding
Hey di, hey di, hoh

Digge ding ding ding digge digge ding ding
Hey di, hey di, hoh
Digge ding ding ding digge digge ding ding
Hey di, hey di, hoh

There's a place I know where we should go, hey di, hey di, hoh
Won't you take me there your lady fair, hey di, hey di, hoh
There's a brook near-by the grass grows high, hey di, hey di, hoh
Where we both can hide side by side, hey di, hey di, hoh

Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday

There's a country fair not far from there, hey di, hey di, hoh
On a carousel the dingdong bell, hey di, hey di, hoh
On the loop di loop we swing and swoop, hey di, hey di, hoh
And what else we'll do is up to you, hey di, hey di, hoh

Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday

Well, I'm game
Fun is the thing I'm after
Now let's a'live it up today
Get set for love and laughter

Well, let's go
Time isn't here for wasting
Life is so full of sweet sweet things
I'd like to do some tasting

Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday

In the country side we take a ride, hey di, hey di, hoh
Where the stars will shine lots of time, hey di, hey di, hoh
Back of your old car we might get far, hey di, hey di, hoh
In the summerbreeze we feel at ease, hey di, hey di, hoh

Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
What a world of fun for everyone, holi-holiday
Hooray, hooray, it's a holi-holiday
Sing a summer song, skip along, holi-holiday
It's a holi-holiday, it's a holi-holiday
