		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I'm dumb?)
(Well, maybe I am because I'm still in love)

You still wear skinny jeans and that should have been my first sign
That you can't let go of the past, so why should I be surprised?
That you're still texting your ex and holding on to shit for dear life
Make the blood rush to my head
Make me wanna nuke my insides

You call me seven times like I don't know you're drunk
Tell me I'm so pretty and you're still in love

Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm dumb?
Well maybe I am 'cause I still pick up
I hate that I don't hate you quite enough
So I must be stupid
I must be dumb
Guess that makes two of us

Don't worry darling
You still make me wet
When tears roll down my eyes onto my cheeks, onto my chest
Oh my god, I look pathetic 'cause you rip my heart in two
And I'm still tryna see the good in you

Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm dumb?
Well maybe I am 'cause I still pick up
I hate that I don't hate you quite enough
So I must be stupid
I must be dumb
Guess that makes two of us

Do you think I'm stupid?
Do you think I'm dumb?
Well maybe I am because I'm still in love
I hate that I don't hate you quite enough
So I must be stupid
I must be dumb
Guess that makes two of us

(I must be stupid)
(I must be dumb)
That makes two of us
So I must be stupid
I must be dumb
Guess that makes two of us
