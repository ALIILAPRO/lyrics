		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I buried my heart in a hole in the ground
With the lights and the roses and the cowards downtown
They threw me a party, there was no one around
They tried to call my girl but she could not be found

I buried my guilt in a pit in the sound
With the rust and the vultures and the trash downtown
So don't step to me, kid, you'll never be found
'Cause while you were sleeping, I took over your town

When I see a man, I see a lion
When I see a man, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, I want ya

I fell for a girl with a port-wine stain
I knew her initials but never her name
I tried and I tried and I was never the same
It's no longer for love and I'm forever changed

When I see a man, I see a lion
When I see a man, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, I want ya
Give up my money, give up my name, take it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
When I see a man, I see a lion
When I see a man, I see a lion

When I see a man, I see a lion
When I see a man, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, I want ya
Give up my money, give up my name, take it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
I'm a sycophantic animal, I'm a sycophantic animal, I'm a sycophantic animal
Break up the chain, I'll break up the chain, I'll break it
Give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
When I see a man, I see a lion
When I see a man, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, I want ya
Give up my money, give up my name, take it away
I'll give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
See you again, I'll see you again, I'll see ya
Give it away, I'll give it away, I'll give it
When I feel low, when I feel low, I feel it
When I see a man, I see a lion
When I see a man, I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, of my eye
You're the apple of my eye, of my eye, I want ya
