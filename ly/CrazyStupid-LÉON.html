		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Star crossed lovers, I can't help but wonder
Did I ever leave your mind?
Late night summer, in your room
I want your body next to mine
Love, I told myself that I could forget
But no, no in the moment 
I don't want nothing else

Telling myself sweet little lies when I'm with you
For a moment think we'll get it right
Making promises that I never keep
And I do it to you every time
I'm so out of my mind
I'm crazy and stupid 'cause I can't forget
So out of my mind
Still I do it to you every time

Birds start singing, empty streets
See the morning slowly rise
No words left, see I shouldn't stay
You begging, "Stay just a little while"
But ohh, you know how it always goes (always goes)
No no, 'til next time I'm gonna let you go, go, go

Telling myself sweet little lies when I'm with you
For a moment think we'll get it right
Making promises that I never keep
And I do it to you every time
I'm so out of my mind
I'm crazy and stupid 'cause I can't forget
So out of my mind
Still I do it to you every time

And I get dressed and try to leave
But maybe I should stay
A part of me feels guilt always pushing you away
So selfish in all my stupid ways
I wanna keep you to myself
'Cause I don't want nobody else to have you
Like a scene in some bad film, we say goodbye
And I say, "This is the last time" but it never really is
You laugh and say, "Oh, is it now?"
'Cause nothing ever changes, can't go back to being strangers

Telling myself sweet little lies when I'm with you
For a moment think we'll get it right
Making promises that I never keep
And I do it to you every time
I'm so out of my mind
I'm crazy and stupid 'cause I can't forget ya
So out of my mind
Still I do it to you every time

I can't help it
I keep doing this to you, keep fooling myself (keep fooling myself)
I'm so selfish
Then you get a little bit too close then I'm running away
I can't help it
I keep doing this to you, keep fooling myself
I'm so selfish
Then you get a little bit too close then I'm running away
