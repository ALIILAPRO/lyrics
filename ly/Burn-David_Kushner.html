		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you ever caused was pain
You can say you're sorry, the evidence is on my
Body but I never complain
I wear it as a lesson, a curse and a blessing

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You're not a prophet
Have you forgotten that you're godless?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You're on your knees and
You're tryna speak, beggin' me please, but

Don't even say what you're gonna say
It's too late, too late, baby
Why did you wait to finally change?
It's too late, too late to save me, oh-oh-oh

You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me

I don't even pity your pain
You can use it as a weapon, but I won't ever let it
Pull me back under again
I let you fool me once, but now I'm dead and gone

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You're not a prophet
Have you forgotten that you're godless?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You're on your knees and
You're tryna speak, beggin' me please, but

Don't even say what you're gonna say
It's too late, too late, baby
Why did you wait to finally change?
It's too late, too late to save me, oh-oh-oh

You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me
Burn, burn, burn
You watched me

(Burn, burn, burn)
(You watched me)
(Burn, burn, burn)
(You watched me)
