		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not long ago but far away
A rainy winter's day
All her pain she kept inside
Could no longer hide
No cry for help
She killed herself
Both life and love could not be saved
She took them both to the grave

A pair of souls become undone
Where were two now one
Divided by this wall of death
I soon will join you yet
With my blood I'll find your love
You found the strength to end you life
As you did so shall I

Oh no
Please don't go
It's like a death in the family

A crimson pool so warm and deep
Lulls me to an endless sleep
Your hand in mine - I will be brave
Take me from this earth
An endless night - this, the end of life
From the dark I feel your lips
And I taste your bloody kiss

Oh no
Please don't go
It's like a death in the family

Don't die on me
Don't die on me
Don't die on me
Don't' die
