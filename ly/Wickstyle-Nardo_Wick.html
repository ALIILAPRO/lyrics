		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang 
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Gang, gang, gang, gang-gang-gang
Gang, gang, gang-gang-gang
Gang, gang, gang-gang-gang
Gang, gang, gang-gang-gang

Middle fingers up, shit, that's just the mood I'm in
I already showed they ass before, fuck it, show they ass again
Keep sayin' he gon' stand on business, why the fuck he ain't did it then?
Can't compare me to these niggas, they ain't in the group I'm in
She keep tryna make me smile, say she like it when I grin
"Nardo, let me in your heart," not by the hair that's on my chin
Don't make promises I can't keep, no, I'm not that type of man
But if a nigga play, I promise he'll never (huh-huh), again (mhm)
Niggas act like hoes, some hoes more gangster than these niggas
Like the way I put on my clothes, say I be cleaner than her nigga
Hopped out, all they seen was flashes like we was takin' a bunch of pictures
I know a couple niggas bangin' B like they Jigga
Just got off the phone with my mama 
She say these niggas ain't fuckin' with me (ain't fuckin with me)
I ride 'round with that Llama, no, this bitch not no semi
If I text you, "Vroom-vroom," that mean come ride me like a HEMI
Vroom, vroom, vroom, that mean come ride me like a HEMI
Your lady say she like me, your lady say she love me
Your lady wanna fuck me (uh, uh, uh)
I'm with all the fuckery, a nigga better not fuck with me 
Or shit gon' get real ugly (uh, uh, uh)
My lil' nigga'll do you in like the first two letters in universe
If it go down right now, before I ask questions, I'ma shoot it first (grrah-grrah)
You get a hearse, switch on the glick, now it shoot in cursive
All the other bitches bad, but, baby, you the worst
Told me she ain't got no night clothes, I said, "Just put on my shirt"
She got that water like a ocean, and I'm bored, let me surf
Tryna beef 'bout a bitch get put thirty toes in the dirt
Why the fuck he got his hand out? He ain't never put in no work (uh)
Zoomin' on the backstreet doin' one-twenty in my SRT (S-R-T)
Take off a nigga face he touch these diamonds on my shirt
My nigga damn near wrecked his whip, he say he dropped his Perc'
She left my house dumb as fuck, she pulled up here a nerd
If I had a million every time I loved a bitch, bro, I'd be broke as fuck
If a nigga play in this party, bro, I ain't gon' lie, I'ma shoot the party up
I know I'm famous, but if I catch that boy, I'ma fuck lil' buddy up
Only advice I got if my niggas come through is, "Duh-duh-duh"
Hashtag gang shit, hashtag bang shit, hashtag crank shit, hashtag flame shit

Gang, gang, gang-gang-gang-gang
