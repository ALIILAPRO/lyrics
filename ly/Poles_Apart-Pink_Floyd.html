		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Did you know it was all going to go so wrong for you?
And did you see it was all going to be so right for me?
Why did we tell you then
You were always the golden boy then
And that you'd never lose that light in your eyes?

Hey you, did you ever realize what you'd become?
And did you see that it wasn't only me, you were running from?
Did you know all the time but it never bothered you anyway?
Leading the blind while I stared out the steel in your eyes

The rain fell slow, down on all the roofs of uncertainty
I thought of you and the years and all the sadness fell away from me
And did you know? (And did you know?)
I never thought that you'd lose that light in your eyes
