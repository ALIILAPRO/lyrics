		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brave the currents, fight the waves
Try to find your own way
A mystery that won't let us free
A power that we can't see

Moments lost, never to return
Time, a lesson that we'll never learn
Moments lost, never to return
Time, a lesson that we'll never learn

A power that shapes us that we can't see
A mystery that won't let us free, free

We try to outrun it but it's always there
Not fair
Reminding us that life is not fair, not fair
(Fear)

Moments lost, never to return
Time, a lesson that we'll never learn
Moments lost, never to return
Time, a lesson that we'll never learn

Time, a secret that we can't unravel
A force that controls us like cattle
Moments lost, never to return
Time is a lesson that we will never learn
Never learn, learn

A river that gives and flows
A journey that nobody knows
A river that gives and flows
A journey that nobody knows

Moments lost, never to return
Time, a lesson that we'll never learn
Moments lost, never to return
Time, a lesson that we'll never learn

A river that gives and flows
A journey that nobody knows
