		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know what you came here to see
If you a freak, then you comin' home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open, let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Your girl just kissed a girl, I do bi (chicks)
Shake for a Sheikh, I'm throwing these Emirates in the sky
Spendin' this as-salamu alaykum, peace to M.O.N.E.Y
I love my beaches, south beaches, surfboard and high tide
I could just roll up 'cause I'm swole up
So that birthday cake get a cobra
Buggati for real, I'm cold, bruh
That Autobiography Rover
Got the key to my city, it's over
It's no thots, only Anna Kournikovas
I set records, ratchets hol' up (I said rackets, ratchets hol' up)

I know what you came here to see
If you a freak, then you comin' home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open, let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real (and they already know me)
It's going down for real

It's going down further than femurs, girls get wetter than Katrina
Yeah, my girl you never seen her 'cause my tints by limousines
My touch say it's the Midas
We the plus, your man the minus
My team blowing on that slam
Make you cough-cough, that's bronchitis
Put your hands up, uh
It's a stick up, no more makeup
Get that ass on the floor, ladies put your lipstick up
Double entendre, double entendre
While you're hating I get money
Then I double up tonkers

I know what you came here to see
If you a freak, then you comin' home with me
And I know what you came here to do
Now bust it open, let me see you get low
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real

Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it, pop it
Lift it, drop it, shake it

It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
It's going down for real
