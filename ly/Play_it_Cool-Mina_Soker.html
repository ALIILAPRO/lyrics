		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gotta play it cool
I ain't a fucking a fool
I get it when it's due
My plan is always true
One shot And it's a goal
You can't expect 'em all
Got shielded with the bros
Come at me and your gone
You made me going crazy hazy
You had me all bazzy dizzy
You made me going crazy hazy
You had me all bazzy dizzy
She got me layed
Next day is great
I am on the boat
Popping hella champian
Twelve stars rate
Can't think straight
Fucked up state
Popping pills all day
Yo
Mofo
Slow mo
On a go
low
You know
The flow
On the roll
Let me be
The one
You want me
Baby tonight
Can I beat it tonight
Popping
Popping
Popping
Got me slow lo lo
On the boat wo wo
With bro wo wos
Do ma show wo wo
I gotta play it cool
I ain't a fucking a fool
I get it when it's due
My plan is always true
One shot And it's a goal
You can't expect 'em all
Got shielded with the bros
Come at me and your gone
You made me going crazy hazy
You had me all bazzy dizzy
You made me going crazy hazy
You had me all bazzy dizzy
