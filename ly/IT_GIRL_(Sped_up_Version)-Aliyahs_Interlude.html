		  Aliyah's Interlude in this bitch
You already know
Aliyahcore today, tomorrow, yesterday, and forever, period
The fuck?

Bitch, you know I'm sexy
Ugh, don't call, just text me
Bitches slow, can't get on my speed
They stare 'cause they know I'm the

I-T G-I-R-L
You know I am that girl
Shh, bitch, don't kiss and tell 
It girl from ATL
I, I-T G-I-R-L
You know I am that girl
Shh, bitch, don't kiss and tell
It girl from ATL

How you mad at me 'cause I'm cunt, bitch? (Huh? Huh?)
How you mad at me 'cause I run shit? (Huh? Huh?)
Be mad at yourself 'cause you ain't done shit (huh? Huh?)
Talkin' all that shit is redundant (huh?)

Trendsetter, bitch, don't be actin' surprised
Aliyahcore to the moon, wanna see my demise
But I don't give a fuck, bitch, look at my eyes
I'm a star girl, bitch 'bout time y'all realized
That bitch today, tomorrow, and the day after that
Don't give a fuck 'bout all you little hoes and that's a fact
Not arguin' with bitches who too scared to show they face, bitch
If you said that in real life
I swear you would get maced, bitch
Pretty bitches love me (yeah)
And ugly hoes hate me
But while y'all busy hatin' I'm flying across the country
To be in Vogue, bitch (yeah)
To walk in shows
'Cause I'm that bitch (yeah)
You already know (the fuck?)

Bitch, you know I'm sexy
Ugh, don't call, just text me
Bitches slow, can't get on my speed
They stare 'cause they know I'm the

I-T G-I-R-L
You know I am that girl
Shh, bitch, don't kiss and tell 
It girl from ATL
I, I-T G-I-R-L
You know I am that girl
Shh, bitch, don't kiss and tell
It girl from ATL

Don't be mad at me, 'cause I'm cunt, bitch (what?)
Don't be mad at me 'cause I run shit (what?)
Be mad at yourself, 'cause you ain't done shit (what? What?)
Talkin' all that shit is redundant

I-T G-I-R-L
You know I am that girl
Shh, bitch, don't kiss and tell 
It girl from ATL

When you a bad bitch
You don't never give a fuck about a mad bitch
Stay true to yourself, you a savage
And don't never let these hoes see you down, bitch (bitch)
When you a bad bitch
You don't never give a fuck about a mad bitch
Stay true to yourself, you a savage
And don't never let these hoes see you down, bitch (bitch)

I-T G-I-R-L
You know I am that girl
Shh, bitch, don't kiss and tell 
It girl from ATL
