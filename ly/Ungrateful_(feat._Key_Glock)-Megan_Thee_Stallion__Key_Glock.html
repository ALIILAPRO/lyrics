Ayy

Whichever bitch wanna come get it, I got it (got it) 
I'm givin' out work, come apply (yeah)
These bitches talkin' that shit and they sayin' my name 
And I can't keep just lettin' it fly (nope)
They gotta sub, they gotta tweet
They gotta go get they homegirl for me (hmm)
If I was still doin' broke shit with your broke ass 
Then your broke ass wouldn't want beef, hey
When I started gettin' money, I'ma tell you the truth (yeah)
All the hoes that was hatin' got they ass cut loose (got they ass cut loose)
Bitch knew a lil' business, wanna put it in the news (hmm)
They'll take it to the 'net (hey), but I'ma take it to the booth (yeah, yeah)
Give a bitch an inch, she'll take it to the moon
Hoes love to stir the pot and I'ma get a bitch a spoon (yeah)
Bitch, I'm the one, you ain't even the two (hey, hey)
You would never be you if I wasn't your muse

Whole lot of fake-ass, snake-ass, backstabbin', hatin'-ass 
No money gettin'-ass bitches (no money-ass bitches)
Y'all actin' really ungrateful, I'm sparin' you hoes (hey) 
I been could've fucked y'all niggas (hey, been could've fucked y'all niggas)
Whole lot of fake-ass, snake-ass, cake-ass, hatin'-ass (yeah) 
No money gettin'-ass niggas (yeah, ayy)
I really been sparin' you niggas (yeah) 
Your girl hate me 'cause I been shittin' on y'all bitches (hey)

I'm the motherfuckin' pimp that will a pay a bitch rent
To put trick daddies only, I don't care about no nigga
Perkies these bitches is poppin' is potent
The shit they be tweetin', they gotta be smokin'
I'm every nigga favorite, pussy get played with
I'm the type of bitch jealous hoes can't hang with
Next to the head of the bed 'cause I'm flexible (ah)
He tryna come fit that dick in my schedule (ah)
Ayy, big rocks all on my neck like I'm Betty Rubble
Boy, stop likin' all my pics 'fore you get in trouble
I don't need a team or a bitch speakin' for me
When y'all hoes step, gotta call y'all sorority (call y'all sorority)
Hollywood shit 'cause I'm with all the action (yeah)
Ain't your boyfriend, you can stop all the actin' (stop all the actin')
If you comin' for me, then you need to come hard (yeah)
If a bitch ain't shakin', I ain't doin' my job

Whole lot of fake-ass, snake-ass, backstabbin', hatin'-ass
No money gettin'-ass bitches (no money-ass bitches)
Y'all actin' really ungrateful, I'm sparin' you hoes (hey) 
I been could've fucked y'all niggas (hey, been could've fucked y'all niggas)
Whole lot of fake-ass, snake-ass, cake-ass, hatin'-ass (yeah) 
No money gettin'-ass niggas (no money ain't spent)
I really been sparin' you niggas (yeah) 
Your girl hate me 'cause I been shittin' on y'all bitches (ah)

Whole lot of lame-ass, fake-ass, hatin'-ass 
Green-ass, pillow-talkin'-ass niggas (yeah, yeah)
I ain't tryna spare none of these lil' rap niggas (yeah, yeah)
I'm tryna fuck on all they bitches (yeah, yeah)
I take that back, I fuck all they bitches
Uh, Maybach Benz sound like it came with switches (yup)
One thing for sure, hell nah, I ain't switching
Uh, two thing for sure, I'ma always go, go get it (skrrt)
Yeah, ran a bag up, up just like Emmitt (Smith)
Ridin' in a yellow thing, you know who in it (skrrt)
Acrobatic trap nigga, yeah, I flip it
I save my money, don't save these bitches
I know I'm the shit, yeah, bitch, I admit it (bitch)
Uh, got a GPS on my road to riches (yeah)
They like, "Where you goin'?" I'm goin' to get it
My bitch just hit me sayin' she tired of these

Fake-ass, snake-ass, backstabbin', hatin'-ass 
No money gettin'-ass bitches (no money-ass bitches)
Y'all actin' really ungrateful, I'm sparin' you hoes (hey)
I been could've fucked y'all niggas (hey, been could've fucked y'all niggas)
Whole lot of fake-ass, snake-ass, cake-ass, hatin'-ass (yeah)
