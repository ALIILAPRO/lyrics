		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison

Following the rights movements you clamped on with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids
Following the rights movements you clamped on with your iron fists
Drugs became conveniently available for all the kids

I buy my crack, I smack my bitch 
Right here in Hollywood

Nearly two million Americans are incarcerated
In the prison system, prison system of the U.S.

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me

Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich
Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch
All our taxes paying for your wars against the new non-rich

I buy my crack, I smack my bitch 
Right here in Hollywood

The percentage of Americans in the prison system
Prison system has doubled since 1985

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
For you and me
Oh baby, you and me

All research and successful drug policies show 
that treatment should be increased
And law enforcement decreased while abolishing 
mandatory minimum sentences
All research and successful drug policies show
That treatment should be increased
And law enforcement decreased while abolishing 
Mandatory minimum sentences

Utilizing drugs to pay for 
Secret wars around the world
Drugs are now your global policy
Now you police the globe

I buy my crack, I smack my bitch 
Right here in Hollywood

Drug money is used to rig elections
And train brutal corporate sponsored
Dictators around the world

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
For you and me to live in
Another prison system
Another prison system
Another prison system
For you and me

They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
They're trying to build a prison
For you and me
Oh baby, you and me
