		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, feel like I'm running, running away from myself
You think you're funny, the way you like to play
Feel like you putting me down, you just gotta see it clearly 
See you clearly (don't fade away)

I close my eyes I lie awake and hear my own voice 
I only hear a lot of noise a lot of noise
I close my eyes I lie awake and hear my own voice (oh)

Every night I talk to myself 
And when I'm all alone
I still howl at the moon (ooh, ooh)

I got me, I got nothing to lose
Fuhh me
What am I suppose to do 
Time's up, I'm waiting on you
Shattered diamonds are still flawless

Feel like I'm walking, walking right back to you
Why am I so serious, never know when to let go 
Feel like people put you up
On a pedestal (don't fade away)

I close my eyes I lie awake and hear my own voice 
I only hear a lot of noise, a lot of noise
I close my eyes I lie awake and hear my own voice (oh)

Every night I talk to myself 
And when I'm all alone
I still howl at the moon (ooh)

I got me, I got nothing to lose
Fuhh me
What am I supposed to do 
Time's up
I'm waiting on you
Shattered diamonds are still flawless

Whether I'm shattered or whole 
I'm still full in my soul
Listening to my own mind
I look into my own eyes 
Scorpio, 'til the moon rise

Every night I talk to myself 
And when I'm all alone
I still howl at the moon 

I got me, I got nothing to lose
Fuhhh me
What am I supposed to do
Time's up (time's up)
I'm waiting on you (on you, yeah)
Shattered diamonds are still flawless flawless, flawless
Flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless, flawless
Waiting on you
Shattered diamonds are still flawless
