		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here comes the sun, doo, dun, doo, doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, doo, dun, doo, doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Little darling, the smile's returning to the faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

Here comes the sun, doo, dun, doo, doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes

Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

Here comes the sun, doo, dun, doo, doo
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

Here comes the sun, doo, dun, doo, doo
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
