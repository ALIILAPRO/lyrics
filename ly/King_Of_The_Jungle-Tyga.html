		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been unfaithful, I been lying like the king of the jungle
But I ain't lying when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lying like the king of the jungle
Ah, yeah, I been wilding, yeah, I been wilding, yeah
I been unfaithful, I been lying like the king of the jungle
But I ain't lying when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lying like the king of the jungle
Ah, yeah, I been wilding, yeah, I been wilding

I been unfaithful, you were an angel
I ran off with your halo, yeah, I made you unstable
Did you get what you came for? Yeah, I got what I came for
You love that designer but being my girl was your favorite label, yeah
I been caught and now the case closed, I don't know
Yeah, I been caught and now the case closed, don't know
I'ma tell it all, Jose Canseco, oh no
You want me to say that it ain't so, but I can't say it ain't, so you know

I been unfaithful
Just when I love you turns into I hate you
Baby, baby, please let me explain to you
I don't know what to say, oh, no, no
Yeah, I been unfaithful
Just when I love you turns into I hate you
Baby, baby, let me explain to you
Say oh no, say oh no

I been unfaithful, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lying when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Yeah, I been wilding, yeah, I been wilding, yeah
I been unfaithful, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lying when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Yeah, I been wilding, yeah, I been wilding

Now don't you act innocent 'cause you went nights without hitting me
But it's not just me
I sabotage, I ruin things before it ruins me
Yeah, silly me, yeah, stupid you 'cause losing you could ruin me
Still, I been unfaithful, making mistakes I can't pay for
Keisha, Lisa and Rachel, we lay up and lay low
I was up in the Wraith slow, you was telling me race home
I was up in the Wraith slow 'cause I already know I gotta tell you

I been unfaithful, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lying when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Yeah, I been wilding, yeah, I been wilding, yeah
I been unfaithful, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
But I ain't lying when I say I love you
But I been unfaithful, yeah, I been lying like the king of the jungle (there's something to say to you)
Yeah, I been wilding, yeah, I been wilding
