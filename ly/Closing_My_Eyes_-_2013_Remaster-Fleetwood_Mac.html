		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now it's the same as before
And I'm alone again

With no sorrow for myself
And I'm blaming no one else

And closing my eyes
And seeing you standing there

Now it's the same as before
You touched me with your love

And though you're in my heart
We're still a world apart

As now I'm back to the time
When I would search for a dream
But no use to try anymore as before
Someday I'll die, maybe then I'll be with you

So I'm closing my eyes
To hear the people laugh

For they're all aglow
Not knowing where to go

But is it asking too much
When the question is what to do
With the life I have?
It seems I know nothing now
Except my love for you
And with the strength in my hands
To go on feeding your smile
