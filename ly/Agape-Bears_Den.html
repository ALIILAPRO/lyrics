		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Agape
Please don't dissipate
I know that I have got it all wrong
I'm reaching out
To touch your voice
But baby, I'm clutching at straws
Even though
Your words hurt the most

I still wanna hear them, every day
You say let it go
But I can't let it go
I won't leave, every word that you say

For I'm so scared of losing you
And I don't know what I can do about it
About it
So tell me how long, love, before you go
And leave me here on my own
I know that I don't wanna know
Who I am without you

Oh agape
Please don't dissipate
Yeah I know I've got it all wrong
I'm reaching out
To touch your voice
But baby I'm clutching at straws

For I'm so scared of losing you
And I don't know what I can do about it
About it
So tell me how long, love, before you go
And leave me here on my own
I know that, I don't wanna know
Who I am without you

I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know
I don't wanna know

For I'm so scared of losing you
And I don't know what I can do about it
About it
So tell me how long, love, before you go
And leave me here on my own
I know that
I know that
Tell me how long, love, before you go
And leave me here on my own
I know that
I don't wanna know who I am without you
I don't wanna know who I am without you
