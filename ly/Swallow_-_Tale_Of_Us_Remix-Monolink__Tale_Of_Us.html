		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thought that I saw you in a bar
Sat in the corner
Just to watch you from afar
I lost your face and fell asleep
Into a dream of echoed voices from the deep
Ooh, you swallow me inside
Like the dark swallows the light
When I'm drowning in your sea
Ooh, the ocean that I've cried
Is running back into my eyes
For I'm not the one you need
Don't wanna leave
Don't wanna leave
Now I don't know where to go
I don't know where to go
Can you show me where to go?
Don't wanna leave
Now I don't know where to go
I don't know where to go
Can you show me where to go?
Don't wanna leave
Ooh, you swallow me inside
Like the dark swallows the light
When I'm drowning in your sea
Ooh, the ocean that I've cried
Is running back into my eyes
For I'm not the one you need
Thought that I saw you in a bar
Sat in the corner
Just to watch you from afar
