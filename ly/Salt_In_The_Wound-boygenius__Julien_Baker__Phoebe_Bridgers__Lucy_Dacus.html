		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You put salt in the wound
And a kiss on my cheek
You butter me up
And you sit down to eat
You add insult to injury
You say you believe in me
But you haven't decided
About taking or leaving me

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

Neck full of mockingbirds
All calling your name
I tried to sing it all back
Like I heard it, it don't sound the same
I'm gnashing my teeth
Like a child of Cain
If this is a prison I'm willing to burn my own chain

But you take and you take
Like silks up my sleeve
Tied corner to corner, never ending
Trick after trick, I make the magic
And you unrelentingly ask for the secret

They say the hearts and minds are on your side
They say the finish line is in your sights
What they don't say is what's on the other side
They say the hearts and minds are on your side
