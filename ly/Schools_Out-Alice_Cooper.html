		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, we got no choice
All the girls and boys
Makin' all that noise
'Cause they found new toys
Well, we can't salute you, can't find a flag
If that don't suit you, that's a drag

School's out for summer
School's out forever
School's been blown to pieces

No more pencils, no more books
No more teacher's dirty looks, yeah

Well, we got no class
And we got no principals
And we got no innocence
We can't even think of a word that rhymes

School's out for summer
School's out forever
My school's been blown to pieces

No more pencils, no more books
No more teacher's dirty looks
Out for summer
Out 'til fall
We might not come back at all

School's out forever
School's out for summer
School's out with fever
School's out completely
