		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can call me king of disappointment
Welcome to my castle, everything's worthless
Please, help yourself to whatever you want
Just get out while your souls still clean

I can't give up control
I'm the ruiner of my own kingdom
Save your silver and gold
I'll be up on this throne with my demons
Even if I could go
There's no way out inside
Of these broken halls
And there's chains on my door, no leaving
So I'll put on a show

You can call me king of disappointment
Welcome to my castle, everything's worthless
Please, help yourself to whatever you want
Just get out while your souls still clean

I get blood on my hands
When I'm thinkin' myself into trouble
'Til I'm stuck in a trance
Rippin' things off these walls
Like a psychopath
And there's no lookin' back
'Cause I know that nobody can tame me
Don't get caught in my wrath, pleading
When your hearts on the floor

You can call me king of disappointment
Welcome to my castle, everything's worthless
Please, help yourself to whatever you want
Just get out while your souls still clean

After everything I've done to me
I can't take it anymore this crown
After everything I've done to me
I can't take it anymore
After everything I've done to me
I can't take it anymore this crown
After everything I've done to me

Shiver echos
Mad echos
Saints echos

You can call me king of disappointment
Welcome to my castle, everything's worthless
Please, help yourself to whatever you want
Just get out while your souls still clean

You can call me king of disappointment
Welcome to my castle, everything's worthless
Please, help yourself to whatever you want
Just get out while your souls still clean
