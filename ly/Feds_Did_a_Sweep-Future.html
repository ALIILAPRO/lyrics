		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I lost so many niggas to the streets this year
Oh, no, no
I ain't even talkin' about, they ain't even dead
They ain't, they ain't dead
Feds did a sweep, Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up
Got a few of my niggas in the sweeps
Trill niggas linkin' up
Real niggas linkin' up
Shit ain't gonna be the same, man
Feds did a sweep
Free my niggas

Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up (real niggas)
Trill niggas linkin' up (trill)
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
I done start buyin' more Cubans
These links on me leavin' bruises
I don't fantasize, I make movies (movies)
I don't tell lies, I tote Uzis
I get idolized by these groupies
I treat 'em just like they're regular, yeah
They sneakin' pics on the cellular
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Them bands on me, more capital
I gotta go pour up some juice
For my dawgs just went Federal

Give your life for this gang gang shit (gang)
Pay a price for this gang gang shit (yeah)
You should wanna remain nameless
Tryna be Instagram famous
Knowin' damn well these streets painless
Gotta take ya time, ya gang gang (gang)
You don't wanna feel my pain
It's gon' drive you insane (Future)
I dread, I prevent it 'cause man I'm a menace
I know what I did, I'ma finish this
I got the code, I got the remedy
I'm doin' this for infinity
I ain't lookin' for no sympathy (nah)
Put a dollar sign on my enemies (woo)
You can't come between my embassy
You gotta stay off the premises (no)
I was down and out, and I remember this
It's gon' hurt my soul just to reminisce
Gotta understand what I represent
You know what I mean to the game

Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up (real niggas)
Trill niggas linkin' up (trill)
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
I done start buyin' more Cubans
These links on me leavin' bruises
I don't fantasize, I make movies (movies)
I don't tell lies, I tote Uzis
I get idolized by these groupies
I treat 'em just like they're regular, yeah
They sneakin' pics on the cellular
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Them bands on me, more capital
I gotta go pour up some juice
For my dawgs just went Federal

Police
We have a search warrant
Police 
Police search warrant
Get on the ground
Get on the ground, get on the ground
Get down on the ground

The Feds did a sweep (damn)
Picked the dogs up like an infant
Got thirteen bodies (what else?)
Got twenty-seven damn victims
Burned the eyes out a witness (what else?)
Put your hood on chitlins (what else?)
Cartiers, I got privilege (yeah)
See the way my dawgs livin' (yeah)
They always gotta dodge prison (dodge)
I was born dodgin' penitentiary
I bought my mom French Tiffanys (what else?)
Gang, gang, we a family
Hold it down for the family
You goin' viral for the family (that's right)
The homie tried to plead insanity
Pray to God, take this energy
Turn around the positivity
When you servin' for an activity
Better learn about the history (history)
I was touchin' work in elementary
Started cookin' work and skippin' chemistry
Then I started speakin' poetry
I just wish my dawg didn't ignore me
Told ya

Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up (real niggas)
Trill niggas linkin' up (trill)
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
I done start buyin' more Cubans
These links on me leavin' bruises
I don't fantasize, I make movies (movies)
I don't tell lies, I tote Uzis
I get idolized by these groupies
I treat 'em just like they're regular, yeah
They sneakin' pics on the cellular
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Them bands on me, more capital
I gotta go pour up some juice
For my dawgs just went Federal

Real niggas linkin' up
Trill niggas linkin' up
Feds did a sweep
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
