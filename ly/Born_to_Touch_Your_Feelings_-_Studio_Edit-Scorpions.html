		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling

Close your eyes and I'll try to get in
To waken your heart like the sping
'cause I was born to touch your feelings

Steal the time, take a song and be glad
Be free as the birds, don't be sad
Your time will come, I'll make you feel it
You're still young like the sun after rain
Follow the light it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings

You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right
You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right

You were born just to lose or to win
To be someone's chime in the wind
To live between your mind and feelings
Find your way, check it out
Learn each day
Follow the light, it's not in vain
And you will see I'll touch your feelings

You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right
You've got your songs
They are everyday for awhile
Just the only way to feel all right

I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
I was born from the sound of the strings
For someone to give everything
To be a song just for your feeling
