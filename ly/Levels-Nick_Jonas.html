		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Levels, levels, levels, levels

Get on my elevator, baby we're going up
Give me that now and later, I can't get enough
So much to discover, please don't stop me now (don't stop me)
Every time I touch you, you lift right off the ground

Let them go, all the one's tryna get in the door
I'ma go where they all couldn't go
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh

I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up

(Rooftop)

Aw yeah, just walking up on the ceiling, dancing up on the wall
You and that drug you're dealing, should be against the law
All this heat keep rising, make you stop, drop, and roll
I'm bottling up the lightning, supernatural

Let them go, all the one's tryna get in the door
I'ma go where they all couldn't go
Up a floor, up a floor, up a floor, oh

I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up

(Rooftop)

Levels, levels, levels, levels
Levels to your love
It can't reach us?
We're high-fiving Jesus
Yeah, yeah

And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
Yeah, there's levels to your love
And I know, we can get higher
There's levels to your love
And I keep on climbing up

(Take them to the rooftop)
Oh, levels
There's levels to your love, yeah, yeah (levels, levels, levels, levels)
Levels, levels, levels, levels
Oh, oh, yeah, get on my level
There's levels to your love and I keep on climbing up
Levels
