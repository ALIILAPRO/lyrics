		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know I do this every time
I walk the line, I play with fire
And I stop myself before the crime
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire

I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way

But if you're looking for stable, that'll be never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me
(I play with fire)

Dry your tears, now don't you cry
I'm by your side at least for a while
I know I do this every time
I walk the line, yeah, I play with fire

I don't wanna push you way too much
I don't wanna lean that way too far
I don't wanna ever learn the hard way, no
I don't wanna keep you in the dark
I don't wanna gamble with your heart
I don't wanna ever leave you lonely

But if you're looking for stable, that'll be never be me
If you're looking for faithful, that'll never be me
If you're looking for someone to be all that you need
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me
(I play with fire)

Can't get too close to the sun (fire)
Baby, you're the only, oh I
I'd never lie to you, baby, oh
You give me a reason to run from the fire
'Cause baby, you're the only one
Oh, I swear I'd never lie

If you're looking for stable, that'll be never be me
But I hope that I'm able to be all that you need
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me, no
If you think that I'm someone to give up and leave
That'll never be me
(Hard as I try)
That'll never be me, no
(I play with fire)
That'll never be me
