		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Losing the stars without a sky
Losing the reasons why
You're losing the calling that you've been faking
Yeah, I'm not kidding

It's damned if you don't and it's damned if you do
Be true, 'cause they'll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo
Oh, hidy-hidy-hiding, whatcha trying to prove?
Hidy-hide
You're not worth a thing

Sew your fortunes on a string
Blue smoke will take a very violent flight
You will be changed and everything
And you will be in a very sad, sad zoo

I once (once) was lost (was lost)
But now (now) I'm found (I'm found)
Was blind (blind), but now I see you
How selfish of you
To believe in all the meaning
all, all the bad dreaming all

Metal heart, you're not hiding
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing
Metal heart, you're not hiding
Metal heart, you're not worth a thing

You're not worth a thing
You're not worth a thing
You're not worth a thing
You're not worth a thing

Tell me what you feel
Tell me what you feel
Tell me what you feel
You don't know how you feel
