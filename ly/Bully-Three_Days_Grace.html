		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He wakes up haunted
With voices in his head
Nobody knows it
But today he won't go unnoticed
He can't forget
Can't forgive for what they said
He's never been so hurt
But today the screaming is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Maybe he needed to be wanted

She takes the long way home
Fighting her emotions
She's a loner
But today she won't go unnoticed
If she can't remember
When she loses her temper
Nobody knows her
But tonight the silence is over

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed

Blame the family
Blame the bully
Blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted
Wanted
