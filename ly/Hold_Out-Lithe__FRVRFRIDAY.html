		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shorty down when it's turnt
Wanna need me now
Tell my mama all the time on the tv now
Fuck around stay live if she see me now
This shit kinda getting kinda tedious
I been in it for some time gon' knees deep yeah
So my shorty FaceTime
Can you see me now

Girl I'm in your ci-ci-ci-city
Know you heard about it let me get it OT
And you know I'm holding out for the G63
Say she wanna Louis and the VV 
Riding around the ci-ci-ci-city
Know your heard about it let me get it OT
And you know I'm holding out for the G63

All the greed and the lies
Heard you wanna piece of the pie
All that shit is bleeding me dry
I don't want your piece and advice

Hold it down for me, huh
Niggas act like bitches all the time, these days
I ain't even gonna lie don't let me down (please wait)
I been throwing hundreds on a dime
Spent 7 on that ring, no wedding vow

All that smoke it make me tired
Twin 22's, I call it Tyra and Mariah
Talk about my lows and all my highs
Been tryna see the light but shit is quiet

All the greed and the lies
Heard you wanna piece of the pie
All that shit is bleeding me dry
I don't want your piece and advice

Girl I'm in your ci-ci-ci-city
Know you heard about it let me get it OT
And you know I'm holding out for the G63
Say she wanna Louis and the VV 

Riding around the ci-ci-ci-city
Know your heard about it let me get it OT
And you know I'm holding out for the G63
