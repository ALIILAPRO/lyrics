		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This speech is my recital, I think it's very vital
To rock (a rhyme), that's right (on time)
It's Tricky is the title, here we go

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, it's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, t-t-tricky, tricky, tricky

I met this little girlie, her hair was kinda curly
Went to her house and bust her out, I had to leave real early
These girls are really sleazy, all they just say is please me
Or spend some time and rock a rhyme, I said "It's not that easy"

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky (how is it D?) It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky

In New York the people talk and try to make us rhyme
They really (hawk) but we just (walk) because we have no time
And in the city it's a pity 'cause we just can't hide
Tinted windows don't mean nothin', they know who's inside

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky (how is it D?) Tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky huh

When I wake up, people take up mostly all of my time
I'm not singin', phone keep ringin' 'cause I make up a rhyme
I'm not braggin', people naggin' 'cause they think I'm a star
Always tearin' what I'm wearin', I think they're goin' too far
A girl named Carol follows Daryll every gig we play
Then D dissed her and dismissed her, now she's jockin' Jay
I ain't lyin', girls be cryin' 'cause I'm on TV
They even bother my poor father 'cause he's down with me

It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky (how is it?) tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky
It's tricky to rock a rhyme, to rock a rhyme that's right on time
It's tricky, t-t-t-t-tricky, t-t-tricky, tr

We are not thugs (we don't use drugs) but you assume (on your own)
They offer coke (and lots of dope) but we just leave it alone
It's like that y'all (y'all), but we don't quit
You keep on, rock, shock 'cause this is it
