		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are the flame in my heart
You light my way in the dark
You are the ultimate star
You pick me from up above
Your unconditional love
Takes me to paradise

I belong to you
And you
You belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet

You make me feel so divine
Your soul and mind are entwined
Before you, I was blind
But since I've opened my eyes
And with you there's no disguise
So I could open up my mind
I always loved you from the start
But I could not figure out
That I had to do it everyday
So I put away the fight
Now I'm gonna live my life
Giving you the most in every way

Oh, I belong to you
And you (and you)
You belong to me too
You make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet
Oh, I belong to you (I belong to you)
And you (you)
You belong to me too
Oh, you make my life complete
You make me feel so sweet

I belong to you (I belong to you)
And you (and you)
You belong to me too
You make my life complete (you make my life complete)
You make me feel so sweet (you make me feel so sweet)
Oh, I belong to you (I belong to you)
And you (and you)
You belong to me too
You make my life complete (you make my life complete)
You make me feel so sweet (you make me feel so sweet)
