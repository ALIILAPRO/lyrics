		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been trying for so long
To sing you the right song
To show you something different every day
So you hear what I have to say
Like puzzle pieces
And now we're here at a standstill
I wonder if you feel
The kind of pain that rips your insides out
That's something I know all about
Shocking, ain't it?
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you

I can feel my heart breaking
Mistakes I've been making
I'm running out of patience to pretend
This isn't how I'll let it end
My feigning fading
You've been mourning your loss here
And that's grinding my gears
How can a human lose their self control
There's nothing left to make you whole
I'm done explaining
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you

Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you
This is what happens when you leave it to someone else
If you want it done right you should just do it yourself
You oversaturate your world with nothing but machines
You might make everyone happy but you're dead inside, just like me
And now we're here at a standstill
I wonder if you feel
The kind of pain that rips your insides out
That's something I know all about
Shocking, ain't it?
We have a lot more in common
Than you would be calm with
It's like we're the same person, me and you
We both don't know we can do
Is it because I can't be her?
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you

Is it because I can't be her?
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her
Made your mistakes and make me hurt
I can't fix you
Is it because I can't be her
Made me awake and make me hurt
I can't fix you
