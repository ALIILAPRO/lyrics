		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh, hey
Ooh, ooh, oh
Ooh, ooh, hey
Ooh, ooh, oh

Yeah, you ever make it up to the gate?
And if you did, I wonder is it a beautiful place?
Did He put his arms around you, make you feel like you're safe?
Did He grab you by the hand and say that things are okay?

I gotta know mama, did He show you some grace?
Give you a pass and tell you He would carry the weight?
Do you smile more, wonder what it's like when you pray?
Is He standing in front of you, so you can look at His face?

When you talk to Him does he talk back? (Ooh-ooh)
You ever have conversations about what you regret?
Or did it all go away once you got there?
Does each breath take you closer to God, would you say that you cry less?

Do you feel at peace yet?
Do you laugh more?
You feel like heaven is everything you could ask for?
I ever make it up there when I see you I hope you're
Smiling 'cause you deserve it, pray to God that you found joy, and always know that

You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more
I hope you're up there looking down on us with a smile on your face
You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more
I hope you're up there with God, feelin' loved and set free from your pain

I look at the situation you had
Might of made the mistake of leavin', but it's makin' me sad
Thinkin' of you how you grew up, tryin' to cope with your past
Were you like me in your relationships and pushed away dad? I gotta know, mama

Did you think you were trash?
Somethin' disposable that nobody could love or be glad?
To say they was with you, that issue is a issue I have
That's why it hurt me when Brittani gave me those letters you sent, I barely read

Any of one of 'em knowing I'd let them go to my head
And get to me especially when I feel I related
Might not be around for my babies
But know when I say that I love you, that I mean it, okay, 'cause

Nobody's perfect, yeah, I guess we all fall short
And I can't hold this unforgiveness in my heart no more
So just know you're lovable to me and of course
You'll always be mama to us, so save a table for four, and know that

You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more
I hope you're up there looking down on us with a smile on your face
You don't gotta cry, you don't gotta cry no more
I hope you're up there with God, feelin' loved and set free from your pain
Mama

You don't gotta cry, no

Yeah, I'm grown now, took me a while to see the bigger picture
'Cause if you were here today and I was talkin' with ya
There'd be a lot of tears of joy falling on my sweatshirt
Prolly followed by some apologies and mom I missed ya, yeah

I pray you see me down here lookin' up
Still got a lot of things that I need healing from
But I'll get there eventually, so don't you worry none
I just hope you finally got some peace and you feel happy mom, I love you
