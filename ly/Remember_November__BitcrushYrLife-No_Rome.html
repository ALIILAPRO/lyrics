		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember you told me they can take all your money
If you do enough talking, you might end up with nothing
They won't say sorry, you work 'til the morning
The concept of loving takes off to the moon

I remember you told me they can take all your money
If you do enough talking, you might end up with nothing
They won't say sorry, you work 'til the morning
The concept of loving takes off to the moon

Maybe I should take it slow
Leave it as the way it goes
You do way too much snow
I might step on yo toes
Maybe that's the way it goes?
Stupid tool, no one knows
Maybe I should take it, ugh
Maybe I should take it slow
I really hate you though
Leave your bag on the floor
Put your fists up and go
Say some shit, maybe I'll blow out up nose
Bitch, maybe that's the way it goes
Maybe that's the way it goes
Maybe I should take it slow?
No bitch, maybe that's the way it goes

I remember you told me they can take all your money
If you do enough talking, you might end up with nothing
They won't say sorry, you work 'til the morning
The concept of loving takes off to the moon
