		  ""Can I blame it on you? I just can't win I just can't win  Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds Can't seem to find a good excuse this time for me and for this to fall apart Shall I blame it on myself or this routine that I've been stuck in?  I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine But it's holding so fucking tight  I just can't handle another day of this I just can't win I just can't win  Get me out alive  Oh God I mean it These are violent days for you and me I just can't handle another day of this routine I just can't win I just can't win Get me out alive  Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds I've found my excuse this time Your words are wearing me down A constant frown upon my back  I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine But it's holding so fucking tight I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine But it's holding so fucking tight  So fucking tight  Follow the water Drain the lake to bring it back to me Follow the water Drain the lake to bring it back to me Follow the water Drain the lake to bring it back to me Follow the water Drain the lake to bring it back to me""
