		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me, anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hm

A couple days no talking, I seen my baby
And this what she tells me

She said
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
And nothing helps
I can't stop missing you, yeah

It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escapin'
It makes me feel a bit complete, yeah
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete, hm

A couple weeks no talking, I seen my baby
I've missed you so damn much, hey
I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me, she said

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
And nothing helps
I can't stop missing you, yeah

'Cause I'm in the magazines
On the T-V
No matter where you are you might hear me
I'm in the magazines
On the T-V
No matter where you go you might see me

Uh, I'm Yeezy
She said "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you an angel, you wave hi to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea
They built a new arena
Why don't you come watch a nigga tear the whole scene up?
I know I've seen you before
But don't know where I've seen ya
Oh, I remember now
It's something I that I dreamed of
Don C said she cool
But don't let her fuck ya cream up
Monica Lewinsky on ya dress, take ya to the cleaners
Sure enough a week later I'm in extra love
And everybody know she mine so she extra plug
Every bouncer every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to an end-a
She let it go to her head, no, not my Aria
The height of her shopping was writers blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you
Nothing helps
I can't stop missing you, yeah
