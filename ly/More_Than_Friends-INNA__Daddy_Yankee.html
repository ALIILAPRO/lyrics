		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  DY, yo Inna baby
Come, arriba, let's go now!

Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, (Yeah) tonight we should be more than friends (Hey hey)

We're in the corner of the crowded room
I want your lips, your body, boy how soon?
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night
This might just be the night of you and I,
If there is no distance, ain't no hearts in that,
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.

Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.

Ain't looking for someone to call my own,
But with you boy we're in danger zone,
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.
So here we are, I just dream of you
And all the things that I'm about to do to you,
And if you like what we doin' why don't we give in for the night.

Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends.

She rings my bell, and they rush the floor
You mighta think that's cool zaw
Everybody in the club was hot 'til I showed my watch, and they cooled out
Caliente! Frío! Que eso que tu tiene mío
Caliente! Frío! Que eso que tu tiene,
It's forever, (forever)
You could be mine, it's whatever (whatever)
Whatever you like, it's forever (forever)
You could be mine
And I'm needing you right now
Baby come and hold me down ow
Caliente! Frío! Que eso que tu tiene mío.

Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight, tonight we should be more than friends

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes,
I've been thinking about you for all of this time,
Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends

(Yeah) Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
(Yeah) Whoa tonight, tonight we could be more than friends
