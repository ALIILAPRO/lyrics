		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmm, yeah

Couldn't understand
We know, we know
We don't wanna have to leave again
I'm working with the upper hand (mmm)
Tried to get you out my head
Someone told me you was out for me

Had some trouble on my ends
Way before
I knew a thing about your friends
And how they just be saying things, day to day
Fast forward
I'm back in town for one night (one night)

And I know
Things will never work the same (never)
Drugs don't take the pain
And you know
I could never love again (no)
Shit had me in a trance
And truth is
We both need romance (we)
Look into my soul for revenge
Tried to not fall in love
Why you gotta make it hard to let me go?

Truth is that I never try
Emotions been running me dry (running me dry)
You made it hard to reply (you made it hard)
You made it hard overtime (you make it hard, oh)
Say that you felt the neglect
'Cause I never dress to impress
Way to pretentious
Love is expensive and I wonder why (and I wonder why)

I been loaded up for days
I, I been trying to find a way (I been trying to find a way)
Could've made the same mistakes
I'ma, hold it down and remain the same
I been loaded up for days
I, I been trying to fight the pain (oh)
Could've made the same mistakes
I'ma, hold it down and remain the same (yeah)
