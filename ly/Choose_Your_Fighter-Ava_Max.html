		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can be a lover or a fighter, whatever you desire
Life is like a runway and you're the designer
Wings of a butterfly, eyes of a tiger
Whatever you want, baby, choose your fighter

I know this world can be a little
Confusing, no walk in the park
But I can help you solve the riddle
You're perfect as you are

If you wanna break out of the box
Wanna call all of the shots
If you wanna be sweet or be soft
Then go off
If you wanna go six inch or flat
Wanna wear hot pink or black
Don't let nobody tell you you can't
'Cause you can

You can be a lover or a fighter, whatever you desire
Life is like a runway and you're the designer
Wings of a butterfly, eyes of a tiger
Whatever you want, baby, choose your fighter

Choose your fighter
Choose your fighter

A pretty knight in shining diamonds
A beauty queen in camouflage
It's giving thunder and lightning
When you give it all you got

If you wanna break out of the box
Wanna call all of the shots
If you wanna be sweet or be soft
Then go off (oh)
If you wanna go six inch or flat
Wanna wear hot pink or black
Don't let nobody tell you you can't
'Cause you can

You can be a lover or a fighter, whatever you desire
Life is like a runway and you're the designer
Wings of a butterfly, eyes of a tiger (oh)
Whatever you want, baby, choose your fighter

(Whoa, whoa)
Choose your fighter
(Oh)
Choose your fighter

Wings of a butterfly, eyes of a tiger
Whatever you want, baby, choose your fighter
