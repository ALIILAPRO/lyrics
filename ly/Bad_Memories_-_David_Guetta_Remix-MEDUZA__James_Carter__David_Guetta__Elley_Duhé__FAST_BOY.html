		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "One more drink," she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
We know there's no turning back now
We love to make bad memories

"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight, we make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
We know there's no turning back now
We love to make bad memories

"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said

I think I'm losing my head now (now, now)
I think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Losing my head now, my head now
Think I'm losing my head now, losing my head now
Again and again

"One more drink," he said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight, we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," he said
And baby, you got me trippin'
We're face to face
'Bout to do it again, again
Again and again

About to do it again, again
Again and again

"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losing my head now (now, now, now)
I think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Losing my head now, my head now
I think I'm losing my head now, my head now
Again and again

"One more drink," she said
I think I'm losing my head now
Tonight we'll make bad memories
"One more drink," she said
We know there's no turning back now
We love to make bad memories
