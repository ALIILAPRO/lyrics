		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I need is five minutes
If you can see the signs
All I need is five minutes
If you read between the lines
One for the eyes and
One for the voices
One for the touch, one for the soft grin

And then the kisses
And then the kisses

All I need is five minutes
All I need is five minutes
All I need is five minutes
All I need is five minutes

All I need is five minutes
Start the ignition
All I need is your look
To hang my imagination
All I need is your view
To picture your position
We could get away
Ride horses
Sail along the bay, drink from the sources

And then the kisses
Following courses
And again the kisses
Following courses

Like a butterfly effect
One hit of a cigarette
Mistakes you don't regret
All I need is five minutes
Like a drug's side effects
Like a ride on a rocket
The love you don't suspect
All I need is five minutes

All I need is five minutes
All I need is five minutes

Like a butterfly effect
One hit of a cigarette
Mistakes you don't regret
All I need five minutes
Like a drug's side effects
Like a ride on a rocket
The love you don't suspect
All I need is five minutes
All I need is five minutes
All I need is five minutes

(All I need is five minutes)
