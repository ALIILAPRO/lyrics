		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was just a wandering soul
Working through the highs and lows
I heard a spirit whisper slow
Drift into a great unknown
Will anybody see my ghost?

Ooh-ooh-ooh
I can see the light
Ooh-ooh-ooh
So let me off at the end of the night
'Cause all my friends are giving up
And I've had enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me

I began to hear my name
My silence in a hurricane
The dust was leaving from my veins
Like some forgotten border train
Carried to my home again

Ooh-ooh-ooh
I can see the light
Ooh-ooh-ooh
So let me off at the end of the night
'Cause all my friends are giving up
And I've had enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me

I wade in darkness
But I can feel you calling, I hear you calling
As I shut my wanting eyes
I said I'd love you 'til I die

I can see the light
Ooh-ooh-ooh
So let me off at the end of the night
'Cause all my friends are giving up
And I've had enough
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I can feel the weight of a thousand eyes on me
