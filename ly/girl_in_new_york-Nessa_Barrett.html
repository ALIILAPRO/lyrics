		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bags in your hand as you kiss me
Tellin' me you're gonna miss me
Promise you'll be on your best behavior
Give me your flight information
Call when you land, say you made it
Sweet little me told you, "Go have a good time"

I didn't mean forget about me
Ridin' in a yellow taxi
Who the hell are you on your way to?

You said I was yours
Maybe just on the West Coast
'Cause as soon as you left home
You got wanderin' eyes
So I guess you lied
When you said I was special
You're not as smart as you think you are
Baby, I know about the girl in New York

Who the hell is she
Taking you from me
Baby, I know about the girl in New York

I know there's always temptation
Guess I'm a little more patient
Baby, I've been on my best behavior
Fuck you for makin' me crazy
While you buy her drinks out on 8th Street
Sweet little you showin' her such a good time

You easily forget about me
Ridin' in a yellow taxi
Back to your hotel, and she's comin' with you

You said I was yours
Maybe just on the West Coast
'Cause as soon as you left home
You got wanderin' eyes
So I guess you lied
When you said I was special
You're not as smart as you think you are
Baby, I know about the girl in New York

Who the hell is she
Takin' you from me
Baby, I know about the girl in New York

Who the hell is she
Takin' you from me
Baby, I know about the girl in New York
