		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

I wanna get into motion, a better devotion
So I can make it through the night
So the music is playin', you know what I'm saying
Now everything will be alright

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

Ola, ola, eh 
Ola, ola, eh
Ola, ola, eh 
Ola, ola, eh

Rhythm is a creation, a better sensation
That will lead you through the night
When your body is movin', the music is groovin'
I want to take you home tonight

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

Ola, ola, eh 
Ola, ola, eh
Ola, ola, eh 
Ola, ola, eh

Keep dancin' hard, give this groove more feeling
Dance, trance, dance, more dealing
In, out, up, down, all around
On the dancefloor gettin' down
Take time just to show and prove
We can make your body move
Totally, yes, the party starter
Sweet dreams keep comin' harder

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

Sweet dreams of rhythm and dancing
Sweet dreams of passion through the night
Sweet dreams are taking over
Sweet dreams of dancing through the night

Ola, ola, eh 
Ola, ola, eh
Ola, ola, eh 
Ola, ola, eh
Ola, ola, eh
