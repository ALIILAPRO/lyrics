		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

I bet you don't kiss her with your eyes closed
I bet you're still walking on a tightrope
Miss me so much, you've been goin' psycho
You ain't gotta say it, baby, I know (I know, I know, I know)

It's a thin line between all this love and hate
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate

And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

Hate me, hate me, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how I'm trash and you could easily replace me
Tell me that I'm strung out, wasted on the daily
Prolly 'cause there's no one around me numbin' all my pain
Prolly 'cause there's no umbrella to shield me from all the rain
Probably because you're the one playin' the mind games
You hate me because I don't let you play no mind games
They give me migraines and damage my brain
Date me, break me, easily replace me
Hopefully you see it clear, hopefully it's HD
Bet you wonder why the last few months I've been spacey
In your head, I sing

And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

It's a thin line between all this love and hate (okay)
And if you switch sides, you're gon' have to claim your place (okay)
So baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate (okay)
Yeah baby, this time you're gon' have to seal your fate

And tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
Tell me how you hate me, hate me, still tryna replace me
Chase me, chase me, tell me how you hate me
Erase me, 'rase me, wish you never dated me
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me

(Tell me how you hate me)
(Lies, tell me lies) tell me how you hate me
(Tell me how you hate me)
Lies, tell me lies, baby, tell me how you hate me
