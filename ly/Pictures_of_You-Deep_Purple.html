		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I’m pickin’ up a new vibe
It’s nothing too much
Antenna says I may be losing my touch
I’m hanging round a bee-hive
Feeling the buzz
It’s hard to explain let’s say it’s simply because
I like the rough
Much more than these smooth…

…Pictures of you
They’re too good to be true
So I’m trusting my eyes again
These cameras never lie

Giving up a day job
Working at night
You’re looking so fine in that cool amber light
You’re running with a new mob
Working the crowd
The final result? Oh should make you proud

Forgive me asking, I can’t help saying
But what you got there, the price you’re paying
In the light of day, what do I see
For what it’s worth, seems no better to me

These pictures of you
Are too good to be true
I’m using my eyes again
These cameras never lie

You got it, you’re down and dirty
You’re made for pleasure
The frame is frozen, you watch the birdie
You’re made to measure
Aaah, look at you now
Ooh, stand out in a crowd
The real you showing up on your face
Your hair is blowing all over the place
