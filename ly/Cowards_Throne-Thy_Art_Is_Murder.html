		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We are the plague of rotting flesh
The dead that roam this earth
Servants to the shadows left to feed on carcass
Soul tormentors, leaching life from the clean
Diseases spreading, chaos, fear, hate for all to feel
Together we rise to take down this god of yours
And darkness will reign over all
Stand forth!
Where is this one you call god?!
An adversary in a coward's
Throne, a message from my master, the time is now
Feel the fire from within
The blood is boiling

Watch their soul destruct
I tear it from their fucking corpses
We are the demon, hunting, killing, slaying, raping god's slaves
Their blood will fill the rivers
An epic tide of Satan's rage, stand forth you coward!
A so called "saviour", save your world or watch it burn
Through the darkness, arise the servants of Christ
Pray this is the end of their days, their lives bound by a book of lies
How can you judge what does not die?
The fires of holocaust will burn for eternity
Upon them is the hour of slaughter
A message from my master, life must not go on
A message from your master, save yourself
A message from my master, obliterate mankind
A message from your master, I've failed you all
This is the end of days
Now watch it burn
