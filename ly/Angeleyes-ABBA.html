		  Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha, keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
Keep thinking, ah

Last night I was taking a walk along the river
And I saw him together with a young girl
And the look that he gave her made me shiver
'Cause he always used to look at me that way
And I thought maybe I should walk right up to her and say
Ah ha ha, it's a game he likes to play

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
And one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh no no no no

Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha, keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
I keep thinking, ah

Sometimes when I'm lonely I sit and think about him
And it hurts to remember all the good times
When I thought I could never live without him
And I wonder does it have to be the same
Every time when I see him, will it bring back all the pain?
Ah ha ha, how can I forget that name?

Look into his angel eyes
One look and you're hypnotized
He'll take your heart and you must pay the price
Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into his angel eyes
Crazy 'bout his angel eyes
Angel eyes
He took my heart and now I pay the price

Look into his angel eyes
You'll think you're in paradise
Then one day you'll find out he wears a disguise
Don't look too deep into those angel eyes
Oh no no no no

Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Ah ha ha, keep thinking, ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Keep thinking 'bout his angel eyes
Ah ha ha, I keep thinking, ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Ah ha ha, I keep thinking, ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Keep thinking, 'bout his angel eyes
Ah ha ha, keep thinking, Ah ha ha, ha ha ha
Keep thinking, had to pay the price
Ah ha ha, Keep thinking
