		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit armageddon, oh yeah
Let’s go hide in the phantom, oh yeah
We can lie there forever, all year
We could die there together, oh yeah
Cause we started together, oh yeah
‘Fore we got it together, oh yeah
While you clouded the weather, oh yeah
Got this shit in my real life, how the fuck is it-
Shit armageddon, oh yeah
Let’s go hide in the phantom, oh yeah
We can lie there forever, all year
We could die there together, oh yeah
Cause we started together, oh yeah
Got this shit in my real life, how the fuck is it real life
How the fuck is it real life
How the fuck is it real life

Down, down hawk down, down
Hawk you down, down
Hawk down, down
Hawk down, down
Hawk down, down
Hawk you down, down
Hawk down

Can’t be sitting on hands and telling me shit
At this rate I’ll never be rich
I give too much, my energy shift
Can’t get good as my melody bitch
Can’t get mad as my enemy get
And if my line get hit then
I’m outside till the vibe get fixed
Being outside put the mind at risk
I’m staying out there, making my share
Think about death while I play in your hair
Don’t be scared, just be aware
Pulled both ways and it’s making me tear
Making me throw it
Looking like pops way I’m beatin’ these boys
Don’t get coy, my life like yours
I been up weeks tryna kick in these doors
Never need force

Down, down hawk down, down
Hawk you down, down
Hawk down, down
Hawk down, down
Hawk down, down
Hawk you down, down
Hawk down

Can’t catch me sitting on land
The shit y’all like ain’t making me amped
That shit y’all play not making me dance
This beef not making me bands
Let ‘em rot, I ain’t taking no chance
Good work though, no shake in these grams
Look right through ‘em when I’m shaking these hands
Making my dollars
Motaraps, name go hard like Giannis
Hold him back, if you let him go he a goner
Smelling like top shelf, marijuana
Last night we done had the block on sauna
22 black cars like Obama
She a bad bitch, she don’t like McDonalds
Smoking on cat piss, driving through tunnels
Doing that shit always keep me humble
I been goin bat shit waiting on drama
Doing drugs to avoid my trauma
New opp pack kicking like E Honda
Ass fat, and she could fight like Ronda
Head bowed, make a wish like Wanda

Got this shit in my real life, how the fuck is it real life?
How the fuck is it real life?
How the fuck is it real life?
Real life
Real life
