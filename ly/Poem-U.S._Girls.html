		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We all know what's right
We didn't get it from a book or a site
We know it in our bones
All blood flows the same
So why did we end up this way?

While you're looking at your phone
They snuck it in the room
Planted it and then it bloomed
And look was all you could do

In a poem unlimited we stay
And on a lawless night, lawless night, we wait
Holding our breath, we wait

No one needs to make a profit
No one needs to get paid
If we all agree we don't have to live that way
But to this day we choose the hard way
(No one needs to make a profit)
(No one needs to get paid)
(No one needs to make a profit)
(No one needs to get paid)
(No one needs to make a profit)
(No one needs to get paid)
(No one needs to make a profit)
(No one needs to get paid)
(No one needs to make a profit)
(No one needs to get paid)
(No one needs to make a profit)
(No one needs to get paid)
But to this day we choose the hard way

We all know what's right
We didn't get it from a book or a site
We know it in our bones
All blood flows the same
So what are we gonna do to change?
What are we gonna do to change?
