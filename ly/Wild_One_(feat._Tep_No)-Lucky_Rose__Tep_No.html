		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh it's a wild, wild over here
Everything is coming clear
Everyone gets lost into the day
Oh we get wild, wild over here
Don't want you to know or hear
What I do not hang out on the bay

Oh, my love
It's a wild, wild, road
Road wherever we go
Oh, my love
It's a wild, wild, road
Road, wherever we go
And no, sweet love
She's a wild, wild one
Got me losing all control

Oh, she's a wild one over here
When she comes I'm coming clear
Everything gets lost when I'm away
Oh we get wild, wild in the dark
I don't want you know who the fuck I'm doing again

And no, my love
It's a wild, wild, road
Road wherever we go
Oh, my love
It's a wild, wild, road
Road wherever we go
And no, sweet love
She's a wild, wild one
Got me losing all control

She's a wild
She's a wild, one
Oh she's a wild one over here
She's a wild, one
Oh, she's a wild one over here
She's a wild
Oh she's a wild one

And no, my love
It's a wild, wild, road
Road wherever we go

And no, sweet love
She's a wild, wild one
Got me losing all control
Oh, my love
It's a wild, wild, road
Road wherever we go

And no, oh oh oh oh oh
