		  Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking, not coming
These hoes not fucking not coming
Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking, not coming
Pull up and we drumming
Pull up and we drumming
Pull up and we stunting
Pull up and we stunting
Bitches not fucking, not coming
Yeah, bitches not fucking not cumming
Yeah, bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking, not coming

All the hoes that you calling not coming
She know if she not fucking, she truckin'
All of the bitches I fuck are not common
Guaranteed if I fuck her she cumming
If I'm in the room please don't come I beat the pussy like it need production
All she want from me is reproduction
Gotta ask "why'd she leave her husband?"
Heard he called up yelling, tweaking, fussing
Talkin' 'bout "it's gon' be repercussions!"
I remember last, last nigga, nigga tried to run up
Got like three concussions
Do you know what you in for?
They copy copy like 10-4
Keep the money 'cause I been poor
All your jewelry like tinfoil
Please don't tell your friends where we shopping at
I swear this shit gon' turn into an in-store (straight up)
Fuck you need another man for, talking to her like a mentor
Talking to her like a nigga Yoda and she say "I love you"
I'm like "hold up, hold up, hold up hold up, hold up, hold up" Hit her, hit her with the
Back up, back up, coldest shoulder

Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking not coming
Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking, not coming
Pull up and we drumming
Pull up and we drumming
Pull up and we stunting
Pull up and we stunting
Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking, not coming

Now every time we in this bitch, you acting like you owe me favors
Acting like you with the shits, but fronting on the homies later
Look, I could tell you're under pressure
Baby time to ease up
Young and living single, like your room was Khadijah's
My apologies, why I gotta be misogynistic every time we kick it
Every time I visit something's different and every time I leave you know you miss it
Don't be crying on my shoulder every time I'm coming over
Talking 'bout a popcorn and soda, Netflix and chill
When you home alone with no Macaulay Culkin
Sex game had her going crazy, now I gotta ask, calling all the time
And I wish I never met her, Carl Thom'
Driving down my street like it's the Autobahn
Getting loud, setting off the car alarms
Here put on my chain, baby you need to chill
Give it some time, baby, let it rebuild
Quit running your nose through the Beverly Hills

Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking not coming
Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking, not coming
Pull up and we drumming
Pull up and we drumming
Pull up and we stunting
Pull up and we stunting
Bitches not fucking, not coming
Bitches not fucking not cumming
Bitches not fucking not coming
These hoes not fucking, not coming
