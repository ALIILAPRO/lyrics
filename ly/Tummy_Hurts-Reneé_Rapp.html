		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe I should try religion
'Cause Jesus, you're hard to rely on
I never find you in the kitchen
You couldn't even pay rent for three months
Oh, I heard you, I get it, you're broke
But oh, you always had money to smoke, though

Now my tummy hurts, he's in love with her
But for what it's worth
They'd make beautiful babies
And raise 'em up to be a couple of
Fucking monsters, like their mother and their father
Eventually, 2043
Someone's gonna hurt their little girl like their daddy hurt me

I just want some recognition for having good tits and a big heart
I can't believe I let you hit it
In hindsight, that might be the worst part
Oh, I taught you everything you know
But oh, I guess boys, they come and they go

Now my tummy hurts, he's in love with her
But for what it's worth
They'd make beautiful babies
And raise 'em up to be a couple of
Fucking monsters, like their mother and their father
Eventually, 2043
Someone's gonna hurt their little girl like their daddy hurt me

Mm, like their daddy hurt me
Like their daddy hurt me
Like their daddy hurt me
Like their daddy hurt me

Now my tummy hurts, he's in love with her
But for what it's worth
He's her problem now
Baby, and she'll stay with him
'Cause she made with him a couple monsters
Like their mother and their father
Yeah, eventually, 2043
Someone's gonna hurt your little girl like you hurt me
