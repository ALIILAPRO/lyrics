		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can't quit until you try
You can't live until you die
You can't learn to tell the truth until you learn to lie

Can't breathe until you choke
You gotta laugh when you're the joke
There's nothing like a funeral to make you feel alive

Just open your eyes
Just open your eyes and see that life is beautiful
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?

I know some things that you don't
I've done things that you won't
There's nothing like a trail of blood to find your way back home

I was waiting for my hearse
What came next was so much worse
It took a funeral to make me feel alive

Just open your eyes
Just open your eyes and see that life is beautiful.
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?

Alive
Just open your eyes
Just open your eyes and see that life is beautiful
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?

Just open your eyes
Just open your eyes and see that life is beautiful
Will you swear on your life
That no one will cry at my funeral?
