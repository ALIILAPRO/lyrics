		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll start with goodbye
No, this won't take long
Just hear me out
Then I'll be gone

I lied, no I'm not that strong
So while I have not been alone
I have a lonely soul

Despair, yes that's a coat I've worn
But when closeness gave me comfort
The warmth became a burn

And the best of all the years have gone
I fear the worst if they go on
Left collecting thoughts inside my mind

Life, the notion's flawed
A futile cause
Abandoned need
No, it won't take long
Now I'm gone
Forget me
 
I have no regrets
I just thought you should know
That life has sometimes been kind
But I fought the wars as well

I tried, I've gone as far as I can go
Now that the pain is so loud 
It's closer to a scream than a call

So, goodnight
Now the truth is told
I don't have the spirit to be alive
I'll be better off a soul 

Cos the best of all the years have gone
I fear the worst if they go on
Left collecting thoughts inside my mind

Life, the notion's flawed
And a futile cause
Abandoned need
No, it won't take long
Now I'm gone
Forget me
