		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just like rolling a stone up a hill in Hades
You want to lie with me, you're going to be a liar
Hell-flavored, I've got mood poisoning
It must be something that I hate
I'm just a prison of property
Buckets full of better misery
There's not a word for what I want to do to you
There's not a word for what I want to do to you
(There's not a word for what I want to do to you)
(There's not a word for what I want to do to you)

[Chorus:]
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh

Murder-cute happy-rape
Murder-cute happy, happy, happy-rape
Killer
Murder-cute happy-rape
Murder-cute happy, happy, happy-rape
Killer

I shot your face, but it was as cold as ice
Okay, I'm not his killer
I shot your face, but it was as cold as ice
Okay, I'm not his killer, killer, killer

[Chorus]

One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three
One, two, three

(If you get in bed, someone will fall in love
You and me and the devil makes three)

You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
There's not a word for what the devil makes me
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh
You and me and the devil makes three
You and me, uh, uh, uh

(If you get in bed, someone will fall in love
You and me and the devil makes three)
