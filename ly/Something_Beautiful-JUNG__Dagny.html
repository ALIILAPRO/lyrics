		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe there's no happy endings
Maybe love'll tear us apart
And if there's no silver lining
I guess I'm dancing in the dark
And the world is turning on us
I know you feel it too

Something beautiful
I'm not giving a fuck about anything anymore
Like an animal
So stay up 'cause there's nothing you gotta do
So irrational
Just not ready to stop for anyone anymore
Something beautiful
Stay up 'cause there's nothing you gotta do

What if everyone's pretending?
What if no one really cares?
You tell your secretary for attention
Just to see if someone's there

Something beautiful
I'm not giving a fuck about anything anymore
Like an animal
So stay up 'cause there's nothing you gotta do
So irrational
Just not ready to stop for anyone anymore
Something beautiful
Stay up 'cause there's nothing you gotta do

(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know you feel it too)
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know you feel it too)
We're standing for something, right?
Standing, so get it through, baby
We're standing for something, right?
I know you feel it too

Something beautiful
Something beautiful (I know you feel it too)

Something beautiful
I'm not giving a fuck about anything anymore
Like an animal
So stay up 'cause there's nothing you gotta do
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know you feel it too)
So irrational
Just not ready to stop for anyone anymore
(I know, I know, I know, I know, I know you feel it too)
Something beautiful
Stay up 'cause there's nothing you gotta do

Something beautiful
