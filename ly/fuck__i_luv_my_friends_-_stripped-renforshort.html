		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, three, four

We laugh till we cry
Drink way too much
Stay up and waste time
Till the sun comes up

With nowhere to go and nowhere to be
Just singin' along to a "Teenage Dream"
If I ran away tonight, I know you'd run with me

Damn, I love my friends
Without them I'd be dead
I know they're the only ones who'll love me til the end
We're all such a mess
Lonely and depressed
Been so long and I can't wait to see them all again
Damn, I love my friends

Damn, I love my friends

Lets both get tattoos
Watch old cartoons
Kiss random schoolboys
And schoolgirls too

With nowhere to go and nowhere to be
Just a bottle of Jack, getting drunk in the street
If I cried and made a scene
I know you'd stick by me

Damn, I love my friends
Without them I'd be dead
I know they're the only ones who'll love me til the end
We're all such a mess
Lonely and depressed
Been so long and I can't wait to see them all again
Damn, I love my friends

My friends

Friends
Damn, I love my friends
