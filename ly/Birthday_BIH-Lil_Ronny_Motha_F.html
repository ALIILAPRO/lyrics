Do yo shit, ow you thick, do yo shit, ow you thick boujee bitch, saditty bitch, take a pic, you the Birthday bitch
Drop it to the floor, pick it back up, girl I heard you like it rough, I get all in that
Hole like Shia LaBeouf , you and your bitches need to line it up, come to the VIP I put you on
The list, we havin' bottles and models and people standin' on the couch hollerin' do your shit
Ayy, gone head drop it to the floor, all this money in my pocket I'ma throw, every night she
Climb a pole, her momma and her daddy don't know, she like to keep her shit on the low, she be

Work, throw that shit back bitch twerk, say you got a man I don't care, what he don't know won't hurt
