		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Girl:] I don't love you anymore
[Boy:] Since when?
[Girl:] Now. Just now. I don't wanna lie, can't tell the truth. It's over
[Boy:] Doesn't matter. I love you, none of it matters
[Girl:] Too late. Goodbye

[Powfu:]
Baby, come walk with me
I'll show you just what love can be
Nothing Like you've seen, before
I can promise he's not the one (He's not the one)
I can show you there's more to life than this
(There's so much more)
If you decide to stay with me
I've been noticing the things you say (You say)
I've been noticing you walked away from him
And you say you're happy
I don't understand what you mean (What you mean)
I don't understand why you've been with him
(I don't understand)
'Cause I know you're not happy (Happy)

[Boy:] I'm sorry, you misunderstand. I didn't mean to
[Girl:] Yes, you did!
[Boy:] I love you!
[Girl:] Where?!
[Boy:] What?
[Girl:]
Show me! Where is this love? I, I can't see it, I can't touch it
I can't feel it. I can hear it, I can hear some words, but I can't do anything with your easy words, whatever you say, it's too late

[Powfu:]
Baby, come walk with me (With me)
I'll show you just what love can be (What it can be)
Nothing like you've seen, before (Before)
I can promise he's not the one (He's not the one)
I can show you there's more to life than this
(There's so much more)
If you decide to stay with me (With me)
I've been noticing the things you say (You say)
I've been noticing you walked away from him
And you say you're happy
I don't understand what you mean (What you mean)
I don't understand why you've been with him
'Cause I know you're not happy (Happy)

Baby, come walk with me
I'll show you just what love can be
Nothing Like you've seen, before
I can promise he's not the one
I can show you there's more to life than this
If you decide to stay with me
