		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I do remember one thing
It took hours and hours but
By the time I was done with it
I was so involved, I didn't know what to think

I carried it around with me for days and days
Playing little games
Like not looking at it for a whole day
And then, looking at it

To see if I still liked it
I did

I repeat myself when under stress
I repeat myself when under stress
I repeat myself when under stress
I repeat myself when under stress

I repeat
The more I look at it
The more I like it
I do think it's good

The fact is
No matter how closely I study it
No matter how I take it apart
No matter how I break it down
It remains consistent

I wish you were here to see it

I like it
