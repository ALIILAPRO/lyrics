		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose
It's the music that we choose

The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood
Keeping my groove on

They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)

They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump

Here you go, get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between his brain and his tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose
Keeping my groove on

They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)

They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)

Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)
They do the bump (it's the music that we choose)

Okay, bring it down here
We'll come back out

Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool shoeshine (it's the music that we choose)
Get the cool (it's the music that we choose)
