		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a new dawn it's a new day
upon the land of the fallen
The higher grounds are frozen
Meanwhile down here they're burning in flames

These battles will set us free from our own doom
Let's go ahead and fight them

These battles will set us free from our own...
These battles will set us free from our own...
So fight them


This is our chance to break away
This is our chance to shatter these chains
Our brothers have fallen
They gave their lives but it won't be in vain

These battles will set us free from our own doom
Let's go ahead and fight them

These battles will set us free from our own...
These battles will set us free from our own...
So fight them

It's a new dawn it's a new day
cn evil order has risen
Battlegrounds in your head
When your mind is weak you become their prey

It's up to you what will you chose
Stay with the system or join us in the mountains

These battles will set us free from our own...
These battles will set us free from our own...
So fight them
