		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm falling down
And 15 thousand people scream
They were all begging for your dream
I'm falling down
Five thousand houses burning down, yeah
No one is gonna save this town

Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here
No, it wasn't here
I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin
So I'm crawling away
'Cause you broke my heart in two, yeah
No I will not forget you

Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no
Falling away
You don't ever see me free
No, I could not forget you

Falling down
Five thousand houses burning down, yeah
No one is gonna save this town, yeah

Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no

Falling down
Now my world is upside-down, yeah
I'm heading straight for the clouds
