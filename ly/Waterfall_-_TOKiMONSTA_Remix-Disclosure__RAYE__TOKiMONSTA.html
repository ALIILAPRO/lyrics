		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I only see you and I
In a crowded room you're my decision
Oh, we been blurring the lines
In a crowded room I guess I kissed him, kissed him

Oh now, baby, hold on, hold on
Pushed you back for so long, oh
And I'm all out of good excuses now, baby
Alright, alright
I can't wait one more night, oh
I give up, I give in I can't take it

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall baby

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh, baby
Let me feel it all

This may be a mistake
But I want your tattoos on my shoulders
If you was bourbon and pain, hmm
I'd raise you to the sky and toast this, hopeless

Oh now, baby, hold on, hold on
Pushed you back for so long, oh
And I'm all out of good excuses now, baby
Alright, alright
I can't wait one more night, oh
I give up, I give in I can't take it

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall, baby

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh, baby
Let me feel it all

Yeah
Give me something to live for
Give me something to love
Give me someone to hold on to
I'll put nothing above
Give me something to live for
Give me something to feel
Give me something to hold on to
Give me something that's real

Never had a lover like you, no
It's the kind of loving I do want
Settled so I'm settling
Love him and I'm telling him
Got a good girl in her element, yeah
Never had a lover like you, no
It's the kind of loving I do want
Settled so I'm settling
Love him and I'm telling him
Got a good girl in her element, yeah

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me
Like a waterfall, baby

Won't you please
Pour your loving over me
All your loving over me

I need you to
Let your water fall
Oh, baby
Let me feel it all

Yeah, won't you let your
Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Waterfall
Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Won't you let your
Waterfall
