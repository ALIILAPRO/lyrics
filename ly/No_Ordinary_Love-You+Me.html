		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I gave you all the love I've got
I gave you more than I could give
I gave you love
I gave you all that I had inside
and you took my love
you took my love

Didn't I tell you
what I believe
Did somebody say that a
a love like that won't last, didn't I give you
all that I got to
give baby

I keep cryin' for you
I keep tryin' for you
There's nothing like you and I baby

This is no ordinary love
it's no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love
it's no ordinary love

When you came
my way
you, brightened every day
Umm with your sweet smile
With your sweet smile

Didn't I tell you
what I believe
Did somebody say that
a love like that won't last
Didn't I give you
all that I've got to
give baby

This is no ordinary love, it's no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love, it's no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love, no ordinary love
This is no ordinary love, it's no ordinary love
