		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're on
That's a nice way to start, Johnny

Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five

I'll lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five

It's the devil's way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now

Because you have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

You have not been
Payin' attention
Payin' attention
Payin' attention

I try to sing along
But I get it all wrong
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies
But like flies, the bugs keep coming back
Not, but I'm not
All hail to the thief
All hail to the thief
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not
But I'm not

Don't question my authority or put me in the box
'Cause I'm not
'Cause I'm not
Oh, go and tell the king that the sky is falling in
But it's not
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not
Maybe not
