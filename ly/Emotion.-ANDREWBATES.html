		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been out late, no phone
Say nobody’s there but I know you
I can feel the rain when you go
Ain’t nothing but a cloud hanging over our love

Why do I feel like you don’t even try
And everyone changes 
But I don’t feel like you want me there

I feel your energy like an ocean
You only come in waves of emotion 
And everybody knows it

Nothin' but love for you
I could go wild for you

I don’t answer your calls on a daily basis
I could O.D on you
Maybe I don’t need you

We are both the same
Playing all these games
But I’ll take the blame for you and I, that’s all I’m good for

I feel your energy like an ocean 
You only come waves of emotion
And everybody knows it

Nothin' but love for you
I could go wild for you
Nothing but love
Oh I could go wild

I think I need you
But never mind leave me lonely 
And I’m thinking of you
When everyone leaves I will be
