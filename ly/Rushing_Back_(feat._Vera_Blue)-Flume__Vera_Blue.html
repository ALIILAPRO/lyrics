		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I always let the days slip away, I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in and now I'm running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back, keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can't change the past, way too young to know the reason why

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

I feel the gravity pulling me faster than it ever has before
When I was seventeen, nicotine loving had me rushing out the door
I try to hold it back, take a breath, looking at old pictures on the floor
But I hear everything telling me, you don't have the time you gotta go

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

All the years, all the issues
All the eyes I have looked into
The stages and the love
All comes rushing back at once, ah

I always let the days slip away, I should have been making up my mind
I never opened up, took it all in, and now I'm running out of time
Sometimes I dream about going back, keeping all the things I left behind
But now I know you can't change the past, way too young to know the reason why

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back

And it all comes rushing back, rushing back (I always)
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back (I always)
And it all comes rushing back, rushing back
