		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Day after day I'm more confused
Yet I look for the light through the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame?

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
So I'm countin' on you to carry me through

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

And when my mind is free
You know a melody can move me
And when I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me

Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You've helped me along, makin' me strong

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul (my soul)
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Hey, hey, hey, yeah, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul (my soul)
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Now, now now, won't ya, won't ya take me?
Oh, oh, take me, yeah

I wanna fly
Early in the morning, won't ya take me?
Come on and free my soul, nah, nah, nah
I wanna drift away, yeah
