		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nobody, nobody, nobody (ooh)
Nobody, nobody, nobody
Yeah

I'd take the fall
I got you covered when there's no one at all
Oh, yeah, and I'd stay through the night
When you got demons tryna break through the walls

There ain't no, no kinda line
That I wouldn't cross if you need me to
You're out here searchin' for signs
So I think it's finally time that you knew

Nobody got you the way I do (ooh)
Whatever demons you're fightin' through
When you need somebody to turn to (ooh)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (woo)

Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Got you the way I do
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (yeah, yeah)

When you go dark and the night gets so cold
I'll be on my way to you (oh yeah)
You know I ain't tryna lose you, oh, no
If you're in Hell, I'll go there too

There ain't no, no kinda line
That I wouldn't cross if you need me to
You're out here searchin' for signs
So I think it's finally time that you knew

Nobody got you the way I do (ooh)
Whatever demons you're fightin' through
When you need somebody to turn to (ooh)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do (the way I do)

Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Got you the way I do
Oh, nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way, the way, the way I do

The way, the way, the way I do
Nobody got you the way I do (woo)

Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Got you the way I do (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Nobody, nobody, nobody (ayo)
Nobody got you the way I do
The way I do
Nobody, nobody, nobody, yeah (ooh)
Nobody got you the way I do
