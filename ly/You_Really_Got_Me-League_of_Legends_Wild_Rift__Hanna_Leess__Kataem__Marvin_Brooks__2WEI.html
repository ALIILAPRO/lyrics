		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you really got me goin'
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin' now
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me
You really got me
You really got me

Yeah, you really got me goin'
You got me so, I don't know what I'm doin'
Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night

Uh
I'll win the war and the battle, bro
We'll take your home for collateral
They like to call us some animals
I know they mad that we crafting the manual
Know, this ain't for weak or for hate this for soul
Tell them retreat cause they ain't even close
Seek casualties cause they can't leave with hope
Keep 'em reminded, they tryna let go
(Yeh, yeh, yeh)

You really got me
You really got me
You really got me

(Go)
I feel the breeze, y'all
I wanna breathe, y'all
Though my actions be louder than words
I'ma keep it one hundred no lie I don't sleep, bruh
I'ma like you today
Yeah, I'm feeling this way
You lacking performance while I got more wingman
Than Superman and while I tease ya

Yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I don't know what I'm doin'
Oh yeah, you really got me now
You got me so I can't sleep at night
You really got me (go)
You really got me (go)
You really got me
