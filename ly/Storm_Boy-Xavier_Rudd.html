		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When will you learn that the more you take
Means the less that you have at the end of the day
Stillness of the mind is so hard to embrace
Freedom of the heart is what we crave
And we sit by the river with a cup of tea
Watch the movement of the tide in the gentle breeze
Pelican drifting slowly looking for a feed
Like Mr Percival the storm boy, you to me
Kookaburra calls just like he knows
And I call right back "Yes, I'm home"
He's been with me, he's watched me grow
Through those rainy days and those rocky roads

And now everybody smiles in the setting sun
And sighs with contentment when the day is done
Hand in hand with the one you love
Feeling blessed by the magic of the moon above
And we sing
Sha-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We're just living in this beautiful world
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world

It's time for fire, smoke and leaves
The only mosquito repellent we need
Pay respect to the North, the South, the West and the East
Pay respect to the spirit of this old country
Freedom in the hearts of the young and brave
Who know little of the journey of the diggers who gave
Their lives to the service and the government gains
So that we could dance together on this beautiful day

And now everybody smiles in the setting sun
And sighs with contentment when the day is done
Hand in hand with the one you love
Feeling blessed by the magic of the moon above
And we sing
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world

When the winter seeps into my bones
And I hear the call from the North
I will go
Yeah I will go

And everybody smiles in the setting sun
And sighs with contentment when the day is done
Hand in hand with the one you love
Feeling blessed by the magic of the moon above
And we sing
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world
Sha la la la la la la la
We're just living in this beautiful world
