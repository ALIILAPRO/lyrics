		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven, wait
Only a word, a sign, I need to know
I can't wait
I'm trying to figure out
I'm trying to figure how you feel
 
I'll lose my mind
Doesn't make any sense, I know it's true
Could I have known?
That I was going to fall
That I was going to fall for you?
 
You're secretive, I know
Your world's a place I don't belong
Even though, I will never let go
 
Cause everyday
You're on my mind
In every way
You're in my heart
You make me feel like
We were never apart
Never apart
Cause everyday
You're on my mind
In every way
You're in my heart
You make me feel like
We were never apart
Never apart
 
Heaven, wait
Only a word, a gaze, I need to know
I won't rest
Until I figure out
Until I figure how you feel
 
Lose my mind
Doesn't make any sense, I know it's true
Did you know?
I was already fond
Was already fond of you
 
You're secretive, I know
Your world's somewhere I don't belong
Even though, I will never let go
 
Cause everyday
You're on my mind
In every way
You're in my heart
You make me feel like
We were never apart
Never apart
Cause everyday
You're on my mind
In every way
You're in my heart
You make me feel like
We were never apart
Never apart
