		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As someone sets light to the first fire of autumn 
We settle down to cut ourselves apart
Cough and twitch from the news on your face 
And some foreign candle burning in your eyes 

Held to the past, too aware of the pending 
Chill as the dawn breaks and finds us up for sale
Enter the fog another low road descending 
Away from the cold lust, you house and summertime

Blind to the last cursed affair, pistols and countless eyes 
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running 
Feed 'til the sun turns into wood dousing an ancient torch 
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting love

Your name on my cast and my notes on your stay 
Offer me little but doting on a crime
We've turned every stone and for all our inventions 
In matters of love loss, we've no recourse at all

Blind to the last cursed affair, pistols and countless eyes 
A trail of white blood betrays the reckless route your craft is running 
Feed 'til the sun turns into wood dousing an ancient torch 
Loiter the whole day through and lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting

Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting
Lose yourself in lines dissecting love
