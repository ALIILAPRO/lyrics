		  Bling, bling, bling, bitches is mad, hahahaha
Hahaha
Uh, uh, alright (Aziz)
Uh, uh (BIA, BIA)

Business as usual (uh)
Usually, I wouldn't smile 
'Less it cost a couple thousands of millions (frrt)
And millions, and millions, and millions (uh, alright)
Business as usual 
Usually, I wouldn't smile 
'Less it cost a couple thousands of millions (frrt)
And millions, and millions, and millions (uh, alright, okay)

I don't cash my new checks, it's old change, you know? (You know?)
Another bitch's man made my phone ring, hello? (Brrt)
Nigga said he cappin' but won't step, you know (who?)
Every time he Zelle me, that's phone sex, hello? (Uh)
Bling, bling, bloaw
Bitches mad, I'm like, "Wow" (brrt)
What the fuck did I do now?
Don't you hoes get me aroused (okay)
I might pull a ticket out of my account (frrt, okay)
Just to show you bitches how to count (uh, okay)
This Glock is new as fuck (grrah)
Don't compare me to these bitches, they don't do enough (do enough)
They can't walk it in my shoes because I'm booted up (woo)
I got oppositions showin' me computer love (uh)
Brought my stick inside the club, I got no worries today (grrah)
I get paid to party on a permanent base (that's true)
Only time we link is meet and greet (huh)
On and off the jet 'cause I got places to be (alright, skrrt)

Business as usual (uh)
Usually, I wouldn't smile 
'Less it cost a couple thousands of millions (frrt)
And millions, and millions, and millions (okay, alright, frrt)
Business as usual 
Usually, I wouldn't smile 
'Less it cost a couple thousands of millions (frrt)
And millions, and millions, and millions (millions, ayy)

Foot on bitches' necks because I'm standin' on business (doot, doot, doot)
I deserve to flex and I have God as my witness (flex)
Police tried to slow me down but they couldn't stop it (skrrt)
I got platinum plaques like I got cards in my wallet (uh)
Now I got millions (millions, frrt)
Got the fuck inside my bag and out my feelings (out my feelings)
Got a couple carbon copies, I got children (now I got children)
Only pussy that's around me is my Brazilian (it's in my lap)
Movin' militant, no regular civilian (grrah)

Business as usual (uh)
Usually, I wouldn't smile 
'Less it cost a couple thousands of millions (frrt)
And millions, and millions, and millions (uh, alright)
Business as usual 
Usually, I wouldn't smile 
'Less it cost a couple thousands of millions (frrt)
And millions, and millions, and millions (beep, alright)
