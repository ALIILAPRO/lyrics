		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk to me baby
Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know

How all of this would end up
Girl, I saw it in your eyes
And baby I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight

You knew that talking dirty to me
On the phone would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected girl
You're such a masochist and I ask why
And you reply

I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So baby don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone

Baby please
Would you end your night with me
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life
Don't you leave my little life
Ooh

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Ooh, ooh
