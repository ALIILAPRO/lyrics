		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  At the dark end of the street
That's where we always meet
Hiding in shadows where we don't belong
Living in darkness to hide our wrong

You and me
At the dark end of the street
You and me

I know that time is gonna take its toll
We have to pay for the love we stole
It's a sin and we know it's wrong
Oh, our love keeps coming on strong

Steal away
To the dark end of the street

They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
They're gonna find us
Oh, someday

You and me
At the dark end of the street
You and me

And when the daylight hour rolls 'round
And by chance, we're both downtown
If we should meet, just walk on by
Oh darling, please, don't cry

Tonight we'll meet
At the dark end of the street
