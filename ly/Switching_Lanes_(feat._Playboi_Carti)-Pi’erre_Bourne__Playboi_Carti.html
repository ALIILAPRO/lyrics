		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby give me brain (yeah), baby go insane (yeah)
Let me switch lanes (yeah), go a different pace (uh-huh)
Man, I'm on a plane (yeah), man, I can't complain (yo, Pi'erre)
First-class gang (yeah), too-much-money gang (uh-huh)
Bought a new chain (yeah), ignorant weights (yeah)
Ignorance is bliss (yeah), smile on my face (yeah)
Mama just pray (yeah), grandma just pray (yeah)
Grandma want a car (yeah), wanna switch lanes (uh-huh)

For my birthday I want more than you, babe (uh-huh)
Fuck you any day, make you scream my name (uh-huh)
I got déjà vu, do the same thing (uh-huh)
Man, I want some change, stack my loose change (uh-huh)
Like a piggy bank (uh-huh) but my money can't (woah)
Fit in like it's lame (uh-huh), got no fuckin' cake (woah)
Save no hoes today (woah), no, that is not okay (nope)
Man, you know the rules (woah), yeah, it's still the same (yeah)

Baby give me brain (yeah), baby go insane (yeah)
Let me switch lanes (yeah), go a different pace (uh-huh)
Man, I'm on a plane (yeah), man, I can't complain (yo, Pi'erre)
First-class gang (yeah), too-much-money gang (uh-huh)
Bought a new chain (yeah), ignorant weights (yeah)
Ignorance is bliss (yeah), smile on my face (yeah)
Mama just pray (yeah), grandma just pray (yeah)
Grandma want a car (yeah, huh), wanna switch lanes (uh-huh)

Ooh-ooh-ooh, 'bout to fuck on a model (slatt)
In the back with the gas (check it out, slatt)
Ooh-ooh-ooh (hol' up, bitch), you ain't even got it (yeah)
I'm with my slatt, hold up, and a Kel-Tec
Yo, Pi'erre, that's my slatt, hol' up
We get crazy, check them stats (what? Slatt)
See a young nigga got gats (slatt)
See a young nigga from the flat, yeah
Smokin' that gas (yeah), look at my pants
Smokin' that gas, put a bag on this, hol' on (fifty)
I'ma die lit, uh (yeah)
For the world I'm dyin' lit, uh (fifty, yeah, fifty)

Baby give me brain (yeah), baby go insane (yeah)
Let me switch lanes (yeah, what?), Go a different pace (uh-huh)
Man, I'm on a plane (yeah), man, I can't complain (yo, Pi'erre)
First-class gang (yeah), too-much-money gang (uh-huh)
Bought a new chain (yeah), ignorant weights (yeah)
Ignorance is bliss (yeah), smile on my face (yeah)
Mama just pray (yeah), grandma just pray (yeah)
Grandma want a car (yeah), wanna switch lanes (uh-huh)
