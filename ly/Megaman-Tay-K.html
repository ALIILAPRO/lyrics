		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke Megaman
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick the change uh y'all so Bruce Wayne uh
If he act mysterious he get hit with my Ray
Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke Megaman
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick the change uh y'all so Bruce Wayne
If he act mysterious he get hit with my Ray

And if you was curious, yes I'm Tay-K
I'm not on time with everything but bitch it's worth the wait
I look at your gang and my .40 and I aim
Marks on his head now he looking like Aang
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came
I don't wanna smooch bitch I really want the brain
I just hit a stain now your bitch wanna claim (me!)
Just opened up your pack and it better be stank (nigga!)

Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke Megaman
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick the change uh, y'all so Bruce Wayne uh
If he act mysterious, he get hit with my Ray
Shining like I'm Megaman, I smoke Megaman
Don't come at the youth, send you back to where you came from
Niggas quick the change uh y'all so Bruce Wayne
If he act mysterious he get hit with my Ray
