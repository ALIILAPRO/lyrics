		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you don't love yourself
Like you did when you were twelve
You're missing a piece of you
It hurts worse than it used to
I know that you hate it when
You have to make brand new friends
'Cause you'll get to wondering
If they'll ever let you in

You don't understand why anyone would love
Someone who's not enough

I wish you knew how much I love you
I wish you knew how bad I need you here
I wish you knew how much I miss you
I wish you knew how bad it hurts to hear
That you're not liking it on earth anymore
But when you feel like you're
Alone in the world
I hope you know how much I love you
I hope you know how bad I need you here

I know you don't like to talk
About all of your dark thoughts
You don't like to ask for help
You carry it by yourself
You think that if you're too seen
The people you love might leave
You feel like you bring them down
You say that it's your fault, how?

You don't understand why anyone would love
Someone who's not enough

I wish you knew how much I love you
I wish you knew how bad I need you here
I wish you knew how much I miss you
I wish you knew how bad it hurts to hear
That you're not liking it on earth anymore
But when you feel like you're
Alone in the world
I hope you know how much I love you
I hope you know how bad I need you here

I hope you know how much I love you
I hope you know how bad I need you here
I hope you know how much I miss you
I hope you know how bad it hurts to hear
That you're not liking it on earth anymore
But when you feel like you're
Alone in the world
I hope you know how much I love you
I hope you know how bad I need you here
