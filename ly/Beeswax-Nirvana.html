		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why doesn't she need him for a father?
Not only maidens can occupy my shack
Goring my manhood turns a man off.
Like Pepe LePew would say, 
Hey, hey, hey! -- then we clash!

I got my diddly spayed

She laughs about it.
Shrinking inflections if the wind blows just right.
Jacking themselves off polyester.
I wanna jump, this isn't right! 
Hey, when am I getting it back?

I don't know why,
I got a joke too silly to say.
Don't touch the balls.
I got a dick, dick -- hear my fucking hate!

If you're wondering, it's gaining monthly. (If your world is getting ugly)
Fiberglass insulated, the sky is cotton candy.
Spawning downstream, El Rancho Ovulate.
Feeling can't help me romp
Bill just fuck me, take me anal
Billy's slit reminds me of someone.
I'm sick of paying for the love boat
Tony and Tenille say wanna jump rope
And I say look!

I got my penis spayed, 
I got a little tail,

I got my dingaling spayed
Nothing hard
I gotta be around pussy
Don't let me fall
I got a heh-heh...well you can't live
We got my dingaling spayed
When ya gonna learn?
