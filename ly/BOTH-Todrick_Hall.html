		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can be a bitch
I can be a diva
I can throw a pitch
I can play receiver
I can turn a bad boy
Into a believer
I can do both
I can do both

I can be your boy toy
I can be your bride
I can shut my mouth
Or I can open wide
Do you want the masculine
Or feminine side
I can do both
I can do both

I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both

It ain't nothing but a flip of a switch
Your suga mama pimp daddy
Either way cause I'm rich
When I'm wicked
Call me Gelinda or that Elthela witch
Cause you could never make a boss
Out a regular bitch
Yeah I'm sweet in Alabama
But a freak in Atlanta
I bounce that booty
On ya lap
While I'm calling you Santa
Do you prefer a hot pocket
Or a taste of banana
I can do both
Bitch I'm Hannah Montana
And baby I can wear your handcuffs
I can wear your ring
I can be your princess
I can be your king
I could forever
Or I could be just a fling
I can do both
I can do both

I can meet your mom
Or I can be for hire
I can make you moist
Or I can start a fire
Do whatever cheeky freaky deaky
Thing that you desire
I can do both
I can do both

I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both
(Do you know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both both both
(Do you know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both both both
(Do you know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both both both
(You better know who the fuck you fucking with)

I can have that hot meal ready
Every time you come home
Or have you breathing real heavy
When your woman is gone
I'll give you tatts
Fitted caps and the sexy cologne
Or be that chick to send XXX pics to your phone
I'll give you sweet in the morning
But a freak in the night
Got my permission to put me in the position you like
Yeah we can let somebody watch
Or we can turn out the lights
Give you burlesque
Or a full magic Mike
Cause baby I can do the dishes
I can wear the pants
I can be your rollie
I can be your fans
You can turn me up
And I'll obey all your commands
I can do both
I can do both

I could be your homegirl
I could be your bro
I could be your whole world
I could be a hoe
I could go whatever way
The fucking wind blow
I can do both
I can do both

I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both
I can do both both both

I can be your man
I can be your misses
You can pull my hair
Or you can give me kisses
And if you rub the lamp
I can grant a couple wishes
I can do both
I can do both

And if we want a third
I can go get her
Doctor or nurse
Either way you feel better
Be a one night stand
Or I can stick with you forever
I can do both
I can do both
I can do both

I can serve cold fish
I can give ruff trade
If you call me bitch
You can call me babe
Want a 30 inch weave
Or full flown tee
I can do both baby

I can do both both both
(Do you know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both both both
(Do you know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both both both
(Do you know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both both both
(You better know who the fuck you fucking with)
I can do both
