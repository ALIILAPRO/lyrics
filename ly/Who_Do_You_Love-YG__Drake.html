		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's up?
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

I'm that nigga with the plugs
I'm the nigga who got homies that be sellin' drugs
I'm the nigga on the back street
With the fat heat, niggas better run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
My Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Police pull up, I'm tryna stash the Glock
Uh, you that nigga on the low-low
You the nigga, you're the one that be talkin' to the po-pos
Uh, Porsche sittin' on Forgi's
Niggas can't afford these
The Panamera shittin' on the 9-11
I call my homies, not 9-11
I'm that nigga with the juice
But I'll never do my nigga like Pac did Q

Bitch, who do you love? (4Hunnid)
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love? (Champagne)
Bitch, who do you love?

I got a shorty named Texas Syn
She got a buddy named Young JB and now you know the deal
We turnt up in the studio late night
That's why the songs that you hear are comin' real tight
OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you
If you a player in the game, this should hold you
And man, shout my nigga Game, he just rolled through
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make
Did 'The Motto", took a flight to the golden state
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight
Had to leave my nigga, homie got a open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
And my name too big, and my gang too big
Young Money shit, me and Lil Wayne too big
I'ma crush that ass even if it ain't too big
I would pinky swear but my pinky ring too big, what's up?

Bitch, who do you love? (4Hunnid)
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block
Fat heat, run like athletes
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga
Bank of America account got six figures
I'm that nigga on the block

Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love? (4Hunnid)
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?
Bitch, who do you love?

Nigga, we street and we hood
Ain't nobody ever gave us shit
When you see us shinin' it's because we steady grindin'
We stay paper chasin'
Separatin' the real from the fake
The fake from the real
We livin' to die and dyin' to live
Nigga, that's why we got so many women
I'm tryna go deep, hit them ass cheeks
Bust them guts, make her cum
Bitch, you know the game
Ain't a motherfuckin' thing change
Bitch, who do you love?

Ayy, hold up
I done lost too many homies in these past couple years
This shit brazy
Rest in peace, my nigga CJ Mack
Rest in peace, my nigga Cedar Block Frog though (bool)
Rest in peace, my nigga Tiny M
And last but not least, rest in peace, my nigga Big Aaron
