		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh-oh no, oh-oh no
Oh-oh no, oh-oh no

You said, "Hey, girl, will you sit with me?
Table in the back of Cafeteria C
We can be friends if you want to be
But only 'til the clock hits three
After lunch, we can walk to class
Talk about the boys that we want to smash
Talk about ways to get a little more cash
After that I'll ignore your ass", oh

The hassle, the fighting, they all want a bite of me
Photos, more photos
Then gossip 'bout hoes that they don't know
Oh, they talk shit though

I don't want no lunchbox friends, no
I want someone who understands, oh, oh, no
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that would last forever, no
No lunchbox friends, no, oh, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that would last forever, no

No lunchbox friends, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that would last forever

They want a fat ass in the brand new jeans
Want a baby in the back with the man of their dreams
That isn't the life for me
I don't look like a fucking damn Barbie
Throw it on TV, people have high expectations of me
Wanna be my best friend, then judge me
If I smoke a little weed, makes no fucking sense to me

The hassle, the fighting, they all want a bite of me
Photos, more photos 
And gossip 'bout hoes that they don't know
Oh, they talk shit though

I don't want no lunchbox friends, no
I want someone who understands, oh, oh, no
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that would last forever, no
No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that would last forever

No, no, no, no
Come to my house, let's die together
Friendship that would last forever
No lunchbox friends, no
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that would last forever, no
No, no, no
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that would last forever

No lunchbox friends, no, oh
No lunchbox friends
Come to my, come to my
Friendship that would last forever
