		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're lookin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
You're sayin' not quite enough to me
You're sippin' just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me?
Trippin' (trippin') a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
We can get right, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to fill your cup
So we can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
Tonight, right
(We can get right)

Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come

Your lips talkin' 'bout, "I play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips movin' oh so slow (so slow)
Bar tab lookin' like a car note (car note)
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
We can get right, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to fill your cup
So we can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
Tonight, right
(We can get right)

So much we've got to say, but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough
Don't leave love behind (don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand
I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
We can get right, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to fill your cup
So we can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
Tonight, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
We can get right, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to fill your cup
So we can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
Tonight, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to sign you up
We can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
We can get right, right
(We can get right)

I'm about to fill your cup
So we can get right, before the night is up
We can get right, right
Tonight, right
