		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's about time
That you noticed
Last night I got
You on it
Hit it, came back
Cause it's so good
I know it's good to you
Good to you
Good to you
Good to you
I know it's good to
Tell me you
Want me babe
I'll climb on top
Ride until you come, yeah
Tell me what's up
Is you bout it baby
I know you got a girl
But when I'm done
With you
I'll have you
Acting different
Dirty pictures
On your phone
Got you tripping
Never give you back
Like you're missing
Ooh
I just want to
Make you feel nice
Get up inside me baby
I know you like it
Know you like it
Cause it's good to you
Good to you
Good to you
Good to you
I know its good to you
