		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I, I get to know your name
Well if I, could trace your private number, baby

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
I want some, want some

I set my sights on you (and no one else will do)
And I, I've got to have my way now, baby

All I know is that to me
You look like you're having fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round

I (I, I, I)
I got to be your friend now, baby
And I (I, I, I) 
Would like to move in just a little bit closer

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round

I want your love
I want your love

All I know is that to me
You look like you're lots of fun
Open up your lovin' arms
Watch out, here I come

You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round

You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round

You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
You spin me right 'round, baby
Right 'round, like a record, baby
Right 'round, 'round, 'round
