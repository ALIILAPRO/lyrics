		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't give away what's left of us to her
I know I hurt you badly don't be mad please
I regret it all
Don't give away what's left of us to her
I know I hurt you badly don't be mad please
Don't be don't be don't be
Where did you go
When you didn't come home to me baby
You're making It hard for me
You're making It hard for me to see the light
Where did you go
When you didn't come home to me baby
You're making It hard for me
You're making It hard for me to see the light
Maybe If we picked up our shit
Forget about It I won't
Sit here and try to pretend
That I could depend on you
Darling let me know
Are you ashamed of what you did?
You were not the one that I thought you'd be
You're not the one
Don't give away what's left of us to her
I know I hurt you badly don't be mad please
Don't be don't be don't be
Where did you go
When you didn't come home to me baby
You're making It hard for me
You're making It hard for me to see the light
Where did you go
When you didn't come home to me baby
You're making It hard for me
You're making It hard for me to see the light
Where did you go
When you didn't come home to me baby
You're making It hard for me
You're making It hard for me to see the light
