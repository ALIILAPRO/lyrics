		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Uh-uh, uh-uhn
Ii-yo, oh-ohh (Steel on the banger)
Certain things on my mind
And, I cannot speak, so, I wanna keep
And, I cannot deny, oh-no no
And, I'll see you in the next life
I don dey fight war, I don dey shoot gun, I turn militant, oh-oh-no no

Say me, don see big man rise and fall
So, me, know what falilure looks like (me, know what falilure looks like)
I don follow girl treck hundred miles reach her house
She dey tell me "goodnight" (ah-yeah, she dey tell me "good-night")
No even pecking, no even hug, nothing wey go fit make man smile (ah-yeah)
I don dey hustle, man, I dey hustle (ah-yeah)
I no even know how to book flight

So, me say, jara 
Oh baby, jara 
No use me gara 
No use me, show your power 
Say, jara (my baby)
Oh baby, jara (oh, my baby)
No use me gara (oh, my baby)
No use me, show your power (show your power)

Say something don do mami water things for this world wey we dey
Wey dey make am just dey inside water
Too many things wey dey bother my head, so
I just dey shayo and hustle, my brother
My defender, who be that man wey dey make man bend am?
My iron bender, I fit tender
Any man fire, give am back to sender, only Jah

And we know say nobody holy
So, I dey burn my poli
So, I dey watch my friends and looking for the people wey go change my story (story)
So, me, give God glory (glory)
And, I know say nobody know me (know me)
And, I no say nobody know me
When I feel the pain, only me go console me ('sole me)

So, me say, jara 
Oh baby, jara (oh baby, jara)
No use me gara (oh, my baby)
No use me, show your power (show your power)
Say, jara (my baby)
Oh baby, jara (oh, my baby)
No use me gara (oh, my baby)
No use me, show your power (show your power)
Say something don do mami water things for this world wey we dey
Wey dey make am just dey inside water
Too many things wey dey bother my head
So, I just dey shayo and hustle, my brother (oh)
Jara
Oh baby, jara (oh, my baby)
No use me gara (oh, my baby)
No use me, show your power (show your power)
(Timi Jay on the track)
