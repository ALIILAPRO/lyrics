		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Shine, shine, shine, shine)

Have you ever had this feeling like you can't believe what you're seeing?
Head is spinning in slow motion, heart is pounding, time is frozen.

Don't close your eyes, look around you, dreams are coming alive.
Don't be surprised, you know that you were born to shine.

You're a firefly, you're the sunlight,
You're a shooting star breaking through the night.
You're a rocket in the darkness, and you sparkle like a diamond sky.
You're gonna be anything you want to be,
If you open your heart, and just believe that the light within will be your guide, oh.
You're amazing, fire blazing, no more waiting,
It's your time to shine.

It's your story (it's your story), never ending (never ending),
Fairy tales, such a magical beginning.
Like a candle, your eyes glisten as you viewed the wonder you'd been missing. (Shine)

So fly (so fly), so free (so free), and smile down on all you see.
Your heart is true, and the world can't help but notice you.

You're a firefly, you're the sunlight,
You're a shooting star breaking through the night.
You're a rocket in the darkness, and you sparkle like a diamond sky.
You're gonna be anything you want to be,
If you open your heart, and just believe that the light within will be your guide, oh.
You're amazing, fire blazing, no more waiting,
It's your time to shine.

You glow like a beautiful rainbow reaching through the sky,
So bright with a heart of gold inside.

(Shine, shine, shine, shine)

You're a firefly, you're the sunlight,
You're a shooting star breaking through the night.
You're a rocket in the darkness, and you sparkle like a diamond sky.
You're gonna be anything you want to be,
If you open your heart, and just believe that the light within will be your guide, oh.
You're amazing, fire blazing, no more waiting,
It's your time to shine.

Ah-ah-ah (You're a firefly, you're the sunlight,)
Ah-ah-ah (You're a shooting star breaking through the night.)
Ah-ah-ah (You're a rocket in the darkness, and you sparkle like a diamond sky.)
You're gonna be anything you want to be,
If you open your heart, and just believe that the light within will be your guide, oh.
You're amazing, fire blazing, no more waiting,
It's your time to shine.
