		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, shake a leg! (Hey, shake a leg!)
It's Mr. Greg (it's Mr. Greg)
And he's here to spend his dough all over the town

He's got the bucks
I've got the bucks
It's all deluxe
It's all deluxe

When you're dining out with me
It's the finest steak and brie
Yeah, and if I break a table it ain't no, whoa
Just bill it to my bank
A hundred bucks? Gee, thanks!

I must admit (you must admit)
It's a perfect fit (you look great in it)
And those fountains I found wasteful
Are actually quite tasteful
This city's got it's charm
Unlike that termite-ridden barn
And any time with Steven
Makes for a delightful evenin'

You're having fun!
More or less
So dance with me, just say
No!
