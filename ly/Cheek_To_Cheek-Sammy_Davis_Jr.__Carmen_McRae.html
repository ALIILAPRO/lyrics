		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats
So that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find
The happiness I seek
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And the cares
That hung around me
Through the week
Seem to vanish
Like a gamblers
Lucky streak
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek

Oh
I love to climb a mountain
And to reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me
Half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek

Oh
I love to go out fishing
In a river, or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half
As much as dancing
Cheek to cheek

Dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through to

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats
So that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find
That happiness I seek
When we're out together
Swinging cheek to cheek

Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
That charm about you
Will carry me through
Right up to

Heaven
I'm in heaven
And my heart beats
So that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find
That happiness I seek
When we're out
Together dancing
Out together dancing
Out together dancing
Cheek to cheek
