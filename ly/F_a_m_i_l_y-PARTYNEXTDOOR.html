		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss my brother, I miss my family
I was the way out
The way that we was supposed to eat
Trappin' out with Warren
'Sauga City saints, so you know where we buried Mariah, I'll carry ya
It's a long long way from Ontario
Woah, turn me up, yeah
I miss my dawgs, when the nighttime calls
I see my dogs, I mean it
When the night turn dawn, hit 'em all when I say, "Yeah"
I miss the family (yeah), ooh, woah, woah, woah
It was a tragedy, how we suffered (yeah, yeah)
I hope that one day we dap up and peace up
I hope they know from me, it's all love
Issa family, yeah, yeah

To my brothers in the city, I see ya
We rockin' Rolex in the PJ and we finna peel it
We rollin' blunts up in Rolls' to the ceilin', oh, and smokin', oh
Miss ya till I die Abdullah R-I-P, I see ya
Don't know what I did to ya, but I see ya, I'll be with ya
Homie on the left side, he ridin' for me, for me, oh, woah, woah

I miss my brother, I miss my family
I was the way out
The way that we was supposed to eat
Trappin' out with Warren
'Sauga City saints, so you know where we buried Mariah, I'll carry ya
It's a long way from Ontario
Woah, turn me up, yeah
I miss my dawgs, when the nighttime calls
I see my dogs, I mean it
When the night turns dawn, hit 'em all when I say, "Yeah"
I miss the family (yeah), ooh, woah, woah, woah
It was a tragedy, yeah (that we sufferin'), nah
I hope that one day we dap up and peace up
I hope they know from me, it's all love
Issa family, yeah, yeah
I miss the family (yeah), ooh, woah, woah, woah
It was a tragedy, how we suffered (yeah, yeah)
I hope that one day we dap up and peace up
I hope they know from me, it's all love
Issa family, yeah, yeah
