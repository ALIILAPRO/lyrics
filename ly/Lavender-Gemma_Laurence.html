		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Born into a world where the walls were painted blue
 it's a boy!   	your mother cried in her hospital room
You play your father's child in his patriotic town
But you wear your mother's lipstick 
When you know she's not around 

You're crying out why can't they see
The restless fugue of pink and blue
In your identity

A lonesome shroud of dissonance settles in your skin 
In your color-coded uniforms  you're wearing to fit in
Anxiety's a little league and fear's a locker room
Teenage suffocation in your body's own cocoon 

And I know it's not easy 
To shed your skin and be the woman
You were born to be
