		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the world is calling me
And I'm listening to plastic tree
All I want is to feel just fine
But I know I won't this time

Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Until I touch down, until I hear the sound
of you telling me that everything is alright
'Til I feel my heart start to pound and my feet leave the ground
And it's all wrong, it's gon' be a long night
'Cause the world is killing me
And nothing makes sense anymore
I won't be fine until I see
Your face when you reach my front door
My front door

Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh

I can't let go
I can't let go (I can't let go)
I can't let go (I can't let go)
I can't let go (oh)

Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Until I come home
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
Until I come, 'til I come home
