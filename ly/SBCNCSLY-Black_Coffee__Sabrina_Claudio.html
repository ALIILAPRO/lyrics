		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Subconsciously, she wonders
What it's like to be in love
She wants to be his everything
But her pride relents too much

In another lifetime, she'll lose control
And she'll give it all and leave room to grow
In another lifetime, she'll be more at ease
And then, finally, admit I am she

She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready, yeah
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready, yeah
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready, yeah
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready

(Give her a moment)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (and she'll set herself free)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (when she is ready)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (I know 'cause she's me, oh)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (ohh, oh)

Subconsciously, she wonders
How it feels to give herself up
She'd died to be the one he needs
But his dependence is overdone

In another lifetime, she'll lose control
And she'll give it all and leave room to grow
In another lifetime, she'll be more at ease
And then, finally, admit I am she

She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready, yeah
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready, yeah
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready, yeah
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready

(Give her a moment)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (and she'll set herself free)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (when she is ready)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (I know 'cause she's me, oh)
She'll love when she's ready
She'll love when she's ready (ohh, oh)
