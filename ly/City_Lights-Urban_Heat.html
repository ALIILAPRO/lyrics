		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look at all the time that's passed.
Some things in life you're never getting back,
Like a young first kiss, a lost lover's eyes,
But you can see them in the city lights.

One more time for the kids in the back,
You've got no chance of living in the past.
But if you just lace your hands in mine
We'll see those lights now for just one more time.

The city lights.
In the city lights.

Do you remember
The city lights? The city lights?
Do you remember
Those sleepless nights? Sleepless nights?
Oh, do you remember?
Do you remember?
Do you remember?

My life. I've torn myself in two.
These days I turn it on. I turn it on for you.
