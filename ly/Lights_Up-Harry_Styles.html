		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
Be so sweet if things just stayed the same
(La-da-da-da-da)

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?

(Shine) step into the light
(Shine) so bright sometimes
(Shine) I'm not ever going back
(Shine) step into the light
(Shine) so bright sometimes
(Shine) I'm not ever going back
(Shine) step into the light
(Shine) so bright sometimes
(Shine) I'm not ever (ooh)

What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never going back now
Be so sweet if things just stayed the same
(La-da-da-da-da)

(La-da-da-da-da)
(La-da-da-da-da) (oh)
(La-da-da-da-da) (oh)
(La-da-da-da-da) (oh)

All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are?
