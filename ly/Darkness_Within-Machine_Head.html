		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here in this darkness that I lay
Depression heavy in its way
And how my body aches to leave
To sing its final eulogy
My sons, I love you evermore
And though the road beckons once more
I see the damage that I've done
In search for redemption
But I am just a broken man
Whose soul cries out to understand
How the madness shatters me
Upon the stage on bended knee
I scream out loud at skies above
That answer mute, bereft in love
I struggle not to fall from grace
Or sing the hyms of my disgrace


We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to attain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within

Misery's forgotten chords
I strum in vain to please the Lord
But he has never answered me
My faith has waned eternally
In empty men who pass along
The woes of all religion's wrong
Now the shadowed veil it falls
Heed the clarion call
So pray to music, build a shrine
Worship in these desperate times
Fill your heart with every note
Cherish it and cast afloat
'Cause God is in these clef and tone
Salvation is found alone
Haunted by its melody
Music, it will set you free
(Let it set you free)


We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to attain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within

(Music save me)
Music my savior (Save me)
Music my savior (Save me)
Music my savior (Save me)
Music my savior (Save me)

We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to attain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within
We build cathedrals to our pain
Establish monuments to attain
Freedom from all of the scars and the sins
Lest we drown in the darkness within
