		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Verse 1 
A tough act to follow baby 
Oh wow 
You set the bar high 
I know if I walk I'm crazy 
Oh wow 
But that won't change my mind 

Pre-Hook
Nothing left to do babe 
You already proved to me 
That you're a keeper 
I should wanna take 
But you shouldn't have to wait
For the truth from me 

Hook 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 
One I could learn so much from 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 
This love affair has run its course 
If it wasn't working 
Then it wouldn't be so hard to call it off 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 
You'd make a good ex love 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 

break

Verse 2 
Danger in the water baby 
Oh wow 
I have to take a dive 
I know that you want to save me 
Holding me tight
I see it in your eyes 

Pre Hook
But this is what I do babe 
I hope it isn't cruel of me
But if I keep your heart it's gonna break 
You shouldn't have to wait for the truth 
From me 

Hook 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 
One I could learn so much from 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 
This love affair has run its course 
If it wasn't working 
Then it wouldn't be so hard to call it off (It wouldn't be so hard baby) 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend 
You'd make a good ex love (oh no) 
You'd make a good ex boyfriend
