		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm 'bout to pour with my friends, smoking green
Waiting on a blacked-out limousine
You can go where you want not for free
When we come always causing a scene
'Cause I got the ghost in the backyard
Ain't going back now, I feel like I'm living a dream
'Cause we in a Benz when we roll up, cannot control us
I got so many things to see
'Cause I got the ghost in the backyard
Ain't going back now, I feel like I'm living a dream
'Cause we in a Benz when we roll up, cannot control us
I got so many things to see
I'm in a big brown Benz with a friend and we riding
You can't tell me what you want 'cause you ain't never sliding
Don't got no time for you or for fighting
I looked and took a ten I saw ain't no need for lighting
'Cause this a dream, I really live
Don't say sorry 'cause I cannot forgive
And all these people talking shit
Don't really care and no fucks for me
But it's the things that you say like every day
Making me not want to stay
And I hope that you see what I would be
'Cause I'm never ever going to leave
Yeah
I'm 'bout to pour with my friends, smoking green
Waiting on a blacked-out limousine
You can go where you want not for free
When we come always causing a scene
'Cause I got the ghost in the backyard
Ain't going back now, I feel like I'm living a dream
'Cause we in a Benz when we roll up, cannot control us
I got so many things to see
'Cause I got the ghost in the backyard
Ain't going back now, I feel like I'm living a dream
'Cause we in a Benz when we roll up, cannot control us
I got so many things to see
So what about now?
I don't care too much what they talking about (yeah)
I been going hard, I'm in the stu, I'm going loud
Yeah, what you want from me?
'Cause I been hearing that you talking
I been running around, while you've been slow
And you've been walking
So what you want from me? Can't be fair
Just not talk me, been working all day-ay
And I don't ever want it to end
Yeah, baby can't you see
That I don't ever want it to end
And I've living too crazy
So I think I might end dead
Yeah
'Cause I got the ghost in the backyard
Ain't going back now, I feel like I'm living a dream
'Cause we in a Benz when we roll up, cannot control us
I got so many things to see
'Cause I got the ghost in the backyard
Ain't going back now, I feel like I'm living a dream
'Cause we in a Benz when we roll up, cannot control us
I got so many things to see
