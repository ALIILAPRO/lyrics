		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I could paint your picture
I'd paint you as the sea
I'd let your arms become the tide

If I could fall into you
I'd let you swallow me
So I could see you from inside

And it's a cruel melody
That you sing when I'm away
Tryin' to find where the sun shines
In a land that's turning grey

And it's a cruel memory
To look back on who we were
'Cause my past is a poison
And I'll never find a cure

If I could break a promise
I'd tell a thousand lies
To have you look at me again

But your heart is empty of me
I see it in your eyes
It wasn't meant for me to win

And it's a cruel melody
That you sing when I'm away
Tryin' to find where the sun shines
In a land that's turning grey

And it's a cruel memory
To look back on who we were
'Cause my past is a poison
And I'll never find a cure

Away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

Away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
I might as well be yours

Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

Take me away
