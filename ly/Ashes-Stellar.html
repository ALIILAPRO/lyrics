		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now that I got a taste
I think that I'd suffocate
For every second that you aren't by my side
But now I'm stuck at the gate of Lucifer's estate
I fell in love with a girl I met in hell

Thinkin' about all the things 
The way you pull my strings
I love the way you turn me on 
I ain't Hades, but I'm the king
I'd do anything
So that I could take you home

She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posie 
I'ma fuckin' blow all the ashes down

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posie 
I'ma fuckin go crazy for you now

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posie 
I'ma fuckin' blow all the ashes down

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posie 
I'ma fuckin' go crazy for you now

Now that I got a taste
I'm gonna hallucinate
I think that I am trippin' off your love
I started playin' your games
You got me in a checkmate
Now you are the queen and I'm the pawn

Thinkin' about all the things
The way you pull my strings
I love the way you turn me on
You're the queen, so let me be your king
I'd do anything so that we could rule the world

She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posies 
I'ma fuckin' blow all the ashes down

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posies 
I'ma fuckin' go crazy for you now

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posies 
I'ma fuckin' blow all the ashes down

Ring around the rosie 
Pocket full of posies
I'ma fuckin' go crazy for you now

(Go crazy for you now)
(Blow all the ashes down)
