		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nah, nah, nah, ayy, ya, ya

I'm so done, I take my blood and drop that in your bitch
I've been thinking 'bout your lies since I was just a kid
Pussy niggas always talking 'cause they got no [?]
I don't worry 'bout no [?] unless you take my ring
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch (sweet)
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch, ayy

[?] for these niggas [?] a gang
I don't do no talking, all these pussies know my name
You said that you love me, I'm your light skin Novocaine
All you do is tell me lies and who's to blame
Watch me [?] your mind, I give you all my shit
Ride me through the night lil bitch, I know you like this dick
Find my in the grass, I'm laying over all my sins
Why you touch my face a bit
Look at alle these woman, they callin'
Ring, ring, ring, get on my phone, they say they want me
Still I fold these niggas like they origami
I could take your life and mine, kamakazi, ayy

I'm so done, I take my blood and drop that in your bitch
I've been thinking 'bout your lies since I was just a kid
Pussy niggas always talking 'cause they got no [?]
I don't worry 'bout no [?] unless you take my ring
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch (sweet)
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch
Let me die, let me die, let me die, bitch
