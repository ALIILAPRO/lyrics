		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Sir Luscious gots gator belts and patty melts and Monte Carlo's
And El Dorados, I'm wakin' up out of my slumber feeling like Rollo
So follow, it's Showtime at the Apollo minus the Kiki Shepards
What about a ho in a leopard-print?
Teddy Pendergrass, cooler than Freddie Jackson
Sippin' a milkshake in a snowstorm
Left her throat warm in the dorm room at the A.U
We blew hay too, athletes might cake you
But you must have me mistaken with them statements that you make
'Cause

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Canary yellow seven-nine Seville is on display
My nigga Bongo hooked it up, Omar gon' dip my rims today
So a nigga can ride out to the Honeycomb Hideout
I'ma show you how to wild out like Jack Tripper
Let me be bambino on your snipples
Ykk on yo' zipper, lick you like a lizard when I'm slizzerd
Or sober, six million ways to fold ya
Like Noah's, I get two's of youse and you get pretty 'D'
But I'll call yo' ass 'round eight-ish I know you'll be there for me
Girl

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Those huge baby eyes, get to runnin' off at they mouth
And tellin' me everything that's on yo' nasty mind
They say you're malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
And invitin' me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are, love who you ain't, you're so Anne Frank
Let's hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick James'n, no chains and whips
I do suck lips 'til hips jerk
In double time the boy next do's a freak, ha ha

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

(And we are) The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(In my mind) The sky is falling ain't no need to panic
(But Oh oh) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Oh oh oh) Compatible created in the attic

(And we are) The coolest motherfunkers on the planet
(In my mind) The sky is falling ain't no need to panic
(But Oh oh) I got a stick and want yo automatic
(Oh oh oh) Compatible created in the attic

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)

Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Don't you think I'm so sexy? I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
Ain't nobody dope as me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
(So fresh and so clean clean)
I love when you stare at me I'm dressed so fresh so clean
