		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I thought it'd feel different playing Wembley
Eighty thousand singing with me
It's what I've been chasing 'cause this is the dream

When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we start talking the way that we do

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
(Mm-hmm, mm-hmm)

The greatest thing that I have achieved
This four little words, down on one knee
Said, "Darling, are you joking?"
And I just said, "Please"

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said, "I love you"
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
(Mm-hmm, mm-hmm)

Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

First kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance, moonlight, in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child, and then a million more first times
