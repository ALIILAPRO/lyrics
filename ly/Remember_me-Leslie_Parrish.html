		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel you so close to me 
I hope you still think of me 
Even I know you found another love 

You took away my chance to 
Be with you forever 
To be your love and stay together 
You gave away the precious love 
That we had to somebody else 
Oh baby I want to tell you 

Remember me 
Remember everything we used to be 
Can you feel my heart pounding, pounding 
Will be forever, will you 
Remember you, remember me 
I remember everything we used to be 
'Cause my blood is still pumping, pumping 
Will be forever, will you remember me 

I need you, but it's o.k. 
I know that, I'll find my way 
I will begin to find another love 

You took away my chance to 
Be with you forever 
To be your love and stay together 
You gave away the precious love 
That we had to somebody else 
Oh baby I want to tell you 

Remember me 
Remember everything we used to be 
Can you feel my heart pounding, pounding 
Will be forever, will you 
Remember you, remember me 
I remember everything we used to be 
'Cause my blood is still pumping, pumping 
Will be forever, will you remember me 

I feel you 
Even I know 

Be with you forever 
To be your love and stay together 
You gave away the precious love 
That we had to somebody else 
Oh baby I want to tell you 

Remember me 
Can you feel my heart pounding, pounding 
Remember you, remember me 
'Cause my blood is still pumping, pumping 
Will be forever, will you remember me
