		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday was a hectic
There was nothin' romantic
If I can just find a reason
To keep this endless chasin'(chasin', chasin')
Yesterday was a hectic
There was nothin' romantic
If I could only imagine
Just one another heaven (yeah, yo)

또 멋쩍은 나의 웃음
낡아빠진 추억들
할 말이 없는 사람들의
돌고 도는 liquor talks
하루 더 죽어가는 느낌
밤의 올림픽대로
형형한 불빛, 난폭한 택시
이젠 지겨워진

Met the people, people, people (talkin' same shit)
Hate the reason, reason, reason (that they all spit)
If bornin' is a pain
How should we do this game?
Keep on thinkin', thinkin' and I

Yesterday was a hectic (na-na-na, na-na-na)
There was nothin' romantic (na-na-na, na-na-na)
If I can just find a reason (na-na-na, na-na-na)
To keep this endless chasin'(chasin', chasin')
Yesterday was a hectic
There was nothin' romantic
If I could only imagine
Just one another heaven (yeah)

Yeah 어디로 가는지도 모르게
적어 내려갔던 시도
어느덧 걸어온 그 길이 되었네
지난 기억 속에
더 이상 길을 잃고 싶지 않은 날
좀 구해줘

Met the people (yeah) people (yeah) people
(Talkin' same shit)
Hate the reason (yeah) reason (yeah) reason
(That they all spit)
If bornin' is a pain
How should we do this game?
Keep on thinkin', thinkin' and I

Yesterday was a hectic (ooh)
There was nothin' romantic (na-na-na, na-na-na)
If I can just find a reason (na-na-na, na-na-na)
To keep this endless chasin'(chasin', chasin')
Yesterday was a hectic
There was nothin' romantic
If I could only imagine
Just one another heaven (yeah)

Yo, hangover's over
관능적인 이 도시의 posture
슬픈 밤 서울을 위한 nocturne
우린 알면서 또 하루를 놓쳐 (ooh)
Ayy 행복이란 뭘까?
그토록 바래왔던 작은 평화
마음이 빛바랜 자들을 떠나
마침내 우리가 수놓은 별밤
꿈을 꾸듯 눈을 감아
지그시 숨을 참아
춤을 추는 사람들의
걸음은 곡선으로 oh, yeah
흘러가는 걸 붙잡을 수는 없대도
We still love and hate this city, yeah
