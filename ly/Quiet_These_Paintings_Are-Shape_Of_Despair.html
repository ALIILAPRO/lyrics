		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Quietly these colours will fade
But soon they will be as one.
For a moment I will stare
Into this deep saddened sea
And will suffer the death's fright.

Under these waves emotions lay,
Still never they'll return
As they are laid to rest. 
Into this one lonely life,
Which, perhaps is growing.
Painfully
Into life to die
