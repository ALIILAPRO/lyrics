		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Let me see you pop that, let, let, let me see you pop that
Let me see you pop that, let me, let me see you pop that
Let me see you pop that, let me, let me see you pop that
Let me see you pop that (let, let), let me see you pop that

Pj taking off, we 'bout to take flight
Cali on a Friday, it's a date night
We might go to Vegas in the same night
Oh, I got on that dress you like to take off (take it off)
You start to rise before we even take off (we takin' off)
All your hard work is 'bout to pay off
You ready?

Oh, all day and night
I can't get you off my mind
Oh, all night and day (all night and day)
Can't nothing get in our way

So when the babies go to sleep, come get on me
And when we get to round three, that's an OT
And when I put it on you, baby, put it on me
Put the phones DND, we be low key
So come and pull up on my body, baby, beep, beep
Tonight I left the water running, got that sweet, sweet
So if they looking for you, if they looking for me
Put the phones DND, we be low key

And I know, I know (let me see you pop that) 
I know, I know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
You know, you know (let me see you pop that) 
You know, you know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
We know, we know (let, let, let me see you pop that) 
We know, we know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
On the low, on the low (let me see you pop that
On the low, on the low (let, let, let me see you pop that)

So much square feet and still we can't hide
Later on come meet me on the east side
Come and take a ride on the water slide, oh
Legs sitting up like the peace sign
Baby, don't say, "Bye", come and say, "Hi" (Hi)
Got me singing out, "Oh my, oh my" (my, my, my)

Oh, all day and night
I can't get you off my mind
Oh, all night and day (all night and day)
Can't nothing get in our way

So when the babies go to sleep, come get on me
And when we get to round three, that's an OT
And when I put it on you, baby, put it on me
Put the phones DND, we be low key
So come and pull up on my body, baby, beep, beep
Tonight I left the water running, got that sweet, sweet
So if they looking for you, if they looking for me
Put the phones DND, we be low key

And I know, I know (let me see you pop that) 
I know, I know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
You know, you know (let me see you pop that) 
You know, you know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
We know, we know (let, let, let me see you pop that) 
We know, we know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
On the low, on the low (let me see you pop that
On the low, on the low (let, let, let me see you pop that)
I know, I know (let me see you pop that) 
I know, I know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
You know, you know (let me see you pop that) 
You know, you know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
We know, we know (let, let, let me see you pop that) 
We know, we know (let, let, let me see you pop that)
On the low, on the low (let me see you pop that
On the low, on the low (let, let, let me see you pop that)

Let me see you pop that, let, let, let me see you pop that
