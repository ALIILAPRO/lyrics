		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, here comes Sherry
What's up with her and her homeboy?
Don't know, man
One minute they're kicking and one minute they're not
I know what it's gonna take
What? That one kiss goodnight, that's it

1-Before I let you go, before I let you go
  Can I get a kiss, goodnight, baby  (2)

Baby(rpt 1, 1)

Lately, I've been thinking something's going wrong
'Cause you got an attitude
And you're not in the mood like you used to
Girl, I can feel it when I hold you in my arms
The feeling is not the same
Can I be the one to blame?

2-I don't want to lose your love, mmm
  I don't want to say bye-bye, oh no no

True love is so hard to find
And it's right between your lips and mine, and mine
(rpt 1, 1)

Turn the lights down low
Let's take it nice and slow
My mission is to keep you mine
Don't want this to be the last time
We make sweet love
Baby, I know you feel it, too
It's bigger than the both of us
There's one thing I'm so certain of
(rpt 2)

It's always the little things, I remember
And I can't just let it slip away
Slip away  (rpt 1)

Teddy, won't you play the music for me
Teddy, won't you play Backstreet side?
Baby I get so lonely
Sometimes, I...
Baby my heart is broken sometimes
I need you right now, I don't...
I can't let you slip away, slip away
(rpt 1)     

I don't see it being a problem
If I just get one little bitty kiss baby...
I just can't let you get away, oh yeah...
Lord, have mercy...
I don't want lose your sweet love
So don't say good-bye, say good-night
