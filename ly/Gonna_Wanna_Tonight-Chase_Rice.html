		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want to climb a ladder on a water tower
Then we'll kick it with the stars for a couple hours
If you want to then we're gonna get away up high
If you want to dip your toes where the water stops
Then we'll let our feet hang off a fishing dock
If you want to then we're gonna have to give it a try, that's right

If you want to go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to falling down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine

If you wanna then we're gonna, girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna, girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

If you wanna catch a buzz and ride it til the morning
Let's get two plastic cups and baby I'll get to pouring
It don't really matter if it's whiskey or wine, it's fine

If you want to go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to falling down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine
Fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there, girl just close your eyes

If you wanna then we're gonna, girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna, girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

You're gonna wanna get a little closer
You're gonna wanna slide it on over
You're gonna wanna

Gonna wanna go way out where there ain't nobody around
And let your long hair get to falling down
And let your red lips leave their mark all over mine
Come on, fill up the night air with the radio
And put your hands wherever they wanna go
Yeah, we're right there, girl just close your eyes

If you wanna then we're gonna, girl
I hope you're gonna wanna tonight
If you wanna then we're gonna, girl
I hope you're gonna wanna all night

You're gonna wanna get a little closer
You're gonna wanna slide it on over
You're gonna wanna, gonna wanna tonight
