		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me that we'll always be together
We'll be riding horses all the way
'Cause boy I feel that men are meant to be
More than the shadows of each other

This road is finally standing up to the sky
Boy we're free, so what is fate to say
How things are gonna turn out now?

If storms are breaking over great escapes
Boy, we'll find how to make it with the rain
This rage will lead us through the burning plains
No matter what they say, we're heroes, boy we'll get to break out

Now we're finally standing up to the sky
Look at me, boy, so what is fate to say
How things are gonna turn out now?
Can't you see that we're dead until we wake up
All your dreams are about to happen now
We are racing to the break of dawn
