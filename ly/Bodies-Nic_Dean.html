		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a long walk back from the boulevard
I don't want this no more
Her eyes are rolling back and she don't wanna stop
She's a fein for this lifestyle
Can you feel the love
You can't put the past away
What you need is us
You remain so stuck in your ways
(Ways)
Ouuuuu
I can tell you all the things
That run through your body
Everything's an argument
But can't say that for your buh buh
Nobody
Does it like you
Yeah Nobody
Ain't collecting bodies
19 but so much is yet to come
Stay clean, polishing all I will come
Seen days of pain and all the tears shed for you
You really think it's fair, your games and all you do
Showed you all sides of me
Pinned me down like an enemy
You really thought that I wouldn't leave
You locked me like I was Khabib
There's so much I could say to you
I hold on to every word unsaid
Nothing I wouldn't do for you
But all you see is red
All you see is red
All you see is red
All you see is red
I can tell you all the things
That run through your body
Everything's an argument
But can't say that for your buh buh
Nobody
Does it like you
Yeah Nobody
Ain't collecting bodies
bo bo bodies
