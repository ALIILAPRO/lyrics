		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wide awake in this violet city
Where it washes over me
It hurts to say that I want you with me
Just draped across my frame

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go
Is when I find I'm in control, in control
Ooh, I need something else, the moment that I let it go
Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

Ooh
In control, in control
Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go
Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

In a maze of my expectation
I just feel so far away
Holding on to these empty spaces
As I try to find my way
'Cause I'm somewhere else
Surrounded by the city shelf
Trying to appease all my desires
'Cause I'm somewhere else
Believe me, I'm beside myself
I've been trying to change

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go
Is when I find I'm in control, in control
Ooh, I need something else, the moment that I let it go
Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

Ooh, I can't help myself, the moment that I let it go
Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control

Is when I find I'm in control, I'm in control
