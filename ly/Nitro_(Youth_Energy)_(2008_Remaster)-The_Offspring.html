		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Our generation sees the world
Not the same as before
We might as well just throw it all
And live like there's no tomorrow

Ooh, there's no tomorrow
Ooh, there's no tomorrow

We are the ones who are living
Under the gun every day
You might be gone before you know
So live like there's no tomorrow

(Ain't gonna waste this life) there's no tomorrow
(I'm gonna live it for me) there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life) there's no tomorrow
(I'm gonna live it for me)

Hey, believe it
Official view of the world has changed 
A whole new way 
Live fast 'cause if you don't take it 
You'll never make it 

So if you understand me 
And if you feel the same 
Then you will know what nitro means 
You'll live like there's no tomorrow 

(Ain't gonna waste this life) there's no tomorrow
(I'm gonna live it for me) there's no tomorrow
(Ain't gonna waste this life) there's no tomorrow
(I'm gonna live it for me) there's no tomorrow
