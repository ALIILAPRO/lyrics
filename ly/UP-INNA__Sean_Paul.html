		  Sean Paul
'Longside di big bad INNA
Mek dem know

Once upon a time there 
Was a girl who made a wish
To find herself a love and 
Finally make a switch (she ah pray fi it)
Then you came around, you 
Healed another stitch
And I'm glad about that 
I can finally make a switch (sweet)

And I know, yeah, I know
Many would like to be in my shoes
And I know, yeah, I know
With you, I got nothin' to lose (you dun know)

When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch

You can use that magic touch
You can use that magic touch

Baby girl, it insane that you feel all di pain
And you feel all di mental drain (yeah, yeah)
But you dun know S to the P
When mi deh, haffi go take you pon a different plane
Can't contain all di loving weh me got fi you, girl
Cah me wan' hear you call out mi name (yeah, call out my name)
And it's a shame dem wanna be your main
Baby girl, you know dem ah move too lame

And I know, yeah, I know
Many would like to be in my shoes
And I know, yeah, I know
With you I got nothin' to lose (suh it go)

When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch
When I'm down, you can bring me up
Up-up-up-up, up-up-up, up-up-up
And when I'm hurt you know I don't need much
You can use that magic touch

Yo, yo
Kissing and loving and such
Said she nah get enough
Said she wan' turn it up
Bad man ah handle di biz
Give her it like a wiz 
(You can use that magic touch)

With a likkle bit ah Henny and ah dutch
Press gas, we nah grudge
Cah you dun know she want it rough
Tell you seh me handle di biz
Give her it like a wiz 
(You can use that magic touch)
