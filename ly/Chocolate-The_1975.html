		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey now, call it a split because you know that you will
Oh, you bite your friend like chocolate
You say that we'll go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it, no we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now, think about what to do
Think about what to say
Think about how to think
Pause it, play it, pause it, play it, pause it

Oh, we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoat
And we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black from head to toe
We got guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
Now you're never gonna quit it
If you don't stop smokin' it
That's what she said
She said we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
And we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

Hey now, we're buildin' up speed as we're approachin' the hill
(Approachin' the hill, approachin' the hill)
Oh, my hair smells like chocolate
Hey now, you say you're gonna quit it, but you're never gonna quit it
Go get it, go get it, go get it, go get it, go
And play it cool

Oh, you said we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black, from head to toe
We've got guns hidden under our petticoat
We're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no

Well, I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Seriously better go
Oh no, well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go

(Hey)
We go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoat
And we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no
Yeah, we're dressed in black, head to toe
With guns hidden under our petticoat
No, we're never gonna quit it, no, we're never gonna quit it, no (no, no)

Well, I think we better go
Seriously better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Seriously better go
And well, I think we better go
Said the feds are here, you know
Said Rebecca better know
Seriously better go
