		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Travelled 'round the world, I no cast
But if I climb the train, e don pass you
Traveled 'round the world, now I found you
And if I catch the plane, e don catch
And I hope you gon' fly away today, aje
Yeah, I hope you gon' fly away today, aje
Mmm, but you know say I fly
So no dey reject me, oh I'm calling
I dey try, but you no dey get me ti ba n kerin
You go like fly
Allow me to spoil you with my money
You don cover my, cover my head oh
Bet you never met a girl you go wife up oh
And I'ma hold you down oh
Bet you never met a girl you go wife up oh
And I'ma hold you down oh
Hold you down with no excuse
Nobody fit damn you
Bet you never met a girl you go wife up oh
And I'ma hold you down oh, down oh

American love
Carry you go Tokyo
Anywhere you want to go
Anywhere you want to go
And I'ma give you some mmm, Nigerian love
Carry you go Jalingo
Anywhere you want to go
Anywhere you want to go

Travelled 'round the world, I no cast
But if I climb the train, e don pass you
Traveled 'round the world, now I found you
And if I catch the plane, e don catch
And I hope you gon' fly away today, aje
I hope you gon' fly away today, aje
Mmm, but you know say I fly
So no dey reject me, oh I'm calling
I dey try, but you no dey get me ti ba n kerin
You go like fly
Allow me to spoil you with my money
You don cover my, cover my head go oh
Bet you never met a girl you go wife up oh
And I'ma hold you down oh
Bet you never met a girl you go wife up oh
And I'ma hold you down oh

Hold you down with no excuse
Nobody fit damn you
Bet you never met a girl you go wife up oh
And I'ma hold you down oh, down oh

American love
Carry you go Tokyo
Anywhere you want to go
Anywhere you want to go
And I go give you some mmm, Nigerian love
Carry you go Jalingo
Anywhere you want to go
Anywhere you want to go
