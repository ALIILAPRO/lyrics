		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Get it girl, if you hear me get a reply
If you doing it big can you stay fly?
Gon' if you make ya ends and you love spend
Gon' if you wanna keep up with the latest trend

One hand in the air if you runnin' it
Other hand on your hip if you don't take no shit
Ooh, if you got no man, one friend and a couple kids
Ooh, 'cause I wrote this song for the chicks and it goes like this

Now won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?

I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a show you how to get it, girl
Go head, go head your turn

Lakesha hit me, Monique hit me
Shaniquam hit me, Ki-Ki hit me

I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a show you how to get it girl
Go head, go head your turn

Get it girls, don't need money from no man
Party hard as they want but still pay rent
Gon' if you got them pumps and bumps and the lumps for your humps
Gon' if you got the bread went ahead a bought you some

Get it girls, got good brains they ain't no scarecrow
If you call her outta her name she quick to let you know
Ooh, if you ain't just booty, you beautiful and smart
Ooh, if it ain't that hard then here come your favorite part

Now won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?

I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a show you how to get it, girl
Go head, go head your turn

Lakesha hit me, Monique hit me
Shaniquam hit me, Ki-Ki hit me

I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a, show you how to get it girl
Go head, go head your turn

Now won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?
Won't cha, won't cha hit me?

I'm a, I'm a get it girl
I'm a I'm a get it girl
I'm a show you how to get it, girl
Go head, go head your turn

Lakesha hit me, Monique hit me
Shaniquam hit me, Ki-Ki hit me

I'm a I'm a get it girl
I'm a I'm a get it girl
I'm a show you how to get it girl
Go head, go head your turn, ooh
