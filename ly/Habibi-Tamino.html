		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Something hides in every night
Brings desire from the deep
And with it comes a burning light
To keep us from our sleep

And as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine
Glances of a new day have arrived
And though he's not alone, he fears to never love another
And leave his heart forever with her smile

Haa-aah

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

Something died within a soul
Left the eyes to rust
And every time it is recalled
It covers all in dust

Haa-aah

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

And meanwhile, a whole lot goes down
Somewhere in the darkness, us together for a while
You loved it then, so did I
A feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again

Now don't leave it there, just give it a chance
If only I'd forget you after one last dance
But you're everywhere, yes you are
In every melody and in every little scar
Ah yes you are, you are

Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
And I am yearning
