		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Have you ever thought you found your place
till you miss a moment and you've been replaced?
have you ever found your peace of mind
just to have it taken for another time?

I've had enough to turn it around again.
I've had enough to take it all back.

Have you ever thought the best would come
till you realize that it had come and gone?
Have you ever got a second chance
just to fall in step and repeat the dance?

I've had enough to turn it around again.
I've had enough to take it all back.

Have you ever?

Have you ever found your sense of self
just to realize you're being someone else?
Have you ever thought you'd seen the end
till you realize it's going on again?

I've had enough to turn it around again.
I've had enough to take it all back.

Have you ever?

Have you ever seen the face of god
till you turn around and wonder what it was?
Or have you ever thought you've seen the light
till you turned around and you felt the knife?

I've had the time to turn it around again.
I've had the mind to take it all back.
