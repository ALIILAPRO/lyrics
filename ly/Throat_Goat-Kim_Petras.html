		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could take it all 
Love it big or small
Make it hit the wall 
I'm the throat goat
I just sucked my ex 
No gag reflex
I just had to flex 
I'm the throat goat

What's my name? 
What's my name?
What's my name? 
I'm the throat goat
What's my name? (Say it)
What's my name? (Say it)
What's my name? (Say it)
I'm the throat goat

These bitches can't suck like me
Walk in, I'm the sucking queen
Look around all eyes on me
Jack it off, I'ma suck it clean
These lips go la la la
This throat, Lady Gaga
Boys say, "hallelujah"
Give me that ya ya ya ya

Yeah, and it's got me very far (far)
Yeah, your man just bought me a car (car)
Yeah, I suck timber behind the bar (bar)
Yeah, I'm mother fuckin' star

I could take it all 
Love it big or small
Make it hit the wall 
I'm the throat goat
I just sucked my ex 
No gag reflex
I just had to flex 
I'm the throat goat

What's my name? 
What's my name?
What's my name? 
I'm the throat goat
What's my name? (Say it)
What's my name? (Say it)
What's my name? (Say it)
I'm the throat goat 

I'm the, I'm the throat goat
I'm the throat
I'm the throat goat
I'm the, I'm the throat goat
I'm the, I'm the throat goat
I'm the throat
I'm the throat goat
I'm the, I'm the throat goat

I could take it all 
Love it big or small
Make it hit the wall 
I'm the throat goat
I just sucked my ex 
No gag reflex
I just had to flex 
I'm the throat goat

What's my name? 
What's my name?
What's my name? 
I'm the throat goat
What's my name? (Say it)
What's my name? (Say it)
What's my name? (Say it)
I'm the throat goat
