		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Before this hits the ground,
Before this fades away,
I wanna let it out
And I don't wanna wait
So don't you let me down
And don't you hesitate
Before I turn around,
Before I walk away,
I want you to make me
Make me
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again
Believe again

If you could take the dirt
And wash it all away
If you could say the words
That make me want to stay
Just tell me there's a chance
To Hell with all the blame.
If you could take my hand,
If you could lead the way,
I want you to make me,
Make me,
Make me

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

Make me believe again
In some kind of faith
Help me to see again
Before it's too late
'Cause forever is never
That far away
Make me believe again,
Make me believe again,
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.

I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
I can't pretend,
Make me believe again.
