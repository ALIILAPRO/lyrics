		  Mm
Oh

The smell of your perfume
I thought I was immune
Lookin' around this room
Can't help but see the traces of you
This moment is surreal
I can't put into words how I feel

Twin
Where have you been?

Nobody knows me like you do (nobody)
Nobody gon' love me quite like you (nobody, yeah)
Can't even deny it, every time I try it
One look in my eyes, you know I'm lyin', lyin'
Body to body, skin to skin (I'm never gon' love like this)
I'm never gon' love like this again (again, yeah)
You were made for me (just for me)
Said you were made for me (only for me, yeah, yeah)
Think you were made for me
Oh yeah, you were made for me

It ain't every day
That I get in my feelings this way
I knew it was rare
'Cause before you, I never did care
Don't know what I would do
If I had to go on without you

Twin
Where have you been?

Nobody knows me like you do (nobody)
Nobody gon' love me quite like you (nobody, yeah)
Can't even deny it, every time I try it
One look in my eyes, you know I'm lyin', lyin'
Body to body, skin to skin (I'm never gon' love like this)
I'm never gon' love like this again (again, yeah)
You were made for me (just for me)
Said you were made for me (only for me, yeah, yeah)
Think you were made for me
Oh yeah, you were made for me

Made for me
Made for me
Made for me
Just for me, mm
