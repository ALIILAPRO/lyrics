		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heard you moved out of town on the weekend
Understand, but I'm sad that you're leaving
Are you up making friends with the ceiling?
Yeah, I know the feeling
I wasn't trying to let you down
I was just working my shit out
I'm sorry I didn't know how much I led you on

Growin' up is weird, sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird, fall in love for a year
And then I disappear, wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange, get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growing up is

Get emotional at two in the morning
It's a habit, know I shouldn't be callin'
Then you let me in, is that what you wanted?
Is this what we wanted?
Now you're back in town, no, I can't come around
Are we better without the what if's and doubts
Is this it?
Are we both too far gone to forget
And try again?

Growin' up is weird, sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird, fall in love for a year
And then I disappear, wish that you were here
Growing up is strange, get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growin' up is

Wish that you were here (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (wish that you were, wish that you were here)

Growin' up is weird, sleep with friends, break a heart
Question everything you thought
Split a pill, smoke a dart
Growin' up is weird, fall in love for a year
And then I disappear, wish that you were here
Growin' up is strange, get too close, push away
Thinking you would do the same
New regrets, new mistakes
Growin' up is strange when the one who's to blame
Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growin' up is weird

Oh-oh, bet I'll just disappear
Oh, will I just disappear?
Wish that you were here
Growing up is
