		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fox, whassup Fox?
What's up Case, how ya doin' baby?
Chillin', what's going down?
Ain't nothin', about to lace this track for ya real quick
Ya gonna flow in the joint for me?
Hell, yeah on some real live Foxy Brown shit
Yo, I'm a flow in the joint on some, some Case shit
The job is flow

Pa Pa just keep me laced up in
The illa Case be, Issac Mizrahi
Fuck around with Dolce Gabanna
Sippin' pure 'Zay with the Ill Na Na
Nigga you fuck around
And how you know you tease and you join
Nigga your royalties and your points
So what the deal is?
But Foxy Brown met Case, now we laced
Bonnie met Clyde now I'm up in Jamaica breaking all your paper

You're the only one for me
You're the only one I need
Can't nobody make me feel
The way you're making me feel
And girl you know this love is real

Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control

I'll spend the night with you
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
'Cause tonight you taste like ice cream

I want to make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again
Don't go away

Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control

What?
Let me get that Lex nigga
Sex, wetter than aquariums
Flashing, they get their ass in
Who fucks slow with lear jets and coups
My ones stackin'
You ain't know that I be mackin'
The extra set of keys
The thirty G's
Them trips to Belize, had you livin' on your knees
Not to mention the laced out crib in Dallas
The forty room palace
Sippin' Cristal-ise

Touch me, tease me
Feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go
Baby I'm about to explode
'Cause all my love you can control
