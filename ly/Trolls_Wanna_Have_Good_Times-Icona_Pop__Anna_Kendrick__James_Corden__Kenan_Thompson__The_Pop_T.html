		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Hey)
(Hey)

Woke up in the morning light
Today is the day that I do everything right
Now that I'm Queen, I've got a kingdom to run
'Cause Trolls, they wanna have fun
Yeah, Trolls just wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna (hey)
Trolls just wanna have fun

Lived underground to get away from the world
'Til I had my life changed by a beautiful girl
Just need the guts to tell her that she's the one
But you know, Trolls, they wanna have fun
Oh, Trolls just wanna have (hey)

That's all they really want
Some fun
When the working day is done
Oh, Trolls, they wanna have fun
Oh, Trolls just wanna have
(Hey)

Good times
These are the good times (we have a good time, yeah)
Leave your cares behind
These are the good times (havin' the best time, oh yeah)
Leave your cares behind
(Hey)

The chills that you spill up my back
Keep me filled with satisfaction
When we're done, satisfaction is what to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
Your groove, I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another

Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tiny Diamond is my name (Diamond)
Come straight from my Daddy's mane (mane)
My whole body's made of glitter (glitter)
And I'll throw it in your face (face)
I love when I make music
And the groove is in my bones (my bones)
Just like my aunt Queen Poppy
Someday, I'll sit on the throne (King Tiny)

Groove is in the heart, yeah
Groove is in the heart, yeah

Yeah
They just wanna, they just wanna (these are the good times)
They just wanna, they just wanna (these are the good times)
They just wanna, they just wanna (these are the good times)
They just wanna, they just wanna

Trolls just wanna have fun
