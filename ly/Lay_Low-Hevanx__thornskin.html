		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't be here
I can't see you
I just need to
Waste more time
Glass is breaking
For the taking
I just need to
Take what's mine

Lay low
Until the sun
Comes up
Let's go
The shadows
Are gone
Don't know
What you think
Of me
I hope so
That you're pleased
With me

Angels Dancing
Bishops prancing
They can't seem to
Turn it down
Lakes of fire
Deny desire
They just can't
Control themselves

And I'm waiting
For your heart
To mend
And everything
Feels so
Violent
I'll burn it all
I can't pretend
Now I just sit
In silence
If I go back
It all might end
And everything's too quiet
I think a lot
But when I talk
I seem so absent minded

Angels Dancing
Bishops prancing
They can't seem to
Turn it down
Lakes of fire
Deny desire
They just can't
Control themselves

I can't be here
I can't see you
I just need to
Waste more time
Glass is breaking
For the taking
I just need to
Take what's mine

Lay low
Until the sun
Comes up
Let's go
The shadows
Are gone
Don't know
What you think
Of me
I hope so
That you're pleased
With me
