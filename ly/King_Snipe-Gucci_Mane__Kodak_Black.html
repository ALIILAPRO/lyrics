		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shit, I love Guwop though 
Zuwop, 'cause I'm a big Z
Ya heard me?
Know what I'm sayin'?
Shoutout to Gucci, I think that's my dad 
You know, I was just jerkin'
(I just told Richie we rich)

Been said, "Whoopty-woop, whoopty-woop"
I was like, "Bet," know that was lyin'
When them bullets had came my way, I say, "I bet Kodak ain't dyin'"
We put murder backwards after, we turned red rum to wine
I'm that nigga that smack all the smackers so I'm the biggest stepper, 5'5
I'm a hot boy, my bitch the coldest, yeah, opposite attract
You got one time to raise your voice in here then I'ma get the strap
I've been chasin' that boy like a fly 'round the house but eventually, I'll get him clapped
All I ever had was the trap, I ain't have me no dad, so I got off my dick, yeah, I jacked

I've been true to this from the jump (uh-huh)
When I do it, consider it done (mm-hmm)
Fuck a shooter, bitch, 'cause I'm one
On point like I'm a dot
I'll swap me a body for a swap
Put a bag right on his top
I got murder all in my eyes, you see it, it's torture in my heart
Beat the pot like it's beef with the dope
Pop Percs, I don't drink, I don't smoke
I'ma leave 'fore I beat on a ho
I'm a Z but I'm P for sure
I've been lowkey, she a swoop
Need codeine with the boot
And I know she cheatin' too
But I ain't finna look for proof

I triple crossed them 'cause I seen it was planned
They tried to count me out, must didn't know how to count (what?)
Told her ring up, and didn't know the amount
Expensive new fabrics I couldn't even pronounce (it's Gucci)
No gun policy, stick in the party
Hope nobody gets out of they body
Got his self hurt, he was full of that molly (damn)
We ain't even wanna have to kill nobody (whoa, ooh)
Ridin' down Ocean like Fast and the Furious (Gucci)
Caught me red-handed, can't crank up the jury (damn)
Your boss is a pussy, your artist so scared (pussy)
Just a matter of time 'fore they take all your jewelry
These young niggas, they done made killin' a sport
They brazen, they'll take a switch to New York
So crazy, kill a pig, turn him into pork
I hope they don't try to get my lyrics in court (it's Gucci)

I've been true to this from the jump 
When I do it, consider it done 
Fuck a shooter, bitch, 'cause I'm one
On point like I'm a dot
I'll swap me a body for a swap
Put a bag right on his top
I got murder all in my eyes, you see it, it's torture in my heart
Beat the pot like it's beef with the dope
Pop Percs, I don't drink, I don't smoke
I'ma leave 'fore I beat on a ho
I'm a Z but I'm P for sure
I've been lowkey, she a swoop
Need codeine with the boot
And I know she cheatin' too
But I ain't finna look for proof

Man, I got juice but I want the lean
I'm smokin' deuce, I pour green
And I got boot but not on my feet
What did I do?
Caresha, please, baby
Bought you a Ring Pop to be funny
I'll take you to Kay's now if you like it
My Pomeranian puppy a Russian 
I brought this lil' beautiful bitch to the ugly
And I'm King Snipe and I came tucked
Yeah, I came tight, you ain't gettin' none
Miami nights, fuckin' in the club
Shakin' with the dice, it don't really bluff
I made a way, it's only us
Niggas hatin', don't mean much
All I did was run it up

I've been true to this from the jump (uh-huh)
When I do it, consider it done (it done)
Fuck a shooter, bitch, 'cause I'm one (I'm one)
On point like I'm a dot
I'll swap me a body for a swap (uh-huh)
Put a bag right on his top (your head)
I got murder all in my eyes, you see it, it's torture in my heart (it's there)
Beat the pot like it's beef with the dope
Pop Percs, I don't drink, I don't smoke
I'ma leave 'fore I beat on a ho
I'm a Z but I'm P for sure (uh-huh)
I've been lowkey, she a swoop (a swoop)
Need codeine with the boot (she bad and bougie)
And I know she cheatin' too
But I ain't finna look for proof
