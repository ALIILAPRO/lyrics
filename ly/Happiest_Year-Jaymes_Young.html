		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm really on the ropes this time
I've been fighting all my life for you
I never should have said goodbye
But maybe that's what stupid people do

'Cause you gave me peace
And I wasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again
Asking 
For nothing

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh

Don't think I could forgive myself
I'm sorry for the ways that I used you
And I could care less right now
But you know, you hurt me pretty good too

Yeah, we made each other bleed
And we tasted it
I'm here to admit
That you were my medicine
Oh, love, I couldn't quit
And I'm down on my knees again

Thank you for the happiest year of my life, oh
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, ooh

So wake me up when they build that time machine
I want to go back
Wake me up when you were sleeping next to me
'Cause I really loved you, ooh

Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life ohh
Thank you for the happiest year of my life, yeah
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
Thank you for the happiest year of my life
