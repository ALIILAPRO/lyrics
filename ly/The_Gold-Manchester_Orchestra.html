		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Couldn't really love you anymore
You've become my ceiling
I don't think I love you anymore
That gold mine changed you
You don't have to hold me anymore
Our cave's collapsing
I don't wanna be me anymore
My old man told me

"You don't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down"
Forty miles out of East Illinois
For my old man's heart attack

I believed you were crazy
You believed you love me

I don't wanna bark here anymore
Black Hills, the colly
Wasn't really dangerous for us
We just catch you coughing
What the hell are we gonna do?
Black mile to the surface
I don't wanna be here anymore
It all tastes like poison

You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down
Forty hours out of Homestake
And I'm trying to translate you again

I believed you were crazy
You believed you love me
You and me, we're a day drink
So lose your faith in me

You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down
You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe

I believed you were crazy
You believed you love me
You and me, we're a day drink
So lose your faith in me
Lose your faith in me
Oh, lose your faith in me
