We nah go fall
We ah go go, we go win, you go know
All of the blessings fall on my yard
Blessings dey for my yard

And like that
E go be, you see, you go feel
Because the blessings fall on my yard
Blessings fall on my yard, yard, yard, yard

That's why I sip my alcohol
I don't wanna reason bad things no more (oh no)
I don't wanna go back to where I dey before
Make nobody stress me no disturb me jo jo jo

I sip my alcohol
I don't wanna reason bad things no more (oh no)
I don't wanna go back to where I dey before (ooh yeah)
Make nobody stress me no disturb me jo jo jo
