		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Savor the taste
Savor the pain
I don't expect you to release me
Jumping the gun
Holding my tongue
I'd never ask you to forgive me

And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Playing your part
Playing the game
I don't expect you to believe me
Missing the mark
We tear it apart
I never ask you why you need me

And you will never see my side
And I will always think I'm right
But I always regret the night
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever

What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe it's too much for you
What else should I say?
What else could I do?
Maybe I am just too much for you

Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
Forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
I told you I would hate you 'til forever
