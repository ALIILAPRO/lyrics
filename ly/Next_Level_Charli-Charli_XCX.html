		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speeding on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

And bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speeding on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever

And drop body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speeding on the highway
Vroom vroomming, might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

And roll with your friends out 'til 7AM
Come and meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speeding on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

And bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speeding on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever

And drop body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speeding on the highway
Vroom vroomming, might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

And roll with your friends out 'til 7AM
Come and meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever

(XCX)

And bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speeding on the highway
Flame burning, tire screams
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever
