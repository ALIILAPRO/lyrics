		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Verse 1 - MASN)
I’ll be the stitches to your scars babe, just hold me just hold me
And I’ll build the stairs to our stars babe, just hold me just hold me
Hold me
Just hold me
Just
Just hold me
Hold me
Just hold me
Just
Just hold me


(Chorus)
Skating with bro all the time clearing these gaps is clearing our minds 
I was skating home from third grade and all my friends were so real
That Baker skateboard should have took her place but
You left that
That hurt me
And I’ll be the stitches your scars if 
If you would hold me, if you would hold me
And I’ll build these stairs to our stars babe, if you’ll hold me


(Verse 2)
But I’ll be your friend anyway just so we can getaway 
Let’s just skate down the interstate
On broadway
Man let’s meet right here same time every single day
I’ll be your friend anyway just so we can getaway 
Let’s just skate down the interstate
On broadway
Man let’s meet right here same time every single day


(Bridge)
There ain’t nothing going on outside but rain thinking I’m emotionally gone down drains
And it’s weighing on my mental cause I don’t see change 
I don’t see the rain
I don’t see the rain
There ain’t nothing going on outside but rain thinking I’m emotionally gone down drains
And it’s weighing on my mental cause I don’t see change 
I don’t see the rain
I don’t see the rain


(Chorus)
Skating with bro all the time clearing these gaps is clearing our minds 
I was skating home from third grade and all my friends were so real
That Baker skateboard should have took her place but
You left that
That hurt me
And I’ll be the stitches your scars if 
If you would hold me, if you would hold me
And I’ll build these stairs to our stars babe, if you’ll hold me, if you’ll hold me


(Verse 3 - Mishaal)
Keep it in I wish you’ll talk in the moment
Keep it locked and get me talkin I’m hoping
And maybe someday I can speak and I’ll own it
And maybe someday I can breath and I’ll hold it

I’ll be the stitches to your scars babe
Just hold me
Just hold me
I’ll be the stitches to your scars babe
Just hold me
Just hold me

Hold me
Just hold me
Just
Just hold me
Hold me
Just hold me
Just
Just hold me


(Outro - MASN)
I’ll be the stitches to your scars babe, just hold me just hold me
And I’ll build the stairs to our stars babe, just hold me just hold me
