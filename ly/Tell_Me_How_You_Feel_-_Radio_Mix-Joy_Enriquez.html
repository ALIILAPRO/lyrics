		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh yea yea yea yea

Your on my mind, had another sleepless night
And all I think about is that I want you here and now
What I want to say, is that I want you in my life
I need you to hold me, make it feel so right

There's no other love
your everything that I'm lookin for and more
why are you so shy
when your walkin right by, I get this feeling inside

[Chorus]
Baby, I want you, but I don't know what to say
I see you everyday when you come around my way
I want you to know that I'm in love with you 
so baby come on, come on, and tell me how you feel

My friends all say that I'm wasting my time
I don't listen to them cause I know your gonna be mine
They don't understand the feelings inside
All I want from you is that you give me a sign

Tell me how you feel
(Tell me how you feel)
I see it in your eyes when your walkin by, you feel me
I feel you too
why are you so shy
when your walk by, I get this feeling inside

[Chorus: x2]
