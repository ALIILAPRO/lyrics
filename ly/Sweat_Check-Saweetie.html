		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's Saweetie, bitch
And look
I know y'all tired of me talkin' 'bout a rich nigga
But you are who you fuck
And I'm a big spender
Hahahahaha, let's go

I could make a rich nigga chase
Pull that durag off, know I love fresh waves
Fat cheeks and a lil' bitty waist
East side nigga but he wanna be bae, okay
Bad bitch, gotta say it, life's short
Turn it over, put the ball in my court
Squat down, shit, I'm creasin' my Forces
I get a nigga hooked, no cords

Saweetie so single, need a freak like a Taurus
You don't wanna take me shoppin'? That's borin'
Flyin' foreign, private boardin'
Mile High Club every night I'm tourin'
I'm pretty like JAY-Z, fine like Lori
New flip flops, cool, bitch, that's Tory
Countin' up a mill' in house like Corey
Baby daddy love me, bitch, sorry, not sorry
I-I-I don't know your nigga, amnesia
He a fangirl, it ain't nothin' deeper
Niggas always beggin' like Felicia
Freaky bitch, I might pull up in some pleasers (yeah)
He could work hard but it's easy to me
Niggas gon' flock but I leave 'em to flee
Fuck this means? Don't believe in the tweet
He don't know my real name? He believe that it's sweet

I could make a rich nigga chase
Pull that durag off, know I love fresh waves
Fat cheeks and a lil' bitty waist
East side nigga but he wanna be bae, okay
Bad bitch, gotta say it, life's short
Turn it over, put the ball in my court
Squat down, shit, I'm creasin' my Forces
I get a nigga hooked, no cords

It's a pretty bitch summer
Get lit, free drinks, fake numbers
Hunnid missed calls in my phone, no wonder
Stone cold stunner, got thighs like thunder
Treat me like Aretha, francs for a diva
Listen to your niggas, they tell you I'm a keeper
If you never knew me that'd prolly be cheaper
If you never knew me, you been know I don't need ya

It's time for sweat check, it's time for sweat check
Hands on your knees, we through the streets
Like it's the Freaknik
It's time for sweat check, it's time for sweat check
Hands on your knees, we through the streets
Like it's the Freaknik
