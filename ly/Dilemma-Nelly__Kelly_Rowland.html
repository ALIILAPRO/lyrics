		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you
I do need you

No matter what I do (woo)
All I think about is you (uh huh)
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you (uh, uh, uh, uh)

I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me and uh
She got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood done seen
But oh, no, oh, no
She got a man and a son though (check it)
But that's okay 'cause I
Wait for my cue and just listen, play my position like a shortstop
Pick up everything mami hittin'
And in no time (no time)
I'm gonna make this one here mine
And that's for sure 'cause I
I never been the type to break up a happy home, but uh
There's somethin' 'bout baby girl I just can't leave alone
So tell me, Ma, what's it gonna be? She said

You don't know what you mean to me (come on)

No matter what I do (woo)
All I think about is you (uh huh)
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you
No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

I see a lot and you look and I never say a word
I know how niggas start actin' trippin' out here about they girls
And there's no way
Nelly gon' fight over no dame (I ain't fighting' over no dame)
As you can see, but I
I like your steez, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holla and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that's gangsta
And I got special ways to thank ya
Don't you forget it, but uh
It ain't that easy for you to pack up and leave him, but uh
You and dirty got ties for different reasons
I respect that and right before I turn to leave, she said (she said, she said, she said)

You don't know what you mean to me (come on)

No matter what I do (woo)
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo (yeah)
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you (put your hands up)
No matter what I do (put your hands up)
All I think about is you (yeah)
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you

Sing it for me, K

And I love you (word?)
And I need you (uh)
Nelly, I love you (uh)
I do (come on, girl)
And it's more than you'll ever know
Boy, it's for sure
You can always count on my love (uh)
Forever more, yeah, yeah

East coast, I know you shakin' right (uh huh)
Down South, I know you bouncin' right (ay hey)
West coast, I know you walkin' right, 'cause (uh, uh, uh, uh)
You don't know what you mean to me (Midwest, I see you swingin' right)

No matter what I do (yeah)
All I think about is you (uh uh)
Even when I'm with my boo
Boy, you know I'm crazy over you (uh, uh, uh, yeah)
No matter what I do (yeah)
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo (check it, check it, check it)
You know I'm crazy over you (check it, check it, check it)

East coast, I know you shakin' right (uh-uh)
Down South, I know you bouncin' right (uh-uh)
West coast, I know you walkin' right
You don't know what you mean to me (Midwest, I see you swingin' right)

East coast, you still shakin' right (uh-uh)
Down South, I see you bouncin' right (ay hey)
West coast, I know you walkin' right, 'cause
You don't know what you mean to me (Midwest, I see you swingin' right)

No matter what I do (woo)
All I think about is you (uh huh)
Even when I'm with my boo

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I'm with my boo
You know I'm crazy over you (yeah yeah)

You don't know what you mean to me (Midwest, I see you swingin' right) (uh)

East coast, you still shakin' right (yeah)
Down South, I see you bouncin' right (dirty, dirty)
West coast, I know you walkin' right
You don't know what you mean to me (Midwest, I see you swingin' right)
