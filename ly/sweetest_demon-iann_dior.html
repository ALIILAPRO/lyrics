		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay, I'm feeling insane, tryna put the pieces together
But my brain don't work that way
I left you so selfishly
Knowing I was wrong, oh
Today, I found the words, the ones you never heard
The ones that I should have said, but then I never did
Waiting for the day, dragging you along
Knowing I was wrong, should have never took this long

You were the sweetest demon I could ever love
I did those things, so did you, and they were wrong
Toxic in every way, I know it got rough
Staring at the left side of my bed, and you're gone
So, I'm writing this song

Always found myself getting higher
Fading every problem, coming down to the wire
Why am I like this? It's hurtin', but I'm tryin' to hide it
I can't explain, so these pills I've been trying
Fade 'em all away, acting like I'll be okay
But in the back of my mind, I know it's all a lie
And this road I've been takin' only end with goodbyes
So, I'm saying goodbye

You were the sweetest demon I could ever love
I did those things, so did you, and they were wrong
Toxic in every way, I know it got rough
Staring at the left side of my bed, and you're gone
So, I'm writing this song

Life has never felt so good, with or without you
I'm right here facing another one, easing my mind, my mind
No longer crying out for help, after all that I have felt
I'm better dealing with this alone

Always found myself getting higher
Fading every problem, coming down to the wire
Why am I like this? It's hurtin', but I'm trying to hide it
I can't explain, so these pills I've been trying
Fade them all away, acting like it'll be okay
But in the back of my mind, I know it's all a lie
And this road I've been taking only end with goodbyes
So, I'm saying goodbye

You were the sweetest demon I could ever love
I did those things, so did you, and they were wrong
Toxic in every way, I know it got rough
Staring at the left side of my bed, and you're gone
So, I'm writing this song
