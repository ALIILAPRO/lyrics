		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rest in peace to the world, it's the end as we know it
Death is pulling up and taking everyone heroic
Evil's at the top, take a look at who's in office
Sometimes I fear that it's too late to stop it
R.I.P. X, R.I.P. Peep, R.I.P. Mac, you're in heaven now relax
This shit got me tearing up, it's like it's one after another killed
Hurts me but imagine how the mothers feel
Got me feeling like I never wanna pop another pill
Too many legends taken away, I can't believe it's fucking real
Damn
What do we do?, so many people that look up to you
Especially kids, look at the youth
Suicidal but you help them get through
Fuck
Got me thinking man, I don't wanna die too soon
Got a lot of shit that I still wanna do
Just turned 22 and I still want the coupe
And I still wanna buy my mom a house and a pool
Goddam goddam, it's a crazy ass life
Might go out with a needle, might go out with a knife
All legends die young, R.I.P. to the greatest
You will always live on through the music you created
So I gotta thank you for making me, me
Cause without your music, don't know who I'd be
Today a angel OD'd, this is my eulogy
Rest in peace to the world, it's the end as we know it
Death is pulling up and taking everyone heroic
Evil's at the top, take a look at who's in office
Sometimes I fear that it's too late to stop it
R.I.P. X, R.I.P. Peep, R.I.P. Mac, you're in heaven now relax
This shit got me tearing up, it's like it's one after another killed
Hurts me but imagine how the mothers feel
