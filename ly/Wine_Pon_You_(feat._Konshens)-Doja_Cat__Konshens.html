		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't got my eye on you
Ain't been hypnotized by you yet
Ain't in here tryna find my dude
I take it you just like the way I wine pon you

How I whine pon you
The way I whine pon you
How I whine pon you
The way I whine pon you, yeah
Take it, you just like the way I whine pon you (the way I)
Take it, you just like the way I whine pon you, yeah

You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens (yeah)

Yeah, yeah
Pop that like Ginkgo biloba
That booty don't need no more soda
Too hot, now this boy don't need no more doja
Leg on the seat, that's a photo
See that you focused
If there's no room, boy, we'll squeeze in the corner
Way that he talking, you think that he know her
Hold up
See baby, this for the night, I won't see you tomorrow
Yeah, but when I dance here, boy you better man up
Be like a museum, got you looking, boy you can't touch
Yeah, I got him speaking, got him geeking, tie them hands up
Tappin' to the beat, you wanna freak her 'cause she random
Know you got your girl here, looking for your ass, run
Faking that you loyal, boy, you playing with her passion
Even when the beat slow, I shake a lil' faster
Twerking on the speaker, know you need her in your fan club

How I whine pon you
The way I whine pon you
How I whine pon you
The way I whine pon you, yeah (way I)
Take it, you just like the way I whine pon you (the way I, the way I)
Take it, you just like the way I whine pon you, yeah

You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens
You can catch her in the Vogue or Hustler magazine (ha)
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens (oh yeah)

Baby girl, badman a wuk yuh wit no neardy
Make underwear fly like birdie
When me call, you cum early
Make you wanna get down and dirty
When you whine up your body so slow
Punch line, solo
It's your show, be the star an done
When you back it up pon me mi nah back down

How I whine pon you
The way I whine pon you
How I whine pon you
The way I whine pon you, yeah (like the way I whine)
Take it, you just like the way I whine pon you (baby, when I, like it when I whine pon you)
Take it, you just like the way I whine pon you, yeah
