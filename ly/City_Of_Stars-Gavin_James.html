		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
That now our dreams
They've finally come true

City of stars
Just one thing everybody wants
There in the bars
And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants
It's love
Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else
A rush
A glance
A touch
A dance

A look in somebody's eyes
To light up the skies
To open the world and set me reeling
A voice that says, I'll be here
And you'll be alright

'Cause I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need is this crazy feeling
The rat-tat-tat in my heart

I think I want it to stay

City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
You've never shined so brightly
