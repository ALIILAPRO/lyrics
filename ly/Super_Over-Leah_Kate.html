		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We're not just done baby, we're super over

Let's play truth or dare
Dare you to leave
This hemisphere
No, no, I don't care
Where you've been sleeping
As long as it's not here

Every time you talk to me
I just want to scream
I'm not gonna lie and say it's not you, it's me

I left the city and I changed my number
We're not just done, baby, we're super over
My heart is empty for you, full disclosure
We're not just done, baby, we're super over
Over

Let's play would you rather
Would you rather go away
Or go away
Hey

Oh, 'cause I don't care
Who's in your sheets
As long as it's not me

Every time you talk to me
I just want to scream
I'm not gonna lie and say it's not you, it's me

I left the city and I changed my number
We're not just done, baby, we're super over
My heart is empty for you, full disclosure
We're not just done baby, we're super over
Over

Middle finger up so everybody knows, we're super over
Don't you call me up, not now or never, 'cause we're
Super over
Super over
Super over
Super over

It's really, really, really over

I left the city and I changed my number
We're not just done, baby, we're super over
My heart is empty for you, full disclosure
We're not just done, baby, we're super
Over
Over
