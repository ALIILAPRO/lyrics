		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Last night I heard the screaming 
Loud voices behind the wall 
Another sleepless night for me
It won't do no good to call 
The police always come late 
If they come at all 

And when they arrive 
They say they can't interfere 
With domestic affairs 
Between a man and his wife 
And as they walk out the door 
The tears well up in her eyes

Last night I heard the screaming 
Then a silence that chilled my soul 
I prayed that I was dreaming 
When I saw the ambulance in the road 
And the policeman said 
"I'm here to keep the peace 
Will the crowd disperse 
I think we all could use some sleep"
