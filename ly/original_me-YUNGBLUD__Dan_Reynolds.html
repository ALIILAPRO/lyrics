		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

I'm so sick of me, wake up and hate to breathe
And I pride myself in that, so dramatic, I'll admit
I'm so typical, my life ain't difficult
But I'm so caught up in it, just a lowlife, I'll admit
I'm self-critical, tryhard original
Oh, I pride myself on that, such a loser, I'll admit

And I ask myself
When my time will come
Will I run away?

Will I run away?
I'm the original loser
Some days I wish I was anyone else
I'm the original loser
Some days I wish I was anyone else

I'm so paranoid, most people I avoid
Not seeking sympathy (nah), I just want all of this
Under an umbrella (yeah)
I try to shelter myself from the rain
I try to stop my head from going insane
I'm counting down, all the days
I swear that there's a price they took
Being alone outside then
Can I suffocate you when they cannot fucking chase me, ayy
Anagram all of the letters
Tellin' me that I'm gonna be fine
Cleaning the world is out of my mind
Piece 'em together and dump on the sides
I'ma be alone tonight
If I try to stay alive
And realize I'm going blind

(Congratulations) I'm the original loser
Some days I wish I was anyone else
(Congratulations) I'm the original loser
Some days I wish I was anyone else

Don't let 'em change your mind
Don't let 'em change your mind (ooh)
And don't let 'em waste your time
Don't let 'em waste your time (someone save me)
Don't let 'em change your mind
Don't let 'em change your mind (loser)
Don't let 'em waste your time
Don't let 'em waste your time
Yeah, don't let 'em waste your time

I'm the original loser
(Congratulations)
Some days I wish I was anyone else
