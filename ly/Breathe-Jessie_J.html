		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything outside is grey and lonely
Sparkle like electricity in our city, yeah
Let's light it up

Falling under pressure I can feel the butterflies
So you blow smoke inside my mouth
You light me up

I can be your work of art for life
You just show me what you want tonight

So together we can breathe
Wanna give you all of me
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me,
When am fallin' to my knees
I wanna give you all of me
You don't have to take care of me, of me, of me
Together we can breathe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Love me, love me
Together we can breathe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Love me, love me

Addicted to the colours that your using on me
Cloud above my head are beautiful and red
Blow it up
Its crystal clear weather you know things
Just inhale me into your world
Blow it up
I can be your work of art for life
You just show me what you want for life

So together we can breathe
Wanna give you all of me
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me,
When I'm fallin' to my knees
I wanna give you all of me
You don't have to take care of me, of me, of me
Together we can breathe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Love me, love me
Together we can breathe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
Love me, love me
Together we can breathe
In and out its all I need to taste the sweet to feel complete
Ohhh
In and out its all I need to breathe to breathe we can breathe

I wanna give you all of me
Open up your eyes and love me, love me, love me
When I'm falling to my knees
I wanna give you all of me
You don't have to take care of me, of me, of me
So together we can breathe
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh ohh ohh
You love me you love me
So together can breathe
You love me, you love, you love me
So together we can breathe
