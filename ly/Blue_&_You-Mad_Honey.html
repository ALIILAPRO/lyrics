		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't worry baby I've been thinking about it
You've got a hand to hold when I'm sleeping on the floor
Hiding your face from me, lift a finger to the heat
It's the words we speak and the dangerous things we mean

I still believe it's true
I will believe you
If all the world remains this shade of blue
I'll forget it all but you
It's all blue and you
It's all blue and you

Coming to terms with all your wildest feelings
Gotta be far from me cause some things never change
If there is a reason I'll be living without you
Please don't fade away even if I do

I still believe it's true
I will believe you
If all the world remains this shade of blue
I'll forget it all but you
It's all blue and you
It's all blue and you
It's all blue and you
It's all blue and you

Maybe we'll make it out alive
Coming to terms, we're gonna be wild

I still believe it's true
I will believe you
If all the world remains this shade of blue
I'll forget it all but you
