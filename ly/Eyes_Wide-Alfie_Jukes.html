		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I need to iron out
These creases in the hotel floor
Can't help but move around
The lights look brighter than they're supposed to
We'd never leave this town
If it was up to me
Been searching for the sound
With you I think I might be close to

I'll let you know when your glows on the low
And we're taking a backseat for the next week

I'm loving you more
Than I have before
To see you with those eyes wide
What is it for?
Staring at the door
Just meet me with those eyes wide

Thoughts that could light a flame
I've queued them all up in my head
She's calling out your name
But she's a whisper and she knows you

I'll let you know when your glows on the low
And we're taking a backseat for the next week

I'm loving you more
Than I have before
To see you with those eyes wide
What is it for?
Staring at the door
Just meet me with those eyes wide

I'm loving you more
Than I have before
To see you with these eyes wide
What is it for?
Staring at the door
Just meet me with those eyes wide
