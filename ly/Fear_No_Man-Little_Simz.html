		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Huh

Rose petal mami, rose to be rose gold
I just demonstrate greatness they cannot show
No new friends can't be in welcomed in my section
See that little zone there, that's a no-go
Tell me who you know floatin' on a beat like this
You can't not respect it, I ain't asking you to like this
You can always trust I'll give you something to vibe with
Heads turn when I pull up looking stylish
Ain't your typical rapper, I ain't got my neck froze
Still your favorite artist couldn't even step close
Heard they want my crown but I ain't never stressed though
'Cause to your career that would be detrimental, c'mon

Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today

Get the hell from 'round me, I ain't playing
True I been I bad breed, I'm my dad's seed
Eyes low, mad lean, blame it on the green
Got a wealth of knowledge, you should listen when I speak
I was probably the hardest kid in the class to teach
Come get on my level, come get on my level
From a youngin', true, I been I different kinda rebel
Coming for it all, I'd be a fool if I just settle
The spirit guiding me, won't see me dancing with the devil
'Cause I

Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today

I get what I want when I want it
More time I don't even want it to be honest
To you my life like a movie on steroids
But to me it's just another day at the office
Put my mum on the cover of GQ
You can't relate 'cause that's something that G's do
Cut through, I'm bobbin' and weavin'
No one likes a pussy, don't be in your feelings
Ay, ten o'clock on the dot
Pull up in that new something from the lot
I think I'm being lowkey when I stepping in
But I'm Little Simz I forgot (oh my)
Tell 'em don't be on me looking for a way in (no, no)
Push me I'ma go Super Saiyan, nah I'm sayin'?
Don't get me irate, ain't no stopping God's plan
Everybody bleeds red so I fear no man

Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today
Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Bad energy go away
Leave me alone today

Oya come on fast fast, I don't got time
Somebody is waiting for me
Bye

Fear no man
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Fear no person
Fear no spirit
Fear nobody
Fear no man
Fear no evil
Fear no person
Fear nobody
