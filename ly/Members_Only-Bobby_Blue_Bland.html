		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Members only
It's a private party
Don't need no money
To qualify
Don't bring your checkbook
Bring your broken heart
'Cause it's members only, tonight

Say you lost your woman
Say you lost your man
You gotta lot a problems
All in your life
Well, they're throwing a party
For the broken hearted
And it's members only, tonight

Go tell mama
Go tell daddy
Red or yellow
Black or white
Throwing a party
All for the sad and lonely
It's members only, tonight

Members only
It's a private party
Don't need no money
To qualify
Don't bring your checkbook
Bring your broken heart
'Cause it's members only, tonight

Say you lost your woman
Say you lost your man
You gotta lot a problems
All in your life
They're throwing a party
For the broken hearted
And it's members only, tonight

Go tell mama
Go tell daddy
Red or yellow
Black or white
Throwing a party
For the sad and lonely
And it's members only, tonight

'Cause it's member only, tonight
'Cause it's member only, tonight
'Cause it's member only, tonight
