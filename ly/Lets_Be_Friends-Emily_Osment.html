		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, what's your name?
I think I like you
Come a little closer now
Wait, what'd you say?
Is that your girlfriend?
Think I'll be turning that around

Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna know,
What it would feel like?

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way
It doesn't matter what you say

I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down

Hey, let me flip though the pages to something outrageous
Potentially maybe it could be more
But don't get your hopes up, first let's just hook up
Maybe you'll be what I'm looking for

Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna?
Don't you wanna know,
What it would feel like?

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way
It doesn't matter what you say
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down

You got my permission
Don't need no admission
Cause I'm on a mission
You got my attention
There's no need to mention
The way
The way you feel

'Cause you're in my vision
I need a decision
So take a position
There's no need to question
My every intention
'Cause this
'Cause this is real

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way
It doesn't matter what you say

I'm knocking you down, down, down ('cause we're young)
I'm knocking you down, down, down
(Let's have fun, let's have fun)

I'm knocking you down, down, down ('cause we're young)
I'm knocking you down, down, down
(Let's have fun, let's have fun)

Let's be friends so we can make out
You're so hot let me show you around
I see what I want and I wanna play
Everyone knows I'm getting my way
It doesn't matter what you say
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down, down, down
I'm knocking you down
