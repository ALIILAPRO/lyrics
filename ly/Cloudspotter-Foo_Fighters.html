		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Big baby running high
Hope it don't sting when the feeling dies
I got sweet dreams, tucked in tight
Silver screen sister in a suit and tie
Two lovers sick and tired
Standing in the mirror it's my good side
Match made in heaven, show me the light
Burn the night down like a house on fire
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Burn the night down like a house on fire
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter

Calling on someone else's dime
Put your two cents where the sun don't shine

Swing, swing guillotine queen
Swinging from the left to the right
Bang, bang, bang, you're so mean
Go and look good, go and look good
Swing, swing guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang, bang, bang, you know what I mean
Go and look good, go and look good
Cloudspotter

Head ringing in the dead of night
Just a pair of lovesick parasites
Put me on hold, hold on tight
Everything's wrong when you've got no right
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Cloudspotter (cloudspotter)
Everything's wrong when you've got no right
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter

I need to know, but I don't ask why
Refuse me while I kiss the sky

Swing, swing guillotine queen
Swinging from the left to the right
Bang, bang, bang, you're so mean
Go and look good, go and look good
Swing, swing guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang, bang, bang, you know what I mean
Go and look good, go and look good
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter

I need to know, but I don't ask why
Refuse me while I kiss the sky

Swing, swing guillotine queen
Swinging from the left to the right
Bang, bang, bang, you're so mean
Go and look good, go and look good
Swing, swing guillotine queen
Cut me back down to size
Bang, bang, bang, you know what I mean
Go and look good, go and look good
Cloudspotter
Cloudspotter
