		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come on, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
Oh, I
I want to be with you everywhere
(Wanna be with you everywhere)
