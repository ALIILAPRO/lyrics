		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't imagine why you say the things you do
Maybe in time I'll understand
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel
When I'm trying everything I can

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way

Can you hear me? 
Am I really coming through? 
Why do your eyes seem to dance away?
I know what's right for you, haven't I always? 
I need you more than I can say

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way
And I'll never ever change

Ha
In my lifetime, I'll stay the same
Yes, I'll never, I'll never change
I'll love you, I'll stay the same

(My love is) running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
Fire burning bright
And it (keeps on) keeps on growing 
(Keeps on) keeps on growing 

Deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
Fire burning bright
And it (keeps on) keeps on growing 
(Keeps on) keeps on growing 

(Deeper than the night)
(Stronger than the north wind blowing) stronger, deeper
(Fire burning bright) fire, oh yeah
(It keeps on growing) keeps on growing 
(Keeps on) keeps on growing
(Deeper than the night) deeper
