		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you, yeah, I'm talkin' to you
Get over here, I said get over here
Gutter chump, ahaha
You know they say that money is the root of all evil
No wonder I love it so much

Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, $uicide death row
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, ridin' slow-mo in a four
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, $uicide death row
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, ridin' slow-mo in a four

Ayy, sold my soul to the Grey, became a household name
I claimed my grave and chained my name
I'm out the game, I don't play to win
I don't play at all and win by default
I climbed to the top just to see how far down I would fall (yikes)
Looked up at the heavens and thought they looked small
Below me, a valley of demons constantly scheming
I look back down, thinking "Fuck all of y'all"
I came into this world as an accident
Blazin' trails just to get a whiff of that blackened scent
Pull up in the Porsche if the Benz got in an accident (fuck)
I'ma have to get my car wrapped again
I'm back again, back against the wall
Tryna live it up before the curtain falls
White knuckle grip holding up my Grey cabal
Any questions? Give one of my managers a call (bitch)

Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, $uicide death row
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, ridin' slow-mo in a four
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, $uicide death row
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, ridin' slow-mo in a four

Used to hide from the pigs, now it's the IRS
Wetto still white trash, fuck all the alphabets
Ain't a damn thing changed but the change I got
All these chains came from pain and the blame I rock
Just gimme the drop, gimme the spot
Give me the time, give me the place
Ringing the nine, bringing the mob
Keeping the iron by my waist
Off of the lines like a race
My decline gave me space
To get my mind to redefine what the fuck I'm looking for today
So it's fuck an intro, fuck what you think you know
$crim was better on dope (fuck, I heard that before)
Pullin' crowds like the pope, heard you broke and it shows
I won't say no names, though, but he got a cameo (oh)
$uicide 'till the murder show (Grey-Grey)
Been gettin' head all around the globe
Backstage hoes, tell 'em, "Tally-ho!" (Maybe Oddy, though)

Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, $uicide death row
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, ridin' slow-mo in a four
Fuck an-fuck an introduction, bitch, you already know
$uicide death row, $uicide death row
