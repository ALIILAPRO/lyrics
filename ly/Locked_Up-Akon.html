		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm steady tryna find the motive (motive)
Why I do what I do?
The freedom ain't getting no closer (closer)
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen (stolen) 
No registration ('stration)
Cops patrollin' (patrollin')
Now they done stop me and I get locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no
They won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
They won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no
They won't let me out

Heading uptown to re-up (re-up)
Back with a couple keys (keys)
The corner block's on fire (fire)
Undercovers dressed as fiends (fiends)
Making so much money (money)
Product's moving fast (fast)
Put away the stash
As I sold the last bag
Fucked around and got locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out (my nigga, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no
They won't let me out (I got locked up)
They won't let me out
They won't let me out (baby girl, I'm Glocked up)
They won't let me out, no
They won't let me out

'Cause visitation no longer comes by (comes by)
Seems like they forgot about me ('bout me)
Commissary is getting empty (empty)
My cell mates eating food without me (without me)
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life (move on with my life)
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead, I'm here locked up

They won't let me out
They won't let me out (oh, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no
They won't let me out (my nigga, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out
They won't let me out (oh, oh, oh, yeah, I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, no
They won't let me out

Can you pay me a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Pay me a visit, baby (they won't let me out)
'Cause I'm locked up (they won't let me out)
Where's my lawyer? (They won't let me out)
I'm locked up (they won't let me out, no)
Get me out of here (they won't let me out)
Locked up (they won't let me out)
They won't let me out
Baby, I'm locked up (they won't let me out, no)
Where's my niggas on the block? Tell them I'm locked up
(They won't let me out)
I'm locked up (they won't let me out)
Oh (they won't let me out, no)
Can you please accept my phone call? (They won't let me out)
'Cause I'm locked up (locked up, locked up)
