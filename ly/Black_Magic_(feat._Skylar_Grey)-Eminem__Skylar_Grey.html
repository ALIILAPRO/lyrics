		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black magic, night walker (yeah)
She haunts me like no other (feel like)
Nobody told me (I don't know) love is pain, oh (I know we just met)
Black magic, dark water (but it's like)
Surrounds me like no other (it's like I know you better than anyone)
She's got my heart in chains

We're volatile, I can't call it, though
It's like too large a peg, and too small a hole (yeah)
But she cheats and I catch her like the common cold (sneeze)
Last time I broke her collar bone, she's intolerable (yeah)
All I know is that the sex is phenomenal, though
We're an unlikely pair (yeah)
Like two different Nike Airs
But I'm the same size she wears (Jordans)
So I think we're soulmates though (yeah)
People don't like us together but like we care (not me, not me)
Yeah, but God strike me dead (yeah)
She knows that I would walk over hot coals for her with both of my feet bare (yeah)
But soon as I asked to hit (asked to hit), it's like she grabs a switch (grabs a switch)
Turns me over her knee, 'cause my ass is whipped
Yeah, and I got her back, but I'm spineless (yeah)
So when she stabs me in mine (yeah), it's like I just can't feel the knife (what)
As she pokes, jabs it and slices
One minute she'll build me up (up)
The next, she'll push me 'round
Probably why she calls me "Dumbbell"
She lifts me up (yeah), then puts me down (huh)
But I am under her thumbnail
I must be under her spell
It's like lookin' right into a gun barrel
But none of these hoes can fuck with my girl
She got that

Black magic, night walker
She haunts me like no other
Nobody told me love is pain, oh
Black magic, dark water
Surrounds me like no other
She's got my heart in chains

We wake up, break up, make up
Like Maybelline, now she's all made up like make believe
Probably why she's so fake to me
But what the fuck's it gonna take for me to make her see?
Strip her naked and take her keys
I been plannin' this day for weeks but I can't tell if I'm wake or sleep
Or if this is actually happenin', sucker for pain
I'm stuck in this radioactive pattern
But hurt by her motherfuckin' hairs
All I imagine, dragon
She lunges, attacks, and scratches
But I ain't gonna stand for that shit
Like Kaep for the National Anthem
As I stab, I'm laughin'
So much for witchcraft and magic
Abracadabra that bitch
No turnin' back, I'm blackin'
As I say farewell to the love of my life, I cut and I slice
I give her one last hug, goodbye
Wipe the blood off my butterfly knife
Watch her fuckin' die right in front of my eyes
But in hindsight, think I just wanted to see what her insides look like
As I pop another five Vic's
That's what this high's like
Look down, there's blood on my Nikes
Shovel at my side, blood on my mic
Now wake up to music to be murdered by
Like
