		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can be naughty and I can be nice
I can be naughty, and I can see in your eyes
That you can be naughty, so I won't tell you twice
We can be naughty, I'm sugar, you're spice
Staying up late and writing wish lists
We're staying up late, you might get your wish
If the mistletoe's there, you might get a kiss
'Cause Christmas is coming, so let's take a risk, oh

Naughty and nice, oh, naughty and nice
Naughty and nice, we're your sugar and spice, oh
Naughty and nice, oh, naughty and nice
We're sugar and spice

We can be naughty and we can be nice
But if we wanna please Santa, we better think twice
'Cause we can be naughty at your roll of the dice, oh
We can be naughty, I'm the sugar, you're spice

Naughty and nice, oh, naughty and nice
Naughty and nice, we're your sugar and spice, oh
Naughty and nice, oh, naughty and nice
We're sugar and spice

Naughty and nice, oh, naughty and nice
Naughty and nice, we're your sugar and spice, oh
Naughty and nice, oh, naughty and nice
We're sugar and spice
