		  She's lookin' for me
She's lookin' for me
Oh, oh
She's lookin' for me
She's lookin' for me
Oh, oh
Can she save the night?
Can she save the night in time?
Can she save the night?
Can she save the night in time?

Call him on the weekend (weekend)
All her girls goin' out
Ragin' 'til Sunday (Sunday)
She just want some private time
Company ain't boring (boring)
This is just a love game
Tonight she'll be scoring (scoring)
Let go all the fears
Ain't no thinkin' twice (twice)
Finally he text back
Oh, I think he like me
Matter fact she know it
He smiles when he see her (see her)
Tequila and some R&B
Sex 'til she dizzy (dizzy)

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
(Baby girl, let me know)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
(Baby girl, let me know)

She's lookin' for me
She's lookin' for me
Oh, oh
She's lookin' for me
She's lookin' for me
Oh, oh
Can she save the night?
Can she save the night in time?
Can she save the night?
Can she save the night in time?

Come on (oh, yeah)
Think he all 'bout it (yeah)
Can't stall (yeah)
Have some fun ready (yeah)
Now she got the boy in a dream lovin' (yeah)
Heatin' up, can't get enough (yeah)
She never wanna leave, see the night's still young (young)
Smokin', feelin' free, makin' love to my tongue
He holds her tight
Sexing 'til the morning light

Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
(Baby girl, let me know)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why?
(Baby girl, let me know)

She's lookin' for me
She's lookin' for me
Oh, oh
She's lookin' for me
She's lookin' for me
Oh, oh
Can she save the night?
Can she save the night in time?
Can she save the night?
Can she save the night in time?
