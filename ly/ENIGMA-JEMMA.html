		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Slowly down to low

and it played around of game 

 

Falling down to low 

without anything, no fail 

 

Do I need to know

of my curiosity? 

 

Cause I found true blood

that was spread around the vain

 

Every kind of change

wasted life to leave the trace 

 

Raise it up

Raise it up

Raise it up

Come on and raise it up 

 

Lock down the generator, on man screw

Don't use the system, use the main plan 

 

Do I need to know 

of my curiosity? 

 

Cause I found true blood

that was spread around the vain 

 

Every kind of change

wasted life to leave the trace 

 

Raise it up

Raise it up

Raise it up

Come on and raise it up 

 

Raise it up

Come on and raise it up

Raise it up

Come on and raise it up
