		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart hurts in the worst possible way 
You came first but now we have to go our separate ways

Came back from work on a Friday, shit was crazy
Long distance FaceTimin' with the lady
Picked up the phone I said what's up? 
I'm good, you good? I'm good, not much
But I noticed something was wrong
Can't even look me in the eyes
Got a tracker on your phone,
I know that you been tellin' lies
Got the passwords to your shit
I see you texting other guys
I got all the proof I need, so why even deny?
Who'd you fuck? 
It's on my head you have to tell me I can't give it up, no
I think about it everyday I cannot go to sleep

I needa say
My heart hurts in the worst possible way 
You came first but now we have to go our separate ways

And then I went and took you back
My boy said I was crazy
That you'd do it again & that you manipulate me
Didn't listen, thought that I knew better
Thought if I left I could never do better
First love, first time, I'm sick
She's got a spell on me
That girl's a fuckin' witch
She casted hell on me
I feel like I'm a bitch, this is a shell of me

Fool me once, shame on you
Fooled me twice, now I'm looking like a fool
My head hurts and I don't know what to do

I made a song to say
My heart hurts in the worst possible way 
You came first but now we have to go our separate ways

I hope you hear this, I hope you hear this
I hope you hear this, I hope you hear this, I hope you hear this

I hope you hear this
