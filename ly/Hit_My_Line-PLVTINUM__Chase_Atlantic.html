		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You straight out of 99 babe
Dark denim over suede it's
Classic and understated

Damn

You were Bonnie and I was Clyde babe
Need to be separated
Captive but captivated

Heard me on the radio
You hit my phone
I said baby I need another night
To be alone
A cigarette on my window ledge
I wish I'd know
That baby we weren't finished yet

Hit My Line
Hit My Line
Baby call me
Anytime
But I won't call you mine

Draw the line
Draw the line
Baby I can
Lay you down
But I won't tell you lies

Hit My Line
Hit My Line
Baby call me
Anytime
But I won't call you mine

Draw the line
Draw the line
Baby I can
Lay you down
But I won't tell you lies

Hit my line
Get in line
She'll take whatever just to feel alive
What a life
Lays with the devil on her darkest nights
And she'll do anything to stay at night

Whatever she took it made her
Look at me sideways
Hop inside the Maserati and
Reverse out the driveway

Yeah, you can hit me Sunday to Friday but
Please don't hit me on my Saturdays
I'm fucked up on Molly
I'm saying

Hit My Line
Hit My Line
Baby call me
Anytime
But I won't call you mine

Draw the line
Draw the line
Baby I can
Lay you down
But I won't tell you lies

Hit My Line
Hit My Line
Baby call me
Anytime
But I won't call you mine

Draw the line
Draw the line
Baby I can
Lay you down
But I won't tell you lies

Hit my line
