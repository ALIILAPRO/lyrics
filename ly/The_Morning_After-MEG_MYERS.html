		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I couldn't sleep last night
There were lions and bears tearing you from my side
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like my daughter
It's burnt in my mind

And I can't feel anything the morning after you
And I can't tell anyone the morning after you

I couldn't sleep last night
You were chasing the birds 'till the beast caught your eye
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like an angel
It's burnt in my mind

I can't feel anything the morning after you
I can't tell anyone the morning after you

And I hope you sleep with a merry gold
I hope you win it this time
And I pray you don't fear the animals
I'll save you, I promise this time

I couldn't sleep last night
There were lions and bears tearing you from my side
I couldn't sleep last night
How you look like my daughter
It's burned in my mind

I can't feel anything the morning after you
I would give anything
