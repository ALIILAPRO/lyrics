		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was just coastin'
Never really goin' anywhere
Caught up in a web I was gettin kinda used to stayin' there
Then out of the blue
I fell for you

Now you're liftin' me up, instead of holdin' me down
Stealin' my heart instead of stealin' my crown
Untangled all the strings 'round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies

Kiss full of color makes me wonder where you've always been
I was hidin' in doubt 'til you brought me out of my chrysalis
And I came out new
All because of you

And now you're liftin' me up instead of holdin' me down
Stealin' my heart instead of stealin' my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied
I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies, yeah
You give me butterflies

Now you're liftin' me up instead of holdin' me down
You're takin' my hand instead of takin' my crown
Untangled all the strings round my wings that were tied

I didn't know him and I didn't know me
Cloud nine was always out of reach
Now I remember what it feels like to fly
You give me butterflies
You give me butterflies
