		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hi, I'm Baldi! Nice to meet ya
Fuck me in the ass and call me Patricia
Book's your game? Just shout my name
When you let me use my whip
So that's one book right
But you're all wrong
You haven't even let me use my thong
While I sing you this song
It goes "Ding dong"
Like the door I open on you
Here's a tip, abandon ship
Or you're gonna see me campfire willy

Oh, oh
Oh hi there! Welcome to my hooker palace
Oh, oh, oh hi there! Please don't leave
I have no friends
Oh, oh, oh hi there! Let's go camping
Let me touch ya
Oh, oh, oh hi there! Haha, I tied you up!

Every boy and girl, come dance around
Let's get an orgy started
Get the Bully's fists and the skipping rope
We'll fill your asshole with it
Gonna make it rain Coca-Cola
Gonna send you right back to detention
Pay attention to my dick's ascension
Sixteen bit's of dodgy tension
You cry, I just hit harder
You're wrong, I'll speed up faster
I rigged this for my pleasure
In this classroom, I'm the master
Oh, ohhh, ohhh
I'm gonna make you scared of me
Oh, ohhh, ohhh you're my ecstasy

Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"
Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"
Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"
Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down


Don't eat ass in the halls
Don't eat ass in the halls
Don't eat ass in the halls don't eat ass
Hahaha, just kidding!

Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"
Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"
Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"
Bitch! Runnin' through the halls, slow down
Shoutin' noises that sound like "Fuck you
Baldi"

Rats, you got away! Sigh Guess I'll die
