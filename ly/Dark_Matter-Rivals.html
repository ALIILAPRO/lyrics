		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The impact of this is gonna fun
Reckless behavior, get ready to run
Bleed me dry to get that answers you want
I like the pain, it makes me feel calm

Bitter and broke and I'm fucking bored
Nothing to lose so watch me transform
A butterfly but with devil horns

Dark Matter
Nothing ever felt the way it's supposed to
Call my dealer
If I sober up, I'll leak my own future
I'll be, I'll be the darkest soul you've ever seen
Dark Matter
Nothing ever felt the way it's supposed to

Self-sabotage is all that I know
Dirt to my lips, another episode
Losing my grip, someone hand me the phone
'Cause I'm calling God, tell him that I'm not going home

Bitter and broke and I'm fucking bored
Nothing to lose so watch me transform
A butterfly but with devil horns

Dark Matter
Nothing ever felt the way it's supposed to
Call my dealer
If I sober up, I'll leak my own future
I'll be, I'll be the darkest soul you've ever seen
Dark Matter
Nothing ever felt the way it's supposed to

The devil on my shoulder, she's telling me it's over
But I don't even really wanna go
If God is a woman then so is the devil
So the devil is someone you know
Criminal behavior, I am my own savior
A monument to who I've become
I'm overly aggressive, the biggest of messes
That's probably why I'm always on the run

Dark Matter
Nothing ever felt the way it's supposed to
Call my dealer
If I sober up, I'll leak my own future
I'll be, I'll be the darkest soul you've ever seen
Dark Matter
Nothing ever felt the way it's supposed to

The devil on my shoulder, she's telling me it's over
But I don't even really wanna go
If God is a woman then so is the devil
So the devil is someone you know
Criminal behavior, I am my own savior
A monument to who I've become
I'm overly aggressive, the biggest of messes
That's probably why I'm always on the run
