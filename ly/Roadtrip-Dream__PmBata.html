		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Secure the bag, know what I'm sayin'? Banrisk on the beat)
(Ayo, Perish, this shit hot, boy)

People change like the tides in the ocean
At least I think or am I dead wrong?
Foot on the brake at the light I don't notice
I sit and wait until the next song

Twenty hours in an old van
Up the east coast through the cold wind
Drove twenty hours by the ocean
Up the east coast, what a road trip

Now that interstate is paved with memories
Of a past life I lived when I was eighteen
And every winter I think back to what we used to be
In that past life we lived at eighteen

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Uh, I reminisce about a past life
Things change, I get it 'cause nothing lasts, right?
Yeah, and I was thinkin' 'bout her last night
Scrolling through our memories, debatin' 'bout our last times
Ayy, for a minute we was cool
Then we flew just a little too close to the sun
Now we finished, now we through
Guess we knew one day we would have to grow up

Twenty hours in an old Ford
Across the Midwest thinking "What for?"
Drove twenty hours, but it's hopeless
Across the Midwest, what a road trip

Now that interstate is paved with memories
Of a past life I lived when I was eighteen
And every winter I think back to what we used to be
In that past life we lived at eighteen
