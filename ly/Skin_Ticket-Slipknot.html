		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Zero and zero is nothing but zero
Cancer and people conspire together
Running and running and going forever
Collected and sampled, starving for zero

Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built-in migraine
Come see my cage, built-in migraine

Minus the inside and minus the circle
Inhabit the riddle and fill in the hovel
Wherein and herein, between us and near us
Zero and zero is nothing but zero

Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built in my grain
Come see my cage, built-in migraine
Come see my cage, built-in migraine

Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Let me go

Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy
Keeping myself alive through your empathy

Leave me alone

Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive, keeping myself alive
Keeping myself alive
