		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Erased my plan
Had nothing better to do
Hollow sky
Dead to our collective eye
No rebellion
No hostility inside
Just indifference
A bit of quiet
And a slow descending curve
To keep you dreaming
Yeah
Of consolation

You drink my words in the wake of your sorrow
You walk beside me and it feels like a hundred years
The plans you make for the perpetual tomorrow
Will be collapsing still

This time I'm losing the battle
There are too many things to overcome

I seek respite
The comfort of apathy
Burial time
Submit to the non-divine

Did you see
The soot in my eyes
The long night
The spiralling lights
I'm so tired
The scars in my mind
It didn't end well
But you had me on fire
