		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rise with the morning you call to me
My thoughts are crawling you're all I see

I wish I could live without you
But you're a part of me wherever I go
You'll always be next to me

Fall into the night as I gaze into you
Shine so bright it's all I do

I wish I could live without you
But you're a part of me wherever I go
You'll always be next to me

You'll always be next to me
You'll always be next to me
You'll always be next to me
You'll always be next to me
