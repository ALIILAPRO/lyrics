		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A little less conversation, a little more action, please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite, a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me
Satisfy me, baby

Baby, close your eyes and listen to the music
Drifting through a summer breeze
It's a groovy night and I can show you how to use it
Come along with me and put your mind at ease
A little less conversation, a little more action please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite and a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark

Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me
(Satisfy me) Satisfy me baby (Satisfy me)
Come on, baby, I'm tired of talking
Grab your coat and let's start walking
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)
Come on, come on (Come on, come on)

Don't procrastinate, don't articulate
Girl, it's getting late, gettin' upset waitin' around

And a little less conversation, a little more action, please
All this aggravation ain't satisfactioning me
A little more bite, a little less bark
A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and, baby, satisfy me
Satisfy me, baby
