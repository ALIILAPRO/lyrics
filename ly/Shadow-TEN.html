		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's just the silhouette I see
I don't know if it's real
Tell me, I've been having vicious dream
That won't last long
When you're not even here
How you still got power over me?
The more I try, the harder it's to leave
I know your shadow creeping over me

One step ahead of time, yeah
You always have the key
You keep me up all night
Bringing all these memories
Nothing's really changed
It's always the same

Look what you've done to me

Living in your empty shadow
Your voices echo, why
Why do I still see your shadow 
See your shadow
Running away from your shadow (shadow)
You'll always follow me (shadow)
In the night when I feel hollow (shadow)
See your shadow (shadow)

If I go paint the world in black
Will I still see your face? (oh-oh)
Said I won't ever double back
But I'm circling the track

Can't bare to think
That you're with someone in the moonlight
Should've been two of us, just you and I (no)
Want you to feel this pain

One step ahead of time, yeah
You always have the key
You keep me up all night
Bringing all these memories
Nothing's really changed
It's always the same, yeah

I always keep on falling

Living in your empty shadow
Your voices echo, why (shadow) 
Why do I still see your shadow
See your shadow (shadow)
Running away from your shadow (shadow)
You'll always follow me (shadow)
In the night when I feel hollow (shadow)

I'll be chasing after light
I don't wanna see you in the dark
But I'll keep turning back around
Baby, you are my only weakness
And it keeps pulling me down

Living in your empty shadow
Your voices echo, why
Why do I still see your shadow
See your shadow (shadow)
Running away from your shadow (shadow)
You'll always follow me (shadow)
In the night when I feel hollow (shadow)

See your shadow

You're still on my mind (shadow)
You're still on my mind
You're still on my mind (shadow)
Living in your empty shadow
