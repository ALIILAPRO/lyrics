		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught up in time to meet the same thing
Regardless the progress we were making 
Keeping a vacancy for so long 
We paddle in gravity to hold on

Colours emerging out of your hands
Voices that vanish into silence 
Sharing the light before we started
Diligence for the broken hearted 

cnd we'll hide
Our promises in plain sight 
We'll save them up to take flight 
But for now we'll settle down 

The perils of love that we encounter 
Will stir up our dreams that whisper louder 
Over the rainbow 'cross the universe 
To carry us back into our hearts 
cnd we'll hide
Our promises in plain sight 
We'll save them up to take flight 
But for now we'll settle down

cnd we'll hide
Our promises in plain sight 
We'll save them up to take flight 
But for now we'll settle down
