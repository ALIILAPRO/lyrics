		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shake your head
Call me a freak
But when you're standing in the mirror
It looks a bit like me so come on
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But with your mind a little clearer
I think you'd burn down the whole world on your own
Come on
I'm burning every bridge down to the wire
From the flames that you've fed with my desire
Cause I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away
Chat your shit
Right in front of me
But when the curtain falls
You see a man on his knees so come on
Come on
When you beat me to a bloody pulp
What do you see
Someone you've locked inside
And thrown away the key so come on
Come on
I'm burning every bridge down to the wire
From the flames that you've fed with my desire
Cause I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth like you still want more
So open you're mouth I know you're hungry like the wolf
I know you're hungry like the wolf
With my desire
Cause I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away from all the lies
That threw me out from the pack to the wolves
I'm fading away
