		  Havannah Brown
Red One
Mr.Worldwide
From Miami, Morocco, to Austrailia
To the world, dale!

Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop

When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy are you afraid of the dark, dark?
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me, do you know where to start, start?
And when the bass gets loud, loud, loud
That is when I feel a part, part
And when the world screams "sound, sound, sound"
Where the sound is the key to my heart, heart

We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night
We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
We run yes the we run the night, the night
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop

From the bottom of the map, Miami,
To the land down under, Australia,
You feel my drive, see my vision and hear my hunger
As my money gets older, theirs get younger
They sell their soul but the Devil knows I have no number
I'm go go baby, fresh oh baby, go go baby, uh oh baby, no no baby
Yeah yeah baby, now jiggle it baby, let me tickle it baby,
I know I'm lost it's gon' be hard to save me,
I'm sorry that's how Dade county raised me,
Y'all heard me right we run the night, now fuck you pay me

We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night, ni-ni-night
We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
We run yes the we run the night, the night
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop

Feelin' like a rush, rush, rush
Brushing past me all over my skin, ski-i-i-in
I can get enough, 'nough, 'nough
'Cause the beat keep pullin me in, in
Takin' me so high, up, up, up
A place that I've never been, aah
Party, party all night, night, night
Sleep all day then do it again, 'gain

We run yes the we run the night, ni-night, night,
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
We run yes the we run the night, we-we-we run, we-we-we run, run
We run yes the we run the night, the night, ni-ni-ni-ni
Run 'em like run 'em run 'em woop
