		<p>
		  (Buried in the snow)
(Buried in the, buried in the snow)

I just sit and lay awake, until the light of day
Buried in the snow
And cut, cut to the bone, my body going cold
Buried in the snow

You tell me I'm selfish
You stole my heart to sell it
I hate it, can't help it
Wish you were someone else's

You hate my guts and break me down
I watch the words come out your mouth 
I stand silent in the corner
No, I'd never make a sound

I just sit and lay awake, until the light of day
Buried in the snow
And cut, cut to the bone, my body going cold
Buried in the snow
Hear my heartbeat through the silence
Voices in my head getting violent
But I sit and lie awake until the light of day
Buried in the snow (ay, uh-huh)

When I'm walking alone, I skip the cracks
So I don't slip and break my back
Survive on blood, smoke, and ash

Your love leaves me in the past
Your love leaves me in the past (leaves me in the past)
Your love leaves me in the past

I just sit and lay awake, until the light of day
Buried in the snow
And cut, cut to the bone, my body going cold
Buried in the snow
Hear my heartbeat through the silence
Voices in my head getting violent
But I sit and lie awake until the light of day
Buried in the snow (ay, uh-huh)

I ain't tryna give it up
Said that I ain't good enough
Bloody red drink, pour it up into my double cup
Think of you it makes me sick
Now I feel like throwing up
Can you tell my brain to give me time? I need a couple months

You hate my guts and break me down
I watch the words come out your mouth
I stand silent in the corner, no, I'd never make a sound

I just sit and lay awake, until the light of day
Buried in the snow (buried in the snow)
And cut, cut to the bone, my body going cold
Buried in the snow (buried in the snow)
Hear my heartbeat through the silence
Voices in my head getting violent (you tell me I'm)
But I sit and lie awake until the light of day
Buried in the snow (buried in the snow)

Buried in the snow, oh
