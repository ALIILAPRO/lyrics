		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So, I was right
You were too good to be true
Was this love fulfilling
Or did I just fill my void like a fool, yeah?
That final night
When you said, "Damn, I'll miss you"
I believed it, didn't I?
'Cause it felt like the right thing to do, yeah

'Cause it feels like I owe you 
For all those years of happiness you brought me
You gave me that, so I'll give you that 
Not one thing that I would take back
Feels like I owe you 
For all those years of happiness you brought me
You gave me that, so I'll give you that 
Though you didn't love me back, you were the best I had

Hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm-hmm
Hmm-hmm

So, I was right
You never did see my worth
But I don't resent you 
I was convinced I was gettin' the world
Thank you for makin' me think that I
Had everything I had asked God for
You made me feel so damn good 
I forgot you've been lonely
Oh-oh-oh

'Cause it feels like I owe you 
For all those years of happiness you brought me
You gave me that, so I'll give you that 
Not one thing that I would take back
Feels like I owe you 
For all those years of happiness you brought me
You gave me that, so I'll give you that 
Though you didn't love me back, you were the best I had
