		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Winterlude, winterlude, oh darlin'
Winterlude by the road tonight
Tonight there will be no quarrelin'
Everything is gonna be all right
Oh, I see by the angel beside me
That love has a reason to shine
You're the one I adore, come over here and give me more
Then winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine

Winterlude, winterlude, my little apple
Winterlude by the corn in the field
Winterlude, let's go down to the chapel
Then come back and cook up a meal
Well, come out when the skating rink glistens
By the sun, near the old crossroads sign
The snow is so cold, but our love can bold
Winterlude, this dude thinks you're fine

Winterlude, winterlude, my little daisy
Winterlude by the telephone wire
Winterlude, it's makin' me lazy
Come on, sit by the logs in the fire
The moonlight reflects from the window
Where the snowflakes, they cover the sand
Come out tonight, everything will be tight
Winterlude, this dude thinks you're grand
