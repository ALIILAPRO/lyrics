		  (So high)
Oh

I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high
I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high

High in the club or hidin' in your basement
Under the covers, shoot me into space
Like five (like five), like four (like four)
Like me (three) and you (two) are one

I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high
I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high

High at the club, let's take it to your place, yeah
Under the covers, shoot me into space
Like five (like five), like four (like four)
Like me (three) and you (two) are one

I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high (so high)
I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high

Oh my, there's somethin' in the way that you move
So fine, Swayze got nothin' on you
Won't lie, makes me feel like angels do
So high

I just wanna ride with ya
I just wanna fly with ya
I just wanna ride with ya (yeah)
I just wanna fly with ya, so high

I just wanna ride with ya, all night
I just wanna fly with ya, so high
I just wanna ride with ya, all night (all night)
I just wanna fly with ya, so high
I just wanna ride with ya, all night (yeah, ayy)
I just wanna fly with ya (with ya), so high (so high)
I just wanna ride with ya, all night (all night)
I just wanna fly with ya, so high (yeah-yeah-yeah)
