		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were lookin' out the window
Hopin' you would disappear
You were singing to yourself

Hmm, hmm (hmm, hmm)

You were lookin' out the window
You were singin' to yourself
And the tears came pouring down from those sad eyes

Until I heard you sing the song
And yeah I heard you
So I sang along
Until I heard you
No one knew
You were invisible-imaginary
To everyone but me

Then one day
I gathered up the courage
To come over
And say
Ba ba ba
Ba
La la la
Ba-dup
Ba ba ba
Ba
La la la

You were lookin' out the window
You were singin' song to yourself
Nobody heard you except for
The birds and the butterflies

And then a wind came a blowin' around
And an echo it swallowed your song
And sent it over the rolling fields to my house
Then I knew
It was over when you figured me out

Ba ba ba
Ba
La la la
Ba-dup
Ba ba ba
Ba
La la la
Ba-dup
Ba ba ba
Ba
La la la
Ba-dup
Ba ba ba
Ba
La la la

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whispering 'My love'
