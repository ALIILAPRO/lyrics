		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I state the predicate
I mean that shit you better get
Up off yo' ass and out this town
Go show some etiquette
Medicine up in my cabinet, I keep it separate
From prying eyes, I am not crazy
But I'm killin' for the hell of it
With the one inch punch
I'll give the ravens their lunch
With the guts of foes who did bluffs
But could not keep their mouth shut
For a goddamn second so I hit with the blunt
(blunt)
Force to a grunt, make a punk growth stunt

Growth stunt, stunt, stunt
Stuntin' on a bitch with my
Weapons for the hunt
Colder than a lich when I make a soul jump
From their fuckin' body
With the shotty when I pump
I'll make ya growth stunt, stunt, stunt
Stuntin' on a bitch with my
Weapons for the hunt
Colder than a lich when I make a soul jump
From their fuckin' body
With the shotty when I pump
I'll make ya growth stunt

Taking my time when I'm doing my thing
I do not need to rush anything in the rain
I'm not gonna slip and fall to the grave
Seneca taught me how to keep my
Sane from all the mess
And chaos with the stress
But I am decapitating every test
In the form of a swarm of my enemies
It's given me the drive to go on
While ya mourn in ya dorm where ya hide
You can run, you can sprint
But know that I will catch ya fall
With a weapon in my hand
Take ya face and then I maul
