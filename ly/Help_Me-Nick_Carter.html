		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Verse 1)
I wish I could define all the thoughts that cross my mind,
this angel begged for me to choose.
I don't even know which ones to lose
when I've fallen down so far
I think I'll never see your light, oh bouncin' off of me shinin' down here from you eyes.

(chorus)
Help me make the right decisions between right and wrong, weak or strong, day and night, where I belong.
Help me make the right decisions, know which way to turn, Lessons to learn and just what my purpose is here.

(Verse 2)
Its like I got the signals crossed with messages I can't decode.
Half asleep, never wide awake ya' know.
Complete overload and I got so much information here and nothing I can really grasp.  I should know the truth but I'm too afraid so I have to ask.
 (Chorus)

(Bridge)
Oh want to know you and more than anything,
I need you in every dream you're there for me. You love me for who I am. No Angel, just an ordinary man.

 (Verse 3)
Help me figure out why I'm stuck in the middel trying to understand why I can't. Why's it such a riddle.  Got my eyes crossed. Thinking so hard but I know I'm missing the mark. Can you help me sort out all the information?  I'm just wrecking my brain, paying attention but I'm still lost and at all cost I...I...I gotta know...gotta know!

(Chorus) Add-lib

(Verse 3)
