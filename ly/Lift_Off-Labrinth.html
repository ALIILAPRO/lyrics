		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
My heart will always be with my home
'Cause home's the only place that got my heart
But something lit a fire in my soul
The voyager gon' voyage

I
Got something that's gon' take me somewhere
Take me up into the stratosphere
This is goodbye until we meet again (hey, hey, hey)
Again (woo)

I could tell you I'm sorry
But you know I won't mean it when you hear me say
Feeling like King T'Challa
'Bout to go Clark Kent and up, up and away

Baby, I don't want to break your heart
But this is where I belong
The world's ready for a superstar
I got my engines on

Lift off
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, gone
You see my rocket ship
Head up in the clouds when the spaceship lit, ignite
Hit me from the ground, I'm about to lift off
Five, four, three, two, one
You see the shuttle is shooting up to Mars
'Bout to land on Venus
Baby, I'm a star
Watch a boy go lift off

Left all the shit that's holding me back
Bonnie and Clyde, 'bout to go ahead and kill that
Sorry to the people I thought I love
I think I found my soulmate
And we're going all the way
As high as that cocaine so

This is probably gonna break your heart (your heart)
But this is where I belong 
The world's ready for a superstar 
I got my engines on

Lift off
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six gone
You see my rocket ship
Head up in the clouds when the spaceship, lit ignite
Hit me from the ground, I'm about to lift off
Five, four, three, two, one
You see the shuttle is shooting up to Mars
'Bout to land on Venus
Baby, I'm a star 
Watch a boy go lift off

(Three, two, one)
Baby, I'm a star
Watch a boy go lift off
