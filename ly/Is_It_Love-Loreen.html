		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You'll find me in the echo of the dark
Workin' on the riddle of your heart
Lost you in a maze, now let me out
Is it love, is it love, is it love?

Without a warning, without a sign
Will you call me or will you hide?
There's a shadow in my mind
How do I know it?
Is it love?

Tell me, where in your heart am I now?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Tell me, what do you feel in the night?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love?
Is it love?
Tell me, how do you sleep when I'm not by your side?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?

You'll find me in the middle of the sea
Drownin' in the words that we don't speak
Bring me out, don't leave me in the deep
Is it love, is it love, is it love?

Without a warning, without a sign
Will you call me or will you hide?
There's a shadow in my mind
How do I know it?
Is it love?

Tell me, where in your heart am I now?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Tell me, what do you feel in the night?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
Is it love?
Is it love?
Tell me, how do you sleep when I'm not by your side?
Is it love? Is it love? Is it love?
