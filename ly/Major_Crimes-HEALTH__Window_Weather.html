		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't want to hurt me
Why you want me to know?
You loved me
And now you don't anymore

Is there no way out?
Is there no way out?
Is there no way out now?
And it's hard to know
Is there no way out?

Life's short
Why does it take so long?
We're only here once
Why blame yourself?

We don't want the same things
But we're afraid to let go

Is there no way out?
Is there no way out?
Is there no way out now?
And it's hard to know
Is there no way out?

Life's short
Why does it take so long?
We're only here once
Blame someone

If life's short
Why does it take so long?
We're only here once
Why blame yourself?
