		<p>
		  (B-B-Bankroll Got it) ayy

Breakin' down and I had the whole world watchin' (whole world watchin')
But the worst part is really who watched me
Every night I cried, I almost died
And nobody close tried to stop me
Long as everybody gettin' paid, right? (Paid, right)
Everything'll be okay, right? (Okay)
I'm winnin', so nobody trippin'
Bet if I ever fall off, everybody go missin'
At night, I'm sittin' in a dark room thinkin'
Probably why I always end up drinkin'
Yes, I'm very depressed
How can somebody so blessed wanna slit they wrist?
Shit, I'd probably bleed out some Pinot
When they find me, I'm in Valentino, ayy
He pourin' me shots, thinkin' it's lit
Ha, little did he know

This pussy depressed, hm, I'm about to stress him, yeah
Pink nails 'round his neck, huh, but this ain't domestic, ayy
Think it's goin' down, ha, now he stand corrected, ayy
This pussy depressed, hm, I'm about to stress him, ah

Ayy, damn, I got problems (I got problems)
Never thought a bitch like me would ever hit rock bottom (hit rock bottom)
Man, I miss my parents, way too anxious (yeah, yeah)
Always cancel my plans (cancel my plans)
Pulled up, caught him cheatin'
Gettin' his dick sucked in the same spot I'm sleepin' (yeah, yeah)
Lord, give me a break (give me a break)
I don't know how much more of this shit I can take (ayy)
How long you been worried 'bout me, tellin' people that's not me?
Honestly, it kinda feel like you plottin', watchin'
Why is you speakin' on me at my lowest when you acted like you ain't noticed?
I was trippin', goin' crazy
And they lowkey hatin', so they ain't gon' say shit
Damn, I finally see it
I'm killin' myself when bitches would die to be me

This pussy depressed, hm, I'm about to stress him, yeah
Pink nails 'round his neck, huh, but this ain't domestic, ayy
Think it's goin' down, ha, now he stand corrected, ayy
This pussy depressed, hm, I'm about to stress him, ah

I ain't goin', yeah, no emotion, ayy
Back outside, yeah, back in motion, ayy
He keep callin', hm, I ignore it (ayy)
He say I'm crazy, hm, don't I know it, ah
