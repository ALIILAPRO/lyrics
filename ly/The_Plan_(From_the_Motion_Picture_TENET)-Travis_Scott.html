		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know where we stand
It's true
Know the plan

Last time I wrecked it, last time I whipped around
Last time I did the whippets (yeah), last time I live reverse (yeah, yeah, ooh)
Pour the brown, hit the reverend (yeah), last time I hit your crib (yeah)
Last time there was no tenants
I done went back in myself, felt like hell
Fuck, I risked it, patience sell (yeah)
Found you livin', know you thrillin', not for sinnin' (yeah)
How I got my stripes in business, backin' out in the street (yeah)
What is wild, let it be, ragers out, gotta eat (yeah)
Not a vibe (yeah), but a wave, with the sound by the way
Count it down, by the days (ooh)
To myself, know they wicked, with the moves (ooh, ooh)
I'm drinkin', off the juice, know I'm drinkin'
I be smooth, then I lose it, yeah, yeah now

You don't know where we stand (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's true (yeah, yeah)
Know the plan

Close the opera
Hear the red and blue outside, I think our option's up
I recrossed it 'round the map, I had to line it up
I be swervin' on the waves, it's like a line of us (yeah, yeah)
Move in 'verse on my turf, I'm outta line, I put in work
I draw the line and cross it first
I need the time, I need the search
It's just like wine, it make it worse
Skrrt, skrrt in the 'vert, skrrt, skrrt
Ride on land, Boeing jet, make it land
It's slow motion when I dance
In your eyes, I see your trance
I run away and then you prance
If I show the hideaway, would you hide out and let it blam?
Ain't no time, I'm facin' scams, nah, nah (yeah)

You don't know where we stand (yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's true (yeah, yeah)
(Ooh)
Ooh
