		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Out of sight
Where am I running to now?
Blinded by shining lights, pulling me close
Bloody red flamin' up, she takes me in oh

Oh, my God, shit
I see myself in you

Baby girl, you're making me a beautiful jewel
Every time I look at you, I keep turning red
I'm not going back, go color me like you
My forbidden fruit
She got the ruby lips

My heart is taken away, I don't give a 
My heart has gone to you, I don't give a
It blows my mind how you did this to me
With all of your shine (hey)
She got the ruby (wah-oh)

My heart is taken away, I don't give a 
My heart has gone to you, I don't give a
And girl, I knew that this would happen just
From the start 'cause (hey) she got the ruby

She got the ruby
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Think I'm out my mind, pass me a Coke Zero to calm down
Shit, this is red too

Baby girl, you're making me a beautiful jewel
Every time I look at you, I keep turning red
I'm not going back, go color me like you
My forbidden fruit
She got the ruby lips

My heart is taken away, I don't give a 
My heart has gone to you, I don't give a
It blows my mind how you did this to me
With all of your shine (hey)
She got the ruby (wah-oh)

My heart is taken away, I don't give a 
My heart has gone to you, I don't give a
And girl, I knew that this would happen just
From the start 'cause (hey) she got the ruby

Ruby sky, ruby ocean 
Ruby eyes, ruby eyes
Yeah
Baby, my eyes are ruby

Baby girl you're making me a beautiful jewel
Every time I look at you I keep turning red
La-la, la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
She got the ruby
