		  Yeah, yeah
Mm

It's like love when we touch
Yeah, you got me out of my mind
More than half of the time
I dive in for the rush
You know what I want and that's that
I'm not taking it back

I don't know, know, know, know
How you do it, I'm in ruins
I don't know, know, know, know
But my head's in overload

You got me going dumb, du-du-dumb
Dumb, du-du-dumb, insane
Got me dumb, du-du-dumb
Dumb, du-du-dumb
Got me going dumb, du-du-dumb
Dumb, du-du-dumb, insane
Got me dumb, du-du-dumb
Dumb, du-du-dumb
Got me going
