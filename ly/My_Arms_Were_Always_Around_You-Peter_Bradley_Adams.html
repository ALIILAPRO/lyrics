		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just say to me
You'll be the fool this time
You'll take my place
For a little while
You'll give me a chance
You'll let me break you down
Let me use you up
You'll show me how

Oh, my love

Your pretty little wings
They must be getting tired
Trying to keep your feet
Up off the ground
Let's go back
To the days beneath the Northern Lights
When we danced so free
Like a little child

Oh, my love
You thought I'd left without you
But oh, my love
My arms were always around you

Just say to me
You'll lie awake this time
You'll watch me sleep
Straight through the night
No more dreams
Must I sacrifice
My heart is safe
You'll guard it with your life

My love
You thought I'd left without you
But oh, my love
My arms were always around you
My arms were always around you

Oh, my love
You thought I'd left without you
But oh, my love
My arms were always around you
My arms were always around you
My arms were always around you
