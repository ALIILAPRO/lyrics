		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am
And within the reach of my hands
She's sound asleep and she's sweeter now
Than the wildest dream could have seen her
And I watch her slipping away

But I know I'll be hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to lengths I'll go

To find her again
Upon this, my dreams are depending
Through the dark
I sense the pounding of her heart
Next to mine
She's the sweetest love I could find

So I guess I'll be hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to
High and low
High
Do you know what it means to love you?

I'm hunting high and low
And now she's telling me she's got to go away

I'll always be hunting high and low
Only for you
Watch me tearing myself to pieces
Hunting high and low
High
There's no end to the lengths I'll go to

Oh, for you I'll be hunting high and low
