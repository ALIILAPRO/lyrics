		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, mmm
Yeah, yeah

I been feelin' like I (mmm), numbin' myself to get by (ah)
That's my reality (yeah), all my days I don't know (yeah), what'll happened to me (go)
Hope for the best, take these shots (yeah, yeah)
Hope I feel some relief, hardest loaded ammo (ah-ah)
Let's go to war when I sleep (ah), yeah, I'm zippin' out, walls are closin' in
I'm in too deep, woah-woah, in this darkness where my demons like to be
No one understands the memospheric therapy (woah-woah, woo)

Yeah, I'm in it (ah-ah-ah), something here is off
Nothing's really helpin' dawg, I'm screamin', "Motherfuck the law" (fuck 'em)
Nigga wishin' (ah-ah-ah), on a shootin' star
Hopin' I can make it, yeah, I pray on my knees (yeah)
Yeah, I'm in it (ah-ah-ah), somethin' here is off
Nothing's really helpin', dawg, I'm screamin', "Motherfuck the law" (fuck 'em)
Nigga wishin' (yeah), on a shootin' star
Practice my world, man (yeah)

Ayy, I told the judge, "I'm prolly biggest off"
I told the bitch she can't be chargin' me for Saint Laurent
Yeah, I told my baby not to break the law
I told my baby mama, careful not to get involved
Yeah, this bitch is bad and she got plenty jaws
Plenty wars, pussy raw, raw, I got Saint Laurent
I told her, "Get some fire, throw on on some'"
How your hat say White Sox and you from the Bronx? (woo)

Yeah, I'm in it (ah-ah-ah), something here is off
Nothing's really helpin' dawg, I'm screamin', "Motherfuck the law" (fuck 'em)
Nigga wishin' (ah-ah-ah), on a shootin' star
Hopin' I can make it, yeah, I pray on my knees (yeah)
Yeah, I'm in it (ah-ah-ah), somethin' here is off
Nothing's really helpin', dawg, I'm screamin', "Motherfuck the law" (fuck 'em)
Nigga wishin' (yeah), on a shootin' star
Practice my world, man (yeah)

Some' to think about is sky's fallin', crumblin'
Can't save 'em all, it's fuck the world and send the heat
Bodied that shit and orange-rich, smellin' tangerine
I'm a madman, get out mine with Lamborghini
Hands are speedin', demons chasin' out 'em
Make way for the rager boys, but in my mind 'til the early morn'
Shruggin' like she creakin', dripped out on Sunday
Lil' virgin wearing VETEMENTS on the runway (woo)

Yeah, I'm in it (ah-ah-ah), something here is off
Nothing's really helpin' dawg, I'm screamin', "Motherfuck the law" (fuck 'em)
Nigga wishin' (ah-ah-ah), on a shootin' star
Hopin' I can make it, yeah, I pray on my knees (yeah)
Yeah, I'm in it (ah-ah-ah), somethin' here is off
Nothing's really helpin', dawg, I'm screamin', "Motherfuck the law" (fuck 'em)
Nigga wishin' (yeah), on a shootin' star
Practice my world, man, right
