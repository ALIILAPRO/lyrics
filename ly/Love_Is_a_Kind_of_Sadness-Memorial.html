		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here it is again
That fateful blue moon
Dancing around in your hotel room
There’s something we want
And we know we’re not allowed
Fireworks hidden in the clouds

That’s when I know
Love is a kind of sadness

A friend treats her happiness
Like an heirloom
A rusted old locket
He’s so scared to lose and it
Should be thrown away
With all the pictures and the poems
But he’s desperate to stay for the last song

That’s when I know
Love is a kind of sadness

To the man at the bar
With his wedding ring removed
You’re chasing a thrill
But the guilt will come soon
You wear your ex lovers
Like regretful tattoos
And I wonder which one turned him into you

That’s when I know
Love is a kind of sadness

Here I am alone
In room number eleven
Wondering if I’ll ever find the one
Who will look into my eyes
Like it’s the last piece of the sky
And not be blinded by the sun

That’s when I’ll know
That’s when I’ll know
