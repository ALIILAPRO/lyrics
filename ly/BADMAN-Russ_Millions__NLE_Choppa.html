		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Type of man, badman, yes
Hey, you know I need the "Yeah"
Yeah (Sebz Beats, baby)
(Crud)
She only want one type of man, badman
Type of man, badman
She only want one type of man, badman
Type of man, badman (yeah)

She only want one type of man, badman
They love Big Russ and they love Tintim (yeah)
Gang gang, lift it up, one hand
Bang, bang, bang
Beamers, creamers, I need 'em (creamers)
One bad bitch, just one night (yeah)

She only want one type of man, badman
They love Big Russ and they love Tintim (yeah)
Gang gang, lift it up, one hand
Bang, bang, bang
Tote Ninas, twist my fingers
Turn rappers into singers (come on)
One bad move would've cost your life

The look in her eyes say she wan' fuck tonight
Kiss her on the forehead, give her butterflies (yeah)
Up to the morning, make her bust it wide
One of a kind, gyal dem wan' take a ride
Summer gets lit lit, killy dem steppin' out
True say the sun's out, man act silly now
Coming to the party, I'm bringin' that weapon out
Bring out the candlelights cah mans dissin' now

Aye, can't hold her bladder, she cummin' on me (cummin' on me)
Throw dick in her, she too weak in the knees (knees)
Make her beg for it like she said please (please)
She eat Plan B's every day of the week (day of the week)
Money making, risk takin'
I used to trap out of bacon, the drugs got me sedated (yeah)
Like Kobe we faded, Neiman Marcus and Macy's (yeah, yeah)

She only want one type of man, badman
They love Big Russ and they love Tintim (yeah)
Gang gang, lift it up, one hand
Bang, bang, bang
Beamers, creamers, I need 'em (creamers)
One bad bitch, just one night (yeah)

She only want one type of man, badman
They love Big Russ and they love Tintim (yeah)
Gang gang, lift it up, one hand
Bang, bang, bang
Tote Ninas, twist my fingers
Turn rappers into singers (come on)
One bad move would've cost your life
