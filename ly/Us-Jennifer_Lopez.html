		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is this a warning?
My heart beatin' on an off beat
Is this a caution
That I can't get enough for your need?

Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?

Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)

(Could it be us?)

I'm right here
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming
Could you be the one without a doubt?
Could I be for your keepin'

Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?
Could it be us?

Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)

Could it be us?

Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us?
Could it be us? (Could it be us?)

Could it be us?

Could it be us?

Could it be us? (Could it be us?)
