		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He helped me change a tire in the Citgo parking lot
He said we both could use a beer
And I said, "Hell, why not?"
What started out as one night turned to six months just like that
He never had a ring on
So I never thought to ask

But then last night I saw a message on his phone
That said, "Hey babe, what time you comin' home?"

I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
And being the other one when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was but it's gettin' hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl

I've heard about those women who didn't have a clue
The ones that made excuses like my mama used to do
And he jumps in the shower just as soon as he gets home
And I spend half an hour going through his phone

I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
And being the other one when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was but it's gettin' hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl

Oh, and I feel stupid
I feel cheap
I feel used
I feel weak

I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Being the other one when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was but it's getting hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to be that girl
