		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As we're sitting here staring each other down
You open up your mouth let your lies spew out
What are we doing here its wrong can't you see
You want to leave me here, and forget about me

You look me, in my face
Tell me I'm, a disgrace
You say that your the victim
I say your full of shit

All the times you stuck me here
And put me on my own
I feel the same that's why
I've got a bullet with your name

As were sitting here staring each other down
I remember how you used to kick me around
Look deep in my eyes come take all my pain
I only have just one bullet with your name

Get the fuck away!

Look deep in my eyes
Come take this pain from me
All I ask of you
Is to get away from me
