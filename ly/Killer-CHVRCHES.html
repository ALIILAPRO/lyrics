		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I lost myself
My mental health
Yeah
On a broken carousel
Spun down to hell
How far we fell
Maybe just as well
The stones we throw
They told me so
Yeah
It was death by stereo
When they dealt the final blow
Nowhere to go

I turned into a killer
I'm insane
I'll cry you a river
Down the drain
Are you entertained?

No one to call
In my downfall
Yeah
In the valley of the dolls
I was climbing up the walls
No light at all

I turned into a killer
I'm insane
I'll cry you a river
Down the drain

I turned into a killer
Played the game
Don't look in the mirror
Fear no pain
Are you entertained?

I turned into a killer
I'm insane
I'll cry you a river
Down the drain
Are you entertained?
