		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the
Light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the
Coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your
Gaze all over again

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like
The world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til
The darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under
Six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're
Losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it
Except you and I

We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like
The world had disappeared
No, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til
The darkness softly clears

Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
