		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why are you so thirsty?
Hovering around like I owe you something?
That $12 Hennessy daiquiri ain’t a down payment for you to invade my personal space all night.
I need to unwind
Just want to have a good time.

Go fuck yourself
‘Cause you won’t be fucking me tonight
Get off and dance
There’s nothing you can do to change my mind

Go fuck yourself
I’m on my own
Get off and dance
Out of the room
Go fuck yourself
Get off and dance
What the fuck do I care?

You’ve reached a dead end
The GPS on your ego trip routed you in the wrong direction
Traveling this way
Thinking you’re God’s gift
You’ll find yourself on lonely roads
Spending a ton of cheese
Chasing after what will never be

Go fuck yourself
I’m on my own
Get off and dance
Out of the room
Go fuck yourself
Get off and dance
What the fuck do I care?

Go fuck yourself

Sit on your throne
I’m prohibited
I hit the road
You’re outdated
Sit on your throne
I’m prohibited
Go fuck yourself
You’re outdated

I don’t want to talk
Didn’t come here to get chose
I need to unwind
Just want to have a good time
I got my hair laid
Wore this skin tight dress 
Just for me
I beat my face to look and feel like the most beautiful girl in the world
Now you’re all up in my mix
Bigging you up
Stunting on yourself like you’re the prize
When we both know that she is me
Go fuck yourself
Go fuck yourself

Go fuck yourself
I’m on my own
Get off and dance
Out of the room
Go fuck yourself
I’m on my own
Get off and dance
What the fuck do I care?

Thinking you’re God’s gift
You’ll find yourself on lonely roads spending a ton of cheese

Go fuck yourself
Get off and dance
Go fuck yourself

Go fuck yourself
I’m on my own
Get off and dance
What the fuck do I care?
