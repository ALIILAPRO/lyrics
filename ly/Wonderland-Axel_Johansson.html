		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody left who cares?
All I wanna do is dance
Here in Wonderland

I've been hiding from the big bad world
You can find me in the things that hurt
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

So we're lost in the upside down
Tell me what you hear in the silence now
All I wanna do is dance
Here in Wonderland

I've been hiding from a big bad world
That you can't find me in the things that hurt
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

Chase the rabbit down the hole
Just to see where it will go
Go, go
Now I ended up alone

Chase the rabbit down the hole
Just to see where it will go
Go, go
Now I ended up alone

La-lala-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

La-lala-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland

We don't need to understand
Here in Wonderland
