		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the time
My baby, you're on my mind
And I, and I don't know why
Yeah, but the feelin' is fine
Can't you see
Yeah, honey you are for me, oh
We were meant to be
Dancing in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Dancing is what to do (to do)
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)
Dancing is what to do (to do)
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)
Dancing is what to do (to do)
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)

Every time when I look in your eyes
I smile with pride, happy that you're mine
Joy in love, your love is true I know
You are the best thing that has happened to me, oh
Dancing in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Dancing is what to do (to do)
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)
Dancing is what to do (to do)
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)
Dancing is what to do (to do)
Dancing's when I think of you (of you)
Dancing's what clears my soul (my soul)
Dancing's what makes me whole (me whole)

All the time
My baby, you're on my mind
I don't know why
Yeah, but the feelin' is fine
Can't you see
Yeah, honey you are for me, oh
We, we were meant to be
Dancing in the moonlight
Gazing at the stars so bright
Holding you until the sunrise
Sleeping until the midnight

Dancing is what to do
Dancing is when I think of you
Dancing is what clears my soul
Dancing is what makes me whole

Go ahead now, your love is true I know
You are the best thing that has happened to me
Sweet love, sweet love, say
You are my destiny, you are my everything
Sweet love, sweet love, say
You're always on my mind, forever in my eyes
Sweet love, sweet love, say
You are my everything, you are my destiny
Sweet love, sweet love
Words can not explain, my love is so unrated

So unrated, so far away
it's so beyond me that I don't know what to say
it's so unrated, so far away
it's so unknown, I don't know what to say
It's down, down, far away
It's, oh, beyond me that I don't know what to say
Go down

Get up on the floor
Dancing all night long
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn
Get up on the floor
Dancing 'til the break of dawn, sing

Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole
Dancing is what to do
Dancing's when I think of you
Dancing's what clears my soul
Dancing's what makes me whole

So, so, so
I'm ready, ready, no, ooh
