		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woke up cold one Tuesday
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life
So I quickly opened the wardrobe
Pulled out some jeans and a T-shirt that seemed clean
Topped it off with a pair of old shoes
That were ripped around the seams
And I thought these shoes just don't suit me

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything's right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Woke up late one Thursday
And I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes
And I felt like there were two days missing as I focused on the time
Then I made my way to the kitchen
But I had to stop from the shock of what I found 
A room full of all of my friends all dancing 'round and 'round
And I thought hello new shoes, bye-bye blues

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn
Take me wandering through these streets
Where bright lights and angels meet
Stone to stone they take me on
I'm walking 'til the break of dawn

Hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes

Oh, hey, I put some new shoes on
And suddenly everything is right
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
And everybody's smiling, it's so inviting
Oh, short on money but long on time
Slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine
And I'm running late and I don't need an excuse
'Cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes
