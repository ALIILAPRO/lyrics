		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I deserve a thank you note
For giving you my presence all year long
I deserve a thank you note
That's the only present that I want
Honey, all I need beneath the tree is a letter made from you to me
Just a thank you note, baby

My Christmas wish-list fits on a post-it (post-it)
I wrote it so big, hoping you'd notice (notice)
Don't spend one cent, a sentence is golden
Written by hand, as nice as you can to show you're devoted

I deserve a thank you note
For giving you my presence all year long
I deserve a thank you note
That's the only present that I want
Honey, all I need beneath the tree is a letter made from you to me
Just a thank you note, baby

Stressed out, full house, every December (each one)
You sing, "Clean elves, clean shelves" but I'm playing Santa (no fun)
Please show me you recognise it, this night's not meant to be silent
And words speak louder than diamonds on a ring

I deserve a thank you note
For giving you my presence all year long
I deserve a thank you note
That's the only present that I want
Honey, all I need beneath the tree is a letter made from you to me
Just a thank you note, baby

(I deserve a thank you note
For giving you my presence all year long
I deserve a thank you note
That's the only present that I want)
Honey, all I need beneath the tree is a letter made from you to me
Just a thank you note, oh, just a thank you note
Just a thank you note, baby
