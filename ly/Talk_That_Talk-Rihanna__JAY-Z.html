		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Talk that talk to me, yeah
Talk that talk to me, yeah

I be trying to chill, bitches wanna fuck me
Every little city I go, fuck me
Shawty must've heard, got the word, I move that D
Had it by a bladder, she like "oh I gotta pee"
Ran into a Rothko in my restroom
Singer slash actress in my bedroom
God I have the ticket for a walk through
Everything that do is big
I talk big money, I talk big homes
I sell out arenas, I call that getting dome
Million dollar voice, came through the phone
We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I'm flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefa
Sex on the beach, left love speechless
They say that money talk, tell these other neegas speak up
What's up

One and two and a three and four
Come on let me know if you want some more
You know what I like, now get it right
Boy talk that talk to me all night

Say you want me to do and I got you
Tell me how to love you, tell me how to hold you

'Cause you ain't never had a woman like me, yeah
And you will never have another like me, yeah
