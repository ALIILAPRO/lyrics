		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I feel so down
When you're not with me
You blow my mind
Feels so strong
I can get no sleep

I closed my eyes for so long
Since we danced so free
You know my heart wrote this song
Drowned in my weep

But this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love

Oh, I feel so down
When you're not with me
You blow my mind
Feels so strong
I can get no sleep

I closed my eyes for so long
Since we danced so free
You know my heart wrote this song
Drowned in my weep

But this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love

Oh, I feel so down
When you're not with me
You blow my mind
Feels so strong
I can get no sleep

I closed my eyes for so long
Since we danced so free
You know my heart wrote this song
Drowned in my weep

But this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
Yeah, this feeling is love
