		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I no longer give a fuck about anything
I already tried drugs, it don't help a thing
I no longer want friends, all these people fake
I find comfort in the rain, cus it numbs my pain
I no longer give a fuck about anything
I already tried drugs, it don't help a thing
I no longer want friends, all these people fake
I find comfort in the rain, cus it numbs my pain
I don't care about your fucking problems
I no longer give a fuck cus I tried to solve em
All you did was come right back
Well don't tell me if it's like that
All I did was give solutions
But you treat me like a nuisance
Pardon me for my intrusion
Now it's time for me to move on
I got better things to do than to hear you out
Everything I ever told you was blocked out
I would treat you like a human but you talked down
Part the reason why I don't give a fuck now
Friend of me? No, not even an enemy
Cut you out my fucking life, now you're dead to me
Remedy? You don't follow recipes
You're dead now, bitch, hope you rest in peace
I no longer give a fuck about anything
I already tried drugs, it don't help a thing
I no longer want friends, all these people fake
I find comfort in the rain, cus it numbs my pain
I no longer give a fuck about anything
I already tried drugs, it don't help a thing
I no longer want friends, all these people fake
I find comfort in the rain, cus it numbs my pain
