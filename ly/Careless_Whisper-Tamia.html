		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I feel so unsure
As you take my hand
And lead me to the dance floor
As the music dies
Something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen
And all its sad goodbyes

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you, oh

Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind
Ignorance is kind
But there's no comfort in the truth
Pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

I should've known better, yeah
Whoa, ooh, ooh

Tonight the music seemed so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
But maybe it's better this way
We'd hurt each other with the things
We want to say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
But love was gonna dance with me
Please dance

I'm never gonna dance again
Guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
Should have known better than to cheat a friend
Waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Ah yeah
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone
Why'd you have to leave me alone?

Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Music's too loud
We'll lose this crowd
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
