		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (God, I wish I never met you)
(I, I keep forgetting to forget you)

I'm drivin' down the coast of Delaware
I had to leave before I fall off the tightrope
Run for my life 'cause, babe, I'm well aware
Need to get out of here right now

Out of my head
Yes, I'm beggin' you
I'm begging, I'm begging you
Driving so fast
But my heart won't move
Whatever, whatever I do

God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgetting to forget you
And from the start I should've known the bad news
I, I keep forgetting to forget you

God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgetting to forget you
And from the start I should've known the bad news
I, I keep forgetting to forget you

I'd pay you fortune for amnesia ('nesia)
And here I'm trying not to jump off the deep end
In every face I see a piece of you
And, yeah, I dream of my freedom

Out of my head
Yes, I'm beggin' you
I'm begging, I'm begging you
Driving so fast (yeah)
But my heart won't move
Whatever, whatever I do

God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgetting to forget you

God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgetting to forget you
And from the start I should've known the bad news (the bad news)
I, I keep forgetting to forget you

God, I
I, I keep forgetting to forget you
God, I
I, I keep forgetting to forget you

God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgetting to forget you
Forget you
