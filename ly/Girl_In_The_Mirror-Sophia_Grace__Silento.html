		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh oh, whoa
Oh oh, whoa
Oh oh, whoa

What's up? It's your boy Silento
Sophia Grace (ooh)
We're about to turn up, baby
Let's go

I wake up every day like, "Hello, beautiful"
'Cause this world is so crazy and it can bring you down
You're too short, too fat, too skinny
Hey, well, excuse me if I think that I'm pretty

So I don't care what you say 'cause I'm original
And I learned how to love me from my head down to my toes
Let 'em know, let 'em know if you with me
Hey, 'cause I finally found the answer is in me

(Tell 'em, Sophia)

Whoa, my mama, she would say (say what?)
Don't you let 'em get you down
How to learn to love me

That's why I'm talking to the girl in the mirror, whoa, oh
Like even if you're down, better get up, whoa, oh
'Cause every setback's just a set up, whoa, oh
For something just a little bit better
Oh, I'm talking to the girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror

(You'd help me)

Go to sleep at night with a smile on my face (ok)
'Cause I know who I am and I can't ever be replaced (oh, yeah)
So go ahead, be proud, be different
Hey, that's what makes you one out of a million

Whoa, my mama, she would say
(Tell us what she said, Sophia)
Don't you let 'em get you down
How to learn to love me

That's why I'm talking to the girl in the mirror, whoa, oh
Like even if you're down, better get up, whoa, oh
'Cause every setback's just a set up, whoa, oh
For something just a little bit better
Oh, I'm talking to the girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror

(Silento) ooh

Sophia, you did it, you took it to the top
You gotta keep going, the grind never stops (ok)
I see you on YouTube with all them views (get it)
Yeah, girl, I'm watching you (get it)
You got that swagger, you got that glow
For all the doubters, just let them know
Count up more, as the day just goes
I love your soul and your rhythm flow

Like "Oh, ooh, yeah"
Yeah, I'm like "Oh, ooh, yeah"
Put your hands in the air
You got that girl power, that girl power
Put your hands up for the girl power

I like it, I won't bite it
Keep it on, girl, 'cause I'm watching
You know it, just kill it (don't stop)
Sophia Grace, you're the number-one champ

That's why I'm talking to the girl in the mirror, whoa, oh
(Hey Silento)
Like even if you're down, better get up, whoa, oh
(Yeah?)
(Is there anything you would change about yourself?)
'Cause every setback's just a set up, whoa, oh
(I dance a lot, but I don't think I would change anything, what about you?)
For something just a little bit better
(No I like who I am)
(We like who you are too)
Oh, I'm talking to the girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror
Girl in the mi-
Girl, girl in the mirror, ooh

Oh oh, whoa (okay)
Oh oh, whoa (yea)
Oh oh, whoa, ooh (okay)
