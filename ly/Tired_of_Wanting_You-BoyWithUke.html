		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not sad, I'm not tired
But I feel I'm bad
I feel different from others
I wish I had what they have
But I'm just dreaming of randomness scheming
I got empty feelings
I wrestle my demons at night

I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now
Because that's not my character
Maybe in another universe

I just think that it's funny
That I cannot bring
Myself from my conscience to rid
Of my butterfly things
I don't feel right when I'm not with you
I'll keep you insight, but I won't pursue

I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now because
If I do I'll never sleep
If you say no to me, but you'll probably
I'm not sad, I'm just tired of wanting you
I want to say I think you're cute
But I can't say it now
Because that's not my character
Maybe in another universe
