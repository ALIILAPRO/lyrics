		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Falling through pages of Martens on angels 
Feeling my heart pull west 
I saw the future dressed as a stranger 
Love in a space-dye vest 

Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding 
A pool in the shape of a heart 
Beauty projection in the reflection 
Always the worst way to start 

"But he's the sort who can't know 
Anyone intimately, least of all a 
Woman,
He doesn't know what a woman 
Is,
He wants you for a possession, 
Something to look at like a painting or an ivory box. 
Something to own and to display. 
He doesn't want you to be real, 
Or to think or to live. 
He doesn't love you, but I love you. 
I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and 
Feelings, even when 
I hold you in my arms. 
It's our last chance
It's our 
Last chance"

Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it 
Learning to swallow the rage 
Found a new girl I think we can make it 
As long as she stays on the page 

This is not how I want it to end 
And I'll never be open again 

"I was gonna move out, get, 
Get a job, get my own place, 
But, I go into the mall where I 
Want to work and they tell me, I'm, 
I was too young"

"Some people, gave advice before, 
About facing the facts, about 
Facing reality. And this is, this 
Without a doubt, is his biggest 
Challenge ever. He's going to have to face it. 
You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and, 
Uh, and, and, and get some help here. I mean no one can 
Say they know how he feels." 

"That, so they say that, in ya know 
Like, Houston or something, you'd 
Say it's a hundred and eighty degrees, 
But it's a dry heat. 
In Houston they say that? 
Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up. 
Dry until they hit the swimming pool." 

"I get up with the sun, listen. 
You have your own room to sleep in, 
I don't care what you do. I don't 
Care when. That door gets locked, 
That door gets locked at night by nine o'clock. 
If you're not in this house by nine o'clock, then you'd 
Better find some 
Place to sleep. Because you're not going to be a bum in 
This house. 
Supper is ready"

There's no one to take my blame 
If they wanted to 
There's nothing to keep me sane 
And it's all the same to you 
There's nowhere to set my aim 
So I'm everywhere 
Never come near me again 
Do you really think I need you 

I'll never be open again, I could never be open again. 
I'll never be open again, I could never be open again. 

And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend 
And I'll never be open again 
And I'll have no more dreams to defend 
And I'll never be open again
