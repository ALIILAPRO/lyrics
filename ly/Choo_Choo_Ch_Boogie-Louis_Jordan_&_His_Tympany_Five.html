		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Heading for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickity-clack
And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with democratic fellows named Mac
So, take me right back to the track, Jack!

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
Woo woo, ooh ooh, ch'boogie!
Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
Take me right back to the track, Jack!

You reach your destination, but alas and alack!
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take your morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situation from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack, Jack!

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
Woo woo, ooh ooh, ch'boogie!
Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
Take me right back to the track, Jack!

Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life of Riley in the beaten-down shack
So when I hear a whistle I can peek through the crack
And watch the train a-rolling when it's balling the jack
I just love the rhythm of the clickity clack
So, take me right back to the track, Jack!

Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
Woo woo, ooh ooh, ch'boogie!
Choo choo, choo choo, ch'boogie!
Take me right back to the track, Jack!

Take me right back to the track, Jack!
