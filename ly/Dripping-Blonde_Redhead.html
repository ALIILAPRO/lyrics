		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were right, girl
You were art, you're dripping
For a girl you're superb
You're so thin

In your eyes and in your mind
I see change, it's a shame
Close your eyes, stalling the walk
You're alive, it's the same

Collect this song
In the blue light of May
For I found the one
No one knows, no one knows

I saw you dripping sunlight
I saw you dripping moonlight
I saw you dripping sunlight
I saw you dripping moonlight

Collect this song
In the glowing light of May
For I found the one
No one knows, no one knows

In your eyes and in your mind
I see change, it's a shame
Close your eyes, stalling the walk
You're alive, it's the same

You were right, girl
You were art, you're dripping
For a girl you're superb
You're so thin

I saw you dripping sunlight
I saw you dripping moonlight
I saw you dripping sunlight
I saw you dripping moonlight
