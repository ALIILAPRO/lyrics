		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)

Let's go, let's go, let's go (yeah)

Lacin' my feelings with drugs
Baby, I'm all outta love
I know she can't understand it
Told her it's better she run
She wondering how I leave
I'm wondering how she stay, yeah
I can't never hold her close enough
But I can't never learn to pray
Yeah, 'bout to lose control
Yeah, too emotional
Yeah, you know where to find me
I be up the road
Yeah, every time I touched love
It was all a show
Yeah, you know when them drugs call
I can't help but go (turn me up)

Yeah, doin' this shit by my dolo (Wetto)
Balenci', I don't rock Polo
Am I too high? 'Cause I don't know
I'm so used to being too low
Look at me, I can't trust no ho
Just me and my dawgs on the bolo (clack, clack)
Get the fuck out my face with them photos
All of my choppers they homos, yeah
I guess my bitch know something I don't
Thinking that she gon' fix it
Open up her heart, knew it from the start
It was never gon' fit me (yeah)
Swerwin' I'm up in a gleski (slatt, slatt)
Lookin' for anywhere peace be
She sayin' that she wanna see me
So I sent her tickets from SeatGeek
Nowhere left but out, yeah
Never wanted clout, yeah
I ain't wrote a fuckin' bar in years
Shit just pourin' out, yeah
All she wanted was a wedding ring
But all I got is doubt, yeah
Been without you before
But them drugs, I can't go without (let's go, let's go, let's go)

Yeah, lacin' my feelings with drugs
Baby, I'm all outta love
I know she can't understand it
Told her it's better she run
She wondering how I leave
I'm wondering how she stay, yeah
I can't never hold her close enough
But I can't never learn to pray
Yeah, 'bout to lose control
Yeah, too emotional
Yeah, you know where to find me
I be up the road
Yeah, every time I touched love
It was all a show
Yeah, you know when them drugs call
I can't help but go (turn me up)

(Tell me if you love, no)
