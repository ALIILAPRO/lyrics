		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It kinda feels like, I'm dyin' on the inside
It kinda feels like, I been tryna get by

And I been this way since day one
I don't need no medication
No, I don't need no drugs
Or maybe I'm different, and maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah

I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I think crazy?
Someone save me (save me)
You can't blame me (blame me)
It's my ADHD, yeah

My mind racin', I been paranoid
Overthinkin', maybe that's a void (woo, woo)
Don't cut me off like I don't have a voice
I think I was born different, I ain't really have a choice, yeah (yeah)
Cancel session, you a hour late (hour late)
Don't play with me, today is not the day (oh yeah)
Pay attention, I am not deranged
I could tell you what I'm thinkin', I just don't know how to say it
Maybe I get in your nerve, I mean what I say (oh yeah)
I been a man of my words, eon wide awake (yeah, yeah)
Baby a lil' disturbed, but that's just me
You don't bleed the blood I bleed
I wear my heart on my sleeve, nigga

And I been this way since day one (and I been this way since day one)
I don't need no medication (I don't need no medication)
No, I don't need no drugs
Or maybe I'm different, and maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah

I feel like I'm dying inside
Why do I think crazy?
Someone save me (save me)
You can't blame me (blame me)
It's my ADHD, yeah

It kinda feels like, I'm dying on the inside (on the inside)
It kinda feels like, I been tryna get by

Yipee-yipee-yih-yoh-yipee-yah-yah
Staring at the fire, kumbaya
I'ma take you higher, take you higher
I'ma take you higher, take you higher
Too many things on my head (yeah, yeah), what am I thinkin'?
How come I can't go sleep in my bed? (oh, yeah)
I hear them talking, everyone stranger
They leave me for dead (oh, yeah), 'cause they want me gone (yeah)
This that shit I be on (yeah)
Ain't no one to lean on (yeah)

And you know I been this way since day one (I been this way since day one)
I don't need no medication (I don't need no medication)
Or maybe I'm on one
Or maybe I'm different, and maybe my ADHD got me trippin'
And maybe I'm just everything that you missin', yeah

I feel like I'm dying inside (inside)
Why do I think crazy? (Crazy, yeah, yeah)
Someone save me (save me)
You can't blame me (blame me)
It's my ADHD, yeah

It kinda feels like, I'm dyin' on the inside
