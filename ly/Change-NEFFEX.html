		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got big dreams
Imma do big things
Yeah you'll see me on the big screen 
Lookin so clean
I don't move slow
I move fast, right past
cnybody takin life for granted, yeah that's too bad
I be grateful
For everything that I have
You only got this life, you don't get it back
Make the most of it
Become the best that I can
Everybody look at me, I got a plan...

You gotta work, hard play hard
Do it from the start
Cuz how you do anything is everything, it's art...
Stay consistent and do it everyday...
Don't let fatigue get in your way
Cuz 10% of something is better than nothing
You better do something if you wanna be something
I can feel my stomach 
Rumbling, I'm hungry
Big things coming, nah I ain't bluffing, yeah

No I don't wanna stay the same, yeah
So I keep on pushing through the pain, yeah
That's the only way to make a change, yeah
So I fight every day and train, yeah
It'll all be worth it
One day it'll all be worth it
So I keep pushing through the pain, yeah
That's the only way to make a change, yeah

I've had enough
I'm making my own luck
cdrenaline my drug
I'm sick of feeing stuck
I got this, yeah I got this
Will not quit to the top I promise 
Cuz I've had enough

You better watch out
I'm on the climb to the crown
In my prime right now, hear me loud
I've been spitting for a while now
cll by myself
Independent DIY now
Don't need no help 
I've been beating out labels, and money, and budgets, its funny 
I do all the work, yeah I keep it one hundred
I fight for my dreams 
I would die for these things
I believe in myself 
I refuse to be weak

I like to build things
Empires out of buildings
I wanna leave a legacy of helping others finally feel things
Of motivating and killing
Depression, exhaustion, we need some healing
I work thru the pain
I like seeing gains
I keep my head down, buried, walk thru the flames
Yeah I do this every day
Even when i feel drained
c true man pushes thru, you don't hear complaints...

No I don't wanna stay the same, yeah
So I keep on pushing through the pain, yeah
That's the only way to make a change, yeah
So I fight every day and train, yeah
It'll all be worth it
One day it'll all be worth it
So I keep pushing through the pain, yeah
That's the only way to make a change, yeah

I've had enough
I'm making my own luck
cdrenaline my drug
I'm sick of feeing stuck
I got this, yeah I got this
Will not quit to the top I promise 
Cuz I've had enough
