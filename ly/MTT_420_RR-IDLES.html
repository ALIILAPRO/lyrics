He was degloved
He was jelly roll

It was February
I was cold and I was high

He wanted love, he wanted soul
There's not enough
To make him whole

It was February
I was cold, and I was high

The swell of heaven on my dashboard
I can see my spinal cord rip high
Hey, hey, hey
It's raining glass like a fever storm
Every promise I have sworn tonight

The swell of heaven on my dashboard
I can see my spinal cord swing high

I was cold and I was high
High, high, high

It was February
I was cold and I was

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?

Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for the storm?
Are you ready for?
Are you ready for the storm?
