		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It always starts with a "Hey"
Turns into "How was your day?" (day)
Turns into "Meet at my place"
Turns into you and me drinking ros√©
Turns into "How did you sleep?" (How did you sleep?)
Turns into "It's been a week" (week)
Turns into gave you a key
Turns into conversations talking 'bout what are we?
I, found a thing when I wasn't even looking for a thing
I, keep thinking about it in my brain

How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (How deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
Stuck up on my arm IV
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault
How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (How deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
How'd you make my heart skip beats? (Skip beats)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault

I ain't saying I ain't into this (yeah)
I'm thinking we can slow it down a little bit (what?)
In your place but I'm feeling like I live in it (live in it)
Butterflies in your stomach got you giggling
You ain't really see us together? I think so
Are you going to love me forever? I don't know
Girl if it was up to me I'd take a time machine
Come back and tell you exactly where this goes

How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (Deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
Stuck up on my arm IV (IV)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault
How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (Deep)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
How'd you make my heart skip beats? (Skip beats)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault
(Yeah) my fault (it's my fault, yeah, it's my fault)

I, found a thing when I wasn't even looking for a thing
I, keep thinking about it in my brain

How I'm 'posed to know how deep? (How deep, yeah)
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
Stuck up on my arm IV (IV)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault
How I'm 'posed to know how deep?
How I'm 'posed to know how deep I'd fall?
How'd you make my heart skip beats? (Skip beats)
Didn't mean to take that leap, my fault

(It's my fault, babe, it's my fault, babe)
(It's my fault, babe, it's my fault, babe)
(How I'm 'posed to know how it'd)
(How I'm 'posed to know how it'd)
