		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

Two, three, four

Helpless, my eyes are bleeding from the fear that's inside
You sealed your demise when you took what was mine
Don't try and stop me from avenging this world
No voice to be heard

Waking the Demon
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows
Watch the blood flow

There's not much longer so don't try and fight
Your body's weakening, walk to the light
All those painful times, so alone, so ashamed
Well I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain

Caution, there's just no limits to the boundaries you push
I've warned you but still you just fuck with my mind
There's no escape from this rage that I feel
Nothing is real

Waking the Demon
Where'd you run to?
Walking in shadows
Watch the blood flow

There's not much longer, so don't try and fight
Your body's weakening, walk to the light
All those painful times, so alone, so ashamed
I'm not coming back, there's nothing to gain

Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Whoa
Tread

Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Breathe for me
Don't wake me from this slumber
Stay with me
Possession taking over

Waking the Demon
