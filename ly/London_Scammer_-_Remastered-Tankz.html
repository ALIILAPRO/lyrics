		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, come on
Listen, look

I'm a London scammer
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin'
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I'm waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dickin'
Codeine, that's what I'm sippin'
Money, that's what I'm missin'

Look, I'm a London scammer
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin'
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I'm waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dickin'
Codeine, that's what I'm sippin'
Money, that's what I'm missin'

Swing me your Monzo or your dozens
Either way, we're makin' thousands
I make so much money, I might have to get an accountant
Mainstreams fuck up the holders credit
I said, "Do you really wanna take that risk?"
Look, I make more money than trappers and shit
I bought a fulls off the dark web
But I got bumped, that shit was dead
Didn't wanna take that L so I took out credit instead
Click eighty packages from Next
Of course the address got blacklisted
So I sent it to my girl's instead

Look, I'm a London scammer
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin'
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I'm waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dickin'
Codeine, that's what I'm sippin'
Money, that's what I'm missin'

Look, I'm a London scammer
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin'
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I'm waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dickin'
Codeine, that's what I'm sippin'
Money, that's what I'm missin'

Look, I was chasin' the bag
More time, now I'm chasin' the suitcase
Best respect my clickin' like Blueface
Court case, got that shit on the 7th
Br gang really on drills like 7th
I'm fully gassed up, no 7 Eleven
N- mad that I'm makin' more than their parents
In my Jordan 1s, I'm takin' your missus
Run outta luck 'cause she likin' my pictures
These opp boys just chat like bitches
These opp boys just move like girls
It was me and K1, up, up in the T with scales
It was me and K1 in that T with scales

Look, I'm a London scammer
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin'
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I'm waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dickin'
Codeine, that's what I'm sippin'
Money, that's what I'm missin'

Look, I'm a London scammer
I see it, I want it, I click it
Nights in the bando, Pyrex whippin'
Next day, man started clickin'
Nobu, I'm waitress tippin'
Bad B come and take this dickin'
Codeine, that's what I'm sippin'
Money, that's what I'm missin'

Look
I see it, I want it, I click it
Pyrex whippin'
Started clickin'
Pattern your bitch 'cause she likin' my pictures
Come on, yeah

Fucking done know
And it's so long
It's like the seventh, fuck that, man
