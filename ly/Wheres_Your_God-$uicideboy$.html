		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it's that triple six, lunatic
Smokin' piff, load the clip
Grab the crucifix, it's an exorcism (666)
I've been hating life $uicide
Who am I? Noose is tied
Closing my eyes is my only mission
(Fuck yo' god)
It's that $carecrow with no soul
I only ride solo please don't take my photo
I hate all you bitches
I'm clinching my trigger
I'm fuckin' your bitches
The graveyard my trenches
Trust me you don't want it i just hit 'em
And kill 'em with hell in my vision
That druggie, that junkie, bitch
Give me your money blood on my clothes
Spells on my soul live in hell, but I'm cold
Trust me, you don't want it when I got
That motherfuckin' look in my eye
Got six million ways
To commit a fuckin' homicide
G59 till the fuckin' day I commit $uicide
(Fuck it)

All the way from hell
Climbing up, and out a well blood sells
So I cut my fuckin' neck and sold myself
To the prince of darkness souls I harvest
Bodies I reap and sow
Turn off the lights, and watch me glow
Back from the dead
Had to sew my throat closed
Maggots and larva started to grow
Now I'm nothing but bones in a hole
Decomposed (Fuck)
Fuck what you believe in, bitch
I never had a reason, bitch
I'm comin' from the semen of
A demon, now I'm leavin', bitch
I'm bringin' back a screaming bitch
And hanging from the ceiling, bitch
It's seemin' like a dream and shit
But trust me, you ain't freeing shit
You a motherfuckin' slave like me and $lick

Where's your God, where's your God
Oh, where's your fuckin' God?
Where's your God, where's your God
Oh, where's your fuckin' God?
Where's your God, where's your God
Oh, where's your fuckin' God?
Where's your God, where's your God
Oh, where's your fuckin' God?
