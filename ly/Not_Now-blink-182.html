		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come here, please hold my hand for now
Help me, I'm scared, please show me how to fight this
God has a master plan and I guess
I am in His demand

Please save me, this time I cannot run
And I'll see you when this is done
And now I have come to realize
That you are the one who's left behind

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here waiting

I see a light, it feels good
And I'll come back soon just like you would
It's useless, my name has made the list
And I wish, I gave you one last kiss

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here waiting
And take my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here waiting

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here waiting
And take my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here waiting

Please stay until I'm gone
I'm here, hold on
To me, I'm right here waiting
And take my one last breath
And don't forget
That I will be right here waiting
