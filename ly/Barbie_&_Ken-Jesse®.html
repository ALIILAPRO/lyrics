		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never was blazing but, heh, fine, really
You're probably high right now and you think it's fucking funny
Daytrip took it to ten (Hahaha)

Daytrip took it to ten
I'm on eleven again
I keep on setting these trends
Keep it one hundred percent (Yeah, mhm)
Keep it one hundred percent (I do)
My girl is a ten, we're the new Barbie and Ken (True)
But we don't gotta pretend, keep it one hundred percent
Yeah, one hundred percent

Boy, fuck your designer
All my shit from China
Retro forty-niners
French toast at the diner
All my songs minor
That's the key to your heart
All white lighter
I'ma need it to spark
Everything dark
Except for my socks
Look how they pop
Coming out of my Chucks with the Ben Davis crop
Thirty on my waist, yeah, tattoos on my face
High as outer-space, yeah, swervin' in your lane
I don't mean to flex
But it's sewn into my jeans
My daddy taught me to drink
My momma taught me to dream
Okay, enough about me
Nevermind, no it's not
Clock's ticking, time's up
All my stars are lined up

Daytrip took it to ten (Yeah)
I'm on eleven again
I keep on setting these trends
Keep it one hundred percent (Alright)
Keep it one hundred percent (I do)
My girl is a ten, (True) we're the new Barbie and Ken
But we don't gotta pretend, keep it one hundred percent
Yeah, one hundred percent

Show me that it's real, make it bounce
Let's just post up all day at the house (okay)
Brrt! Hit my plug, get an ounce
Smoke it all together on the couch
Put your lipstick on my mouth
LOL, I'm so relatable
And also upgradable
Is it me? Is it him?
It could be anybody, we're all interchangable
Good girl with a bad ass
Needs to star with that ass
Paid for it on the card
Buyin' shit I can't afford
She got a thing for foreign cars
Red bottoms and the red Porsche
Red lights get ignored, all for her, yeah, all for her
Real love I offer her
When she hurt, she knows I'll ball for her

Daytrip took it to ten
I'm on eleven again
I keep on setting these trends
Keep it one hundred percent (Yeah)
Keep it one hundred percent (I-I-I do)
My girl is a ten, (True) we're the new Barbie and Ken
But we don't gotta pretend, keep it one hundred percent (Yeah)
One hundred percent (Alright, I)

Daytrip took it to ten (I, I do)
