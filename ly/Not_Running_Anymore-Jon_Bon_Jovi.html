		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bless me father I have sinned
I'm not sure where to begin
I won't name names or where I've been
But I've been there and back again
No Hail Marys will save me
You learned to live with memories
Here, slip this C-note up your sleeve 
Just stay inside until I leave

I've been running, always running
Never have both feet on the floor
I've been running, always running
Now I'm not running any more

The hands of time may tick no more
Let darkness fall upon this door
No waves will wash up on this shore
I won the fight but lost the war

I've been running, always running
Never had both feet on the floor
And I've been running, always running
Now I ain't running anymore

There were roses I have loved
Who've given or have given up
I pushed your patience and my luck
It wasn't love I didn't trust
It wasn't you, or me, or us
You've shouldered ifs, and ends, and buts
It's that way okay, I've said too much
But I've been running, always running
Never had both feet on the floor
I've been running, always running
Now I ain't running anymore
