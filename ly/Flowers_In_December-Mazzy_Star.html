		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  
Before I let you down again
I just want to see you in your eyes
I would have taken everything out on you
I only thought you could understand

They say everyman goes blind in his heart
And they say everybody steals somebody's heart away
And I got nothing more to say about it
Nothing more than you would me

Send me your flowers, of your december
Send me your dreams, of your candy wine 
I got just one thing I can't give you 
Just one more thing of mine 

They say everyman goes blind in his heart 
They say everybody steals somebody's heart away 
And I've been wondering why you let me down 
And I been taking it all for granted
