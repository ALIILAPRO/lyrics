		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Times that I've seen you lose your way
You're not in control, and you won't be told
All I can do to keep you safe
Is hold you close, hold you close

'Til you can breathe on your own
'Til you can breathe on your own

Hold tight, you're slowly comin' back to life
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up, darlin'
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up, darlin'
Hold tight, you're slowly comin' back to life
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up, darlin'
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up

Everyone keeps a darker place
To lose control, you're not alone
And when you come lookin' for embrace
I know your soul, I'll be your home

'Til you can breathe on your own
'Til you can breathe on your own

Hold tight, you're slowly comin' back to life
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up, darlin'
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up, darlin'
Hold tight, you're slowly comin' back to life
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up, darlin'
Let go of all your haunted dreams tonight
I'll be keepin' your head up
I'll be keepin' your head up

And I won't let you down
And I won't let you down
