		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Red Bull in my hands, feels like I got wings
Lotta people in my face, but I can't hear a thing
It's like my heads up in the clouds, heads up in the clouds
And I ain't coming down, no
Just turn the music on, just let me get lost
I swear that I"ma lose it if somebody turns it off
What are you out your mind?
You must be out your mind

Just turn the music up, turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

Snap back on my head, I'm so motivated
Nike's on my feet, understand the situation
This is not a game, this is not a game
You ain't gon' bring me down, no
Yeah I mean what I say, and I say what I mean
You best wipe off that hater look before you make me scream
What are you out your mind?
You must be out your mind

Just turn the music, turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up

I got the adrenaline
Rhyme like I'm a veteran
Fine, I've been ahead of the
Game, no way I'm settlin'
Drained, but I'ma get it in
Lame this is a medicine
Hey, you get the medic kit
Beats, 'cause I don't let 'em live
Fast, better keep pedalin'
Blast you with the pen again
Laugh, but I'm ahead of them
Act, like I don't get it then
That is when I enter in
Rap until I never can
Cash, it is irrelevant
Passion is the element
Laps around these other men
Pass 'em, who you runnin' with
Facts, is what I'm coming with
Back, but I ain't never left
Swift, but I will never get
Wack, you better get a grip
Last isn't a medal it's glass and I'ma shatter it
Who do you think you battling?
Who do you think you laughing at?
I am not a comedian, man it don't even matter
If you don't know what I'm saying, you better do what the chorus says
You don't know what the chorus says?
Turn it up on the choruses

Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
You must be out your mind
Turn the music up
Turn the music up
Turn the music
Turn the music
Up
You must be out your mind
You must be
