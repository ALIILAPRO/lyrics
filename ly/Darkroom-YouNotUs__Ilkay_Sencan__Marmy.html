		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

You make me scream at the top of my lungs
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

It all goes down in the discotheque
Where the souls come out to play

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

You make me scream at the top of my lungs
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

Taste, taste, the darkroom
In, in the darkroom
In, in the darkroom
The darkroom, baby
The darkroom
Taste, taste, taste (darkroom, baby)
The, the, the (in the darkroom)

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

You make me scream at the top of my lungs
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

It all goes down in the discotheque
Where the souls come out to play

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby (baby, baby, baby)

I got your taste on the tip of my tongue
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

You make me scream at the top of my lungs
I think I fell in love in the darkroom, baby

Taste on the tip of my tongue
On the tip of my tongue
On the tip of my tongue
Darkroom, baby

You make me scream at the top of my lungs
The top of my lungs
The top of my lungs
Darkroom, baby
