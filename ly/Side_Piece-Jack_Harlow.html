		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, I want you to know
To know that you are really special
Oh, I want you to know
To know that you are

I already got a song for my main chick
So let me do a record for my side piece
Let me do a record for my side piece
Let me do a record for my side piece, ayy
I need you beside me
Late night, girl, you know where to find me
DeJ Loaf, introduce you to the family
DeJ Loaf, introduce you to the family

Back when I was a young man (young man)
I liked them girls that was in that Abercrombie (I did)
I liked them girls that was in that Aeropostale (I did)
Now them same girls got coke in they nostrils
Somethin' done made the youth hostile (hostile)
Maybe it's the fuel from the fossils
All I know is that the future is gettin' colossal
This shit is gettin' colossal (Cole, you stupid)

Let me do a record for my side piece, ayy
Let me do a record for my side piece, ayy
Let me do a record for my (for my side piece)
I need you beside me (I do)
Late night, girl, you know where to find me
DeJ Loaf, introduce you to the family (to the family)
DeJ Loaf, introduce you to the family

I need somethin' besides the inside of these hotel rooms and lobbies
Maybe I should pick up a hobby
More like probably
More like Margot Robbie
Out in Abu Dhabi
And they dress in all white, oh, y'all must be feelin' godly
I call my pops and he let his son talk like Mavi, mmm
Walkin' through Argentina, the police stop me
Told me go home or somebody gon' rob me
Said we in the slums where they Shmurda like Bobby
I guess these earrings too gaudy
And these clothes fit a lil' perfect on my body
I don't need nobody searchin' for my body
Especially when I'm workin' on my body

And I already got a song for my main chick
But let me do a record for my side piece, ayy
Let me do a record for my side piece, right
Let me do a record for my side piece, ayy
I need you beside me
Late night, girl, you know where to find me
DeJ Loaf, introduce you to the family
DeJ Loaf, introduce you to the family

I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
To know that you are really spe-
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know
I want you to know

Baby, don't pretend like you don't want this, uh
Huh

She say, "You chat so much shit"
Baby, don't pretend like you don't want this
'Cause when I get back to the United Kingdom
You know you the one that I'm gon' fuck with
I'ma have you cream filled on some donut shit
Okay, okay, let me chill on some grown-up shit
Hit tape, you the one I wanna show up with
Lookin' at me through the phone, baby, blow a kiss
Like Soulja Boy told you, soon I'ma hold you
But it's gon' be a minute though, I won't hold you
You can fuck around while you wait, I won't scold you
Five hour difference, but you picked up when I called you
I think I'm booked for Wireless
And some other festival in Ireland
Life gettin' fast, I can feel my head spiralin'
If I'm not back soon, I might have to fly you in
Baby, is your passport valid?
Tell me, are you down for a challenge?
It don't matter to me if you vaxxed or not
Either you come to me or I come back to your block
I don't wanna get too excited
But if I called the jet, would you ride it?
Lay with me overseas, don't pack a bag, we can shop
Go Italy, let's have sex on a yacht
