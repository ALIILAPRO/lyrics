		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like the cars, the cars that go

Top back, candy paint
Damn I got expensive taste
Flex on 'em everyday
Champagne, celebrate
I get freaky, all my girls we have a kiki
Rock a party like I'm Prince
Purple boomin' Lamborghini

Drop a couple thou when I'm rolling off the lot
Make a lot of noise, all the people stop and watch
I don't give a fuck, I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
Camera ready, bases heavy, like them cars that go boom

I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom

I like, I like, I like, I like, boom boom
I like, I like, I like, I like, boom
I like, I like, I like, I like, boom boom
I like, I like, I like (whoo)

Drop down, dip it low
Earth shaking stereo
False bitch, I let 'em know
Stuntin' when the bass go
Yeah I'm loco, so Chanel they call me Coco
Buy me shining, watch me blind them
Paparazzi snapping photos

Drop a couple thou when I'm rolling off the lot
Make a lot of noise, all the people stop and watch
I don't give a fuck, I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
Camera ready, bases heavy, like them cars that go boom

I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom

I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom
I like the cars, the cars that go boom

I like, I like, I like, I like, boom boom
I like, I like, I like, I like, boom
I like, I like, I like, I like, boom boom
I like, I like, I like, I like, boom
I like, I like, I like, I like, boom boom
I like, I like, I like (whoo)
