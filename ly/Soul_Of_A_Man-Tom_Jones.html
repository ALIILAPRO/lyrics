		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won't somebody tell me
What is the soul of a man

Well I've traveled to different countries
I've traveled to the foreign land
I found nobody could tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man

I want somebody to tell me
Answer me if you can
I want somebody to tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man

Well I saw a crowd talking
I just came up in time
Teaching the lawyer and the doctor
A man ain't nothing but his mind

Well I want somebody to tell me
Answer me if you can
I want somebody to tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man
Yes what is the soul of a man

Well I read the Bible often
I tried to read it right
As far as I can understand
It's nothing but a burning light
God, I want somebody to tell me
Why don't you answer me if you can

I want somebody to tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man
I want somebody to tell me
Answer me if you can
I want somebody to tell me
Tell me what is the soul of a man
Oh, what is the soul of a man
