		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You can tell by the way
She walks that she's my girl
You can tell by the way
She talks, she rules the world

You can see in her eyes
That no one is her chain
She's my girl
My supergirl

And then she'd say
It's okay
I got lost
On the way but I'm a supergirl
And supergirls don't cry

And then she'd say
It's alright
I got home
Late last night, but I'm a supergirl
And supergirls just fly

(And supergirls just fly)

And then she'd say
It's alright
I got home
Late last night, but I'm a supergirl
And supergirls just fly

And then she'd say
That nothing can go wrong
When you're in love
What can go wrong?

Then she'd laugh
The night time into day
Pushing her fear
Further along

And then she'd say
It's okay
I got lost
On the way but I'm a supergirl
And supergirls don't cry

And then she'd shout
Down the line
Tell me she's got no more time
'Cause she's a supergirl
And supergirls don't hide

And then she'd scream
In my face
Tell me to leave, leave this place
'Cause she's a supergirl
And supergirls just fly

Yes, she's a supergirl
A supergirl
She's sewing seeds
She's burning trees
She's sewing seeds
She's burning trees
Yes, she's a supergirl
A supergirl
A supergirl
My supergirl
