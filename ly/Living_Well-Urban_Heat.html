		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Darkness, when will you come for me?
I've been waiting to see, and now I long for it.
There were words written down
Once they come out of my mouth
and If we've gotten this far
then there's no easy way out.
It's an oath that you take
and a feeling so vague.
Feel it sting in your bones
as you're lying awake.

If we cannot get on top of it, we'll never sleep again.

Darling, release me from your grip.
I lost a piece of myself and now I long for it.
There were words written down
Once they come out of my mouth
and If we've gotten this far
then there's no easy way out.
Now it's starting to creep
as you lay down to sleep.
It's a voice in your head
that hears the secrets you keep.

If we cannot get on top of it, we'll never sleep again.

At such a time as this, it feels like forever but if
the darkness comes for me, the darkness comes for everybody.
It seems at times like these it comes down if every dream.
If the darkness comes for me, the darkness comes for everybody.
