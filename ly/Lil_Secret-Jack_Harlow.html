		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know that you sick of bein' my lil' secret
I know that you sick of bein' my favorite
I know that you hate the fact that I'm famous
Hate the fact that you gotta wait, but you gon' wait
'Cause you confident that we soulmates
I told my therapist about you (you)
She always takes your side
Ain't nobody I love more, I just need more time

I know that you fantasize about sittin' next to me courtside
I know that your ex-man was no poor guy
In fact, he was one of them sports guys
Runnin' up and down the court guys
And y'all ain't date for no short time
But it's cool, though, we got more time
I don't never get sick of you
And that right there is a sure sign you're mine

I know that you sick of bein' my lil' secret
I know that you sick of bein' my favorite (favorite)
I know that you hate the fact that I'm famous
Hate the fact that you gotta wait, but you gon' wait (gon' wait)
'Cause you confident that we soulmates
I told my therapist about you (you)
She always takes your side
Ain't nobody I love more, I just need more time

Spendin' time with somebody else and I get to wishin' that she was you
Any girl can be beautiful, but not any girl can just be in tune
And you so in tune, you understand me
I make you laugh, and you say to me that you can't stand me
You soul food, and you eye candy, I wanna meet you in Miami
And I want you to meet my family and

I know that you sick of bein' my lil' secret
I know that you sick of bein' my favorite
I know that you hate the fact that I'm famous
Hate the fact that you gotta wait, but you gon' wait (gon' wait)
'Cause you confident that we soulmates (soulmates)
I told my therapist about you (you)
She always takes your side
Ain't nobody I love more, I just need more time
