		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Okay I pull up high as fuck
Right up front to where the venue was
Every time I look at her she feel like I'm the only one
Only thing I care about is living life the best I could
Only wanna smoke and stay productive 'til the day is done
Pull up to my day ones, kickin' shit like Deawon
Then I played her favorite song, she think we can get along
I ain't got no beef with bongs
But I rather roll the strong
She ain't tryna prolong, she get to the provolone
Pull up to my block quick, pop out then I dip
At first I told her no but now I think I'll have a sip
Ever since I got my money right I'm smilin' like the Grinch
And I don't give a fuck about no sucka nigga shit
I'ma pull up screamin', I don't give no fuck and that is it
I show up, do a 540, shake and bake and whip
Chicken bone now it's on shorty in my whip
It's Hollow Squad the coffin fleet 
I bet they won't forget, you bitch

They tryna be cray (mmh, yeah)
They tryna be cray (mmh, yeah)
She wanna meet Carti (Carti)
That bitch is a Barbie (yeah)
I'ma fuck these hoes (ooh)
I'm on 730
Got a brand new pack like Kid Cudi (brand new)
I smoke dope like Kid Cudi
Push up and get the slugs from me (slime slime)
I'm with all the shits (slime slime)
We pull up with shit (yeah)
We pull up with, uh (yeah)
We pull up with sticks, hol'up
We pull out the van, hol'up
We pull out the shit, ay
I pull out the .9, hol'up
I pull out and blitz, hol'up
I pull out the fire, hol'up
I pull out wit' six
I'm smokin' out the pound
The bitch can suck my dick, yeah
The bitch gonna ride the dick, yeah
The bitch get thrown in the pit

Runnin' from the cops (cops)
Gotta keep my Glock (gotta keep my Glock)
When I see them cops (cops)
You know I have my Glock (know I have my Glock)
Middle finger, fuck 12 (yeah), always on my block (always on my block)
Middle finger to the opp, we gon' pop at opps (we gon pop at opps)
Pop a body, drop him (drop him)
Cop a body, deuces (deuces)
They be talkin' 'bout it (huh?)
But don't know who be doin' it (don't know who be doin' it)
These niggas be talkin' (talkin')
They lemon squeeze (lemon squeeze)
Xd (XD), ooh, lemon squeeze (brrt, brrt, brrt), yeah
