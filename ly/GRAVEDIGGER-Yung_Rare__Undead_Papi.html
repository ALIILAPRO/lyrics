		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kick it up
Clutch is sticking up
Fucking shift into ignition bruh
Fuck transmission up
Kill the witness
Shake the witness up
Big fuckin wheels on the truck, cold steel in the trunk
We ain't gotta shoot shit
Lil' Bitch, you get run over
What the fuck made you niggas think that you couldn't get done over
Cuz no offense, Bitch
You look like an asshole
I went from the burbs, to the trap, and then back hoe
Now I got more sticks than I could mothafucking ask for
Feels like a nicotine itch
No patch can fix
Like a scratch you can't scritch, or a scab you can't pick, Boy
Trigger finger twitch
Had to lay a couple dead niggas in a ditch
And that's some regular shit

Need somebody stretched
We can get em for ya
Need somebody dead
We can hit em for ya
Yeah
I'm the Gravedigger
I can't dig any faster
I can't dig any faster

Grave Digger
Woulda thought I'm whipping a stolie
But this a monster truck
Grave Digger
It ain't really nun for me to get you touched
Big tipper
Milwaukee shit
I make that thing, shake it's butt
Like your sister, she a busser, the dick got her acting up
Take a picture, as soon as I glaze her face up with my nut
Post that on Twitter, tag yo stupid ass up on that, bruh
Left on delivered when I asked you drop that Lo, Huh
Knock on the door
Blitz them like I witnessed Jehovah
Snow and liquor
Out the window, blick them
His folks finna miss them
Spin the block like Twister
Make sure he not twitching
Leave yo body stiffen, forty Smithen
Take yo top off like you stripping
I go doley on a mission
Dragons Breath my ammunition
Make life hard for them morticians
Aim assist got mad precision
Long distance, 50 incision
Red dot Rudolph, Ima blitz them
Snub nose leave 6 holes up in them
Drop 30, ain't talking jiggas
Talm bout stendos and them switches
Me and Rare out here grave digging, UH

Need somebody stretched
We can get them for ya
Need somebody dead
We can hit them for ya
Yeah
I'm the Gravedigger
I can't dig any faster
I can't dig any faster
Need somebody stretched
We can get them for ya
Need somebody dead
We can hit them for ya
Yeah
I'm the Gravedigger
I can't dig any faster
I can't dig any faster
