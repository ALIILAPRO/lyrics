		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't
I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't

Uh, v√°monos, falling like a domino
On a roll, and you keep your mama close
Honestly, you get all my honesty
Last man played you like Monopoly (damn)
Tragedy, now you living happily (man)
Trapped with me, no one's comin' after me
It's only us, hope you know you hold me up
Photos on the 'Gram, damn I love it when you show me up

Boys mad, got the girl they dream 'bout
Girls mad 'cause I ain't as free now
Ma's glad 'cause I show my teeth now
In it for the long haul, I won't ever creep out

I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't
I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't
If I start to slip, tighten my grip
I'ma always hold you, don't you trip
'Cause I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't

Yeah, holding tight, this ain't happen overnight
It's cold tonight, so you sleepin' over, right?
Texting me, told you, "Come have sex with me"
Respectfully, I think about you sexually (yes)
Luckily, you forever stuck with me (bless)
Trust in me, can't believe you fuck with me
December hit, tell me you'll remember it
Brought you to my family, yeah, my mama said, "It's definite"

Boys mad, got the girl they dream 'bout
Girls mad 'cause I ain't as free now
Ma's glad 'cause I show my teeth now
In it for the long haul, I won't ever creep out

I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't
I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't
If I start to slip, tighten my grip
I'ma always hold you, don't you trip
'Cause I could never let you go
No, I won't, no, I won't
