		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone in the night
With only the thought of you
The stars that come into view
Do I know you by heart?

When we are apart
How are you so near to me?
So vivid, so clear to me
Like I know you by heart

When you want me like I want you
We're defenseless to our senses, to ourselves
But in hindsight, beyond the moonlight
At the merciless break of dawn
Will we awake and love move on?
Our bodies fade at the hands of time
Like stars
Eclipsed in the dark
All alone in the night

All alone in the night

Alone in the night
When you're making love to me
We know love instinctively
Don't you know me by heart?

When you love me like I love you
We're defenseless to our senses, to our souls
But in hindsight, in the twilight
At the merciless break of dawn
Will we awake, will love move on?
Our memories slip through the hands of time
Like stars eclipsed in the dark
Like you and I
All alone in the night

All alone in the night
All alone in the night

Alone in the night
How will you remember us?
If your memory turns to dust
Will you know me by heart?
By heart
By heart
By heart
