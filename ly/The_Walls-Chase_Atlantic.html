		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry if I look a little lost
I just keep my head up in the clouds yeah, yeah, yeah
Give it to her however she wants
Told her that she gotta keep it down though yeah, yeah
I could do this shit like every night
Grab your friends and pull them to the side yeah, yeah, yeah
Never been so busy in my life
Told me that she wanna do it twice now, yeah, yeah

Honestly, she needs a little lovin'
Fuck it now I'm gettin' off the subject yeah, yeah
I just think she needs a little something
Or someone to get into heavy drugs with yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

(I just think she needs a little something)
(Or someone to get into heavy drugs with yeah, yeah)

Everybody's hitting on the walls
I don't think they're ready for the fall (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cut a little, now she wanting more
Told her that I gotta make some calls (yeah, yeah, yeah)
This just might be one hell of a night (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come with me we gotta go outside (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody's hitting on the walls
Fuck it, I might take a little more now yeah, yeah

Life is getting busy everyday (everyday)
Take a little more to stay awake now, yeah, yeah
She been busy digging out her grave
Telling me that I gotta behave now, yeah, yeah

Honestly she needs a little lovin'
Fuck it now I'm gettin' off the subject, yeah, yeah
I just think she needs a little something
Or someone to get into heavy drugs with yeah, yeah

Everybody's hitting on the walls
I don't think they're ready for the fall (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cut a little, now she wanting more
Told her that I gotta make some calls (yeah, yeah, yeah)
This just might be one hell of a night (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come with me we gotta go outside (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody's hitting on the walls
Fuck it, I might take a little more now, yeah, yeah, yeah

(Honestly, she needs a little lovin')
(Fuck it now I'm gettin' off the subject) Yeah, yeah
(I just think she needs a little something)
(Or someone to get into heavy drugs with) Yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

This just might be one hell of a night (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come with me we gotta go outside (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Everybody's hitting on the walls
Fuck it, I might take a little more now

(Yeah, yeah)
