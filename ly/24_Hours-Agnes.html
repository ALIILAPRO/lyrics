		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My intuition said it from the start
I didn't wanna listen, I gave you my heart
Oh, little by little it all fell apart
Oh, yesterday was black and blue (blue, blue, blue)
Too many reasons to not go back again
Oh, sweet dreams finally came to an end
I thought that I would never see the light, my friend
Oh, yesterday was black and blue (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Walking through the fire all because of you
I found that something to believe in
Me, myself and I, all because of you
I found that something to believe in

Twenty-four hours never seemed so far away
Feels like a lifetime ago
Twenty-four hours, so little did I know
Twenty-four hours ago

In the religion of the insecure
Yeah, backlash hitting you down to the core
Oh, forgive and forgive and maybe there is hope
It's not all in black and blue (ooh, ooh, ooh)

Walking through the fire all because of you
I found that something to believe in
Me, myself and I, all because of you
I found that something to believe in

Twenty-four hours never seemed so far away
Feels like a lifetime ago
Twenty-four hours, so little did I know
Twenty-four hours ago (twenty-four)

Now is the last time, the last time I'll ever be yours
Just twenty-four hours ago
Now is the last time, the last time I'll ever be yours
Just twenty-four hours ago

As my world fell apart
It hit me like lightning in the dark
This is my sliding door moment
Here and now, I choose my future
Here and now, I choose my future
(I choose my future)

Twenty-four hours never seemed so far away
Feels like a lifetime ago
Twenty-four hours, so little did I know
Twenty-four hours ago

Twenty-four hours never seemed so far away
Feels like a lifetime ago
Twenty-four hours, so little did I know
Twenty-four hours ago

Now is the last time, the last time I'll ever be yours
Just twenty-four hours ago
Now is the last time, the last time I'll ever be yours
Just twenty-four hours ago
