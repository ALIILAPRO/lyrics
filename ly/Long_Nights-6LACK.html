		<p>
		  (Fuck)
(That's what I need, I need-, I just need)
(Wanna be in Miami or somewhere, mm-mm-mm)

I got a good side, got a bad side, do you wanna find out?
Rollin' through the city, I'm probably 'posed to be on timeout
Why you gotta ask, won't you just take it?
You want someone that won't fake it
Want someone that's down to get you naked
I know I'm a problem
I know that I'm somethin' you should ponder
God just sponsored the monster
Pimp like Katt Will
Black truck, got black wheels
Candy paint got the matte feel
I been stuntin' so wild, that it came up outta Nat Geo
Shawty open like pistachio
And I'm slight throwed off, so I had to go
Mami, I had to know, I

Hopin' for a fuck around
Hopin' for a good time
Hopin' for a long night
Pour up the drink, bacchanal
Mami, you bad as hell, I
Hopin' for a fuck around (yeah)
Hopin' for a good time
Hopin' for a long night
Pour up the drink, bacchanal
Mami, you bad as hell

She get Fendi on her lips, uh-huh
Think I wanna kiss just one
We did what should have been done
You the hottest thing under the sun

Hopin' for a fuck around (yeah)
Hopin' for good time
Hopin' for a long night
Pour up the drink, bacchanal
Mami, you bad as hell

(I just wanna put on a song and hear you)
(Baby, baby, baby)

Let's do something bad and laugh at it (you know?)
You cannot help that you mad at it
Roll up a joint, then we kick it, oh yeah, shawty
Pour us a drink, now we drunk and we fuckin' to Sade
Mm-hmm, hmm-hmm, how did we get here? (Yeah)
How did we get there?
With a night like that, what are we?
Don't ask no questions, shawty
Hotel room for the after party
You know that I want this shit
I like your vibe and you really legit
We done got low to the floor in this bitch
We done went high and went low in this bitch

That's just for one night
And if you wanna do it again, maybe we can
