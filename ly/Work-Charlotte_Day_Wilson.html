		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's gonna take a bit of work
Oh-oh, work
Now that you're here
Whoa-oh, work

'Cause people come and go
But I think you should know
That I
I think this will work

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

It's gonna take a little time
But with you by my side
I won't let go
'Til I've got what's mine

'Cause people come and go
But you should know
That I, that I
I'll take it slow

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh-ooh

It's gonna take a bit of work
Oh-oh, work
Now that you're here
Whoa-oh, work
It's gonna take a bit of work
Oh-oh, work
Now that you're here
Whoa-oh, work
