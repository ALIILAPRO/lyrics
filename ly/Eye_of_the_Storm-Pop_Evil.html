		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I-I know you're running from a tidal wave you can't ignore
I-I know you're trapped inside a hurricane
In the eye of the storm
Of the storm, of the storm
When it feels like you can't go on

You're only one step away
From breaking down the walls you made
The walls you made and
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go
But you're only one step away
From getting out of the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm

You're one step away
From falling off the edge
It's messing with your head
It's making you forget that you're one step away
From conquering the pain
From overcoming darkness when fear's in the way

You're only one step away
From breaking down the walls you made
The walls you made and
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go
But you're only one step away
Don't let it bury you, oh

I-I know you're running from a tidal wave you can't ignore
I-I know you're trapped inside a hurricane
In the eye of the storm

But you're only one step away
From breaking down the walls you made
The walls you made and
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go (I know it's hard to let go)
I know it's hard to move on
I know it's hard to let go
But you're only one step away

From getting out of the eye of the storm
Eye of the storm
Don't let it bury you
