		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up
I'm up, the fuck?
I'm up
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up (wake that ass up, wake that ass up)
I'm up, the fuck? (Wake that ass up)
(Wake that ass up, wake that ass up) I'm up
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up (wake that ass up)

I'm up, I'm woke as fuck
You still sleep bitch, that's why you broke as fuck
You still in yo' pajamas, that's why you ain't got no money
Bitch, I'm in the Bahamas, somewhere where it's sunny
'Cause I'm up for the bag
I'm up for the cash before the sun is
I need that shit fast, if it ain't no pass
I don't really want it
You see, that check is my alarm clock
It be ringin' nonstop
Don't believe me, bitch
Just check the diamonds in my damn watch

Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up
I'm up, the fuck?
I'm up
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up (wake that ass up, wake that ass up)
I'm up, the fuck? (Wake that ass up)
(Wake that ass up, wake that ass up) I'm up
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up (wake that ass up)

You don't gotta tell me to wake up
I was up early, gettin' my cake up
Ain't takin' no pay cuts, I don't want no lay-up
Be up so early, I might as well stay up
You still be sleepin' late, don't got no real estate
You don't get money, 'cause you don't do anything
The fuck have you been doin' anyway?
'Cause I just dropped mil' from my dinner dates

Early birds get the worm, and I'm one fly-ass bitch
If you broke, wake up early, ho, you should try that shit
I like designer, I like diamonds, I like fly-ass shit
So I'm up early, workin' for it, so I can buy that shit, bitch

(I'm up)
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up
I'm up, the fuck?
I'm up
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up (wake that ass up, wake that ass up)
I'm up, the fuck? (Wake that ass up)
(Wake that ass up, wake that ass up) I'm up
Wake yo' ass up, bitch, I'm up (wake that ass up)
