		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many beats are u beating ? 
So many things on your mind   
Do you ever feel for someone else 

How many pills in your system ? 
How many pills till you're fine? 
Does it ever make u feel alright 

So u break your bones 
Don't breathe at all 
Noe ones there to help 
 
I don't wanna see Your life
Turn into pain for someone else 
So don't go blind 
Go fight 
Cus every mother loves here child
So you wake up in the morning 

Oh you gotta wake up 

Heard you were high on a feeling
Bigger and stronger than life 
Is there any way to bring you down? 

How do you Sleep If your sleeping
How many times have you tried
Will you ever Gonna be alright

I don't wanna see Your life
Turn into pain for someone else 
So don't go blind 
Go fight 
Cus every mother loves here child
So you wake up in the morning 

Oh you gotta wake up
Oh you gotta wake up now
Oh you gotta wake up
Oh you gotta wake up now
