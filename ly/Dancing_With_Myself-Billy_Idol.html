		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the floors of Tokyo
Or down in London town to go, go
With the record selection
And the mirror's reflection
I'm dancing with myself

When there's no-one else in sight
In the crowded lonely night
Well, I wait so long
For my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh-oh, dancing with myself (oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (oh-oh-oh)
When there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove (ohh, oh)
Well, I'll be dancing with myself
Oh-oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh)

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh-oh, dancing with myself (oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (oh-oh-oh)
When there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove (ohh, oh)
Well, I'll be dancing with myself
Oh-oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh)

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (ohh, oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa (oh-oh-oh)

(Ta)
(Ta)
(Ta)
(Ta)
(Ta)
(Ta)
(Ta)

Well, if I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
'Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Oh-oh, dancing with myself
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance, ow

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Dancing with myself (oh, my hair's all wet)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (and I'm sweating)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (and I'll sweat, sweat, sweat)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat)
Oh-oh, dancing with myself (sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, sweat, ohh)

Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Whoa

Oh-oh, dancing with myself
Oh-oh-oh

With myself
Oh-oh-oh

With myself
