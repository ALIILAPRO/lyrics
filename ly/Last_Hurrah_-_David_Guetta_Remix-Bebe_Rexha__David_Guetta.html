		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gon' stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

This is my last hurrah
This is my last hurrah

I'm done with the drinking, I'm done with the smoking
I'm done with the playing, I'm done with the joking
I'm done with the ladies, I'm done with the fellas
Just sayin' (yeah)
Farewell tequila, so long margarita
And lady sativa, I hate to leave ya
Don't want the pressure, I don't need a lecture
No, thank you, honey, God bless ya

I know I've said it all before
But it won't hurt to do it all once more

This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gon' stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

This is my last hurrah
This is my last hurrah

I'm done with the heartache, I'm done with the demons
Can't wait to be normal, right after this weekend
I'm done with the drama, I'm fixing my karma
One more night up your nirvana

I know I've said it all before
But it won't hurt to do it all once more

This is my last hurrah, once I start
I ain't gon' stop 'til I go too far
Last hurrah and it's okay
Maybe tomorrow I won't feel this pain
Last hurrah
Last hurrah

This is my last hurrah
This is my last hurrah
This is my last hurrah

Maybe I'll never change
But I'm still glad I came
Try again another day
But for now

This is my last hurrah
This is my last hurrah
Last hurrah
Last hurrah
This is my last hurrah
