		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Patience
Feels like I've been waiting for a lifetime
For lightning to strike me
Daydreams
Feels like I've been sending out the signals
Hoping that you'll find me

I don't need the detail, you don't need to tell me
It's like I already know where you'll be

You and me
We were lovers in a past life
Slow dancin' in the midnight glow
I wanna hold you for a lifetime
For all we know
And these are familiar places
And maybe we're not just strangers
You and me
We were lovers in a past life
For all we know

Distance
Only ever makes the heart grow stronger
Late at night, I wonder
Were you thinkin' of me
In someone else's arms? (Oh)
Does that feel like it's meant to be?

You and me
We were lovers in a past life
Slow dancin' in the midnight glow
I wanna hold you for a lifetime
For all we know
And these are familiar places
And maybe we're not just strangers
You and me
We were lovers in a past life
For all we know

We were lovers

(I wanna hold you for a lifetime)
