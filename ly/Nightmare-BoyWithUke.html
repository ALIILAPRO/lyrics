		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm too emotional, I have to let you go
I haven't cleaned my room since last time you came home
And everyday that passes by, makes it so much harder to enjoy my life
Though, it's part of growing older
I'm sleeping with the lights off
It's better, if I'm blind so I can get you off my mind, 'cause

Every time I see you smile, I die a little bit
Heard that you've been doing well, I wonder who you're with
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare
But every time I see those eyes
I wonder if you know you're keeping me up late at night
I don't know where to go
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare

I'm too impulsive, I didn't mean to call again
I wasn't thinking straight last night at 3AM
I've been having trouble tryna fall asleep
Melatonin by my side, but my will is weak
Keepin' notions that I'm fine so I don't need
Medicated remedies, fuck benzodiazepines

Every time I see you smile, I die a little bit
Heard that you've been doing well, I wonder who you're with?
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare
But every time I see those eyes
I wonder if you know you're keeping me up late at night
I don't know where to go
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare

How do I try? I don't why I wanna fall in love
I wanna die, every time I see you parking up
Forget about the fights, remember the nights we had, it's not enough
I wanna lie, pretend I'm alright, but

Every time I see you smile, I die a little bit
Heard that you've been doing well, I wonder who you're with?
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare
But every time I see those eyes
I wonder if you know you're keeping me up late at night
I don't know where to go
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare

Every time I see you smile, I die a little bit
Heard that you've been doing well, I wonder who you're with?
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare
But every time I see those eyes
I wonder if you know you're keeping me up late at night
I don't know where to go
I pretend, I don't care, I tell myself you're right here
It's nothing but a nightmare, nightmare
