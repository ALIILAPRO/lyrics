		  Who that is, ho?
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy

Who that is, ho?
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy

Who that is, ho?
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy

Who that is, ho?
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy
That girl is a tomboy

With my little titties and my fat belly
I could take your man if you finna let me
It's a guarantee that he won't forget me
My body little, my soul is heavy
My little titties be bookin' cities all around the world
They be fucking wit' me
I'm a Calvin Klein model, come and get me
Step the resy up, don't be fucking with me
My little titties are so itty bitty
I go locomotive, chitty chitty, bang bang
Gold hoops and that name chain
Timb boots and like four rings
Missy Elliott, can't stand the rain
You lames playing the same games
Little titties, I'm so damn pretty
Staircase and a cracked philly
Little titties and a kitty kitty
Big pants and some scuffed shoes
Pow-pow-pow, Blue's Clues
(Pow-pow-pow, pow-pow)

With my little titties and my fat belly
My little titties and my fat belly
My little titties and my fat belly
(Is a tomboy, who that is ho?)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my fat belly
(That girl is a tomboy) woo
My little titties and my fat belly (who that is ho?)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
(That girl is a tomboy) yeah, ho

Who that is, ho? (My little titties and my fat belly)
That girl is a tomboy (my little titties and my fat belly)
That girl is a tomboy (my little titties)
That girl is a tomboy

Who that? Who that? Who that?
Princess Nokia, Baby Phat
I be where the ladies at
Who know how to shake it fast
We gon' spit that brazy track
You know that I'll take it back
I'm spitting the illest mack
Yeah, ho
Who that? Who that? Who that?
Princess Nokia, make it clap
She with it to set it back
And get with a fire track
Y'all, watch what gon' happen next

Who that up in the North?
Dennis Rodman the court
When I step up in the function it's a party, of course
I'm having fun with my friends
And I don't want it to end
And if you finna blow my high then I'ma punch you again

With my little titties and my fat belly
My little titties and my fat belly
My little titties and my fat belly (Nokia)
(Is a tomboy, who that is ho?)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my fat belly
(That girl is a tomboy) woo
My little titties and my fat belly (who that is ho?)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
My little titties and my fat belly (that girl is a tomboy)
(That girl is a tomboy) yeah, ho

Who that is, ho? (My little titties and my fat belly)
That girl is a tomboy (my little titties and my fat belly)
That girl is a tomboy (my little titties)
That girl is a tomboy (yeah, ho)

He so in love
He think it's a spell
There's levels to magic and he cannot tell
He fuck with my bruja, my pussy a spell
My toto is special, got locks like a jail
It's Polo, it's Tommy, it's Mecca, it's Nauti
I'm finna sit back and just sip on Bacardi
You come to my party
You gon' meet my army
A room full of girls and we acting real rowdy
