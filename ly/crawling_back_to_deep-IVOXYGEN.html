		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We met on a night
Where you blessed my sight
Like fifty other dudes
Shot down before I
Caved in to hype
You say
"Me, oh My!"
"You don't strike me like the others
What is with this guy?"
It's OK
Cease all anxiety
Look, before we get sprung
I go by Dr3
You go by wasting time
Yes, I know your kind
Came here with your girls
But these men don't mind
Look
Pretty lady, it ain't
Gotta be like that
G'on tell yo friends
That you will be right back
YA LIED!
No swerve
But let's both slide!
And I thought
I could assist with the alibi
Why would I resist
Where your interest lie?
You the type
To act if it's all alright
Nah
We don't mask or hide
It's something bout your heart
That I can't deny
NO!
Fast forward
Cooking you breakfast
Sure look clean
In that all white Lexus
Lord done blessed me
Cruise into my heart
Then she block the exit
Who'd a guessed it?
Mi Amor
From ceiling to floor
Healing the boy
It ain't just a feeling
I know it!
Sharp support
Plus we keep a tight rapport
Any mention of your name
And my mind adore
Stop!
Hol' up!
Won't you listen?
Can't you tell
That this man on a mission?
Always bring
What I lack and been missing
All I need
So it ain't double dipping!
No double dipping!
Gotta go and get it
Never take for granted
That your love is a privilege
Any other threat
That you imagined
Was a figment!
Stop, hol' up, listen
Man on a mission.
