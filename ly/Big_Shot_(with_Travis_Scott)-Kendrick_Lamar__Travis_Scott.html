		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wakanda, welcome

Big shot, hol' up, wait, peanut butter insides (no)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot, big shot, (hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah

Serve that work for Kung-Fu Kenny
Got juice, got work, got weight, got plenty
Got them, got her, got more, got Benji (yeah)
Top off gettin' topped-off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fiddy (yeah)
I hit the ceiling and forgot about the floor (yeah)
Brand so big, got my haters on the ropes (yeah)
This be the wave, plus I live on the coast (yeah)
When I touch a bag, young nigga do the most (yeah)
Mmm, woo, and I Wakanda flex
And you know what time it is (yeah)
But don't know what grindin' is
Baby, I care, baby, I swear
Only one real nigga here
Only two real niggas here (yeah)

Big shot, hol' up, wait, peanut butter insides (no)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot, big shot, (hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah

Big shots (yeah)
Purped up, syrup'd up, nigga, like Pimp C
Flight suit, 'bouta slide down space city
Top down, she down under like Iggy (yeah, it's lit)
Lockjaw when the night-call too litty
Knockoff, get your rocks off, got plenty
Got rocks, got Jay's, got 'Ye, got Lenny (yeah)
I need my engine, she need extensions (yeah)
Don't be the center-attention, just play your position (straight up)
Got my life on a yacht mission 'cause they been a vision (yeah, yeah)
Runnin' through these waves like I'm Moses out the booth
Hop out the trees, whippin' a frog and it leap
Foggy, can't breathe, Vacheron over Philippe (alright)
Out in the street (yeah), chill with the gang, make it sweet
Big shots, yeah (do-do-do-do)
Forget your name like I'm Steve

Big shot, hol' up, wait, peanut butter insides (no)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot, big shot, (hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
