		  Meon 
Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to hear the things I have to say 
I fear today
Does anybody want to see me cry
If I'm the only one I'd rather die

Thoughtless baby
(Repeat)

Does anybody want to see me smile
Does anybody want to open up and see what's vile
Sometimes it's like it's said
Sometimes it's throw away

Thoughtless baby
(Repeat)

Does anybody want to take me on
Does anybody want to see me die
When he cries, throws away

Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to see me cry
If I'm the only one I'd rather die

Thoughtless baby (Repeat)

I'd rather die
Does anybody want to take me on
(Repeat)
