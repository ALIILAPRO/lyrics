		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sea is crying sunset.
Waves erasing all.
These sounds remind me
of sweet memories
and bitter days.
The wind is laughing quietly.
I thought we walked together.
We walked hand in hand.
We would sound the bell.
In the light of youth and chaos.
Your letter said "good-bye"
on the old table.
If I grew wings on my back.
If I had courage in my heart.
I would fly to take you away.
But it's no fairy tale.
For fear of being wounded.
I said nothing.
What an awkward man you are.
She laughed and left me.
I won't forget your smile.
I don't need to cry,
I don't need to cry.
Sea and tears dyed red
by the setting sun.
I don't know why,
I don't say good bye.
Run over to the setting sun.

Suddenly I walk
go to the barber.
I don't need
my long hair anymore.
River, Waterfalls,
Stardust, Rainbow,
I saw various things.
Once again. Once again.
But once again.....
I don't need to cry,
I don't need to cry,
Sea and tears dyed red
by the setting sun.
I don't know why,
I don't say good bye.
Run over to the setting sun.
I don't need to cry,
I don't need to cry,
Sea and tears dyed red
by the setting sun.
I don't know why,
I don't say good bye.
Run over to the setting sun.
Over to the setting sun.
Over to the setting sun.
