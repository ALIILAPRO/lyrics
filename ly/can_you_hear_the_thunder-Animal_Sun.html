		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fate has brought us here
Beneath the pale afterglow of my despair
Light behind your eyes
Seems to flash across the skin of my disguise
And I've got chills down to my bones
With a weight above the clouds that built your throne
Real, this can't be real
As you cast me from the mountain to your feet
I'm yours to keep
Oh when I try to leave
You've got another one up your sleeve
(Oh, don't let me go)
Before the thunder rolls
I look straight into your eyes I'm feeling paralyzed
(Oh, don't let me go)
Before the thunder rolls
I begin to hate myself
Just as these walls do melt
Oh honey, you'll see things in me I'll never be
(What do you want from me?)
Wish I could break your heart
Not tear myself apart
It's your tainted innocence that devours me, oh no
And you're the howling winds of the roaring sea
You shake me to the core of reality
Weathered down by pouring rain my soul is yours to own
Oh when I try to leave
You've got another one up your sleeve
(Oh, don't let me go)
Before the thunder rolls
I look straight into your eyes I'm feeling paralyzed
(Oh, don't let me go)
Before the thunder rolls
I hear the thunder roar
I hear the thunder roar
(Oh, don't let me go)
When I try to leave
You've got another one up your sleeve
(Oh, don't let me go)
Before the thunder
