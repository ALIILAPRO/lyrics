		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Doctor, look into my eyes
I've been breathin' air, but there's no sign of life
Doctor, the problem's in my chest
My heart feels cold as ice, but it's anybody's guess

Doctor, can you help me 'cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me 'cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind

Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me 'cause somethin' don't feel right
Somethin' don't feel right

Sweet nurse, don't look at me that way
I've seen those eyes before, I can tell you want to play
Counselor, give me some advice
Tell me how hard will I fall if I live a double life

Doctor, can you help me 'cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast before I change my mind
Doctor, can you help me 'cause I don't feel right
Better make it fast because there ain't much time

Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Darker in the day than the dead of night
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me 'cause somethin' don't feel right
Somethin' don't feel right
Somethin' just ain't right

And as the darkness falls, it fills up both my eyes
My life before me like a flash in the night
With my arms open wide

Well, it's cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Cold, cold, cold, cold inside
Doctor, can you help me 'cause somethin' don't feel right
Somethin' don't feel right
Somethin' just ain't right
