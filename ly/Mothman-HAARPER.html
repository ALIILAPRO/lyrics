		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What's the cost moths in the box
When you got the scrilla
You don't worry about no loss
Tell me where's the pain
Pharaohs in my name when you see the light
I want you all to runaway

Summon the syndicate
Go fetch the leader of your pack
I carry your whole world
I carry the carriage on my back
The marriage of death and ana
Swiftly knocking at your door
We leaving no survivors
Leave you higher than your soul

Your vessel gon rot rot with the rocks
You won't find a way
I've played the moths in the box
Sleep with one eye on the prize on the pot
Got the other two on the on
The knife on the lock

I'm leviathan, flood like niacin
Cold like cryogen, nitrogen
Grown like biotin from the vitamins
Show and tell, I'ma show you hell
Throw you in the well, rid the rings
All the shiny things, with hellish caroling

Mystic flames have risen
From the surface of the building
Bringing my wing span to the ceiling
Everybody seen me turn to the villain
I'ma go shock I'ma shock
I'ma shock like Femto
Count to 15, I'ma claw crescendo
Make em fall out make it fall like a bento
While I beat her box God Hand like kenpo

What's the cost moths in the box
When you got the scrilla
You don't worry about no loss
Tell me where's the pain
Pharaohs in my name when you see the light
I want you all to runaway
