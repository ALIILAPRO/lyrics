		  Legends on three, two, one

'Cause I'm GOATED, GOATED, GOATED
GOATED, GOATED, GOATED, please
Please don't go there, go there, go there
Go there, go there with me (go there)
'Cause I'm GOATED, GOATED
GOATED, GOATED, GOATED
GOATED, GOATED
GOATED, GOATED, GOATED (ayy, ayy, ayy)

Barely even got enough change in the meter
Double parked, lookin' like Bane in a beater
Her friends keep helpin' detangle the weave
Only jumped in the front seat to play with the speakers
Stuck to my plans, stretchin' my bands
Plus when I stomp in my customized Vans
Plush like, rush life, plus I got 'em all plus size
Panamera trunk, I hop out the roof, yeah
Dime on my left wrist and she got the flu, yeah
Watch look like Chex Mix, it's 'posed to be blue, huh
She know it's two seats, so she leave her best friends
Buss down my dad face, your chain is a necklace

'Cause I'm GOATED, GOATED, GOATED
GOATED, GOATED, GOATED, please
Please don't go there, go there, go there
Go there, go there, go there with me
Left wrist golden, right wrist golden
Necklace golden, yes, it's golden
Just don't go there, go there, go there
Go there, go there, go there with me (ayy)

I had to hit my designer for sneaks
Double dip mine in the bleach, I'm Blanco for sure (I miss my dad)
If I'm poppin' down Miami Beach
Pull up like Lebron with the Heat, huh?
I bought crib in a crib with a office chair
Beach half a mile, but I can't see me walkin' there
I whip a Tesla, but it ain't no charger there
I call up Co and Brianna and park it there
Top heat, box seats, I'm watchin' Archer there
Cop lights, stop right, next where my block at, trust fall
Beat I might drop that
Hips on Thee Stallion and Doja her top half, uh
2300 on the horse and I'm Michael
Switchin' out the character, the strip is like typos
Legends on three, two, one

Oh, you tried it
You say you love me like love him, you lyin'
You know your worth, for what it's worth, I could buy it
Would say it's lonely at the top, but I'm biased
Because I'm only at the top, but you tried it (yeah)
You say you love me like love him, you lyin'
You know your worth, for what it's worth, I could buy it
Would say it's lonely at the top, but I'm biased

Okay, I have reloaded
Bitch, I'm GOATED

Walk on this beat like I'm walkin' to Poland
Got Glocks that I'm holdin' and guap that I'm throwin'
Hoes gon' love a nigga in some Rick Owens
And different color diamonds like I'm Josh Brolin
How many times can I tell you I'm GOATED?
How many times can I tell you I'm GOATED?
How many times can I tell you I'm GOATED
Without niggas actin' like they do not know it?
Why sir? See every year I'm gettin' better as a writer (okay)
And when it comes down to the flow, I'm gettin' nicer (okay)
And niggas couldn't name a song, but a cypher (okay)
It doesn't matter, 'cause I'm still gettin' money though (okay)
The only reason why you hatin', 'cause your money low (okay)
And every hundred thousand dollars, there's a hundred hoes (okay)
When niggas see you as a GOAT, that's just how it goes (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Niggas don't wanna see you do great
Rather they see you fall off and then watch your whole ego deflate
Don't give a damn what you make
I see the jealousy, boy, that's a horrible trait (mm)
I spot the hate, no binoculars (mm)
This how it feels to be popular (mm)
They sendin' shots, no photographer (mm)
Don't give a damn, that ain't stoppin' me

'Cause I'm GOATED, GOATED, GOATED
GOATED, GOATED, GOATED, please
Please don't go there, go there, go there
Go there, go there, go there with me
Left wrist golden, right wrist golden
Necklace golden, yes, it's golden
Just don't go there, go there, go there
Go there, go there, go there with me, yeah
