		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little boy covered in make-up, what has the world done to him'
You think I'm only joking, But I tell you, you're not getting through.
We give all our lives for you, just we two, never get away.
We give all our love to you, just we two, never get away, never get away.

Your mind growing older, what has this life done to him'
You think we're only joking, but I tell you, you're not getting through.
We give all our lives for you, all day through, never give away.
We give all our time you see, just so we gently slip away, gently slip away
