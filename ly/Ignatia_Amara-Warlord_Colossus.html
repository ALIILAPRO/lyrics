		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm feeling fucked up
I do not trust her
I bring the thunder
Why do I suffer
Switchblade stomping on the feet
May day open up the coffin got the key
Always wheezing coughing bout to vomit
On the street
Pop a tab of acid now I'm stomping on the beat
Ima die slow
Feeling like a ripped throat
Walking on the rope
Let it go to the cold
Breathe slow with the flow
Walking to the hangman show
With the crowds in the rows
And the birds be the crows
You came to flip on the gang
I came with boots and a chain
I stomp em I'm looking at brains
Vampire tuck in my fang
Look at me level up watching me change
Ay, aye
We not the same
Pussy boy suffered his fate
King of the hate
Look at my energy never the same
Look at me change
All of my friends
They do not talk to me
Lets not pretend
This is the end
Eyes turning black
And my veins turning red
I'm out of dopamine
I got no soul in me
I got nobody to talk to me
Demons be calling me
I'm at the top of my levels
You sit with the devil don't talk to me ever
Bitch
I'm feeling fucked up
I do not trust her
I bring the thunder
Why do I suffer
I'm feeling fucked up
I do not trust her
I bring the thunder
Why do I suffer
I'm feeling fucked up
I do not trust her
I bring the thunder
Why do I suffer
I'm feeling fucked up
I do not trust her
I bring the thunder
Why do I suffer
