		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The stop lights, a familiar drive
Through another ghost town on a Saturday night
All alone so you're losing your mind tonight
And I said, "Calm down, I'll there by tonight"
Don't you get yourself down, not the end of your life
Don't mean that you'll marry me tonight, tonight

And you said, "You got it? We're nothing"
I'm the worst, if you want it

When your heart aches and it's dead in the night
Don't you worry for me, it's cool
It's enough to survive, don't you worry, I want your
Fainted love, that's enough, fainted love

Dark room, not a whisper or word
Guess you take all the pain that you think you deserve
Won't sleep 'cause it's easy to hurt tonight, tonight

'Cause you said, "You got it? We're nothing"
I'm the worst, if you want it

When your heart aches and it's dead in the night
Don't you worry for me, it's cool
It's enough to survive, don't you worry, I want your
Fainted love, that's enough, fainted love
I want your fainted love, that's enough, fainted love

White lies from the passenger seat
Say you'll love me for life, say you'll never leave
Kiss me 'til I almost believe, tonight

But when your heart aches and it's dead in the night
Don't you worry for me, it's cool
It's enough to survive, don't you worry, I want your
Fainted love, that's enough, fainted love
I want your fainted love, that's enough, fainted love
