		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, ooh

They said a man rich with love
Could go crazy
Spendin' all his gold
Bettin' on a maybe, ooh-ah

Just like that river, baby
Don't let it be misunderstood

If you told me to come runnin'
Runnin', runnin'
You know that I would (I would, I would)
You know that I would (I would, I would)
All for you

You know I'd satisfy you, honey
Ooh, on the daily (on the daily)
She got me cryin' to the Lord
Screamin' out, "Oh, someone come and save me" (come and save me, come and save me)

Just like that mountain, baby (ooh, ooh-ooh)
My love is standin' tall for you

You said you'd love me if you could (if you could)
It doesn't do me any good (any good)
You know that I would (I would, I would)
You know that I would (I would, I would)
You know that I would (I would, I would)
You know that I would
Ooh, ooh, yeah
