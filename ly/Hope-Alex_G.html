		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He was a good friend of mine
He died, why write about it now?
Gotta honor him somehow
Yeah, saw some people cryin' that night
Yeah, Fentanyl took a few lives from our life
Alright

I awoke in the middle of the night
He spoke with his eyes half closed
Can you get me somethin' else to eat?
Got a hole in my chest, I can't take it anymore
Put my pillow to the test, let me rest

In the house they were callin' out his name
All night takin' turns on the bed
Throwin' bottles from the windows of the home
On Hope Street
You can write a check in my name now
Eddie, take the money and run
