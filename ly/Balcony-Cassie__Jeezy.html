		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna scream, I don't even wanna tell you
How good it is
Because if it's a dream
I'd only wake myself up
And baby I don't wanna ruin this
Honestly, I was scared 'cause
I know you, were prepared
And you know what I was thinking
All my thoughts, all my cares
Then we made love on the balcony
Right there in new york city
I saw the tourists staring back at me (They're all staring back at me)
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was alive

I said she sassy, she classy, haircut like she Cassie
Why your voices so raspy
Ooh, I hope she nasty
Last night, good kush and Sirrock with a super freak
Told him put it on my black card
Get it super sweet
We can do it right now girl, I don't give a fuck
Right here in the valley, we can do it in the truck
Got her legs on the dashboard, yeah I got a boulder
Maybe it's the kush or the heat but it's fogged up
Go

Had a couple drinks, later L it was perfect
Started enjoying the scene, now breathe
We couldn't help it
All things have their purpose
The wind it blew, through my hair love
I was stunned by your stare
From the sight of you, standing there love
I could walk, walk on air
Then we made love on balcony
Right there in New York City
I saw the tourists staring back at me (They're all staring back at me)
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was mine

Started off on the floor
Ended up up on the dresser
Baby girl name is Pam
Why I just called her Vanessa
I'm on the balcony stylin'
I got her legs on the rail
I locked that thing out the frame
Like I just got out of jail
She said Young don't you quit
She said Young don't you stop
She said you happy to see me?
I said no girl that's my Glock
She said you're G to your heart
You just so stuck in your ways
I said girl what you mean?
Why you still got on your J's?
I said they just dropped today
So I'mma keep on my shoes
And you keep moaning like that
Then we gonna be on the news
I like bitches with money
She likes niggas with power
She said let's do it again
But this time in the shower, gone

Then we made love on balcony
Right there in New York City
I saw the tourists staring back at me (They're all staring back at me)
In Times Square in New York City
And in that moment the city was ours
Turn the lights on
