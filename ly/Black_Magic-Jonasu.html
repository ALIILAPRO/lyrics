		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Driving down the four five
Running all the stop signs
The way you're touching my skin
The way you're making me sin

Layin' in your backseat 
So put your magic on me
Come and tie me up in your strings, uh, make me do anything

Yeah yeah, got me lookin' hella crazy
Yeah yeah, got me tripping on you lately
Yeah yeah, I'm under your spell and I'm under your body, oh

It's like
Black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic
The things you do to me yeah
Black, black magic
Oh just like that
Black, black magic
You work your voodo on me
Black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic
The things you do to me yeah
Black, black magic
Oh just like that
Black, black magic
You work your voodo on me

Black, black magic
Black, black magic
Your voodo on me
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 

Staring into dark eyes
You're controlling my mind
The way you're touching my skin
The way you're making me sin

Bring me down on my knees, 
So the devil doesn't take me
Tangling up in emotion
We go down in slow motion

Yeah yeah, got me lookin' hella crazy
Yeah yeah, got me tripping on you lately
Yeah yeah, I'm under your spell and I'm under your body, oh

It's like
Black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic
The things you do to me yeah
Black, black magic, oh just like that
Black, black magic
You work your voodo on me
Black, black magic
You work your voodoo on me
Black, black magic
The things you do to me yeah
Black, black magic, oh just like that
Black, black magic
You work your voodo on me

Black, black magic
Black, black magic
Your voodo on me
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 
Black, black 

Black, black magic
Black, black magic
Black, black magic, oh just like that
Black, black magic
