		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  "Parsed out on this rippity-dippity-rippity-dippity-rippity-dippity triplet flows
The $UICIDEBOY$ formula is pretty obvious at this point
Whether it'd be because you've heard some of the duo's previous EP's 
Or you're familiar with the classic Hip-Hop albums 
That the duo pretty much used as inspir-"

Swervin'
7th Ward (7th Ward, 7th Ward)
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
7th Ward

7th Ward swerving, white Benz, wheels turnin'
Rose gold chrome accent on the rims, picture perfect
No destination, let's just wait and see where we end up
Burnin' zones, burnin' up the ozone, Backwood stay tightly tucked
Bitch look at me, she said "Yuck!"
"What the fuck?" Hoe, I'm Oddy Nuff
I don't fuck with lifeforms from this planet, bitch, you out of luck
I got better shit to do, like sip the lines up in my cup
I ain't sharing, pint stay tucked
Waste my whole life hunting ducks

"The flows on this thing generally are pretty tight
It seems almost as if there is a slightly larger focus on hooks with this project, too (norf, norf)
Some of which really pop, like on the track 'Nicotine Patches' (norf, norf)
One day I'll forget their name!"

I be that rotten garbage crawlin' out the ditch, stitches for a snitch
Bodies in the fridge, blade scraping
Grey aping, banging on my fucking chest
Feel the static, problematic, be my motherfucking guest
Yung Christ, masked up for a poltergeist
Feel like I'm stuck in a vice, feel like I been paid my price
My wrists have been sliced
Now I'm scarred from the blade that's pressed against my skin
Lifeless and I'm stuck up in this shit
The walking Mortal Sin, whose lives will never end
Fuck

"But simultaneously
There are spots on this album where the lyrics 
Can come off a bit too edgy or try-hard
Or basic, maybe even juvenile
Especially on the track 'Mr. Nice Guy'"
