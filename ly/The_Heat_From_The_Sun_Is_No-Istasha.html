		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swing wide, go side, never age, soul side
Rewind, Benjamin, overtime, dolls eye
Cloud vision, no flash but I’m full blind
Overclock shifting, no crash

Cart filled loud to the brim
Back bent from the weight
Feel the silence like a brick to the head, no
Stay sickle like a spine on trial
When I’m Giles Old Corey, keep it silent
No fentanyl
Forty rocks, more weight, I’m might vomit
Call me monetary gain, I'm a prophet
Save face, No shame, No stopping
No capping, my retina, blank
Stay blocking up

Swing wide, go sidе, never age, soul sidе
Rewind, Benjamin, overtime, dolls eye
Cloud vision, no flash but I’m full blind
Overclock shifting, no crash and I’m all fine
Swing wide, go side, never age, soul side
Rewind, Benjamin, overtime, dolls eye
Cloud vision, no flash but I’m full blind
Overclock shifting, no crash and I’m all fine

Cart filled loud to the brim
Back bent from the weight
Feel the silence like a trail of a witch
Shit
Feel lost, crow pack, Have my teeth picked
Let em come back with the
Tides and I’m seasick
Forty rocks, More weight, I’m might vomit
Call me monetary gain, I'm a prophet
Save face, No shame, No stopping
No capping, my retina, blank
Stay blocking up

Swing wide, go side, never age, soul side
Rewind, Benjamin, overtime, dolls eye
Cloud vision, no flash but I’m full blind
Overclock shifting, no crash and I’m all fine
Swing wide, go side, never age, soul side
Rewind, Benjamin, overtime, dolls eye
Cloud vision, no flash but I’m full blind
Overclock shifting, no crash and I’m all fine

If I’m ever losing touch, I’m out the back
KO
Cannot keep on taking shot, crack, Sarajevo
Phantom pains is all I got
Block bodies in the gutter
Cup of rot duck thots, bye, buttercup
In the background, split me like a wing, huh
Manufacture up, worship anything, huh
Getting dragged down, went in that thing
Blackhole sucked
Turn into a coiled-up spring
Go, red light, I’ll intersect that spot
Call me six, how I’m sensing the plot
Go, red light, I’ll intersect that spot
Call me six, how I’m sensing the plot
