		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pink Floyd lemonade dripping on my tongue
Okay now I feel it creeping in my blood
Two face I'll just keep it moving till I'm done
Lungs full of kush I got heaven in my blunt

I don't even need two cups
You ain't know bout nothing
Still tryna stay up
Won't say shit bout nothing
I'm out of touch
Still worry bout nothing
And I still feel nothing
How long this shit gon last

Voice in the dash
Tell me to crash
I ain't tryna pull over
I'm too attached
Living in the past
I ain't tryna stay sober
Ok keep it close range
But I still keep my composure
No I don't need closure

I'm so psychotic
Gold cap in my pocket
Lifestyle of reject and I keep waking up nauseous
No lights surround me
I feel so lonely
I'm on my own but I still hear them moaning

Tell me I'm ok and that I got it
Don't try to hold back cause I'm flawless
I'm sipping on red wine I got problems
I wouldn't doubt it
Yeah

Pink Floyd lemonade dripping on my tongue
Okay now I feel it creeping in my blood
Two face I'll just keep it moving till I'm done
Lungs full of kush I got heaven in my blunt

I don't even need two cups
You ain't know bout nothing
Still tryna stay up
Won't say shit bout nothing
I'm out of touch
Still worry bout nothing
And I still feel nothing
How long this shit gon last

Voice in the dash
Tell me to crash
I ain't tryna pull over
I'm too attached
Living in the past
I ain't tryna stay sober
Ok keep it close range
But I still keep composure
No I don't need closure
