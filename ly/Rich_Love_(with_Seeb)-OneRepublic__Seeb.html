		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I remember talking and drinking what we could find
Burnin' all those candles and stayin' up through the night
We'd make reservations for the places we know we'd never try
But then oh, we found some rich love
I remember feeling broke as a bottle of wine
I didn't move to the city to count all my pennies and worship the Hollywood sign
She'd say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"
But she'd take it in one last time
And I know, 'cause I found some fake love

Ooh, broke as a bottle of wine
Ooh, but drink with you all damn night
Ooh, I'm not trying to trade love
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey is just enough
We got some rich love

She'd say, "Hey man,"
She'd say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"
She'd say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"
But she'd take it in one last time and I know

Do you remember dancing? The parties out in the yard?
We would piss off the neighbors
They'd eventually call the cops
And I was saving up for something, hoping life would finally start
'Cause oh, we had some new love

Ooh, broke as a bottle of wine
Ooh, but drink with you all damn night
Ooh, broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love

She'd say, "Hey man,"
She'd say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"
She'd say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"
But she'd take it in one last time and I know

Oh, we're broke as a bottle of wine
Said, we're broke as a bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love

She'd say, "Hey man,"
She'd say, "Hey man, nice to meet you,"
We're broke as a bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love

We're broke as a bottle of wine
Broke as a bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine, bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine
We're broke as a bottle of wine
'Cause if we don't find money
Then what we got honey lifts it up
We got some rich love
