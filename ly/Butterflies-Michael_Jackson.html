		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh
I just want to touch you

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

If you would take my hand, baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I

I just want to touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I
