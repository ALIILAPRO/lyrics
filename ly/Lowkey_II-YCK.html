		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Smoking in the backyard crash and I can't start
Blunts to the face when I race like it's NASCAR
Bitch I've been my own plug growing all my own drugs
Step into the dirt and I've been digging fucking bones up 

Pretty fucking factual that I don't like a casual
I'm winging all this shit I'm rolling deeper with no manual
Can't see well you got glaucoma
Backing up quick put you in a Glock coma 

No one say let's go out to fucking Fresno 
I don't need a bitch in my ear cause I said so 
Say that I'll be famous but I don't think being less known
Making any difference I already made a death note

Drug composing I'm down and I'm feeling loaded 
I'm smoking alone and hoping a fucker would toe to toe and
Fade that's a fact no problem when I attack
So wack when they all rap but fuck it I made a stack

Yeah we like to keep it lowkey
Hard up in the paint bitch I gotta go deep
Rolling up first then I'm getting proceeds
I've been spilling codeine I'm a fucking dope fiend

Body bag zip zip blunts that I rip rip
Bet you went and fuckin told the cops little tip tip
Thinking that you big shit then you start to nitpick
'Bout ta meet up with your bitch fuck then I dip quick

Break a fucking vessel all my demons I will meddle with
Drugs up in my blood I pay the statement I will settle with
Ain't a lot of rappers I can say that I be level with 
Triple six up I be repping all the devil shit 

Back vengeance ideas I fucking penned it
I've gotten all your attention I'm serving a time my sentence 
Going never ending this money I want to spend it 
Well I'm guessing that's the benefit of federal pension

Locking em up I'm hopping a bump when I ride and swerve 
Copping a cup I'm coughing it up now we tied in first
To me it's so amusing they try me but I'm the master
I beat em into a pulp and I'm leaving a body tattered

Yeah we like to keep it lowkey
Hard up in the paint bitch I gotta go deep
Rolling up first then I'm getting proceeds
I've been spilling codeine I'm a fucking dope fiend
