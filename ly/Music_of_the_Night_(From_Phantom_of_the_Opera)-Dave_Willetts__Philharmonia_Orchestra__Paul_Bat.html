		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Phantom)
Night time sharpens
Heightens each sensation...
Darkness wakes
And stirs imagination
Silently the senses 
Abandon their defences
Helpless to resist 
The notes I write
For I compose 
The music of the night...

Slowly, gently
Night unfurls its splendour.
Grasp it, sense it -
Tremulous and tender
Hearing is believing
Music is deceiving
Hard as lightning
Soft as candlelight
Dare you trust
The music of the night...

Close your eyes
For your eyes will only tell the truth
And the truth
Isn't what you want to see.
In the dark
It is easy to pretend
That the truth
Is what it ought to be.

Softly, deftly
Music shall caress you...
Hear it, feel it
Secretly possess you...

Open up your mind
Let your fantasies unwind
In this darkness which
You know you cannot fight - 
The darkness of 
The music of the night...

Close your eyes
Start a journey through a
Strange new world!
Leave all thoughts
Of the world 
You knew before!

Close your eyes
And let music set you free...
Only then 
Can you belong to me...

Floating, falling
Sweet intoxication!
Touch me, trust me
Savour each sensation...

Let the dream
Begin
Let your darker side
Give in
To the power of
The music that I write - 
The power of
The music of the night...

You alone
Can make my song take flight -
Help me make
The music of the night...

Come we must return - 
Those two fools
Who run my theatre
Will be missing you...
