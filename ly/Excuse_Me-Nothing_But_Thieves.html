		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  His space crowds out your space, your space
Your space crowds out hers
Coffee breath and headphone hiss
But no one says a word
Eyes upon the paper headline
Refuge in your phone
Bumping shoulders, cough, and sniff
But no one says hello

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here

My heart beats like yours does, hers does
My heart keeps good time
And every day, I mind the gap between you and me
Here comes someone else to share the air we breathe

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Reach out for anyone
And they will tell you, "Get out of here"

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
I'm asking everyone
You gotta help me get outta here
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Excuse me while I run
I really got to get out (I really got to get out of here)

Meanwhile under the gun
Hey everyone, our work here is done
A way out, you gonna come?
Hey everyone, our work here is done

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Excuse me while I run
I really gotta get out of here
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Reach out for anyone
And they will tell you, "Get out of here"

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
I'm asking everyone
You gotta help me get outta here
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Excuse me while run
I really got to get out of here
