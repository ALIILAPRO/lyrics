		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the darkness I will shine
Cast no shadows nor define
I walk on water float on air
There's no other to compare

I have this fascination
No cause for deviation
It's called levitation
Levitation
Levitation

There's no cause to start and scream
Nor rub your eyes this is no dream
Although I sit upon this chair
I rise and float up in the air

I have this fascination
No cause for deviation
It's called levitation
Levitation
Levitation

Magnetic force, repel - attract
Once it starts there's no turning back
I offer you this chance to learn
Take it now there's no return

I have this fascination
No cause for deviation
It's called levitation
Levitation
Levitation

Magnetic force, repel attract
Once it starts there's no turning back
I offer you this chance to learn
Take it now there's no return

I have this fascination
No cause for deviation
It's called levitation
Levitation
Levitation
