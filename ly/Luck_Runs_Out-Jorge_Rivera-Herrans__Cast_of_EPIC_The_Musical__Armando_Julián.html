		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't tell me you're about to
Do what I think you'll do

You've heard the legends of the
Island in the sky, this proves they're true
We're in the home of the wind god

We don't know for sure

How many floating islands have
You seen before?
This is the home of the wind god

And what's your plan?

I'm gonna climb to the top and
Ask 'em for a hand

You could be caught off guard
And lose your life
Or piss off this god and
And infuse us with strife
Don't forget how dangerous the gods are

Have faith, friend, we've come this far

Yes, but how much longer 'til
Your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

I still believe in goodness
I still believe that we can be kind
Lead with the heart, and see what starts

And what will we do when it tears us apart?

Where is this coming from, my friend?

I just don't wanna see another life end
You're like the brother I
Could never do without

And suddenly you doubt that I
Could figure this out?

Captain, how much longer 'til
Your luck runs out?
How much longer 'til the show goes south?
How much longer 'til we all fall down?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

How much longer 'til the snake breaks free?
How much longer 'til your great days cease?
How much longer 'til your
Strength takes leave?
You rely on wit, and people die on it, whoa

Thank you for the concern
But brother I can assure you
Our journey is almost done
I understand that we're tired
I understand that we're fazed
But don't forget how much we've already faced
I took six hundred men to war
And not one of them died there
In case you needed a reminder
If you'd like to speak more
Let me pull you aside then
I need to talk to you in private

I can't have you planting seeds of doubt
I can't have you disagree each route
I need you to always be devout
And comply with this
Or we'll all die in this
Okay?

Okay

Thank you
