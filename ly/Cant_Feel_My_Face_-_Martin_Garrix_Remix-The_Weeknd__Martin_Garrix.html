		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young
This I know, yeah, this I know

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh, woo

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh

And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love
This I know (this I know, yeah), girl, I know

She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh, woo (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I can't feel my face when I'm with you
But I love it, but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face)
But I love it (but I love it), but I love it, oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it (but I love it, yeah), but I love it (but I love it, yeah), oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it (but I love it), but I love it (girl, I love it), oh

Ooh, ooh
She told me, don't worry about it
She told me, don't worry no more
We both know we can't go without it (can't go)
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh

Woo
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face, girl)
But I love it (but I love it, yeah), but I love it (oh, I love it, yeah), oh
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (said, I can't feel my face, girl)
But I love it (but I love it), but, I love it (girl, I love it), oh

(Hey) I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you)
But I love it (know I love it, girl), but I love it (don't you think I, yeah)
I can't feel my face when I'm with you (I can't feel my face when I'm with you) 
(I can't feel my face, girl)
But I love it (when I'm with you, baby), but I love it (said when I'm with you, baby)
I can't feel my fa-
Hey
