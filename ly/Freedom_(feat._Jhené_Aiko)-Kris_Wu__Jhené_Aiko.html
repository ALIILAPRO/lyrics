		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You could have been anywhere in the world 
but your here with me
She gonna lie to you about her whereabouts 
but you'll be with me, oh oh oh

I really want freedom
So you don't really need us
I really can't keep up
I keep falling out of luck (keep up)
Eyes got me peaking (peaking)
And the headache got me going

I had her pillow talking 
and she's told me she just want a little freedom (freedom)
She gonna lie to you about her whereabouts
just for some freedom, yeah
She wanna hang with her friends on the weekend
She just want that freedom (freedom)
Aye, aye, and I'mma give it to her, yeah
And I'mma give it to her, yeah
And I'mma give it to her, yeah

And imma give it to you all day
You ain't gotta call me
I fuck with you the long way (yeah)
You say you want some freedom
You ain't got a leash on, you ain't coming home (oh well)
But where you wanna go
You already know
We can blow a creeper on the low (yeah yeah)
I be on my throne
Tryna take it slow (aye)
Guess you can control, let's play (aye, skrt)
'Cause you know I got the dough
Drip from head to toe
You ain't got to tell no one (no)
I won't say a thing
I just wait and see if you into me
No fronting (yeah)
Give it to me all night
I love the way that you ride
You know what I want lets go baby (all night)
You gonna sip this dark wine
Make you want it more
We can get insomnia baby

You could have been anywhere in the world 
but your here with me
She gonna lie to you about her whereabouts 
but you'll be with me, oh oh oh

I really want freedom
So you don't really need us
I really can't keep up
I keep falling out of luck (keep up)
Eyes got me peaking (peaking)
And the headache got me going

I had her pillow talking 
and she's told me she just want a little freedom (freedom)
She gonna lie to you about her whereabouts
just for some freedom, yeah
She wanna hang with her friends on the weekend
She just want that freedom (freedom)
Aye, aye, and I'mma give it to her, yeah
And I'mma give it to her, yeah
And I'mma give it to her, yeah

Never had a car back (yeah)
I've been waiting till you crawl back (waiting)
And I can handle all that (all that)
Heart on my sleeve but it's all black (all black)
Yeah, aye, you can tell me all your secrets
You can let your feelings flow
When you feeling really low
And you put it on a show (skrt)
I can be your Romeo (skrt)
Know you rollin' with a pro
I can put it on you every time, yeah, yeah, yeah
You know the [?] don't quit (you know)
You can play it raw, no script (you can play)
Taking off we go don't quit (take off)
We can do it all i'm lit (yeah yeah yeah)
Give it to me right now
Give it to her all day (yeah)
Reminisce when you come stay (Reminisce)
I got your back like all state (I got your back)
Yeah, we'll take you back to the old ways

You know I got the dough
Drip from head to toe
You ain't got to tell no one
I won't say a thing
I just wait and see if you into me
No fronting
Give it to me all night
I just need my space
No specific reason
Just get out my face
You don't want me leaving
I need freedom, freedom, freedom
