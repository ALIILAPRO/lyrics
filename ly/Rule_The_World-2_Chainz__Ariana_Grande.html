		<p>
		  Yeah
Uh-huh
(Hitmaka)
2 Chainz

Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it (yeah)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it (used to it)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
I realized we could rule the world
I realized we could rule the world (oh yeah, oh yeah)

Yeah
Fell in love with a real one, this a dedication (wow)
Had 'em patiently waitin' for a revelation
Even when I ain't around, ain't no separation
Your skin's smooth, your eyes brown and you're far from basic
Then we go to different places with no suitcases (wow)
But when we come back, we got suitcases (yeah)
Right now I use love for a medication (love)
Back in the day I'd shoot Cupid with no hesitation (bow, bow)
I got more than 40 acres for my reparations
Pussy on my navigation, that's my destination (tell 'em)
Please don't never tell on me, baby (never tell)
That mean don't call 12 on me, baby (don't call 12)
As long as the meal prepared for me, baby (it's prepared)
The mills I prepare, I share with you, baby (share)
Of course they gon' like this shit, look at it (look)
Everybody ain't happy, then look at me

Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it (used to it)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it (yeah)
Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it (wow)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it (wow, tell 'em, baby)
I realized we could rule the world
I realized we could rule the world (oh yeah, oh yeah)

Why don't we ride four deep
Rode so far, we on E
She on E, she on me (yeah, yeah)
Let's try that way, okay
Shawty came in, walkin' like a model
Shaped like a bottle
She know if she mess with me, it's gon' be trouble
I'ma bust that bubble
I'ma always love her, mess up all the covers (yeah, yeah)
Watch me break it down like a foldin' chair
See me in the Chain Reactions, I got 40 pair
Sorry I ain't answer the phone, I was slappin' ass
Last night ain't answer, I was pullin' hair
Y'all know me, so lowkey
All this ice on, I got cold feet
My shawty bad, she a trophy
She like to lay on me and call me cozy (yeah)

Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it (pray for me)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it (alright)
Top down on the Dawn like I'm used to it (skrrt)
Prayin' you make it home, I got used to it (skrrt)
Prayin' you make it home like I'm used to it
I realized we could rule the world
I realized we could rule the world (oh yeah, oh yeah)

Skrrt (yeah)
Yeah
I'ma trap it out one way or another (yee)
Yeah (oh)
One thing about love, they say it's blind
No matter where you're from though
You gon' bump into it one day
