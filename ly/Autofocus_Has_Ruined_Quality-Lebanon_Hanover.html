		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything is out of focus
Autofocus has brought a new disease
How can I focus full of
Distraction and insecurity?
We run through the grass
If I fall, would you take me or just leave?

Throw your potential throw it all in the bin
How can you work in
A world full of inactivity?
We lie beneath an oak, and
When I close my eyes, I still see a screen
Everything is out of focus
Autofocus has ruined quality
We run through the rain
And this mess is like the blurry life of me
