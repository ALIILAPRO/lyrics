		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I hear a voice in trouble,
From this rubble,
So distressed.
It echoes through my head,
Tell me, when will this story end?

Guide me, blindly,
With your friendly lies.
So kindly,
I'll see through your eyes.
Remind me,
Where do you reside?
Call out your ruined lullaby.

Take me behind the scenes.
And mask these memories,
I'll find the path that's lined with red,
Augment reality.
And mind your head,
No I won't fret,
Just hit reset.
This can't be over yet.

No one cared as much she,
For someone as blind as me,
She was my only friend,
But now she's history.
Total eclipse of my vision,
Ruined without resistance.
Now she's lost in the distance.

Guide me, blindly,
With your friendly lies.
So kindly,
I'll see through your eyes.
Remind me,
Where do you reside?
Call out your ruined lullaby.

My ruined lullaby.
Oh, ruined.

"Hush little baby, Don't say a word,"
Was the last song he had ever heard.
Poor mother woke up to a long lost son,
The monster's task was already done.

"Hush little baby, Don't say a word,"
Was the last song he had ever heard.
Poor mother woke up to a long lost son,
The monster's task was already done.

Guide me, blindly,
With your friendly lies.
So kindly,
I'll see through your eyes.
Remind me,
Where do you reside?
Call out your ruined lullaby.

My ruined lullaby.
Oh, ruined.
