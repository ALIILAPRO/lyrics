		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come a little closer 'cause you looking thirsty
I'ma make it better, sip it like a Slurpee

Snow cone chilly
Get it free like Willy
In the jeans like Billie
You be poppin' like a wheelie

Even in the sun, you know I keep it icy
You could take a lick but it's too cold to bite me

Brr, brr, frozen
You're the one been chosen
Play the part like Moses
Keep it fresh like roses (oh)

Look so good yeah, look so sweet (hey)
Lookin' good enough to eat

Coldest with the kiss, so he call me ice cream
Catch me in the fridge, right where the ice be

Look so good yeah, look so sweet (hey)
Baby, you deserve a treat

Diamonds on my wrist, so he call me ice cream
You could double dip 'cause I know you like me

Ice cream, chillin', chillin'
Ice cream, chillin'
Ice cream, chillin', chillin'
Ice cream, chillin'

I know that my heart can be so cold
But I'm sweet for you, come put me in a cone

You're the only touch, yeah, that get me meltin'
He's my favorite flavor, always gonna pick him

You're the cherry piece, just stay on top of me, so
I can't see nobody else for me, no

Get it, flip it, scoop it
Do it like that, ah yeah, ah yeah
Like it, love it, lick it
Do it like la la la, oh yeah

Look so good, yeah, look so sweet (hey)
Lookin' good enough to eat

Coldest with the kiss, so he call me ice cream
Catch me in the fridge, right where the ice be

Look so good, yeah, look so sweet (hey)
Baby, you deserve a treat

Diamonds on my wrist, so he call me ice cream
You could double dip 'cause I know you like me

Ice cream, chillin', chillin'
Ice cream, chillin'
Ice cream, chillin', chillin'
Ice cream, chillin'
Ice cream, chillin', chillin'
Ice cream, chillin'
Ice cream, chillin', chillin'
Ice cream

Chillin' like a villain, yeah, ra ra ra
미친 미친듯한 속도 in my La Ferra'
너무 빨러 너는 삐끗 
원한다면 그냥 지름
Millis, billis 매일 벌음 
한여름 손목에 얼음

Keep it movin' like my lease up
Think you fly, boy, where your visa?
Mona Lisa kinda Lisa
Needs an ice cream man that treats her

Keep it movin' like my lease up
Think you fly, boy, where your visa?
Mona Lisa kinda Lisa
Needs an ice cream man that treats her (hey)

Na na na na na
Na na na na na (hey)
Ice on my wrist, yeah, I like it like this
Get the bag with the cream
If you know what I mean

Ice cream, ice cream
Ice cream, chillin'

Na na na na na
Na na na na na (hey)
Ice on my wrist, yeah, I like it like this
And I'm nice with the cream
If you know what I mean

Ice cream, ice cream
Ice cream
