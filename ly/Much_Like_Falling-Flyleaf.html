		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I said good morning
I was lying
I was truly thinking of
How I might quit waking up

He pointed out how selfish
It would be to kill myself
So I keep waking up

It feels so much like falling
Dying while I wait to die
The fear of something or nothing
Lonely empty lie

I don't want to be a liar
I don't want to be selfish anymore
I want so much to change, learning your love every day
There's still so much to know

You grip my wrists
I let go

It feels so much like falling
Separated from the fear
Aware of a destination far away from here

It feels so much like falling
Separated from the fear
Aware of a destination far away from here
Far away from here
