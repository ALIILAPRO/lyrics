		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I'm invisible
Barely a ghost
Cause when I walk they look right through me
And when I talk no one can hear me
If I disappeared today
I bet no one would know
I'm sorry if that makes you worry
I know loving me is such a burden
There's sirens going on and on and on and on and on inside my head
I think there's something wrong here
But I'm just too afraid to leave my bed
There's rumors going on and on and on and on
Since you left me on read
Something strange is going on here
I'm starting now to think I might be dead
Oh
