		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We dared to ask for more 
But that was long before the nights began to burn 
You would have thought we'd learned 
You can't make promises all based upon tomorrow 
Happiness, security are words we only borrowed 
For is this the answer to our prayers, is this was God has sent? 
Please understand this isn't what we meant 

The future couldn't last, we nailed it to the past 
With every word a trap that no one can take 
Back from all the architects who find their towers leaning 
And every prayer we pray at night has somehow lost its meaning 
For is this the answer to our prayers, is this was God has sent? 
Please understand this isn't what we meant 

A long time ago when the world was pretty 
Standing right here in a different city 
They're not coming back any more 
They're not coming back any... 
Is this the answer to our prayers, is this was God has sent? 
Please understand this isn't what we meant
