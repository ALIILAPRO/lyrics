		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fly, fly, fly
It's Gucci (it's Gucci)
Huh? Fly (woo)

I drink 'til I'm drunk (yeah), smoke 'til I'm high (yeah)
Castle on the hill (well damn), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love the luxury (yeah)
That's why they all fuck with me (woo)
Out here with the moves (yeesh) like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly

Haan, haan, haan
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me (woo)
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me
Ooh, think it's vegetables
Ooh, think it's edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond Number 9 now
Section full of foreign dimes
Bitch is starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Gucci Barry White, I'm singin' to your ho (well damn)
A one man show, a human bank roll (whoa)
She lost in the sauce 'cause Gucci got the glow (huh)

I drink 'til I'm drunk (burr), smoke 'til I'm high (it's Gucci)
Castle on the hill (heh), wake up in the sky (you won't)
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)
The ladies love the luxury, that's why they all fuck with me
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly)
I know I'm super fly (I know), I know I'm super fly (I know)

Now watch me fly, fly
Now watch me fly, fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly (Kodak, Kodak)

I'm so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealin' bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I been smokin' this Cherry Pie so much
But this my life
I'm on Adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tec when I piss
Like it's basketball, I drop 50-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil' Kodak, take a pic
I came home and dropped a hit
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled
Cutlass sittin' high, I feel like I can fly
So fresh to death it's crazy, feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings, they make me wanna sing (glee)

I drink 'til I'm drunk ('til I'm drunk)
Smoke 'til I'm high ('til I'm high)
Castle on the hill (ayy), wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I ain't fly, baby)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)
The ladies love luxury, that's why they all fuck with me (ayy)
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth (yo, yo)
You can't tell me I ain't fly (you can't tell me I don't fly, baby)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)
I know I'm super fly (I know it)

Now, now watch me fly, fly
Now watch me fly, fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly
