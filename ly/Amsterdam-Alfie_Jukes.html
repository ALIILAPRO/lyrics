		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He packed his bags only yesterday
With delusions of a lover only half his age
He was broke and burning money like he owned the place
Where has he gone?
And there's a hole in every letter of his alibi
While he poses as a victim with glass of wine
Getting cosy with somebody on the other side of the pond

Who do you love?
'Cause you're taking the mick now
Who do you trust at the end of the day?

Yeah you can drag your name
Through a gutter of shame
But the kids really want you back
You're throwing it all away
For a minute to play
On a game that you can't win back
Quick thrills and all your broken toys
You can just come home you know you've got a choice
'Cause yeah you can drag your name
Through a gutter of shame
But Amsterdam won't fix that

A shopping trolley full of cheap beer
And he's guilty but he's living like he's cavalier
He's got his ears pierced
Because she likes it
Yeh she wrote it in her bio online

Who do you love?
'Cause you're taking the mick now
Who do you trust at the end of the day?

Yeah you can drag your name
Through a gutter of shame
But the kids really want you back
You're throwing it all away
For a minute to play
On a game that you can't win back
Quick thrills and all your broken toys
You can just come home you know you've got a choice
Cause yeah you can drag your name
Through a gutter of shame
But Amsterdam won't fix that

Yeah you can drag your name
Through a gutter of shame
But the kids really want you back
You're throwing it all away
For a minute to play
On a game that you can't win back
Quick thrills and all your broken toys
You can just come home you know you've got a choice
Cause yeah you can drag your name
Through a gutter of shame
But Amsterdam won't fix that
