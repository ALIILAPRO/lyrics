		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?
Hollowed out and feeling uninspired
The question I keep asking you is what
Will it take to ease your worried mind
You worried mind

Now you're letting your confusion take control
And leading it down a dark and lonely road
Even that won't last forever
Just look around and see you're not alone
You're not alone

If you can't find love but you're still not giving up (Can I get a witness?)
If you died at night but you still wanna live it up (Can I get a witness?)
And if the weight of the world is on you now
But you know you can turn it all around again
Can I get a witness?
Yeah
Can I get a witness?
Yeah

Does it feel like you're just wasting time
Here without a reason or a rhyme
The answer you've been looking for is
There any right before your weary eyes
Your weary eyes

If you can't find love but you're still not giving up (Can I get a witness?))
If you died at night but you still wanna live it up (Can I get a witness?)
And if the weight of the world is on you now
But you know you can turn it all around again
Can I get a witness?
Yeah
Can I get a witness?
Yeah

And if the weight of the world is on you now
But you know you can turn it all around again

Are you sick and tired of being sick and tired?

If you can't find love but you're still not giving up (Can I get a witness?))
If you died at night but you still wanna live it up (Can I get a witness?)
And if the weight of the world is on you now
But you know you can turn it all around again yeah
Oh
Can I get a witness?
Yeah
Can I get a witness?
Yeah

And if the weight of the world is on you now
But you know you can turn it all around again yeah yeah yea-yeah
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
Can I get a witness?
