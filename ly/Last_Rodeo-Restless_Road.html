		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I bet you thought I'd hang it up
When you hung me out to dry
You hit me with the goodbye faster
Than a eight-second ride
I thought you were the best damn thing that I'd ever had
I thought that I'd give up on love but

This ain't my last rodeo
I might be bruised but I ain't broke
Back in the saddle, back on the road
This ain't the first time or the last time
That I'll ride, ride, ride
Off to the next, straight out the gate
You think I'm down, but just you wait
I'll dust off this heart, put on a show
This ain't my last rodeo

I'm already ready for a new sunset to run into
'Cause all you are is another scar
From the hell you put me through
You ain't gonna catch me crying over a whiskey glass
And I hate to break it to ya

But this ain't my last rodeo
I might be bruised but I ain't broke
Back in the saddle, back on the road
This ain't the first time or the last time
That I'll ride, ride, ride
Off to the next, straight out the gate
You think I'm down, but just you wait
I'll dust off this heart, put on a show
This ain't my last rodeo
This ain't my last rodeo
This ain't my last rodeo

This ain't my last rodeo
I might be bruised but I ain't broke
Back in the saddle, back on the road
This ain't the first time or the last time
That I'll ride, ride, ride
Off to the next, straight out the gate
You think I'm down, but just you wait
I'll dust off this heart, put on a show
This ain't my last rodeo
This ain't my last rodeo
This ain't my last rodeo
