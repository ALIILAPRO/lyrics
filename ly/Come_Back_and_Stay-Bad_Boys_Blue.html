		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk in the rain
Trying to wash away the pain
You went away
I made you cry so many days

(Where do broken hearts go to
How can broken hearts
Find their way back home
When nobody cares about you
And you’re feeling blue)

Come back and stay
Don’t keep me waiting baby
Come back and stay
Don’t say goodbye
Don’t let my love die

Come back and stay and try again
Don’t walk away from me
I’m still your man
Where are you now
Where did you go

Come back and stay
Don’t keep me waiting
I miss you so

Walk in the rain
Thinking about the game I played
I am to blame
I lost my loving yesterday

(Where do broken hearts go to
How can broken hearts
Find their way back home
When nobody cares about you
And you’re feeling blue)

Come back and stay
Don’t keep me waiting baby
Come back and stay
Don’t say goodbye
Don’t let my love die

Come back and stay and try again
Don’t walk away from me
I’m still your man
Where are you now
Where did you go

(Since I’ve been gone
I’ve missed you
I miss your touch
Oh baby)

Come back and stay
Don’t keep me waiting baby
Come back and stay
Don’t say goodbye
Don’t let my love die

Come back and stay and try again
Don’t walk away from me
I’m still your man
Where are you now
Where did you go

Where are you now
