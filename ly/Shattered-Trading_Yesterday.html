		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding 
Fall into your sunlight 
The future's open wide beyond believing 
To know why hope dies 
Losing what was found, a world so hollow 
Suspended in a compromise 
The silence of this sound is soon to follow 
Somehow sundown 

And finding answers 
Is forgetting all of the questions we call home 
Passing the graves of the unknown 

As reason clouds my eyes, with splendor fading 
Illusions of the sunlight 
And the reflection of a lie will keep me waiting 
Love gone for so long 

This day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know 
Knowing that faith is all I hold 

And Ive lost who I am 
And I can't understand 
Why my heart is so broken 
Rejecting your love 
Without love gone wrong 
Life 
Less words 
Carry on 

But i know 
All i know 
Is that the ends beginning 

Who I am from the start 
Take me home to my heart 
Let me go 
And I will run 
I will not be silenced 

All this time spent in vain 
Wasted years 
Wasted gain 
All is lost 
Hope remains 
And this war's not over 

Theres a light 
Theres the sun 
Taking all the shattered ones 
To the place we belong 
And his love will conquer 

And Ive lost who I am 
And I can't understand 
Why my heart is so broken 
Rejecting your love 
Without love gone wrong 
Life 
Less words 
Carry on 

But i know 
All i know 
Is that the ends beginning 

Who I am from the start 
Take me home to my heart 
Let me go 
And I will run 
I will not be silenced 

All this time spent in vain 
Wasted years 
Wasted gain 
All is lost 
Hope remains 
And this war's not over 

Theres a light 
Theres the sun 
Taking all the shattered ones 
To the place we belong 
And his love will conquer all 
Yes his love will conquer all 

Yesterday I died, tommorrows bleeding 
Fall into your sunlight
