		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How does Hamilton, an arrogant immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he's despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens
The room where it happens
You've kept me from the room where it happens
For the last time

Dear Alexander
I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me "amoral"
A "dangerous disgrace"
If you've got something to say, name a time and place, face-to-face

I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A dot Burr
Mr. Vice President
I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Here's an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

Sweet Jesus

Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryna do my best for our republic, I don't wanna fight
But I won't apologize for doing what's right

I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A dot Ham

Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or prepare to bleed, good man

Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself, it's what you do
I can't apologize because it's true

Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken, dawn
Guns drawn

You're on
I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A dot Ham
A dot Burr
