		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They all the same
They smoking pain
And poping champagne
And other things related
Mama I made it
And I’m not ashamed
Cause I’m staying true tho I’m in the game yeah
They feel no gain
That’s in your brain
And I maintain
To feel it my veins yeah
I wanna face it
In all different places
Cause time moving fast since I’m in the matrix
Alright, hello, named tricky, but the name is Nicki
Hey, hello, motherfucker's as white as marshmallow
You might think I’m a sweet, motherfucker
Come closer, you gon' bleed
No, I ain’t no gangsta, certainly not wanksta
Only killing beats, but I‘ll show you how the streets are
We are, simple dudes from the streets, bruuh
Facts, nothing but facts, man
Now I’m rocking cities
Hoes be showing titties
Tricky getting money
Bet you want me all, don’t wanna leave me
Where y’all been when I needed you
Huh
You was quiet when I greeted you
Huh
They all the same
They smoking pain
And poping champagne
And other things related
Mama I made it
And I’m not ashamed
Cause I’m staying true tho I’m in the game yeah
They feel no gain
That’s in your brain
And I maintain
To feel it my veins yeah
I wanna face it
In all different places
Cause time moving fast since I’m in the matrix
Tricky is a stuck up
You can talk ya talks
Money never change me
But the ladies call me boss
But the ladies
Loving all these ladies, I’m a simple man, if I see a cutie lady imma hit it all day
Now, just to be honest
I have never been a fuck boy, always been a block boy
Judging me by my insta' pics, you ain’t smart boy
Really wanna know me meet in a real life, toy
Got it, get it
Get it, got it?
Most of these motherfuckers really can’t stop me
Got it, get it
Get it, got it?
Hating just to hate cuz, you'll never block me
They all the same
They smoking pain
And poping champagne
And other things related
Mama I made it
And I’m not ashamed
Cause I’m staying true tho I’m in the game yeah
They feel no gain
That’s in your brain
And I maintain
To feel it my veins yeah
I wanna face it
In all different places
Cause time moving fast since I’m in the matrix
