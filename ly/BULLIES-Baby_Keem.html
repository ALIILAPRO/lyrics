		  Baby on my hit list, I'm excited
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (to me), I don't like it
Baby on my hit list, I'm excited
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (to me), I don't like it
Let's go

Tell baby I'm coming home
Bless me, I've been on my own
You can love me and still do me wrong
I've been hurt but I still remain strong
How many times I show face and shit go south on me?
I had a kickstand last year, but she ain't really love me
Y'all better leave me alone
If I have to pull up, I'll be

Baby on my hit list, I'm excited (hey)
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake (to me) deep, I don't like it
Baby on my hit list, I'm excited
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (to me), I don't like it
(Hey) Let's go

I hurt your feelings
You know these facts, your love is tall
Worth more than millions
I save your heart, I play the part
I miss your kisses, okay (hm)
Y'all better leave me alone
No one need me
I pop like genie
You don't wanna see me
Duckin' enemies
Ex one look like RiRi
I'm not a weakling

Baby on my hit list, I'm excited (Hey)
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (To me), I don't like it
Baby on my hit list, I'm excited
God got me to protect, it's a Friday
Don't talk fake deep, I don't like it
Don't talk fake deep (To me), I don't like it

She bully me
Em yllub ehs
She bully me
Em yllub ehs
She bully me
Em yllub ehs
She bully me
Em yllub ehs
(Hey)
