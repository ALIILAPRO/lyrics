		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm naked
I'm numb
I'm stupid
I'm staying
And if Cupid's got a gun, then he's shootin

Lights black, heads bang
You're my drug
We live it
You're drunk, you need it
Real love, I'll give it

I could've followed your heart down
Wandering around like a ghost now
Same faces, lost in the same town
I know you don't like what I say now
Something tells me you think of me often
Wouldn't think much if you lost him
Might of fucked up and just offed him
Might of fucked up and just offed him
I feel the pain of the past
I feel the same if I can
I feel the love till the end
I miss my face to your hands
I see it all where I am

You're a stranger in the dark
My love fell apart
I wait in the dark
Until it all starts

You're a stranger in the dark
My love fell apart
I wait in the dark
Until it all starts

Lights black, heads bang
You're my drug
We live it
You're drunk, you need it
Real love, I'll give it

bound to linger on
We drink the fatal drop
Then love until we bleed
Then fall apart in parts

You wasted your times
On my heart
You've burned
And if bridges gotta fall, then you'll fall, too

Doors slam
Lights black
You're gone
Come back
Stay gone
Stay clean
I need you to need me

bound to linger on
We drink the fatal drop
Then love until we bleed
Then fall apart in parts

Lights black, heads bang
You're my drug
We live it
You're drunk, you need it
Real love, I'll give it
