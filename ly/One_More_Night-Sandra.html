		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more night
One more night with you
Close your eyes I'll give you my love
One more night
One more night with you
Please hold me once again
Cause I love you
Here I stand
And I can't even cry
My heart is breakin up inside
You say goodbye
Found somebody new
Wherever you go
I'll be with you
One more night
One more night with you
Hear me now I can't let you go
One more night
I'll open my heart to you
Please hold me once again
Cause I love you
Before you leave
Just take me in your arms
And let me feel you once again
Can't help myself
I still depend on you
Whatever you do
I'll be with you
One more night
One more night with you
Close your eyes I'll give you my love
One more night
One more night with you
You know how long it gonna last
It's up to you
I want to hold you once again
Cause I love you
