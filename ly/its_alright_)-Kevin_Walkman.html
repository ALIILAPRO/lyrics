		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And it's alright
That's the way I like it
Getting crucified
Every time you cross my mind
Maybe that's not kind
You won't like my face
I'll hit you up online 'cause
Babe I've changed
I think it's for the better
We can go our ways
Doesn't mean you're off my mind
Go and live your life
Let me write a song about you
Once or twice like
Ya da da da da da da da da da da
Ya da da da da da da da da da da dow
Ya da dow
Self loathing, thrift clothing
There's not much more to me right now
And you don't know how, and
Ripped t-shirts, in my bed skirt
I use all those nights as framework
You weren't perfect but a hell of a ride
You can call but
Boy no promises
'Cause I don't gotta pick you up anymore
And it's alright
That's the way I like it
Getting crucified
Every time you cross my mind
Maybe that's not kind
You won't like my face
I'll hit you up online 'cause
Babe I've changed
I think it's for the better
We can go our ways
Doesn't mean you're off my mind
Go and live your life
Let me write a song about you
Once or twice like
Ya da da da da da da da da da da
Ya da da da da da da da da da da dow
Ya da dow
And now every time I bring you up my friends shoot it down
What a hell of a reminder of our post-loving sound
What a time to be alive
I hate it when you shut down
And frankly I still love the tracks that we used to sing
I thought you'd fuck it up you didn't ruin a thing
What a time to be alive
I swore that it was our sound
You can call but
Boy no promises
'Cause I don't gotta pick you up anymore
And it's alright
That's the way I like it
Getting crucified
Every time you cross my mind
Maybe that's not kind
You won't like my face
I'll hit you up online 'cause
Babe I've changed
I think it's for the better
We can go our ways
Doesn't mean you're off my mind
Go and live your life
Let me write a song about you
Once or twice like
Ya da da da da da da da da da da
Ya da da da da da da da da da da dow
Let me write a song about you
Once or twice like
