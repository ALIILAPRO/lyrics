		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You make me not feel like a man
Keep throwing stones for while you can
I know myself and who I am
That story's end is calloused hands

There not a soul ever here
I've only grown from the tears

I'm the dead man in this war
But, baby, I've been here before
There's beauty hidden in the gore
Yeah, I'm the dead man in this war

Do you remember September?
Do you remember September?

You threw me back into the fire
I screamed while your smile was getting wider, ohh-oh
Demons and angels in my choir, mmm
Singing about what I desire

There not a soul ever here, ohh-oh
I've only grown from the tears, ooh-ohh-ohh

I'm the dead man in this war
But, baby, I've been here before
There's beauty hidden in the gore
Yeah, I'm the dead man in this war, ooh-ooh

Do you remember September?
Do you remember September?

Wade on, wade on
Give me back my old salvation
Wade on, wade on
Give me back my old salvation
Wade on, wade on
Give me back my old salvation
Wade on, wade on
Yeah

I'm the dead man in this war
But, baby, I've been here before (I've been here before)
There's beauty hidden in the gore (yeah)
Yeah, I'm the dead man in this war

(Hidden in the gore, yea-yeah)

There's beauty hidden in the gore
I'm the dead man in this war
