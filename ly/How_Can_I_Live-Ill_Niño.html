		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am so alike you
In so many ways
I know I'm just a copy
That carries on the stain

(But) we make the same mistakes
('Cause) we are one in the same
(But) we leave behind the stain
I cannot separate

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?

I am your mirror image
I'm all you left behind
You made me what I am
Then who the hell am I?

(But) we make the same mistakes
('Cause) we are one in the same
(But) we leave behind the stain
I cannot separate

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?

Why? Yo no entiendo por qué
I know that our lives are the same
Y mi vida
Just a guessing game, a dirty stain that I cannot play
But I follow your steps
In the same way that you just 
Walked away and blocked the way through
I, will, not, live

Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you
Do you think of me?
Do you dream of me?
I always dream about you

All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
All that lies in me
All that dies in me
How can I live without you?
