		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh sister, nobody knows
What the future will bring
Just that we'll have, to move on
Without, our queen and king
It's surreal that you're gone
We still want you, back here
Thoughts spiraling down
In a negative feedback loop
A crash, you're pushed back
Your world turns pitch black
That first and last crash
Your mind went in a flash
Oh sister, nobody knows
What our future will bring
It's useless
This can't stay
Or did you want us to
I guess we should
Let's go running
Come back here
Let's go running
Come right here, NOW
Fate can make
It can break us
Cause good deeds and mistakes, sister
It destroys and creates
Our triumphs and heartaches
Fate can make
It can break us bad
Cause good deeds and mistakes
Right dad
And it destroys and creates
But for now
It keeps me locked in a heartache!
Go running
Come back here
Keep me locked in a heartache
Go running
Come right here
It keeps me locked in a heartache
