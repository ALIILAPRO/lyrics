		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A creature made of sunshine
Her eyes were like the sky
Rabbit howls like something old
As we twitch to her lullaby
The scalpel shines in gods sunshine
Street lights whisper pain
Down here near the poison stream 
You're god has gone insane

She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands into the sun she stares
She feels it die, I heard her cry

She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands into the sun she stares
She feels it die, I heard her cry

Like the scream of the butterfly

Sunshine a house in flames
She likes it where she gets it
But it's never felt the same
Surgery in the house of dissection
When your candle burns out I will resurrect you
She runs through fields of daisies
Yeah it's just a shame
That they eat their own babies
Who cares cause the air is free
When you get there will you kiss the dead for me?

There's blood on the moon
And the summer is cold
There's love in the room
But baby that's gettin' old
There's blood on my face 
Sittin' on a dead shore
A highway of emptiness
And I'm feeling old
There's blood on the moon
As we plan our escape
The goddess in bloom
Handcuffed and raped
There's blood in the bath tub
Murder the king
There's blood on the moon
There's blood on just about everything

Sunshine a house in flames
She likes it where she gets it
But it's never felt the same
Surgery in the house of dissection
When your candle burns out I will resurrect you
She runs through fields of daisies
Yeah it's just a shame
That they eat their own babies
Who cares cause the air is free
When you get there will you kiss the dead for me?

Something cold is forced inside her
A tear spills down her cheek
Stillborn songs of a dead dreamer
Hymns of the needle freak
With sunlight in her hair 
She smiles like she don't care
Her dreams are liquid blue
I cut myself again and again
To remind myself of you

She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands into the sun she stares
She feels it die, I heard her cry 

Like the scream of the butterfly

I met an angel with a sawed-off shotgun
Wanted by the FBI
We dropped some acid, killed our parents
Then we hit the road

Like the scream of the butterfly 
Like the scream of the butterfly
