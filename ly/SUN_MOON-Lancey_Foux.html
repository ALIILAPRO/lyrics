		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah, sun behind me (woo), moon in front (ah)
Ah, sun behind me (woo), moon in front (ah)
Ah, sun behind me (woo), moon in front (ah)
Ah, sun behind me (chyeah), moon in front (come on)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Ha, chyeah, uh, swerve, chyeah

Pure dope, I don't do coke
Pure smoke, gun in the coat
Pure weed, none in a roach
Pure molly, fresh off the boat
Pink or green, I'ma do both
Two baddies, I'ma do both (chyeah)
Out my mind, givin' them motion (ha)
Touch the sky, givin' them motion
Shirt and tie, show no emotion
Check the swag (uh), check the swag (uh)
Check my moves
I clocked the games, here I am still actin' stupid (uh)
Must not clocked how I hopped out the car like Vladimir Putin (woah)
I'm in the rolls with more firearms than a federal unit (woah)
I'm about to trademark the lil' leather pants, I'm on Kim Un (ha)
Security running beside of the car, I'm Kim Un
Rude boy, one in the window (who the fuck the is you?)
From the driver side let my ting go, what the fuck you doin'? (C'mon)
Think I hit bro (somebody check me)
Tryna get sassy in traffic, the .45 kept it cute (c'mon)
I'm on that Colonel Gaddafi got baddies entering the crew (truck, c'mon)
I might spit one lyric, come like I made it up
Someone died, they're pointing fingers, somebody saying it's us (ha)
Criminal vibes, double o-seven, and I should've came in a tux (hey)
I should've came right in her eye so she can't see I'm the one
I thought it was me, myself, and I, but I had my gun
You know I keep a new disguise like I'm on the run (shine)
I know this shit gon' be iconic when it's said and done (chyeah)

Ah, sun behind me, moon in front (come on)
Ah, sun behind me, moon in front (come on)
Ah, sun behind me, moon in front (come on)
Ah, sun behind me, moon in front (come on)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
Sun behind me, moon in front (ah)
