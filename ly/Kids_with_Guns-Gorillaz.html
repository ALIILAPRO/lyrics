		<p>
		  Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Taking over
But it won't be long
They're mesmerized
Skeletons
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

Drinking out (push it real, push it)
Pacifier (push it real, push it) 
Vitamin souls (push it real, push it) 
The street desire (push it real, push it) 
Didn't mean to (push it real, push it) 
But it won't be long (push it real, push it) 
Kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Drinking out
Pacifier
Sinking soul
There you are
Doesn't make side to
But it won't be long
'Cause kids with guns
Kids with guns
Easy does it, easy does it, they got something to say no to

And they're turning us into monsters
Turning us into fire
Turning us into monsters
It's all desire
It's all desire
It's all desire

Push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real, push it real
Push it, push it, push it real
