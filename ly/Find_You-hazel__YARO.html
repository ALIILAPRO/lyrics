		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  A table for one, I go solo
I don’t mind spending time with me
But every night, right before the stars glow
I’m wishing for cupid to get me

Who will be the one to make it right?
Give my all, I’ll give it to you 
Pull me in and love me every night 
Boy I’ll be climbing mountains till I Find You 

Who will be the one to make it right?
Give my all, I’ll give it to you 
Pull me in and love me every night
Boy I’ll be climbing mountains till I Find You 

I’ll lay my head on your shoulder
I believe it’s you and me forever
High and low, you know I’ll keep you closer
If we go down, we go down together

Who will be the one to make it right?
Give my all, I’ll give it to you 
Pull me in and love me every night
Boy I’ll be climbing mountains till I Find You 

Who will be the one to make it right?
Give my all, I’ll give it to you
Pull me in and love me every night
Boy I’ll be climbing mountains till I Find You

Down in the valley of the darkest night
Up to the stars where we’ll be shining bright
Not before I get your body next to mine
I’ll be alright

Who will be the one to make it right?
Give my all, I’ll give it to you 
Pull me in and love me every night
Boy I’ll be climbing mountains till I Find You
