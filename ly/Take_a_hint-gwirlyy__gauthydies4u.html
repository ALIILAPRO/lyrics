		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why am I always hit on by the boys I never like
I can always see 'em coming, from the left or from the right

I don't want to be a priss, I'm just try'na be polite
But it always seems to bite me in the

Ask me for my number, yeah, you put me on the spot

You think that we should hook up, but I think that we should not

You had me at "hello", then you opened up your mouth

And that is when it started going south
Oh!

Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint

I guess you still don't get it, so let's take it from the top

You asked me what my sign is, and I told you it was "stop"

And if I had a dime for every name that you just dropped

You'd be here and I'd be on a yacht
Oh!

Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
No you can't buy me a drink, let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint

What about "no" don't you get?

So go and tell your friends

I'm not really interested

It's about time that you're leavin'

I'm gonna count to three and
Open my eyes and

You'll be gone

One

Get your hands off my

Two

Or I'll punch you in the

Three

Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint

I am not your missing link
Let me tell you what I think
I think you could use a mint
Take a hint, take a hint
Take a hint, take a hint
Woah!

Get your hands off my hips, 'fore I'll punch you in the lips
Stop your staring at my hey!
Take a hint, take a hint
T-take a hint, take a hint
