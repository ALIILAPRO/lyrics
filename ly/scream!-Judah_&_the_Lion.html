		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say that death and taxes
Are the two sure things in life
And it's a filthy pattern
When we come to realize they were right
Maybe that's why we're screamin' on the interstate

They say when life gets heavy, Try and keep our head held high
There's over seven billion of us
Just tryin' to find some peace of mind
Maybe that's why we're screamin' on the internet

Lonely, this planet tends to get so woe-is-me
And 'round and 'round we go, so hold me
So sometimes, we just need to scream (scream)

They say that death and taxes
Are the two sure things in life
Well, if that's automatic
We should all rethink what makes us come alive
Maybe that's why we're screamin' in the mirror

We know that life gets heavy
So let's come to realize
There's over seven billion of us
So just try to keep an open mind
Maybe that's why we're screamin' on the internet

Lonely, this planet tends to get so woe-is-me
And 'round and 'round we go, so hold me
So sometimes, we just need to scream

'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Turn the TV on and then you'll know
Why seven billion of us are just about to explode
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Turn the TV on and then you'll know
Why seven billion of us are just about to explode
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Turn the TV on and then you'll know
Why seven billion of us are just about to explode (lonely)

I don't why I feel so lonely
This planet tends to get so woe-is-me
And 'round and 'round we go, so hold me
So sometimes, we just need to scream
