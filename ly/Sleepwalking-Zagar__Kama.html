		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the nighttime you call for me, resist I won't try 
 All the streets feel the same to me, every day's like a lie 
 I came to get wasted, spaced out on your time, 
 You say Iâ€™m a sinner, but looking for love ain't a crime  
  
 Days pass by as we keep on running, nightmares they keep on coming, 
 Polarized ride, we're speeding away, your light is my demon, my night is your day  
 Sleepwalking, but It feels so numbing, nightmares they keep on coming,  
 nightmares keep on coming, before the dawn paves the way 
  
 Am I awake or hypnotized, looking for truth through my eyes 
 But the nightmares won't let me be, all I see is misery 
 I came to get wasted, woke up on the floor 
 I answered the devil's knock on the door 
  
 Days pass by as we keep on running, nightmares they keep on coming, 
 Polarized ride, we're speeding away, your light is my demon, my night is your day 
 Sleepwalking, but It feels so numbing, nightmares they keep on coming,  
 nightmares keep on coming, before the dawn paves the way
