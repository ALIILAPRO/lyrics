		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people we 

See, my shooter pescatarian, but he eat up all the beef (21)
You gave me your ass to kiss, but want the all of me (Goddamn)
I stand on business, dot my I's and cross my T's
All I got is these lil' pictures when I think 'bout all the G's (21)
Memories in my head, the devil talkin' to me (on God)
I know Satan down that path, but God walkin' with me
Put your phone light in the air if you done lost a nigga (21)
Kept it solid, ran up a bag and didn't have to cross a nigga (21, 21, 21)

Whoa, bulletproof my cars (yeah)
He a homebody, fuck it, kill him in his yard (yeah)
Niggas go to clubs and let down they guard (21)
We got choppers out until we find somewhere to park (on God)
Pussy, hit the cup and nod (21)
Trench hoes used to curve me, now they treat me like I'm God (facts)
I know you want my spot, but you don't wanna play your part (pussy)
If it was up to you, you probably let these niggas starve (21)
I got rich and opened more doors than a doorman (on God)
All the Glocks came with extensions like a sew-in (straight up)
And all these cars came with BBL's and body kits (21)
Claim you a killer, but you still ain't got a body yet (21)
How you that nigga when you can't go where you grew up at? (pussy)
How that's your nigga when he cap to hoes behind your back? (The fuck?)
Family picture, you can kill me if you spot a rat (on God)
Real rap, this ain't no cap

See, my shooter pescatarian, but he eat up all the beef (21)
You gave me your ass to kiss, but want the all of me (Goddamn)
I stand on business, dot my I's and cross my T's
All I got is these lil' pictures when I think 'bout all the G's (21)
Memories in my head, the devil talkin' to me (on God)
I know Satan down that path, but God walkin' with me
Put your phone light in the air if you done lost a nigga (21)
Kept it solid, ran up a bag and didn't have to cross a nigga (21, 21, 21)

Came from rats and roaches (yeah)
I seen plenty homicides and still kept my focus (21)
Kill you for some clout, and they'll do anything for motion (on God)
We can't let no bitch say that she the one who broke us (facts)
All familiar faces at the table when we toastin' (21)
Every story got a twist
I can put on watches from my shoulder way down to my wrist
I can't wait on no one, I'm a hustler, I won't ask for shit
She gon' look at you less than a man if you ask your bitch (21)
Even if you helped her on her feet (on God)
They take you for granted, better charge your fee (21)
You 'posed to be a woman, that's the better me
How we both pushin' P?

See, my shooter pescatarian, but he eat up all the beef (21)
You gave me your ass to kiss, but want the all of me (Goddamn)
I stand on business, dot my I's and cross my T's
All I got is these lil' pictures when I think 'bout all the G's (21)
Memories in my head, the devil talkin' to me (on God)
I know Satan down that path, but God walkin' with me
Put your phone light in the air if you done lost a nigga (21)
Kept it solid, ran up a bag and didn't have to cross a nigga (21, 21, 21)
