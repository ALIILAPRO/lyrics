		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational
I can fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow I don't know

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational
I can fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know

Stop claiming what you own, don't think about the show
We're all playing the same game, laying down alone
We're unknown and known, special and a clone
Hate will make you cautious, love will make you glow

Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?

Decisions as I go, to anywhere I flow
Sometimes I believe, at times I'm rational
I can fly high, I can go low
Today I got a million, tomorrow, I don't know

Make me feel the warm, make me feel the cold
It's written in our story, it's written on the walls
This is our call, we rise and we fall
Dancin' in the moonlight, don't we have it all?
