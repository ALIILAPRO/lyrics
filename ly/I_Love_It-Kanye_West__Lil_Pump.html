		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  'Cause you know in the old days they couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today, "Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka"

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it
(Love it, love it) (I'ma fuck a bitch, tell her cousin)
Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin (dork, McLovin, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I just pulled up in a Ghost (Ghost)
Fucked that bitch up out in London (up out in)
Then I fucked up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' (uh-uh, woo)
And my niggas gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant (ignant, yeah)
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' (fell)
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? (where we at?)
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank (aye!)
Ooh, fuck, she take lines (lines)

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (scoop!) (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

You're such a fuckin' ho
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you try to act like you was drinkin' sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a fuckin' hâ€”
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck (whoop!)

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch (bitch, bitch, bitch)

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it (I love it)

'Cause you know in the old days they couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today, "Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka"
