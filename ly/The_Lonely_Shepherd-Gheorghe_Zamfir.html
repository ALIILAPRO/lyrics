		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely

God help me help me to survive!
Remember first time we met day one
Kids in the garden' playin'
Games heaven' fun
Excitin' and amazin' havin'
A real friend of mine
Feel my heartbeat and for
Real friend of mine
Face to face and eye to eye 
Usin' our hands to buy and supply
Chillin' is cool from January to June
And we still sticked together
Like the glue
And know the rules
Forever you and I and believe
It was clear
If I ever should fall
I could count on you with no fear
Runnin' out of time I see who's fake
Alone without protection
From all them snakes
All for one one for all I was told
Black white yellow no matter
If your young or old
Nana's in the house to let you know
What I see is how I fell and damn
I'm alone

I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely

God help me help me to survive!
Everybody's trippin' on me
Oh lord come help me please
I did some bad things in my life
Why can't you rescue me
'cause you've got all I need
I know I got to pay the price
Cheppin' through the streets at night
After a fuss and fight
Tears in my eyes I'm a man
Lookin' for the light
Dark is the path
I know he will rescue me
The lord is my shepard
I'm cool despite emergency
Whom shall I fear exept the god
Thank you for the blessin' a
Nd the skils on the mic
Five years we know there's no dignity
Free at last see the light in me
What goes up must come down
I'll be around while you
Heading towards death town
Always look forward hardly
Never look back
So many tears and
The snakes on my jock
Now I'm riding in my big fat ride
Your ass is late so look for the line
Nana in the house to let you know
What I see is how

I feel so leave me alone
I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely

God help me help me to survive!
Knock on my door whom you lookin' for
A dream or reality enemies at my door
Eyes I realize
It's fantasize I must be high
So let me live before I die
Once again grab the
Bottle twist the cap
To survive your life
Is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step by step and be versatile
Love peace and cash
That's what it's all about
Alone by yourself than you
Lack there's no doubt about
I'm always into something
Making moves to improve
What would you do
If you were in my shoes
Boom a letter oops another suicide
Meet me for a ride at the boulevard
Nana's in the house to let you know
What I see is how I feel
And damn I'm alone
