		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
I want a black and white one and a pink, doesn't matter

Hey, stop
What you want?
Tell me everything you want
What do you want? What do you want?
Tell me everything you want
Oh, yes
What you want?
Tell me everything you want
What do you want? What do you want?
Tell me, I'll do what you want

Look in the mirror
And pose, so damn fine and say it
I'm sick, so bad
Louder, louder
I'm sick, I'm hot, I'm gorgeous, so bad

I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
Black and white one and a pink or purple
I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
Black and white one and a pink, doesn't matter

Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (bam, bam, bam)
Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (ah)
Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (bam, bam, bam)
Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (bam, bam, bam)

I walk like a model, people say, oh
Who's that sexy thang I see over there? (Yeah, that's me)
Don't worry about it
Do the do the thang
Hey, just believe in yourself
What you want a do?
Just sing it out loud

Look in the mirror
And pose so damn fine and say it
I'm sick, so bad
Louder, louder
I'm sick, I'm hot, I'm gorgeous, so bad

I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
Black and white one and a pink or purple
I want a black and white one and a pink or purple
Black and white one and a pink, doesn't matter

Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (bam, bam, bam)
Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (oops)
Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (bam, bam, bam)
Kick it up, kick it up, kick it up, kick it up
Kick it up, kick it up (bam, bam, bam)
