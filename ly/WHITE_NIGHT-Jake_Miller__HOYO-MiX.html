		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want you to show me
Your fantasy (your fantasy)
No past and no future
That's what I need (that's what I need)
The groove takes it over
We'll wait and see
Even I might blank out
You and me

I thought that dream could light our way
(You take me higher, take me away)
(Oh-ohh-oh) oh, be my savior and take me away
(Away, away)
(Take me away)

Tick and tock, once more
You're hosting (you're hosting)
A magic show I cannot escape (I cannot escape)
There's nothing else left for me to do
Going to the other side (other side)

I don't wanna be alone tonight (oh, whoa)
Oh, lead me with your altered sign
There's no one else left for me to lose
Heading to the other side (other side)

(Oh-ohh-oh) yeah (whoa, oh-whoa)
You take me higher, take me away (whoa, oh-whoa)
Just be my savior and take me away (away, away)
Sing it with me, everyone

I don't wanna be alone tonight 
Bring me to the other side (come on)
There's no one else left for me to lose
Going to the other side (other side)

I don't wanna be alone tonight (oh, whoa)
I'll bring you to my best disguise (let's go)
'Cause I don't need, don't need to know the truth
Let me rave forever in your life

whoa, oh-whoa (come on)
Oh, whoa (let's go)
Oh, whoa
