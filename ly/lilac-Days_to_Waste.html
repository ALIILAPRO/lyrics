		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Sunlight drowning the scene
In beautiful things I've lost inside myself along the way)

I'll spiral back down to the floor
And cry
Feel your hand on my chin
Lift my head up to meet both your eyes
And you sighed
Wipe the tears from my lips
As you kissed them and held me so tight
We both lie
On the floor of my room
And we stayed there the rest of the night
As my guide
Took my hand
And we crawled into bed
And just watched the sunrise

Serenade
Can we just go back to sleep
When our bodies slowly sink
I'll be here in the morning

Sunlight
Drowning the scene
In beautiful things
I've lost inside myself along the way
It's alright
Hold onto me
And never release
I've found inside myself somewhere to stay

(Maybe we were just destined to be)

Maybe we were just destined to be
Stars aligned start to shift with the sea
All this time I've been trying to breathe
With my chest pressed against the concrete
All the shadows cast
Through my blinds
To the sheets
While we lay in bed
With your hand on my cheek
Trace my silhouette
As we dance to the silence

(It's finally quiet)

Sunlight
Drowning the scene
In beautiful things
I've lost inside myself along the way
It's alright
Hold onto me
And never release
I've found inside myself somewhere to stay
