		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, you wouldn't...
Fuck around and get lost up in those eyes
Never felt the need to blink at all this whole time
First sight is like love, I get hypnotized
Just might make you mine if it goes right
Reminiscing and I'm wishing back to old times
Thinking I can hold you down if you could hold mine
I been feeling like it's fate breaking closed ties
I been feeling all the lows but with no highs
Never caught up in the lies or what they say
All I know is that you're mine and you may stay
Love's a drug and I'm addicted like it's cocaine
Now I'm hung up and I'm bugging trying to locate you
Ask you if you're doing well and if you're okay
Cause life has been a living hell since you went away
Things change, rearrange, I'm all alone now
All on my own, nobody hitting back my phone now
I'm in the zone and I'm looking for an outlet
Beats and rhymes, I could never live without them
When my time is, I haven't figured out yet
But until then, I'll be living in the now let (Go)
Do more of what we love and less what we're (Told)
Living to the fullest before we get (Old)
Focus on our goals and go for the (Gold)
Light that shines through in a world so (Cold)
Be the light that shines through in a world so cold
Be the light that shines through in a world so cold
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, you wouldn't...
Tell me why I'm waiting
