		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once upon a highway
Lost among the lights of neon tribes (tribes, tribes, tribes)
I used to be a part of you
You used me and I used you too
You took me to the desert
Desecrated, desperate prey, oh yeah

You took me to the desert

I smoke the blackened tissue
High inside the church of the neon lights (lights, lights, lights)
I grease my limbs and enter you
The engine roars as engines do
The pressure we are under
Unmarked grave, the undead reign, oh yeah

The stars align
Behind my eyes
I'm going blind

I look up to the sky
But all I see is the dirt I'm buried in
Lonely lays the longing
I'm so far away from the world that buried me

An unknown destination
Tied up in the trunk of a stolen ride (ride, ride, ride)
I've never seen a sky so red
Just one more try before we're dead
The ashes in our nostrils
Ask for nothing, act like you're ok

The stars align
Behind my eyes
I'm going blind

I look up to the sky
But all I see is the dirt I'm buried in
Lonely lays the longing
I'm so far away from the world that buried me
I look up to the sky
But all I see is the dirt I'm buried in
Lonely lays the longing
I'm so far away from the world that buried me

(A crushing wave)
(Upon the rocks)
(A shallow grave)
(On the coast)
(I'll wait)

I look up to the sky
But all I see is the dirt I'm buried in
Lonely lays the longing
I'm so far away from the world that buried me
I look up to the sky
But all I see is the dirt I'm buried in
Lonely lays the longing
I'm so far away from the world that buried me
