		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I came along for the ride
Went wicked with the clutch
Happened so fast and it hurt so much
You're a car crash
And I can't look away
I should have known by now
I'm still not afraid
I do it to myself
Knows what I never say
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

All I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing!
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

I couldn't stop at the red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

I came along for the ride
Went wicked with the clutch
Happened so fast and it hurt so much
You're a car crash
And I can't look away

And all I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
My life flashing!
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

I couldn't stop at the red light
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away
From the headlights
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away! (Let's go for a ride!)

And all I see is shattered glass and
Red lights passing
(Let's go for a ride!)
Headed for the same disaster
Faster and faster and faster

I couldn't stop at the red light
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
And I can't look away
From the headlights
The red light
Stop at the red light
I couldn't stop at the red light
You're just like a car crash
Like a car crash!
And I can't look away!
