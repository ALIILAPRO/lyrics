		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was heading for the mountains
I had saved so much for you
And in the town I left behind me
There was nothing left to do.

I knew that you were waiting
For me to share your life
Cause I told you when I left, that
When I come back you'll be my wife.

But someone was waiting
In the shadows of the night
Someone was waiting
It just didn't feel right.

Danger on the track
Something told me there were
Strangers on my back
And I was so right.

Maybe I should surrender
Maybe I should give it up
But the strength I had inside
Told me you can never stop.

The men wanted to break me
Steal and bring me down
But I fought for you and later
They were lying on the ground.
