		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've known me at my lowest stage
You brought me through the burning rain
You knew who you were navigating
I feel love
Even in my darkest place
I feel a light I can't explain
And it's something that is ever changing

You've seen the long nights, the I'm not alrights
The ebb and the tide, the salt in the red eyes
You don't know how you're saving my life tonight
'Cause I feel like

You are my hero
And I want you to know that I feel like
You are my hero
I want you to know

I've been wrong
More times than I have been right
But you don't bring that up in fights
You held me when I felt defeated
I feel strong
Whenever you've been around
I see you hidden in the crowd
You make me feel like I am needed

You've been there for the scars, the aches in my heart
The journeys in cars, that talk through the bad times
You don't know how you're saving my life tonight
And I feel like

You are my hero
And I want you to know that I feel like
You are my hero
And I want you to know

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I feel like
You are my hero
And I want you to know that I feel like
You are my hero
And I want you to know that I feel like

You are my hero
And I want you to know that I feel like
You are my hero
I want you to know, my hero
