		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every time you say you love me, I don't believe it
Heart been broke too many times, I swear, it be bleedin'
No matter how many times, I'll never be even
Never be even, no
'Cause days turn nights and nights turn cold
Where do you go when the lights get low?
When the lights get low, where do you go?

See, I got a hundred million reasons
Why I should go, why I should go
A hundred million reasons
But you keep pullin' on my soul
A hundred million reasons, reasons
A hundred million reasons
Why I should leave, but I don't

Every time you kiss me, I could tell that you're schemin'
My mama never liked you and I know the reason
You've been actin' different 'round your friends lately, yeah
I ain't never switch up, I'm consistently there
Whenever you need me, whenever you call (call)
You know that I won't let you fall
Always kept it real with you, I guess that's a flaw
That's my flaw

See, I got a hundred million reasons
Why I should go, why I should go
A hundred million reasons
But you keep pullin' on my soul
A hundred million reasons, reasons
A hundred million reasons
Why I should leave, but I don't

You know the things that you do
To get my mind goin' crazy
I know the things that you say
You never mean it, you my baby
Eastside, Westside, Southside, Northside
It don't matter what side, baby, I'm on your side
Even though we ain't on best terms
Baby, tell me when you gon' learn?
You always mine, ain't no lie

See, I got a hundred million reasons
Why I should go, why I should go
A hundred million reasons
But you keep pullin' on my soul
A hundred million reasons, reasons
A hundred million reasons
Why I should leave, but I don't
