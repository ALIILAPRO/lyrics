		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Losses, losers and more, gain of life's pleasures cohorts listen
Behind the doors to a life meaningless less than zero in me all my walls
Falling down pains aloft misery
I'm sure that the lessons were learned, I'm sure that the punishments
Went well deserved by the pawn in the plan taste of shit bitterness
Walk from me everything systematically

Come on you were the one you were the one
To dredge up shit inside of me in my pointless life of nothing
Tell me what I'm supposed to be
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
Tell me what it takes to ascend
Tell me what it takes to live

Patience, pleasures and rewards, come in due time stare at the sun
I'm bored in a life meaningless soaking up all of me like the cross
You worship life is loss look at me I'm sure that some day we'll wake
Up I'm sure that some day we'll wake from the dream
Of success and focus, tunneling to the light glowing deep inside of
Me your taunting I wake up

Come on you were the one you were the one,
To dredge up shit inside of me in my pointless life of nothing
Tell me what I'm supposed to be
Tell me who I'm supposed to be
Tell me what it takes to ascend
Tell me what it takes to live
Tell me now!
Tell me now!

Pain misery distress dismal know where depressed idiot failure
In me, calling, loser, man I'm the
Loser, loser, loser, in me, who I am, in me

Don't feel sorry don't feel sorry for me
Don't need your sympathy or empathy, don't need your sympathy inside
Of me
Don't need your sympathy or empathy, don't need your sympathy inside
Of me
Don't feel sorry don't feel sorry for me

Come on
I know you were the one you were the one
Numb to feelings inside of me why I've seized my vision
Don't need you to tell me who to be
Don't need you to tell me what to be
Don't need you to tell me how to ascend
Don't need you to tell me how to live
