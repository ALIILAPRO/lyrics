(Internet Money, bitch)
Hahahaha, yeah
Yeah

I remember times when I ain't have shit
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (oh, no-no-no)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

My life been tragic, thank you for askin'
I've seen too many of my fam' end up in caskets
I've seen too many of my friends turn into ashes
Wish I still had them
Light a blunt, put it to the sky, I'm tryna get high (high)
Yeah what's up? Look at me in my eyes, tell me it's alright (alright)
Had to cut plenty people off, money on my mind
I can't fuck with 'em, I can't trust nobody but I

I remember times when I ain't have shit (yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would

They hate so bad-bad, huh, my money up, they fake as fuck
I know they mad-mad, I still ain't done, I ain't switchin' up
I ain't givin' up, I'm goin' in, word to my friends
I ain't thinkin' clear, tell me what I did, I just whipped the Benz
I'd give it all back right now just to see you smile
I'll give my hoes back, on slime, just to hear you now
They ain't my friends, that ain't my woadie, it ain't my dawg
For to get some money, be the only reason that they come around
And the top down, everythin' goin' smoothly
Hope they don't try me, come out on top, I'm shootin' 'round
When I'm up in town
Haters after me but got so many rootin' for me (yeah)
I can't let 'em down

I remember times when I ain't have shit (yeah)
No food in my crib, now I live lavish (talk to me)
They say they love me to my face, but they can't stand it
Them hoes ain't fuck with me back then, now they attracted
FN attached to my bro and he gon' blast it
Don't tell me what I've been through, you don't know
Made it out the mud, with or without you I'm good
Did it for my lil' bro, just to show him one day you could
I did this for my mama 'cause I told her one day I would
