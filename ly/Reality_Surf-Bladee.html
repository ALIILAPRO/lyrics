		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tree so ripe, we got fruit
We got crowns, salute it (yeah, it's real)
Put a concept on that feeling
Take a word and change the meaning
Only you, deck the halls, open the ceiling
On Hawaii island, reality surf
Reality surf, reality surf, reality surf, oh

Venom in the vile
Enemies closer than you
Trick them into buying
Snakes slither in the spine, take the fruit
Still a dirty city throwing cards (yeah)
Everything related back to you (back to you)
I have never been the one to talk
Cinderella, Cinderella, wear it if it suits
Build it just to watch it fall apart
Looking for the arrow when you shoot
You take yourself seriously, just stop
Listen to your heart
Mirror, mirror, the reflection of the law
I just wanna show you something new (new)
Everything is funny when you see it
DVD, my life is a cartoon
