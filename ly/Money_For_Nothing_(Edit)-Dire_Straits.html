		  (I want my MTV)

Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free

Now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

I shoulda learned to play the guitar 
I shoulda learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it stickin' in the camera man
We could have some

And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's bangin' on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothin' get your chicks for free

We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these color TVs

Listen here, now that ain't workin', that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't workin' that's the way you do it
Money for nothin' and your chicks for free
Money for nothin' and the chicks for free
Get your money for nothin' (what's that?)
And the chicks for free (look at that, look at that)
Get your money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
And the chicks for free (I want my MTV)
Money for nothin' (I want my, I want my)
Chicks for free (I want my MTV)
