		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  An imitation from New York
You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippy tarts hero
'Cause you put on a bad show
You put on a bad show
Oh, don't it show

Still out on those pills
Oh, do you remember?

You think it's swell playing Max's Kansas
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut
You better keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut
In a rut

Still out on those pills
Do the sambo

Four years on you still look the same
I think about time
You changed your brain
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor little faggot
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me

Think it's swell playing in Japan
Everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit
You're coming to this
Ya poor little faggot
You're sealed with a kiss

Still out on those pills
Cheap thrills Anadins
Aspros, anything
You're condemned to eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss
Kiss me

A kiss, a kiss
You're sealed with a kiss
A looking for a kiss
You're coming to this
I wanna kiss
You do just about anything
Oh, kiss this
Tatty bye
