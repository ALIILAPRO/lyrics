		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So I wrote in a letter
But I don't know if it came
The nurse she likes my writing
So she keeps it just like me
So that it won't get away

I won't be denied this time
'Fore I go out of my mind over matters
Got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the room

Got a sky that looks like heaven
Got an earth that looks like shit
And it's getting hard to tell where what I am ends
And what they're making me begins

And I won't be denied this time
'Fore I go out of my mind over matters
Got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the moon

Saturday in the yard
They'll bring you by
We'll lay down on the grass
And watch as the sky closes in

And I won't be denied this time
'Fore I go out of my mind over matters
Got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the moon
