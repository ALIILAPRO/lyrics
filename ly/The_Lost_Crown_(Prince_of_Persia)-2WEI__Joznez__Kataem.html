		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cll those dark times I was made for
Pushed me to the edge but I stayed sure
Heard you need a warrior that's what I came for
One to pay the cost of the waged war

Ey, Yeah, Uh
Tell 'em bow down in advance
Staying out the way ain't enough
Even with time in my hands
I learned to move in a rush
Heard the kingdom was in need saving, brought some warriors in for the clutch 
I got Layla and Qais in my grasp, they ain't gon heal through those bruises and cuts
Can't get too caught in the past
I fight through the scars while I'm marking the map
Faced with the odds, the gods, the demons and still put them all on the backs
I only run with immortals
We got that type of fight that ain't gon' ever old
Keeping my warriors victorious
I might be the last hope, so I can't say no

No,
got no time to hope my story gon' be told

I see the danger coming close, it feels like home
I face these pressures on my own, who else was chose
Who else was born to give 'em hope
Or to find it on the other side of the unknown
It's only right, I show you who I meant to be
It's meant for me
Long as I got the hands of time it ain't out my reach 
Just look at all that I've found searching for the lost crown, but the journey ain't complete
It's only right I show you who I'm meant to be

Cutting through all of the enemies plotting that's whether they ready or not
Better get better with time I can't see an enemy ending the plot
My struggle came with a purpose
Now I'm bout to turn the doubts into a burden
You'll see I ain't backing off what I'm deserving
I put that on every battle that I fought
Had to play the plight 
Don't take a chance with me, take advice
Been through the dark times so I came with a dark side that'll show you the light
See how I rose up, boy the warrior grown up
Now we giving them hope
Keeping my warriors victorious
Putting harm on any enemy that's getting close
So...

No,
got no time to hope my story gon' be told

I see the danger coming close, it feels like home
I face these pressures on my own, who else was chose
Who else was born to give 'em hope
Or to find it on the other side of the unknown
It's only right, I show you who I meant to be
It's meant for me
Long as I got the hands of time it ain't out of reach 
Just look at all that I've found searching for the lost crown, but the journey ain't complete
Its only right I show you who I'm meant to be

Walking through the unknown 
همیشه تنها جندگیدم (I've always fought alone) 
Such a long journey from my home
من متوقف نمی شوم (I will not stop)
Cause I'm the hero that they need
من قهرمان هستم (I'm the hero)
Can't waste no time it's up to me
وقتشه حرکت کنم (it's time I make my move)
cnd look at all that I found searching for the lost crown
اما سفر کامل نیست (But the journey is not complete)
It's only right I show you who I'm meant to be

I see the danger coming close, 
Who else was born to give 'em hope
I face these pressures on my own, 
Even if it's just a dream
I'll show you who I'm meant to be
