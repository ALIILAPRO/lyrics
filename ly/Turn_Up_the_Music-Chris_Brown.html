		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Turn up the music 'cause the song just came on
Turn up the music if they try to turn us down
Turn up the music, can I hear it 'til the speakers blow?
Turn up the music, fill your cup, and drink it down

If you're sexy and you know it, put yo' hands up in the air
Put yo' hands up in the air 
Girl, put yo' hands up (hands up, hands up, hands up)
If you're sexy and you know it, put yo' hands up in the air
Put yo' hands up in the air 
Girl, put yo' hands up and

Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (turn up the music)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (turn up the music)

T-t-turn up the music
T-turn up the-

Turn up the music 'cause the sun just came up
Turn up the music if they try to turn us down
Turn up the music, 'cause I'm tryna hear the speakers blow
Turn up the music, fill your cup, and drink it down

If you're sexy and you know it, put yo' hands up in the air (hey)
Put yo' hands up in the air (oh)
Girl, put yo' hands up (hands up, hands up, hands up)
If you're sexy and you know it, put yo' hands up in the air (up in the air)
Put yo' hands up in the air 
Girl, put yo' hands up and

Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah) (I need it)
Turn up the music (just turn it up louder)
Turn up the music (I need it in my life, yeah) (yeah)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (turn up the music)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (turn up the music)

Save my life (just dance with me)
All I wanna do is party, so DJ turn it up
Girl, dance with me (just dance with me)
