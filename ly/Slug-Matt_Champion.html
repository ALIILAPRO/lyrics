		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, ah, hey, hey

I want someone
And that someone just happens to be you
I won't leave you
No matter what you do

Oh, I, I just want your love
Oh, ah, won't you be my slug?

I'd fall, I'd fall, and you ain't gotta save me
Ah, come on, just close the door (ooh!)
Don't let the rain in
You said it's dangerous, it's dangerous
It's dangerous to look in your eyes
I can't explain it (explain what?)
How I got so mangled in your light

Oh, I, I just want your love
Oh, ah, won't you be my slug?

Oh, I, I just want your love
Oh, ah, won't you be my slug?

A slug
Genuine
Adrenaline
What you're feeling, hold it
No rush (no rush)
Look how beautiful and creative 

Oh, I, I just want your love
Oh, ah, won't you be my slug?
I just want your love
