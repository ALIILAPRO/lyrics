		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Send out a sound for the wood between the worlds
Gently repeat as the boundaries start to swirl
Keep to the call that is twice now liminal
It's not the same where the trails lead to the outer regions

Echoes from the otherworld turn horizons into endless ever present
Echoes 
Many otherworlds true horizon start to turn
Numberless names withe the force of the ninth wave
Keep to the call that's repeated in the outer regions
Echoes from the otherworld turn the horizon into endless ever present
Echoes
Many otherworlds true horizon makes the endless ever
Present echoes into otherworlds true horizons into the endless ever
Present echoes
Many otherworlds true horizon takes a turn
Echoes reflect and change they serenade
