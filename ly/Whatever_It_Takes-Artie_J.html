		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pick your poison I told you I can't stand that shit
You be running game for the last few times
And I know, I just can't lose you baby
I just can't lose you baby
I can't lose you girl
I'm just tryna keep it all together
Now the sex don't feel the same
Feels like something really changed
I can tell you turned off
And its not even my fault yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
She just want somebody brand new
But she's hiding it from you
Baby what can I do, to make it feel
Like there's still something there
Just to make it feel real again
And again and again and again yeah
I'm like is there anything that I can do
I'm tryna get right right with you
I'll do whatever it takes for
I'll do whatever it takes baby
I'll do whatever it takes girl
Whatever (I love you baby)
I'll do whatever it takes for you
Whatever it takes for you
To show you that I'm serious
Are you bored of me, are you tired of me
Are you lonely with me babe
(I love you baby)
Pick your poison I told you I can't stand that shit
You be running game for the last few times
And I know, I just can't lose you baby
I just can't lose you baby
I can't lose you girl
I'm just tryna keep it all together
Now the sex don't feel the same
Feels like something really changed
I can tell you turned off
And its not even my fault yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
She just want somebody brand new
But she's hiding it from you
Baby what can I do, to make it feel
Like there's still something there
Just to make it feel real again
And again and again and again yeah
I'm like is there anything that I can do
I'm tryna get right right with you
I'll do whatever it takes for
I'll do whatever it takes baby
I'll do whatever it takes girl
Whatever (I love you baby)
I'll do whatever it takes for you
Whatever it takes for you
To show you that I'm serious
Are you bored of me, are you tired of me
Are you lonely with me babe
(I love you baby)
