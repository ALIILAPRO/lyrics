		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Run away, girl, don't you ever look back
There's a hole in the sky with your name in the cracks
So run away kid, watch it all unfold
You gotta cut 'em loose to find your home

And the sirens scream down every road
While the signs light up, "This way to gold"
Oh, you've come so far to get lost at sea
Where the hell am I supposed to be?

So I cut the shackles and changed my name
And I shed my past, like skin on a snake
But I came so far to get lost at sea
Oh, where the hell am I supposed to be?
And the sirens scream down every road
While the signs light up, "This way to gold"
But I'm attached to my worst enemy
Oh, who the hell am I supposed to be?

Run away girl, don't you ever look back
There's a new world out there, there's a newfound act
Oh, run away kid, watch the curtains unfold
You gotta cut the strings to find your home

And the sirens scream down every road
While the signs light up, "This way to gold"
Oh, you've come so far to get lost at sea
Where the hell am I supposed to be?

So I cut the shackles and changed my name
And I shed my past, like skin on a snake
But I came so far to get lost at sea
Oh, where the hell am I supposed to be?
And the sirens scream down every road
While the signs light up, "This way to gold"
But I'm attached to my worst enemy
Oh, who the hell am I supposed to be?

And the sirens scream down every road
While the signs lit up, "This way to gold"
But I'm attached to my worst enemy
Oh, who the hell am I supposed to be?
Who the hell am I supposed to be?
Who the hell am I supposed to be?

So I cut the shackles and changed my name
And I shed my past, like skin on a snake
But I came so far to get lost at sea
Oh, where the hell am I supposed to be?
And the sirens scream down every road
While the signs light up, "This way to gold"
But I'm attached to my worst enemy
Oh, who the hell am I supposed to be?
