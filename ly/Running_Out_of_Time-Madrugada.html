		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One more early morning
One more late afternoon
Once more you're out in the wind
And once more you come in too soon

It's a long road, oh man
And it's a hard road
You wanna make sure to make all the friends that you can make
You ain't worth much more to them
Than the worth of what you give
And the worth of what you take

In this old ritual of compassion
Well, you just fail and fall behind
Now you're running
Seems to be running
You're running out of time

You know it ain't love
No, you know it ain't love
Unless it's eating you alive
When you're in your bed at night

No, you know it ain't love
You know there can't be no love
Unless it comes howlin' out of you
Then you know the time is right

Ah you wait so long
And now you don't know
Now you don't know what to do
Except to pray for your love
To come returning on back to you

You dry out with all of this bitterness and fear
And with every passing year
Nothing's really real to you
Except this pain that you feel

You will come to realize
That you had your day
Someday oh so long ago
When somebody came a-calling at your door
And you pretend that you were not home

Now you're running
You're running
You're running out of time
