		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're feeling isolate
And all kinds of frustrate
But I love you as you are
Love you as you are, yeah
And don't worry about the hate
It don't fit in those boxes they create
And it's tearing you apart
It's tearing you apart, yeah

And when you build those walls to keep you safe
It's like a prison you can't escape
You tear them down, you just might hear me say

I love you as you are
I love you as you are
And when the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
I love you
I love you as you are
I love you as you are
And when the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
I love you
I love you as you are

You can come out of the shadows
They only scared of what they don't know
But I love you as you are, love you as you are, yeah
Yeah, you waged this war within yourself
Wasting time dying in a shell
They don't define you 
Just know they never will

I love you as you are
I love you as you are
And when the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
I love you
I love you as you are
I love you as you are
And when the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
I love you
I love you as you are, yeah
I love you as you are, yeah

You're feeling isolate
And all kinds frustrate
But I love you as you are
Love you as you are, yeah

I love you as you are
I love you as you are
And when the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
I love you
I love you as you are
I love you as you are
When the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
'Til it's gone, 'til it's gone

I love you as you are, yeah
I love you as you are, yeah
When the whole damn world 
Don't know what they got 'til it's gone
I love you as you are
