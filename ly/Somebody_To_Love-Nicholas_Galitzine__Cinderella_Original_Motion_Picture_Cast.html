		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can anybody find me
Somebody to
Love?

Each morning I get up, I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
(Take a look at yourself) take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord, what you're doin' to me (yeah)
I have spent all my years in believin' you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord

Somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?

I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life
I work 'til I ache in my bones ('til he aches in his bones)
But at the end of the day (at the end of the day) I'm all on my own
I get down (down) on my knees (knees) and I start to pray (praise the Lord)
'Til the tears run down from my eyes, Lord

Somebody (somebody)
Somebody (somebody)
Can anybody find me
Somebody to love?
(Somebody, somebody)

I work hard (he works hard) every day of my life (every day)
I try and I try and I try
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
I got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe

Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love
Find me somebody to love (find me somebody, somebody to)
Find me somebody to love (find me somebody, somebody to)
Find me somebody to love (find me somebody, somebody to)
Find me somebody to love (find me somebody, somebody to)
Find me somebody to love, love, love, love, love
(Somebody) somebody
(Somebody) somebody
(Somebody) anyone
(Somebody) anybody
Can anybody find me
Somebody to
To love?

Find me, find me, find me
Somebody
Find me, find me, find me
Somebody, somebody
Find me, find me, find me
Someone to
Find me, find me, find me
Someone to love
