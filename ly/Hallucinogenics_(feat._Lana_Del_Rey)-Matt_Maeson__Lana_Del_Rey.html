		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 
'Cause I forgot I lit it

Rippin' with my sinners 
'Cause fuck it, man, I ain't no beginner
And then I crawled back to the life 
That I said I wouldn't live in

'Cause I just couldn't open up
I'm always shiftin'
Go find yourself a man 
Who's strong and tall and Christian

Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 
'Cause I forgot I lit it

Drunken in Seattle
Two more Xans and without a paddle
I don't remember your face 
Or your hair, or your name, or your smile

'Cause I just couldn't open up
I'm always shiftin'
Go find yourself a man 
Who's strong and tall and Christian

Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
And then I crawled back to the life 
That I said I wouldn't live in

'Cause I carried on like the wayward son
And now through and through, I've come undone
And now I am just but the wayward man
What with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hand
'Cause I carried on like the wayward son
And now through and through, I've come undone
And now I am just but the wayward man
What with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hand

Pushing past the limit
Trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 
'Cause I forgot I lit it
