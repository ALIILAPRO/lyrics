		  Uh
Uh

You may think I'm ghostin', but the truth is I'm a liar
I sell you what I tell you, but you ain't a fucking buyer (yeah)
You thinkin' that I'm sleepin' when I'm creepin' in the night (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)
They say it's bad karma when you live a double life (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)

They say it's bad karma bein' such a heart breaker
I've always picked a giver, 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it, then I'll think about it later, uh-huh
Kiss me, bad karma, uh (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)
Uh (uh uh, uh uh, uh uh)

The itsy bitsy spider went and spun a web of lies (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I don't play the nicest but it ain't a fucking crime (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
I never learn my lesson so I always do it twice (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
They say it's bad karma when you live a double life (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

They say it's bad karma bein' such a heart breaker
I've always picked a giver, 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it, then I'll think about it later, uh-huh
Kiss me, bad karma, uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)

I don't give a fuck, I don't believe in luck
That's why I do what I wanna do, yeah (yeah, I do)
Oh, I don't give a fuck, I don't believe in luck
I do what I wanna do, oh (I wanna do)

They say it's bad karma, being such a heart breaker
I've always picked a giver, 'cause I've always been the taker
I'd rather just do it, then I'll think about it later, uh-huh
Kiss me bad karma, uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Uh (uh, uh, uh, uh, uh)
Uh

You got a mean drummer face
Just like "Argh"
