		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Once, never enough
Once, you can't stop
'Til it hurts
'Til it burns
What do you want
For your last words?

'Cause no one is safe here
No one cares
Pleasure sacred
Is pleasure sacred?

All my sins dragging me back again
Yeah, all the regrets
Dragging me down
Into the dirt, the blood
What you do you want
If it's your last night with her?

No one is safe here
No one cares
Pleasure sacred

There's no one to save you
And everyone's scared
Pleasure sacred
Is pleasure sacred?

Do unto those that which they did to you
Pleasure's sacred
Do unto those that which they did to you
Pleasure's scarce

Shall we renounce
From where we've come and who we were?
Hear me now, you demigods
Either lift me up or let me burn
