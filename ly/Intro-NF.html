		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm lookin' like I'm gonna get it, you probably don't get it
I come in your house with a microphone
Lookin' like I'm about to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm outta my mind but I feel like I'm in it
If I never make it, don't make any difference
I'm still gonna kill it
You know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'

NF is a monster, I am a villain
My music is sick, and you don't know what ill is
You better get back, I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I don't have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid tryna make it in music
I'm thinkin' it's crazy

I spent all my money on studio time, tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible
Learned to get better, the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album
Most of you people, you probably don't know what I'm sayin', hold up!
What you're witnessin' now, don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone, jump in the crowd
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, wow
The moment you told me that you was a rapper, I couldn't believe it
You believe it now?

Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio, stay up 'til 3 in the morning
And write 'till I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
Well, thank you for buyin' it!
Maybe you burned it!
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it!
I look at the industry, look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind

You put a whole lot of money into it, you better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past few years of my life and I promise you I have been given it mine
Try to keep up with this
I'm not a puppet, no string on my back, I'm one of a kind
Music is changing, no way to tame this
I am an artist, look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowing they're famous
But I really don't care what your name is
And I really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is
Cocky? Nah, I'm competitive?

This is a job for me, it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather
I come in the ring, my punches are way better
I never drink but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king, who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard
And the carry the speakers on both of my arms
'Til you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me Imma show you what dope is
And when I say dope I ain't talkin' 'bout smoke
And I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic, it's part of my family

Take it away, I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, these people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math, I look at the map
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
But man, this track was beautiful
The least I can do if I murder a beat is take the time to go his funeral
