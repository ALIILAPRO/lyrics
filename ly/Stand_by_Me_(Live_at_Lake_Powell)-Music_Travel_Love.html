		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid
No, I-I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, won't you stand by me
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
And the mountains should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I-I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

So darlin', darlin'
Stand by me, oh, won't you stand by me
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble, won't you stand by me?
Oh, won't you stand by me
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me

Oh darling
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
