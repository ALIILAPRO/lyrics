		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (And we would love you to join us for a bite)
(And we would love you to join us for a bite)
(And we would love you to join us for a bite)

Can't wait to meet you
So join the animatronic family
We open real soon
Try your best to hold on to sanity
Come get to know me
And you won't want to leave after tonight
Down here, we're lonely
And we would love you to join us for a bite

You've been through 20 long, frightful nights
You've seen their faces, felt all their bites
You know our show is so far from over
And Freddy told us you're an organ donor

All eyes are on you
We can walk you through our dark fantasy
Learn what we've gone through
We can teach you to laugh at tragedy
You thought the nightmares ended
Back at Freddy's we're all still right here
So let's get friendly!

We're feeling festive
Join the party, we'll try hard not to bite
Anger is restless
Don't hold it against us, we're alright
The fun is starting
A celebration that lasts eternally
I'm always watching
Because somebody purple murdered me

We'll be found down deep underground
What have I done to deserve this damnation?
Who knows if you're the one to blame
'Cause we don't even know your name
But you're here now and we've got temptations

We're only playing
Just wanted to make a few new friends
You plan on staying
Oh when you're with us, the party never ends
You might look at me and
Think you're going crazy
I lost it long ago, you're not alone, Baby!

Can't wait to meet you
So join the animatronic family
We open real soon
Try your best to hold on to sanity
Come get to know me
And you won't want to leave after tonight
Down here, we're lonely
And we would love you to join us for a bite

(And we would love you to join us for a bite)
(And we would love you to join us for a bite)
(And we would love you to join us for a bite)
(And we would love you to join us for a bite)
(And we would love you to join us for a bite)
