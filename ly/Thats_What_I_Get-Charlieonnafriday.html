		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never meant to make you fall but that's what I get
For promising to give it all, guess that's what I get
Oh, why'd I go and lead you on when I can't commit?
Oh, I guess that's what I get

Was it karma? Was it fate?
Was it meant to be this way?
I don't know, all I know is
I broke your pretty little heart

Now you're happy, doing great
Fell in love with what's his name
Tables turn, bridges burn
Now I'm stuck here singing in the dark

Should've known that when I let you go
That'd I be losing part of me, yeah
It's too late to fix all my mistakes
But I just hope one day you'll see

I never meant to make you fall but that's what I get
For promising to give it all, guess that's what I get
Oh, why'd I go and lead you on when I can't commit?
Oh, I guess that's what I get

And now I'm going through withdrawals, guess that's what I get
And you don't pick up when I call, guess that's what I get
Oh, how'd I go from you're the one to your one regret?
Oh, I guess that's what I get

Tossin', turnin'
Feels like pain is permanent
These open wounds won't close (we got no hope)
Used to be one person
Now we're two hearts uncertain, yeah
Our future's up in smoke

Should've known that when I let you go
That'd I be losing part of me, yeah
It's too late to fix all my mistakes
But I just hope one day you'll see

I never meant to make you fall but that's what I get
For promising to give it all, guess that's what I get
Oh, why'd I go and lead you on when I can't commit?
Oh, I guess that's what I get

And now I'm going through withdrawals, guess that's what I get
And you don't pick up when I call, guess that's what I get
Oh, how'd I go from you're the one to your one regret?
Oh, I guess that's what I get

Oh, I guess that's what I get
Oh, I guess that's what I get
