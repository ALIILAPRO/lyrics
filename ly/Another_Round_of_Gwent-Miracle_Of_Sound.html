		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Be you a lass or be you a gent 
You'll never pass on a round of Gwent! 
When your mail is a-mauled and your blades are a-bent 
Take a rest from it all it all with a round of Gwent 

Long shall we play 
To wile away the days 
Another round of Gwent! 
Another round of Gwent! 
A coin for the bard 
And drop another card 
Another round of Gwent 
Another round of Gwent 

When you're drowning in tears and your heart is a-rent 
Bring back your cheer with a round of Gwent 
When you're stewed, full of beer and your coin is a-spent 
Before you disappear, play a round of Gwent! 

Long shall we play 
To wile away the days 
Another round of Gwent! 
Another round of Gwent! 
A coin for the bard 
And drop another card 
Another round of Gwent 
Another round of Gwent
