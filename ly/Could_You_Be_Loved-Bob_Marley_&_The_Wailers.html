		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved and be love?

Don't let them fool ya
Or even try to school ya, oh, no
We've got a mind of our own
So go to Hell if what you're thinking is not right
Love would never leave us alone
A-in the darkness ya must come out to light

Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, whoa now, and be love?

The road of life is rocky and you may stumble too
So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you
(Love your brotherman) could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be, could you be loved?
Could you be, could you be loved?

Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya, oh, no
We've got a life to live
They say, only, only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive, ay

Could you be loved and be love?
Could you be loved, whoa now, and be love?

(Never gonna miss your water until your well runs dry)
(No matter how you treat him, man will never be satisfied)
Say something (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
(Could you be, could you be loved?) Say something
Say something (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (could you be, could you be loved?)

Say something, say something (say something)
Say something, say something (could you be loved?)
Say something, say something, reggae, reggae
Say something, rockers, rockers
Say something, reggae, reggae
Say something, rockers, rockers
Say something (could you be loved?)
Say something (could you be loved?)
Say something, come on
Say something (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (could you be, could you be, could you be loved?)
Say something (could you be, could you be loved?)
