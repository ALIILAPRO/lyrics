		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I was a fisherman 
Tumblin' on the seas 
Far away from dry land 
And it's bitter memories 
Castin' out my sweet line 
With abandonment and love 
No ceiling bearin' down on me 
Save the starry sky above 

With light in my head 
With you in my arms

I wish I was the brakeman 
On a hurtlin' fevered train 
Crashin head long into the heartland 
Like a cannon in the rain 
With the feelin of the sleepers 
And the burnin of the coal 
Countin the towns flashin by 
And a night that's full of soul 

With light in my head 
With you in my arms

And I know I will be loosened 
From the bonds that hold me fast 
And the chains all around me 
Will fall away at last 
And on that grand and fateful day 
I will take thee in my hand 
I will ride on a train 
I will be the fisherman 

With light in my head 
You in my arms

Light in my head 
You in my arms

Light in my head 
You 

With light in my head 
You in my arms
