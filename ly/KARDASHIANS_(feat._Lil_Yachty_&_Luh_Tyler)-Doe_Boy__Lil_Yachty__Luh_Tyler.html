		  Atl Jacob, he a fuckin' millionaire

First off, they need to free BG up out that slammer (free BG)
They think I'm sweet 'cause I don't tote guns on camera (brrt, brrt)
I run through pints, I pour up fours in Fanta (I pour up fours)
(pour up fours, I pour up fours, pour up fours)
I get all my drugs from the same nigga, know that it's clean (bee)
This a real Tesla, I don't pop no five-dollar bean (bee)
My dawg hop out and get to sprayin' 
Like he shot me the green (brrt, yeah, brrt, hey)
Shit ain't what it seems, dawg, I mean it (dawg, I mean it)
Niggas is not authentic, dawg, I seen it (niggas not authentic, huh)
She go the extra mile for my penis (she go the extra mile, okay)
All I hang around is baby demons (yeah)
Why these bitches tryna trap me? 
I'ma just go and sell the semen (Let's go, let's get it)
I almost started damn near touched the stems (damn, okay)
Bitch, you ain't fly, all them outfits Skims (shit, okay)
That bandana burgundy 'cause of brims
Fifty cent tear out that seal no bird gang, this him

You ain't fly, that ain't Chanel, bitch, you go shop on Skims (fool)
Don't knock you 'cause you shop at Skims
But bitch, don't act like you trimm (fool, trimm, trimm)
Feel like Kylie, Kris, Khloe, yeah, I got K's like I'm Kim
I-i'm from Cleveland 
I told Tristan put me on with Kendall (oh, really? Come here, baby)
Real nigga, said he came 'cause he fuck with her nigga
Dunk on an opp like Ben Simmons 
When I come through and spin 'em (rrah-baow-baow-baow)
Slime 'em out, bitch, I been thuggin'
Pull up, dump out the window (slatt, slatt)
My oppers sweet, bitch, I don't feel 'em, I sleep on Gucci pillow (pussy)
Pull up shootin', think I won't, but bitch, I will like I'm Willow
Fresh-ass prince, RIP lil' Will
I told that bitch to bend over (Come here, baby)
Hard to walk, my pockets heavy, I fuck 'round and tip over
Chose they side, but he wasn't ready, switchy made him switch over (switchy)
Finesse, don't know a nigga colder, all I do is get over (Let's go)
My ice cold like Minnesota, stack my racks to my shoulder (racks, racks)
Opp shoppin', gun you down in public, clap you at Kroger (oh, really?)
Told that lil' bitch just come over 
Just might cop you a Rover (mwah, come here, baby)
If she block me, pour the Wocky in the pineapple soda (Wocky)
You gon' cry inside this Bentley or that broke nigga's shoulder?
Not like Joe Burrow, not from Cinci 
Bitch, Knowles Ave where I post up (bop, bop, bop)
Took her and her friends out on a trip
I told Yachty, "Pull that boat up" (skeet)

In here rappin' 'bout a ten ball 
Boy that shit ain't nothin' (that shit ain't nothin')
All my haters, I can't stand y'all
Y'all gotta stop that bluffin' (boy, stop that bluffin')
Ayy, if it ain't 'bout them bands, dawg
Then it ain't no discussion (no discussion)
She so damn thick, can't get her pants off
My bitch got that muffin (she got that muffin, uh)
She can't even get them britches off, my bitch, she too thick (she too thick)
I done ran up so much digits, dawg 
I think I'm too rich (bitch, I'm too rich, yeah)
I swear, I got so many bitches dawg, I can't even pick (I can't even pick)
If we locked in, ain't no switchin', dawg 
Bitch, you gotta stick, yeah (you gotta stick)
Yeah, bitch, I get up on that mic 
And make this shit look easy (make this shit look easy)
Ballin' on these niggas just like Mike 
They need to twenty-three me (boy, twenty-three me)
Niggas steady tryna steal my flow
I think they wanna be me (they tryna be me)
I done ran up so much fuckin' dough, I kinda feel like Beezy (oh, really?)
Diamonds skiing on my chain
I swear this shit look like a blizzard (this shit a blizzard, nigga)
My lil' nigga, he insane, he like to poof shit like a wizard (poof, poof)
He make me mad, I'm quick to cut a bitch off
Like go get the scissors (Go get the scissors)
Bro, don't tell my bitch, but I low-key be fuckin' with her sister, (huh?)

Last name HNDRXX, whatever I do
