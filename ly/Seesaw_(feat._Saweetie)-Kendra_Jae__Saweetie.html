		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Love me, love me not
Either way they always come right back
Fuck me? Nigga, prolly not
No, I don't even see you like that no more
But that's on you, 'cause I never would've turned my back on you
Got the racks on you, shit, I got racks too
I ain't need you but them broke hoes do

'Cause I love too fast, all them damn red flags
But I still can't help but to free fall
And when shit get bad, I get in my bag
But I thought you'd be the one that I could lean on
Now I'm in that gym, got the waist on slim
You can still see that ass with the jeans on
Then you see me out and you send that text, and I don't even respond
'Cause I'm sick of goin'
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw
So I want that, but I don't need that, had it but you blew it 'cause you keep goin'
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw

Uh-huh
Had me goin' in up-down like my scraper
Feelin' dangerous, I thought you was my anchor
But you ain't shit and on some real shit tell me what the problem is
Say he gon' do better but it's always just the opposite
How you fumble with the baddest bitch are you a dumb nigga?
You got nerve sellin' me all these threats when you wrong that's a big trigga
How you figure, ain't the woman that you thought
You was humpin' thots, fuckin' narcissist you just mad you got caught
So what's up now? you only fuckin' with me 'cause I'm up now
I ain't tryna hear that you in love now
Saw me at my lowest now I'm busted down
You feelin' left out

'Cause I love too fast, all them damn red flags
But I still can't help but to free fall
And when shit get bad, I get in my bag
But I thought you'd be the one that I could lean on
Now I'm in that gym, got the waist on slim
You can still see that ass with the jeans on
Then you see me out and you send that text, and I don't even respond
'Cause I'm sick of goin'
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw
So I want that, but I don't need that, had it but you blew it 'cause you keep goin'
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw

You keep goin' up-down, but I know you miss it goin' up-down
You know I was with you when you was down
How you workin' later 'cause I'm up now? Typical
How you lose a real bitch and your mind?
Even let you still hit, like you was mine
We was takin' field trips, I would slide
Now you gotta go and find another one to ride
But maybe I thought that you would change
Maybe, I thought that you was done playin' games
Maybe, I thought you felt the same
But I ain't goin' back and forth I just take the blame

'Cause I love too fast, all them damn red flags
But I still can't help but to free fall
And when shit get bad, I get in my bag
But I thought you'd be the one that I could lean on
Now I'm in that gym, got the waist on slim (hey, yeah)
You can still see that ass with the jeans on
Then you see me out and you send that text, and I don't even respond
'Cause I'm sick of goin' 
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw (up-down)
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw (up-down)
So I want that, but I don't need that, had it but you blew it 'cause you keep goin'
Up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down, up-down seesaw

Saweetie goin' up (free fall)
Pretty bitches know what's up (lean on)
Now I'm in that gym, got the waist on slim (jeans on)
Then you see me out and you send that text, and I don't even respond (K.J yeah)
