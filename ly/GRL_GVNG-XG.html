		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah (ayy, ayy)
A band of hittas, we a different kinda party (kinda party)
The type of crew, don't gotta answer to nobody (nah)
You mess around with us, I promise you'll be sorry
Trust me, trust me
That'd be a big mistake

We go hard every day (we go, we go hard)
Me and my girls ain't here to play (we ain't here to play)
If you ain't tough, can't join the club (can't join the club)
Yeah, we only got room for the baddest (bad)
Made of winners my team go ham with it (go ham, go ham)

Don't you let these pretty faces fool you
Savage underneath (yeah, we so savage)
There's no limit, nothing that we can't do (ah)
Whatever the problem
We know how to solve 'em (yeah, yeah)

Workflow, hustle game
Never pick fights with the girl gang
All of my ladies are fire
Rolling with queens, issa female empire
Workflow, hustle game
Never pick fights with the girl gang
All of my ladies are fire
Rolling with queens, issa female empire

Bow down
Get back
Head down
Get stacks

Bet you can't match these stats
Try to catch up, we stay one step ahead
Bet you can't rack up these checks (yeah, yeah)
Give it a shot but you'll end up finessed
Boom (boom), ha (ha)
Confident chicks with a whole new swagger
Boom (boom), ha (ha)
Level so high gonna need that ladder

We got something extra hot
Yummy, yummy, out the pot (pot)
Rolling deep when we in town
You ain't know, you're learning now
They say, "You so fly, oh, my God"
Crew so tight, they know we on lock
Drip so cold, we stylin' like ice
Crew so bold, we stupid on sight (ayy, ayy)

Don't you let these pretty faces fool you (yeah, yeah)
Savage underneath (underneath)
There's no limit, nothing that we can't do (that we can't do)
Whatever the problem
We know how to solve 'em (yo, do it)

Workflow, hustle game
Never pick fights with the girl gang
All of my ladies are fire
Rolling with queens, issa female empire (yeah, yeah)
Workflow, hustle game
Never pick fights with the girl gang
All of my ladies are fire
Rolling with queens, issa female empire

Heavy hitters
Gang of winners (yeah, yeah)
Put 'em up
Who the realest? (Oh)
Ooh, the way we shine it's always burnin'
Ooh (ready), they gonna see us when we coming (yeah, we coming)

Workflow, hustle game
Never pick fights with the girl gang
All of my ladies are fire
Rolling with queens, issa female empire (oh, yeah)
Workflow, hustle game
Never pick fights with the girl gang
All of my ladies are fire
Rolling with queens, issa female empire

We go hard every day
Me and my girls ain't here to play
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(We be the, we be the) baddest, baddest, yeah
(Only got room for the) baddest, ooh
