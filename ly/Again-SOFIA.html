		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I tend to fill up all my days
It´s not a phase
For so long I've been running a race
I keep the pace to measure up, 
cause if I stop,
I´ll discover that I am not okay, not okay, not okay, not okay, not oka-ay
So I fill up all my days, all my days, all my days, all my days, all my da-ays

When life is unpredictable, I need control, 
so my calender´s usually full
I'm saying yes to everything, 
cause maybe then
they will like me so I say yes again and again and again and again and aga-ain

Oh I feel so overwhelmed, overwhelmed, overwhelmed, overwhelmed, overwhe-elmed
I have so much to do and no motivation
I've been defying my limitations 
I just can't understand why I do this again and aga-ain

So much to do and no motivation
So little time and high expectations
I don't understand
I need a hand, I need a hand, I need a hand

And you show up and tell me: Friend, 
I give you all my love again and again and again and again and aga-ain
You embrace me as I am, as I am, as I am, as I am, as I a-am

I want to let go, face my emotions
No expectations, You take me as I am
You are my Salvation and I will receive your love again
