		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lovers, keep on the road your on
Runners, until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
And I have no doubt
One day we're going to get out

Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
And I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out
