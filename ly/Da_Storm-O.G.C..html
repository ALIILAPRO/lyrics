		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I Be Starang, man I gets wicked on the flows
Its Louieville, you know I pack the bat like so
They call me Top Dog, but better known as D.O
Motherfuckers better act like they know

I can be as good as da best the rest, and be as bad as the worst
So don't test we, D.O. has had it up to here
With those niggas that don't be knowin who we are
Have you lost all your respect for the squad?
If so, y'all bitch ass niggas betta get that shit together
Causee D.O.G. will rain on that ass like the weather
Killin em softly with the words that I be bringin
Leavin them niggas smellin and lookin dead and stinkin
Cause we will, face all the trials and tribulations
So arm yourself cause armageddon is now
Let me show you how these punk ass clowns are goin down
Slowly but surely I won't let y'all niggas fold me
Body bag me, put me on a plate and toe tag me
That'll be emphatically non-cipher
They calll me D.O. because D.O. carries power

I Be starang, I represent the Dreads and the 'fros
I be louieville,you know I represent those that know
I be the Top Dawg, Searchin for the big O
Motherfuckers better act like they know

Suckas be hold up
I fold that ass its Ville Slugga
My niggas say I make a bigga nigga run for cover
Fools get caught up with words don't even make me
Put pine to your spine, now you niggas hate me
For reasons
We bring freezers to heated regions
Troopin through your crew like the PM night demon
Fuck looly gaggin talk comin for ya
Crush that ass to dust, just like sawyer
Beans, leavin scenes uglyer than ben
Green cause it seems niggas can't understand a thing
But this is how we set it
Get your peeps and meet us in the exit
Load those weapons cause this fuckin shit can get hectic

I be starang, rock from your head to your toes
It's quiet riot, number two spots get blown
I be D.O. known for the ten second roll
Moherfuckers better act like they know

Starang
I, shot ya
Lock it down now I got cha
For this jam I am the phantom of the opera
Don't say a word, take it to the streets fuck the props
X marks the spot like Sadat
Starang makes shit hot
Lyrics for days you been warned
Call me thunder, the first one out the storm
Now its on, throats get cut like lawns
My nigga O strong packs the 38 long
Skinny nigga, fuck the muscle I don't tussle
Glock the d-o-g and let him bust you
I crush you, your sayin tough guy bullshit may be
But at times they say starang is crazy
Forget it lets just call it he say her say
Fuck you up in like the worst way
Blow that ass out like candles on your birthday
Brother, make you and your mom-dukes run for cover
So who's the crew runin all through your section
Black smif n wessun connection

I be the Top Dawg to nice up your body
Tell everybody to leave the shottie shake your body
Top Dawg to nice up your party
Tell everybody to leave the shottie shake your body
I be starang, play yourself and catch the sharp elbows
Its louieville slugga, you know I was here but gots to go
Its D.O. and you know I don't give a what
Motherfucks better act like they know, oh
