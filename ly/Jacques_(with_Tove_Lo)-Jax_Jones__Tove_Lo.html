		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask me for my cigarette
Just so he can taste my lips and start to work me
Calculate his every step
Feel his hands around my hips, here comes the head tip
Kiss him in the French way (ooh la la la)
Professionally passionate, head to a private place
So I can reciprocate (ooh la la la)
Let me be an astronaut, locked in your airspace

Je m'appelle Jacques and I love you a lot
I'm with you tonight, but tomorrow I'm not
Je m'appelle Tove, get the show on the road
I'm down for one night, let's go (ooh la la la)

No talking now, pull on my waist (ooh la la la)
'Cause I want you doing bad things to me, to me (ooh la la la)
Always on top, I need a change (ooh la la la)
Come over, I just want your weight on me, on me (ooh la la la)

(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
I just want you on me (Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
I just want you on me (Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)

Yeah, I kinda like the view
On a mission to position myself right underneath you
Boy, that was good for me (ooh la la la)
I don't really do this, but hey, you wanna go again?

Je m'appelle Jacques and I love you a lot
I'm with you tonight, but tomorrow I'm not
Je m'appelle Tove, get the show on the road
I'm down for one night, let's go (ooh la la la)

No talking now, pull on my waist (ooh la la la)
'Cause I want you doing bad things to me, to me (ooh la la la)
Always on top, I need a change (ooh la la la)
Come over, I just want your weight on me, on me (ooh la la la)

(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
I just want you on me (Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
I just want you on me (Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)
(Jacques, Jacques, Jacques)

(Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, just a little
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, just a little
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, just a little
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me)

No talking now, pull on my waist
'Cause I want you doing bad things to me, to me
Always on top, I need a change
Come over, I just want your weight on me, on me

On me
I just want you on me (on me)
Oh yeah, want your loving on, on me
I just want you on me (on me)
Oh yeah, on me
