		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Your love is like a tidal wave, spinning over my head
Drownin' me in your promises, better left unsaid
You're the right kind of sinner to release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around, no, no, no

Your love has set my soul on fire, burnin' out of control
You taught me the ways of desire now it's takin' its toll
You're the right kind of sinner, to release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around, no, no, no

You're the right kind of sinner, to release my inner fantasy
The invincible winner and you know that you were born to be

You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around with me

You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Don't you mess around with me
You're a heartbreaker
Dream maker, love taker
Heartbreaker
