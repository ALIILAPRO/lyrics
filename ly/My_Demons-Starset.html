		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Mayday, mayday)
(The ship is slowly sinking)
(They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling)

They're all around me
Circling like vultures
They wanna break me and wash away my colors
(Wash away my colors)

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh, you make everything okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)
We are one in the same
Oh, you take all of the pain away, away, away (away, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

I cannot stop this sickness taking over
It takes control and drags me into nowhere
I need your help, I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching
I can feel you out there

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh, you make everything okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)
We are one in the same
Oh, you take all of the pain away, away, away (away, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

Take me over the walls below
Fly forever
Don't let me go
I need a savior to heal my pain
When I become my worst enemy
The enemy

Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one in the same
You take all of the pain away

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh, you make everything okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)
We are one in the same
Oh, you take all of the pain away, away, away (away, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh, you make everything okay, okay, okay (okay, okay, okay)
We are one in the same
Oh, you take all of the pain away, away, away (away, away, away)
Save me if I become
My demons
