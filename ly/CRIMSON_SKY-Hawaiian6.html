		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sunset makes a long shadow
on the ground
The shadows of us
and the buildings that stands
And the sunset
will shine on everything
Even the impure heart
and the words
And to all the wrecked
broken dreams of us
It shines on everything
like it's pitying
And it dyes us and
the city we live and
the shadows all in red
The sun will rise
and falls for sure
And what ever happens the rain
will stop someday
The sadness and
old memories will fade away
And one day we all disappear
into the crimson sky
Meet and separate,
comes and goes
Beginning and the ending
Yes, I know
But I lost my precious thing
I had
And my precious one
has gone away from here
I couldn't stop my tears
And I lost myself in the rain

The crowd I see,
the streets we see,
a piece of memory
When I close my eyes
Loneliness is always there
But I still believe
I can get out
Someday I can be strong
Someday I can be strong
Meet and separate,
comes and goes
Beginning and the ending
Yes, I know
But I lost my precious thing
I had
And my precious one
has gone away from here
I couldn't stop my tears in rain
I couldn't stop my tears in rain
I couldn't stop my tears in rain
My tears into the crimson sky
