		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut my hair into a bowl after you told me that you liked it like that
Wish I didn't care at all but now I'm in the mirror with scissors in hand
I saw you at a party, said hello like an old colleague
Talked about the summer when we didn't know each other

Was bound to happen, I suppose, but fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had (had)
And I still want it (I still want it)
Yeah, I still want it bad

Getting used to being alone
But, babe, a house don't mean a home like before, no (ah-ah)
Got a place back in Australia, it's different than you remember
I think you'd like it though (ah-ah)
You touch me in the back seat of the party bus on Tenth Street
Kinda confused me, both a couple drinks in too deep, it

Was bound to happen, I suppose, but fuck me, now I really know
Yeah, I know

I still got it bad
I still got it bad
'Cause you've got what you had (had)
And I still want it (I still want it)
Yeah, I still want it bad

Ah-ah
Ah-ah
We lost what we had (had)
And now I want it (now I want it)
Now I want it back
'Cause you still got it

Still got it
Still got it
