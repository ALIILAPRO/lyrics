		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anyone
Anyone
Anyone
Anyone

You can blame me
Try to shame me
And still I'll care for you

You can run around
Even put me down
Still I'll be there for you

The world
May think I'm foolish
They can't see you
Like I can
Oh but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand

Anyone
Anyone
Anyone

I just feel so sorry (anyone)
For the ones
Who pity me

(Anyone) 'Cause they just don't know
(Anyone) Oh they don't what happiness love can be

I know
I know to ever let you go
Oh, it's more than I could ever stand
Oh, but anyone
Who knows what love is
Will understand

Oh (anyone) they'll understand
(Anyone) If they try love, they'll understand 
(Anyone) Oh, try to understand
