		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You say that I'm your favorite
With your hand between my thighs
Tell me if you were gonna
That I would be the one you tried
So you inch a little closer
Say your boyfriend, he wouldn't mind
You think that I'd be flattered
It's pathetic 'cause you're right

In the PM, all the pretty girls
They have a couple drinks, all the pretty girls
So now, they wanna kiss all the pretty girls
They got to have a taste of a pretty girl
In the AM, all the pretty girls
Act like it never happened in another world
Yeah, it's a blessing and it's a curse
So keep on pretending pretty girl

All the pretty girls

This conversation's classic (classic)
I can predict this shit, line by line
I like a straight jacket
But it feels like it's a little tight
Yeah, your boyfriend's cute
Oh, shit, yeah, he can come too
You'll be his in the morning anyway

In the PM, all the pretty girls
They have a couple drinks, all the pretty girls
So now, they wanna kiss all the pretty girls
They got to have a taste of a pretty girl
In the AM, all the pretty girls
Act like it never happened in another world
Yeah, it's a blessing and it's a curse
So keep on pretending pretty girl (ah)

All the pretty girls (ah)
All the pretty girls (ah-ah)

It's a blessing and it's a curse
So keep on pretending, pretty girl
All the pretty girls 
(Yeah, that bitch is gay)

On pretending, pretty girl
Keep on pretending, pretty girl
Keep on pretending, pretty, pretty
Keep on pretending, pretty girl
All the pretty girls
On pretending, pretty girl
Like, like it never happened in another world
Keep, keep on pretending, pretty girl
