		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I really meant to call you babe
I've been honest on my side
But you can't say the same
Guess you stayed the same , Ooo
I really gotta know
What's been going through your head
Did you really have to do me like that
Like that
Like that

I put my trust in you
Deep rooted trust issues
Missed calls
But I'm still involved , Oooo

Baby where did we go wrong
I don't know
But it feels right
Where did we go wrong
We never should have crossed that line
Where did we go wrong
Baby
Baby
I know I should of seen the signs
Maybe it could work this time

Oooo
Please don't get my feelings misconstrued
Don't fuck up this chance I'm giving you
Can you match everything that I want
Don't get attached
If you do its your fault babe
I miss that thing that you do with your tounge
Ooo, La La La La

I put my trust in you
Deep rooted trust issues
Missed calls
But I'm still involved

Baby where did we go wrong
I don't know but it feels right
Where did we go wrong
We never should of crossed that line
Where did we go wrong
Baby
Baby
I know I should of seen the signs
Maybe it could work this time

Where did we go
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go
Where did we go wrong
