		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Come on) 
I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on) 
We gonna light up the night
(Come on) 
I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on) 
We gonna light up the night

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Can see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna run wild in the middle of the night
Right under the moon, bodies glowing in the night
Nothing in between our skins but the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm

The night-time 
Is the right time

I wanna dance in the dark 
And never stop
We gonna light up the night 
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound 
Don't be alarmed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dancing in the dark
I wanna dance in the dark 
And never stop
We gonna light up the night 
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound 
Don't be alarmed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dancing in the dark

Underdogs dance in the middle of the night
Out here with the stars like the creatures of the night
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm
I wanna dance, dance in the middle of the night
And see the night skies in the mirror of your eyes
If you don't dance make sure you got the rhythm
Make sure that your heartbeat beats with the rhythm

The night-time 
Is the right time

I wanna dance in the dark 
And never stop
We gonna light up the night 
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound 
Don't be alarmed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dancing in the dark
I wanna dance in the dark 
And never stop
We gonna light up the night 
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound 
Don't be alarmed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dancing in the dark

I wanna dance in the dark
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night 
(Come on)
I wanna dance in the dark 
(Come on)
We gonna light up the night

I wanna dance in the dark 
And never stop
We gonna light up the night 
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound 
Don't be alarmed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dancing in the dark
I wanna dance in the dark 
And never stop
We gonna light up the night 
Like shooting stars
Whenever you hear the sound 
Don't be alarmed
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Dancing in the dark
