		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I just wanna say from the bottom of me heart
I'd like to take this chance to apologize (fifty seconds now)
To absolutely nobody
The double champ does what the fuck he wants

Uh, woo, aye, 'bout to go stupid again
She out the roof of the Benz
I'm 'bout to do it to get her
I'ma fuck two of her friends (aye)
Just made a flip out the wok
Fuck the Frank Mueller
I'll jump out the jeweler again
I fucked my money up on a re-up
But I got it right back and I blew it again (bitch, ah, woo)

Uh, aye, pack full of bricks
Back selling nicks like Ewing again
Trap ain't bump like this since '06 
Soulja Boy shit, start you'ing again (ah, you)
Clear it out
Grrt, stick 'em
Air it out
Brrt, flip 'em
Whereabouts?
I ain't never 'bout to give 'em
Fair amounts?
I ain't never finna hit 'em with
Tripling and double up the stash
Quarter brick, another half
And I got another twenty on the vigilant
Spatula flipping it, a caddie from the kitchen
I would hustle 'til the car came with another brick in it
Crib came with another bitch in it
If you ain't getting litty with the shitty
I'ma put another bitch in it
Bitch better hit me with "D-Troat" (oh)
And no I ain't talking about Michigan (woo-hoo)
Aye, oh, uh, damn, shit
I'm going stupid and shit (woo)
She played the flute with my dick, wrist sick
I got the flu on a bitch (woo)
I play it cool on a bitch
Hit it, stick, that's how I do on ya bitch (ugh)
What I'ma do in this bitch?
Pussy was great, flew out and flew in this bitch (they're great)
.40 it's shining and shining
Way in the hills I'm high in the climate
Niggas is tricking and niggas is simpin'
Paying for heels and wining and dining
Jewish lawyer's on the phone call
I said I'ma sign that lil' shit when I sign it
I got these Benjamin Frank on my body
Ain't finna fuck if that shit ain't exotic
(Woo) ten trap phones 'cause the bitch keep on calling (calling)
Sleeping on the floor, I been scamming getting it all in (all in)
Do the money dance when the money fall (when the money fall)
Nigga fuck my ex, I'm un-involved
You could suck my dick and lick a nut too (woo)
Yeah, you don't like me nigga, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
(Fuck you nigga)

Damn, he running through all this paper
That's what I do to a hater
Don't touch two things
My hair and my paper (woo)
Passing that bitch and she hot
Pass her like hot potato
I grind, I skate her (uh)
If she look good, I might date her
Pussy was good and I ate her
Lil' bitch I'm major (woo)

Wait, hold the fuck up, hold the fuck up, hold up
So we both at the function, you know what I'm sayin'?
You pull up with ya bitch in a 458
I pull up with my bitch in a 488
You pull up beside my shit like 
"Yo, what's the difference between my 458 and your 488?"
It's 'bout like eighty to a hundred thousand cocksucker, beat it

Woo, aye, 'bout to go stupid again
She out the roof of the Benz
I'm 'bout to do it to get her
I'ma fuck two of her friends
Just made a flip out the wok
Fuck the Frank Mueller
I'll jump out the jeweler again
I fucked my money up on a re-up
But I got it right back and I blew it again

Ah-ha-ha
And we don't wanna hear no sucker shit after this shit either, nigga
Know what I'm sayin'?
Oh, you worried about your bitch?
Yeah, yeah she's here
Namsayin'?
Oui-oui, parlez-vous fran√ßais and all that good shit
Straight off the run way in Paris nigga
I could give ten fucks about a bitch (fucks about a bitch)
