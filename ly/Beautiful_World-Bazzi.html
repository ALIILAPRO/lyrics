		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I've been thinking
We've been missing out on knowing us
(Searching the world, I've been searching the world)
I've had my reasons to believe in
Something bigger than us
Yeah

Hey
I could show you the world
This beautiful world
You can know
Hey
I could show you the world
This beautiful world
So unknown

Got a spot out in London, I'll show it to you
Trips out to Paris, let's stop by the Louvre
Post up in cafes, smoke cigarettes with you
And we'll look at the locals and guess what they do
Girl, I been here before, but with you it feel new
You're looking at art, and I'm looking at you
What a beautiful sight (yeah, yeah)
Seeing the world through your eyes, yeah, yeah

(Hey) Hey
I could show you the world (I could show you the world)
This beautiful world (this beautiful world)
You can know
Hey
I could show you the world
This beautiful world
So unknown
