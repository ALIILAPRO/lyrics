		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I'm coming home
London in the rain
Driving real slow in the fast lane
Feeling kinda stressed
Tryna get drunk
Problem with the rich kids is that they're no fun

Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how sad this life can be

Driving through the clouds
Picking all the bad ones out the crowd
Had a bad month
Had a bad year
Had a bad time getting over my fears

Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how

I don't wanna talk about my problems
I don't wanna tell another lie
I don't wanna write another love song
I don't wanna even fucking try
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody

Right now I'm flying
So come and take a shot at me
Not scared of dying
It's sad how sad this life can be
