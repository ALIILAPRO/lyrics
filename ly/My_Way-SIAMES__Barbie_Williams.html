		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  WAIT! I DIDN'T NEED YOU ADVICE
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF RESPECT
I HAVE TO TRY IT FOR MYSELF SOMEDAY
AND MAYBE I'LL MAKE SOME MISTAKES
BUT I'M TAKING MY LIFE IN MY HANDS

OH, I'M BETTER THIS WAY, 
MY WAY!
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
SO PLEASE STOP PRETENDING!

HEY! IT'S NOT A FOOL'S PARADISE
I'LL HAVE TO LEARN TO WALK AGAIN
WHATEVER TAKES TO FIND MY PLACE AND PACE
SO YES I'LL MAKE SOME MISTAKES
BUT I'M TAKING MY LIFE IN MY HANDS

OH, I'M BETTER THIS WAY, MY WAY!
NO, I WON'T TURN AWAY UNTIL I SAY 
OH I'M BETTER THIS WAY, MY WAY!
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
SO PLEASE STOP PRETENDING!

STEP BY STEP
THE AIR I'M BREATHING
HOLDING ON THE WORLD I'M DREAMING
CAUSE I DECIDE THE WAY I LIVE MY LIFE

OH, I'M BETTER THIS WAY, MY WAY!
NO, I WON'T TURN AWAY UNTIL I SAY 
OH I'M BETTER THIS WAY, MY WAY!
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
SO PLEASE STOP PRETENDING!
