		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Beauty queen goddess
I remember what you taught us
And I know it's been a while
But I'm tired of being honest
I just really need you now
I just need a safe bet
I just need to cozy up i just need to forget
And time, just really want time
Aye a million thoughts
And they're runnin' through my mind
And so and so although I know
How she gonna love
Old beauty comin' back home

Beauty, baby imma go crazy
You turnin' me into a fiend
I just wanna doze off lately
I wanna feel hazy oh it's so so sweet
But baby leave me beauty, baby
Imma go crazy you turnin' me into a fiend
I just wanna doze off lately
I wanna feel hazy oh it's so so sweet
But baby leave me

You know that feeling when you miss so much
Your stomach's in a knot
You know that pinpoint ain't exacto
When you started with this thought
But like a cape to me became a great to me
We always talked when everybody hated me
You see
All my friends they're tryin' to be
What mom and dad spent time to see
But you and me we never went home
I never was alone
I've seen some beauty never known

I remember back then, oh
Back then when the high was free
Beauty, baby i'm a little hazy
Please don't come to me miss beauty queen
I remember back then, oh
Back then when the high was free
Beauty, baby i'm a little hazy
Please don't come to me miss beauty queen

Beauty, baby imma go crazy
You turnin' me into a fiend
I just wanna doze off lately
I wanna feel hazy oh it's so so sweet
But baby leave me beauty, baby
Imma go crazy you turnin' me into a feign
I just wanna doze off lately
I wanna feel hazy oh it's so so sweet
But baby leave me
