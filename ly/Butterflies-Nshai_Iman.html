		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you really love me darling
Shower me with love in the morning
Even your kiss goodbye
Oh, it gives me butterflies
And I know I can't help it
That you are my main addiction
You get me so, so high
Oh, it gives me butterflies
Yeah, you give me butterflies

Baby
How'd you get a hold of me
I must be lucky
To have you be my side
I can't even lie
Cause the way you treat me
Oh it's like a queen babe
Clingin' on you like a magnet babe
I can't even lie
Love so enticing
How you draw me in
Every conversation is so intimate
Had me falling from the beginning
Strong feelings for you, even back then
Loving every minute
Every interaction is so heaven sent and
With you, I feel no disconnection
Our love in the right direction

If you really love me darling
Shower me with love in the morning
Even your kiss goodbye
Oh, it gives me butterflies
And I know I can't help it
That you are my main addiction
You get me so, so high
Oh, it gives me butterflies
Yeah, you give me butterflies

Yeah, you give me butterflies
