		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayo, model bitches in my section, one ho tried to touch me
Told that bitch don't press your luck, you lucky if you suck me
You ain't never live like me, get praises by the junkies
You ain't never live like me, split Chi-Chi's with your bunky
Tasteless nigga, CC's all on me and still look bummy
All this BB on me, oversized I'm lookin' husky
Choppin' bricks like Cobra Kai, Hermes plate lookin' dusty
I knew I can get a hundred when the plug wife hugged me
Kissed me on both cheeks and said "Westside you look like money"

Fishbowl on the Maybach truck, sippin' Ace while it's jumpy
Mclaren Road, in a McLaren Road
You niggas is food, see me fashion week June
I'm not in the mood, bitch don't fuck up my groove
I fuck 'em in twos, look at my jewels
Studs on Balenci' crocs, look at the shoes
I don't even got no opps, we put 'em on snooze
Still use a fork in the pot and hundred round tools
Still use a lock in a sock, we sellin' that dope

Model bitches in my section, one ho tried to touch me
Told that bitch don't press your luck, you lucky if you suck me
You ain't never live like me, get praises by the junkies
You ain't never live like me, split Chi-Chi's with your bunky
Tasteless nigga, CC's all on me and still look bummy
All this BB on me, oversized I'm lookin' husky
Choppin' bricks like Cobra Kai, Hermes plate lookin' dusty
I knew I can get a hundred when the plug wife hugged me

Wizard OZs, G's could laid a brick road out Kentucky
Led me to the D, pull up from 3 like Rodney Stuckey
How you sleep at night knowing you sheist, I tell 'em comfy
Like to bum no pants when we in the field, should've played Rugby
Ain't no need to love me, love cost pain I think it's dumpy
Jump out on a lame and said my name, my aim ain't Rusty
You gon' see God, you punch me, knockin' bows like Muggsy
I'm the shit niggas can't flush me, let me thug how I be thuggin'
All my whips is luxury, this your first time seeing it 'cause me
My mom made a gangsta, so a gangsta how her son be
Taught me keep my banger, know it's haters want her son bleed
Told him I'm a snake him, so it's his fault if he trust me
