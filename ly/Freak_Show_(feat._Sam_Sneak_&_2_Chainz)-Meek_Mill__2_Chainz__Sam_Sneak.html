		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All a nigga want is some mouth and lip service
All a nigga want is some mouth and lip service
Suck a nigga dick ho, suck a nigga dick ho
I got a stack for the freak show, I got a stack for the freak show
Suck a nigga dick ho, suck a nigga dick ho
I got a stack for the freak show, I got a stack for the freak show

Uh, shorty on a molly, um prolly
I'm ridin' with my niggas and we finna catch a body
I check into the telly, you just meet me in the lobby
Throw the horses on my portions and the horse on my Ferrari like
Vroom bitch, vroom-vroom bitch
That DOA, they got sweepin' with the broom bitch
I'm talkin murda on that pussy, I'm a goon bitch
You spend the night, you make it home by afternoon bitch
Move quick, that go a rack
Bust it ho, you gotta boyfriend
But we like fuck him though
But you tell me he a sucka though
Tellin' me listen I done suck a nigga dick or something, bitch

Suck a nigga dick ho, Bitch
Suck a nigga dick ho
I got a stack for the freak show
I got a stack for the freak show
All a nigga want is some of that lip service
All a nigga want is some of that lip service

2 Chainz in these chains in this bitch, ho
Let me rephrase it
2 Chainz in your bitch ho, bustin' over instrumentals
Bust that pussy that pimples
Bustin' like pistols, fuck it
I'm bustin' that simple (Tell 'em)
I'm getting head while i'm ridin'
Chauffeur drivin'
If you turn around man your gonna get fired
All I spit is fire like a dragon
I love new pussy, I should've kept the tag on
Born to win and I'm built to last
When I had the rock, I used to give em glass
Uh, In the bank like I'm finna laugh
And when I left, all you see is some dealer tag, Leggo

Suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, suck a dick ho
Yea, I got a stack for the freak show
I got a stack for the freak show
Yea, suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, I got a stack for the freak show
I got a stack for the freak show
All a nigga want is some of that lip service
All a nigga want is some of that lip service

Yeah, oh, I take ATL DOA, MIA it's KOD
When you hear them albums back
I'll be going straight OD
Straight OD, straight OG, you know that I ball ho
I got these bitches looking for me, you should call me Waldo
I tell er to bust it open, bust it like a hog ho
Throw the money in the air, something very far though
Did I leave? Did I leave?
My new chicken got my speed
I be getting ball player money like I'm in the league
In the league, all I want is lip service
I could kill that pussy, all you bitches gettin' murdered
Swerving I bet they say
Top off and no toupee
These haters say I'm too baked
'Cause I be swaggin' hot new J's

Suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, I got a stack for the freak show
What?
I got a stack for the freak show
Yea, suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, suck a nigga dick ho
Yea, I got a stack for the freak show
What?
I got a stack for the freak show
All a nigga want is some of that lip service
All a nigga want is some of that lip service
