		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It isn't working
I'm a tidal wave of question marks
And you're just surfing
Leaning into me like it's an art

It's so crazy
Lately
You just understand my feelings
Make me
See I'm capable and fine
And feeling beautified tonight
I'm ready to dive

Maybe it's the loving in your eyes (I'm here, see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine (I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive

'Cause the water's warm
And nothing wrong, it's alright, yeah
I'm coming out and diving in tonight
I feel like It's crazy
Lately, you just understand my feelings
Make me see I'm capable and fine
And feeling beautified tonight
I'm ready to dive

Maybe it's the loving in your eyes (I'm here, see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine (I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive

Diving into you, diving into me (hmm)
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep, I'm
Diving into you, diving into me (hmm)
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep, I'm
Diving into you, diving into me
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep, I'm
Diving into you, diving into me

Maybe it's the loving in your eyes (I'm here, see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine (I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive (right into you)
I'm ready to dive (right into you)

Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall, I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive
