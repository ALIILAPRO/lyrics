		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Somebody let me know
You re always there for me
There for me
Hey June
Hey June it’s me,
Sometimes I think of you
You come out of the time
Hey June
Hey June, I’m here
Memories bring back to you
Everything stayed the same
I remember
When you looked at me
When we were so young
I remember
When the sun has gone
When we fade away
Somebody let me know
You re always there for me
There for me
No matter what they say
We'll see the deep blue sea
Deep blue sea
Oh memories
Memories hurt somedays
And they go away
Oh memories
I know I'm not alone
I'm still with your soul
Somebody let me know
You re always there for me
There for me
No matter what they say
We'll see the deep blue sea
Deep blue sea
