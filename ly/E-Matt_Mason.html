		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got home from Wichita a couple days before I thought
Didn't recognize the truck parked in my drive
My boots hit the hardwood floor
Busted through the bedroom door
Guess I must've caught you by surprise
By the time he got his buckle on
I hit the safe and grabbed my gun
You were beggin' me with tears in your eyes
Screamin', "Baby, let him go, you don't want that on your soul"
I said, "A man is gonna die tonight"

I'm chasin' taillights
Straight as the crow flies
Huntin' justice down a country road
I've got a shotgun, it's ridin' shotgun
And we're both fixin' to unload
Son, I know what you done
There's only one way to outrun me
You better pray your tank don't beat mine to E

Just blew past the county line
The needle's pushin' ninety-five
I'm on you like a shadow, move for move
All you see is my headlights
I see the whites in your eyes
That fear, mirrored in your rearview
Go ahead and ride the gas
Don't think that you're livin', man 
Just 'cause you make it past Dead Man's Curve
Man, as far as I can tell we might both end up in Hell
But you're sure as hell goin' first

I'm chasin' taillights
Straight as the crow flies
Huntin' justice down a country road
I've got a shotgun, it's ridin' shotgun
And we're both fixin' to unload
Son, I know what you done
There's only one way to outrun me
You better pray your tank don't beat mine to E

I'm chasin' taillights
Straight as the crow flies
Huntin' justice down a country road
I've got a shotgun, it's ridin' shotgun
And we're both fixin' to unload
Son, I know what you done
There's only one way you can outrun me
You better pray your tank don't beat mine to E
