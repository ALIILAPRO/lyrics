		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah

Life can take you higher
then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo
Life can take you higher
'Til you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
Kinda like a yo-yo
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)

One minute I feel shit (shit)
Next minute I'm the shit (the shit, uh)
It get under my skin (yeah)
Kinda just like a tick
Some people make me sick (mhm)
I'ma just bite my fists (my fists)
I'ma just wet my wrist (my wrist, yeah)
Fuck a nigga 'til he limp (goodnight)
This doesn't need a caption (no-no)
I'm a real bitch, you half one (ahh)
Hate all you want, lil' bitch, these bands I got
You won't get a fraction
I'm sorry that you're lost boy (lost)
I'ma go down like Jackson (like Jack', like)
Hooks on hooks on hooks like ay (yeah)
You wanna just call me captain

Life can take you higher
then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo
Life can take you higher
'Til you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
Kinda like a yo-yo
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)

Y'all ain't shit but I flush
Why you wanna eat my dust?
Everybody wanna gets my crush
That's somethin' y'all need to discuss
I gave these bitches they flowers, ayy
Now they can suck one thousand eggs
I sip too much Powerade
Now I'm like, "Muhfucker, bow to me"
I'on give a fuck 'bout a fake fan
Sayin' you mad, you proud of me
While y'all asses up in arms
Don't forget to go down on me
Bitch have a seat in a ottoman
Y'all hoes mad you ain't got a man
You missin' out on all the fun (yeah)
Muhfucker, you could die today

Life can take you higher
then you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
Kinda like a yo-yo
Life can take you higher
'Til you're feelin' low-low
That you gon' go up and down
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
Kinda like a yo-yo
(Up and down-down, up and down, up and down)
