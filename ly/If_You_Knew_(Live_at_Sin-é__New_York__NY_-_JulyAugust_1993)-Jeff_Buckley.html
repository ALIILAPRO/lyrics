		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you knew how I miss you,
You would not stay away today.
Don't you know how I need you?
Stay here, my dear, with me.

I need you here beside me,
Forever and a day, a day.
Together, never parted,
Just you, just me, my love.

I can't go on without you.
Your love is all I?m living for.
I love all things about you.
Your heart, your soul, my love.

I can't go on without you,
Forever and a day, a day.
I need you here beside me,
Forever and a day, a day.
And no one else besides me.
I love you, I love you, I do.
I do.
