		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Those were the times we had
Sharing a joy that we thought would last
Memories of love and affection
Never really was just like a dream
Was it the simple things
That made me so crazy about you
Was it your charm or your passion
It's not hard to believe
I love you and I need you so I

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Did we give up too soon
Maybe we needed just a little room
Wondering how it all happened
Maybe we just need a little time
Though we did end as friends
Given the chance we could love again
She'll always love you forever
It's not hard to believe
I want you and I need you so I

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
Forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
Forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
Baby please forget me not
Sending you forget me nots
Baby please forget me not

Sending you forget me nots
To help me to remember
Baby please forget me not
I want you to remember

Sending you forget me nots
To help you to remember (help you to remember)
