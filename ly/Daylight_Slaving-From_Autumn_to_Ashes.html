		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rising and spiraling
Then vanish in the wind
I can't tell where the land
Ends and they sky begins
Are you acquainted with
The threat of being killed
Are you conversing with pigeons on the windowsill
And every battle has been fought
And everything I think was thought
Down and down we've descended
Every day keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves start getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
Patronize pedestrian
With no sense of direction
I am lost and can't ask a question
Rising and spiraling
They vanish in the wind
I can't tell when the land
Ends and the sky begins
This city truly is assaulting my senses
Unkempt unruly devour defenseless
Occupant if poverty build character
And spoils breed arrogance
Id rather consort with the low and the decadent
Every battle has been fought
Everything I think had been thought
Down and down we've descended
Everyday keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves keep getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
Patronize pedestrian
With no sense of direction
I am lost and can't ask a question
You'd better have the strength
Of the wandering aimless
With an audience of the most prestigious
Do you have the strain to love the one
You came with
I hope you have the strength
Were in the belly of
Every battle has been fought
Everything I think has been thought
Down and down we've descended
Every day keeps getting shorter
As my sleeves start getting longer
And the sidewalks overflow
Patronize pedestrian
With no sense of direction
I am lost and can't ask a question
