		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Living in a day
Trying to keep it sane
On my mind
Living life
Sitting on a lake
Breathing in my space
Out of touch
This is kind of nice

All this time I've been colorblind
Feeling like I'm out of line
Giving every part of my love
All this time I've been fighting tears
Maybe get a little therapy
Changing who I want to be
I've been missing out

Take a little time if you got to go
This is what it feels like
Give a little kindness to yourself
Sometimes it just feels like

I'm living in a way
Making everything make sense
On my mind
I'm learning life
I'm getting in my face
I'm donе falling, falling, falling, falling
I think I've had enough
I think I've had еnough

All this time I've been colorblind
Feeling like I’m out of line
Giving every part of my love
And all this time I've been fighting tears
Maybe get a little therapy
Changing who I want to be
I've been missing out

Take a little time if you got to go
This is what it feels like
Give a little kindness to yourself
Sometimes it just feels like
