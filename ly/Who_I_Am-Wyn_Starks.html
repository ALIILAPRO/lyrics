		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been closing the door
All my life held it in, but not anymore
Got two feet on the floor
This is it
I'm stronger than ever before

Pardon my imposition
But this is my conviction
I need to get this off my mind

I gotta be me
Gotta be I
Gotta be who I know I am inside
Can finally breathe, taking it in, look at me flying

It's always been there, it just took me a minute to find it
If I were to be anybody else, I'd just be hiding
Who I am
Who I am

Lookin' back, back on a little boy
Never gave him a chance to ever be more
I didn't love him but I'm gonna love him right now and forever
It's time to push open the door

Pardon my imposition
But this is my conviction
Ain't nothing left to hold me down, no

Gotta be me
Gotta be I
Gotta be who I know I am inside
Can finally breathe, taking it in, look at me flying

It's always been there, it just took me a minute to find it
If I were to be anybody else, I'd just be hiding
Who I am
Who I am

It's always been there, it just took me a minute to find it
Who I am

Oh, oh, whoa-whoa-whoa

Gotta be me
Gotta be I
Gotta be who I know I am inside
Can finally breathe, taking it in, look at me flying

It's always been there, it just took me a minute to find it
If I were to be anybody else, I'd just be hiding
Who I am
Who I am

It's always been there, it just took me a minute to find it
Who I am, yeah
