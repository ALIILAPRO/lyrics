		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wait for your life, for your life
The time is right, don't wait
For your life, for your life
Sometimes gotta try
Gotta fight
For what you want, don't wait
For you life, for your life

Never stop forgetting who you are

Jaded, feeling like you're out of mind
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
Even after all this time
Jaded, don't you wanna feel alive?
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
I believe the dream will never die

See all the signs, what a sight
Like September rain when it falls in the night
Don't wait for your life, for your life
Like September rain
Sometimes gotta fight

Jaded, feeling like you're out of mind
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
Even after all this time
Jaded, don't you wanna feel alive?
I believe, I believe, I believe in you 
I believe the dream will never die

Jaded, what you thinking?
Faded all the time
Jaded, what you thinking?
(Come back to reality)
Jaded, what you thinking?
Faded all the time
Jaded, what you thinking?

Waiting and waiting
But it's all in your head

Jaded, feeling like you're out of mind
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
Even after all this time
Jaded, don't you wanna feel alive
I believe, I believe, I believe in you
I believe the dream will never die
