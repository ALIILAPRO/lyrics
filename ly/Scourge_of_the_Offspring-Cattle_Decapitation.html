		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hell hath wrought upon this earth
From the desires of the patriarch
To carry thine name unto the dawn
A hapless spawn to go on and on and on

A swift and deadly virus has once again emerged
Blessed upon humankind to control the surge
We are the scourge

One more host to transmit death
One more ghost shaped from my breath
Human beings they never learn
Even as their houses burn

We are infections
We are pathogens
We are assassins
The gluttonous factions
Curve never flattens
When the population fattens

What a wondrous life this would have been
But I'm outnumbered
Like the stars at night
There's so many of us
That need to die
Like a swarm of flies
There's too many of us

We came to destroy
We're alive to cause abject suffering
The troops are deployed
Ultimately, unanimously outnumbering

Live to feast upon everything
Feed to dilapidate our surroundings
Enveloped by kindred societies
Evil, corrupt heterogeneities

From the pupa to a nymph
Molting each stage of our lives 'til cold and stiff
Now thriving terrasites, dramatic shift
Now as a parasite humanity persists

What a wondrous life this would have been
But I'm outnumbered
Like the stars at night
There's so many of us
That need to die
Like a swarm of flies
There's too many of us
We need to die
Can this vengeance please be mine?

A virus emerged
To control the surge
A virus emerged
We become the scourge
