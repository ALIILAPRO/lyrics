		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Little boy in a hurry to find his answers
And then I grew up, man I fell hard
But there was never a battle for redemption
Just a trickle trickle, while I wait on the side of the road, yeah
Just a trickle trickle, while I wait on the side of the road, yeah

Pieces of you, pieces of me, last September
And I said way oh, oh let 'em go yeah
Forever never was your favorite answer
And I said way oh, oh let 'em go yeah
And I said way oh, oh let 'em go yeah

Oh, oh give me life
Or give me death in the middle of the night
Oh, won't you give me life

Runner runner, tell me all your secrets
From above me, I can feel the distance now
There was never a promise of tomorrow
You made a decision, just like I asked you to, love
You made a decision, just like I knew you'd do, love

Oh, oh give me life
I can see your light
Don't look away, oh if you do love I might not last the night

Oh, oh give me life
Oh, oh give me life
Oh, oh give me life
