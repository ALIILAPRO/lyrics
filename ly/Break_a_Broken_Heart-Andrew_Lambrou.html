		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The lights went out
I hit the ground
You didn't mind that I was bleeding out
You filled my life
With minor songs
I loved you but you loved to do me wrong
I miss your kiss, gasoline and a matchstick
Red Lights, flashes, rising out of the ashes
I see you
For who you are
But you can't break a broken heart

You lift me up and leave me in the gutter
You tear me up and move on to another
I'm torn apart but I am a survivor
You can't, you can't break a broken heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't break a broken heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

An all-time low
But I get by
And over you I'll find the highest high
You did your best
To do your worst
I got used to all the ways it hurt
Feel the fever telling me that I need her
Science fiction turning into an addiction
I see you
For who you are
But you can't break a broken heart

You lift me up and leave me in the gutter
You tear me up and move on to another
I'm torn apart but I am a survivor
You can't, you can't break a broken heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't break a broken heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, I miss your kiss, gasoline and a matchstick
Red lights, flashes, rising from the ashes
You lift me up and leave me in the gutter
Tear me up and move on to another
I'm torn apart but I am a survivor
You can't break a
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

You can't break a broken heart
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't, you can't break a broken heart
You can't, you can't, you can't break a broken heart
You can't, you can't break a broken heart
You can't
You can't break a broken heart
