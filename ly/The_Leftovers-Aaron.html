		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wasted and tired
Oh I'm so wasted and tired
We've lost the game
Dropped the case and said goodbye
Wasted and tired
Four letters of pure joy and sorrow
You gave me the big waves, mysterious heart
Oh I regret nothing, nothing
Still my heart is beating
Still my eyes do see

Strangers disguised as lovers
Same skin, but different feeling
We come and we're gone
Alone in the crowd
Would I ever feel so lonely
You tell me, if I knew how do to fly?
I-I-I, I-I, I-I, I'll walk over you
And on the things we'd do, I'll dream alone
No matter the storms and the leftovers
Our leftovers maybe
I-I-I, I-I, I-I, I'll dream of you
And on the things we'd do, I'll walk alone
No matter the storms and the leftovers
Our leftovers maybe

Western eyes
What will you look at now?
This whispering city
Leads me to the gate of wanders
Where are we now?
For we're nothing but tumbleweeds lost
I've never liked any cage
It's tattooed on my skin

And I'm a hard believer, believe it
Still my heart is beating
Still my eyes do see
Strangers disguised as lovers
The same skin, but different feeling
We come and we're gone
Alone in the crowd
Would I ever feel so lonely
You tell me, if I knew how do to fly?
I-I-I, I-I, I-I, I'll walk over you
And on the things we'd do, I'll dream alone
No matter the storms and the leftovers
Our leftovers maybe
I-I-I, I-I, I-I, I'll dream of you
And on the things we'd do, I'll walk alone
No matter the bittersweet leftovers
Our leftovers maybe

The bittersweet leftovers
The bittersweet leftovers, our leftovers maybe
