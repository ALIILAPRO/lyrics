		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hold out
I’ll be right there
Feel like I’ve been only
Inside where I hold it
Good find while I call
How long are you waiting?
Tell that I’ve been off
Look by, under-felt
Good for making more

Come down and waste with me
All you can wait and see
You never liked me

And I’m so tired I’m barely here at all
So un-required the feelings I control
On the side, I never want to know
Goodbye

Come down and waste with me
All you can wait and see
You never liked me
Come down and waste with me
All you can wait and see
You never liked me
