		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play me through the stereo
Hold me on the dance floor (all night)
Take me to your Avalon
Nobody needs to come along
Just come alone

Play me through the stereo (ooh)
Hold me on the dance floor (all night)
Take me to your Avalon (ooh)
Nobody needs to come along 
Just come alone (ooh)

Seconds go by, look into your eyes
You're slowing down a little just to catch this high
Oh, fell for you
On a Sunday night
You dance till the morning
Now it's one more time, yeah

Where you wanna land?
Drop into Havanas or France
End it with a glass
Hoping you would see through this trance

Play me through the stereo (ooh)
Hold me on the dance floor (all night)
Take me to your Avalon (ooh)
Nobody needs to come along
Just come alone (ooh)

We're just in time to catch the party at the Vogue
Ignoring all the whispers, you run me through the show
You take a glance at me 
An everlasting dream (yeah)
Don't wake me from this moment

Where you wanna land?
Drop into Havanas or France
End it with a glass
Hoping you would see through this trance

Play me through the stereo (ooh)
Hold me on the dance floor (all night)
Take me to your Avalon (ooh)
Nobody needs to come along 
Just come alone (ooh)

Are we ready to risk it all?
Are you ready to risk it all?
Are we ready to risk it all?
I'll be ready to risk it all
Risk it all for you
My hands are out
So take me now

Play me through the stereo
Hold me on the dance floor (all night)
Take me to your Avalon (ooh)
Nobody needs to come along (ooh)
Just come alone (ooh)
