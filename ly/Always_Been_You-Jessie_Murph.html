		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it feels like it's one-sided
Like some type of unrequited love
I keep it dark, I keep it quiet
But then you come around and light me up

Usually I ain't the type to stay up all damn night thinking 'bout someone else
It's hard to be fine when your heart's on the line 
And the truth is I'm going through hell

'Cause in my head, it's always been you
Heart in my hands, hopeless 'cause no one can take it from you
You
I tried rewriting this hundreds of times
But if it ain't you, it's a lie
Yeah, in my head
It's always been you
You

I've been tripping, I've been sliding
I'm under water like Poseidon
Taking up space like a hyphen
You're on my mind and I can't fight it
Yeah

Sick of playing games with myself
Sick of playing like there's someone else

'Cause in my head, it's always been you
Heart in my hands, hopeless 'cause no one can take it from you
You
I tried rewriting this hundreds of times
But if it ain't you, it's a lie
Yeah, in my head
It's always been you
You

Usually I ain't the type to stay up all damn night thinking 'bout someone else
It's hard to be fine when your heart's on the line 
And the truth is I'm going through hell
