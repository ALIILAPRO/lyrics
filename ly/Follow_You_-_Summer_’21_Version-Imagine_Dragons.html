		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You know, you know, you know

You know, you know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Takin' those, takin' those losses if it treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night, oh, you know it's not right

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night, oh, you know it's not right

I'll follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

She's not the type to give herself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here comin' through)

I'll follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

La-da-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da, you know I'll follow you
La-da-da-da-da-da, wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you
