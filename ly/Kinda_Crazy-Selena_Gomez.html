		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hey, you started out sweeter than hard candy
Words were like licorice to the taste
But slowly, all the sugar, it went to waste
Went to waste

Oh, you started getting funny with no jokes
I started seeing through you like a ghost
And now I'm pretty sure I can't take no more
I can't take no more

I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're acting super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodging phone calls lately
But still texting me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

You've been lying just for fun
Luckily no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Oh-hoh
Oh-hoh, hmm-hmm
Oh-hoh
Oh-hoh, hmm-hmm

Hey, you're the one who started talkin' to me
Made the move, asked me to be your bae
And now you're treating me like I'm insane
You're insane

I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're acting super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodging phone calls lately
But still texting me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

You've been lying just for fun
Luckily no damage done
But now I see you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Oh-ho
Oh-ho, hmm-hmm
Oh-ho
Oh-ho, hmm-hmm

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, yeah, yeah
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah, hey-yeah
Hey-yeah, hey-yeah

I think you're kind of crazy
And not the good kind, baby
'Cause you're acting super shady
You know it, you know it
Been dodging phone calls lately
But still texting me, "Baby"
Yeah, I think you're kind of crazy
You know it, you know it

Oh-ho
Oh-ho, hmm-hmm
Oh-ho
Oh-ho, hmm-hmm

(Hmm, I don't know)
