		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Most of them gon' talk, I know, I know
Most of them gon' fall, I know, I know
We gon' bet it all, I know
We gon' bet it all, I know

Power girl, I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna, power girl
You been runnin' through my section all day
You been runnin' through my mind all day
All day, all day, all day, all day, yeah, uh

Somethin' in the way you move
Radion beams castin' vibrant views
Pick me up when I fall down and out
Dust me off and show me all truth
Show me that I'll never fly alone
I fucked up so many times, but I still have you
Show me how you do it like that
Carryin' a brother is not easy on your back

I know most of them gon' talk, I know, I know
Most of them gon' fall, I know, I know
We gon' bet it all, I know-ow-ow
We gon' bet it all, I know-ow

Power girl, I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways (wanna know, wanna know)
I really wanna, power girl
You been runnin' through my section all day
You been runnin' through my mind all day
All day, all day, all day, all day, yeah, uh

Your body and your mind is your contribution
I'm here to give you love and never lose ya (lose)
Power girl, power girl
If I had you, I'd travel right here for you
Power girl, power girl
Let me show you what it do, ayy
Workin' on me and you all day (all day)
Makin' sure what we have is safe
Doin' it all
She's over the city (she's over the city)
She go there if she been there (she go there if she been there)
I'm only one nigga (I'm only one nigga)
I can't be everywhere
But I can take you anywhere, I know, I swear

Power girl, I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways
I really wanna know your ways (wanna know, wanna know)
I really wanna, power girl
You been runnin' through my section all day
You been runnin' through my mind all day
All day, all day, all day, all day, yeah, uh

Power girl out in the city, some niggas, they out in the city
Goin' nowhere, girl, you doin' it, ay
Goin' everywhere, girl, you don't need it
Goin' everywhere, what you doin'?
Power girl, why you over the city?
Do you know, girl, girl, you know the city?
Over the city, over the city
Power girl, yeah, she's over the city
Hourglass, yeah she turned it over
Power girl, yeah, she's over the city
Hourglass, yeah she turned it over
