		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been so long, so long since I could hold you hold you
And you've been so strong so strong through it all
It's been so long, so long since I could hold you hold you
Did I do wrong do wrong by you
It's so good to have you back again
You've been missed my saving strength
It's so good to hold you close again
You've were missed my saving strength
All of the pain and the words we were saying all
The mistakes that I know we're not making now
All of fears that tore up in side and all of the tears that you know that I 
Cried for you

It's so good to have you back again
You've been missed my saving strength
All of the days that I stood there just waiting and
All of ways that I hoped you'd stop hating me now
And all of the fears that I know that you hide and
All of the tears that I know that you cried for me to
It's so good to have you back again
You've were missed my saving strength
It's so good to have you back again
You've were missed my saving strength
