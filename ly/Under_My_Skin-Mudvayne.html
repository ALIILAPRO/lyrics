		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Nailed inside my head,
F*** this I don't need your s***,
All the lies deceit and arrogance,
Talk your s*** like my life is some kinda game,
Like you f***in' know me,
Just go far away and be small,
Run far away and be small,
Go lie in a hole and be small,

Thorns, splinters, pushing,
Under my skin,
They want in,
Sharpened tongue to penetrate me,

If you really think you got what it takes to be me,
Then walk a mile in the skin of my head case mental being,
So you want a piece of this life that belongs to me,
Well make a cut on the line and take a deeper look inside of the freak,

That is me, f***er, come on,

Disturb, search me, prying up all my scales
To get in lance the core to penetrate me,

So you want inside of me,
So you want a piece of this,
So you want to tear me down, for your own selfish wants and needs

Disturb, search me, prying, up all my scales,
To get in, lance the core to penetrate me,

So you want inside of me
So you want a piece of me,
So you want to drag me down,
For your own selfish wants and needs

You were there like a punk,
Just to get in my face,
Wanted in me wanted to be
Till I gave you a taste
Don't need your goddamn pressure
Frontin' stress I'm superman motherf***er
Without the "s" on my chest
Trying to step in my circle I'm leaving you purple and black
On your back drop your a** like a heart attack
Rippin' through your life like a motherf***in'
Hurricane fist full of Novocain for the pain
You're nothing in my life in my head
You're nothing in my life in my land
Nailed inside my head

You're under my f***in' skin!
I have cleansed my life now of the people who pry
And threaten place always in my face I think it's time for them to
Go away always in my f***in' space,
Always in my scene always in my sight,
Always in my way

You're dead to me punk a** f*** .

There's nothing left
