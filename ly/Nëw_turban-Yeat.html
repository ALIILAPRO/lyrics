		  Ayy, ayy, ayy (phew)
Yeah, turn up
I went and bought a new turban
I went and bought a new
(Bugz Ronin, he gon' run it up)

I went and bought a new turban (turban)
I went and bought a new shank (shank)
I went and bought a new turban
I went and bought me the tank (Tonka)
I got a Richard Millie, yeah (ugh)
You just be fuckin' on skanks
Money as tall as the ceiling, huh
I bought a crib and the bank, yeah
I just be sippin' on muddy
Keep flyin' high like I'm in a plane (ooh)
Yeah, I run my money up to the moon, I feel like Usain
Yeah, I said I quit the Percs but I did 'em again, I'm going insane
I add a bell to the beat 'cause I touched it up, you know that's my thang
Yeah, I just poured up, I just poured up (stain)
Yeah, mud in my cup, yeah, mud in my cup
Heard lil' shawty wan' fuck, yeah, told her what's up
Yeah, I bought the turban, I don't be in the sun

Yeah, bought a new turban, yeah, ride 'round put up my curtains
I went and bought me the Lamb', yeah, this bitch peel off perfect
Yeah, I can't even fuck with 'em, nah, yeah, they pussy, they nervous
Yeah, I don't give a fuck what you said, I don't think that you heard us
Yeah, I'ma geek off the pills, I'm a geeker, like yeah, I been flyin' with the birds
Pulled up on that bitch, I'ma sneak up, yeah, like she gon' pull up and twerk (yeah)
I don't need no friends
She asked me what I'm swervin' in, yeah, told that bitch, "The Benz"
Yeah, I'm in high demand
Walk inside the building, all my pockets got a limp
I live in the sky, bitch, I been high like I'm a blimp
Bitch, fuck what you said, you not them, bitch, 'cause we him
I went and bought a new turban, just 'cause I can
Walkin' around in London, shank him up, they caught the plan, yeah

I went and bought a new turban (turban)
I went and bought a new shank (shank)
I went and bought a new turban
I went and bought me the tank (Tonka)
I got a Richard Millie, yeah (ugh)
You just be fuckin' on skanks
Money as tall as the ceiling, huh
I bought a crib and the bank, yeah
I just be sippin' on muddy
Keep flyin' high like I'm in a plane (ooh)
Yeah, I run my money up to the moon, I feel like Usain
Yeah, I said I quit the Percs but I did 'em again, I'm going insane
I add a bell to the beat 'cause I touched it up, you know that's my thang
