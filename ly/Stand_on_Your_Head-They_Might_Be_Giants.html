		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like people, they're the ones who can't stand
They're the ones who can't stand
I see smoke signals coming from them
They say "We are out of furniture"

Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own

You made my day, now you have to sleep in it
Now you have to sleep in it
I love the world and if I have to sue for custody,
I will sue for custody

Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
Stand on your own head for a change
Give me some skin to call my own
Stand on your own head
Stand on your own head for a change
Stand on your own head
