		  When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your sh-
When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your shadow

When I'm, when I'm standing
When I'm, when I'm standing
When I'm, when I'm standing
When I'm, when I'm standing

When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your sh-
When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your sh-

Being in your shadow
Shadow, shadow
Being in your shadow
Shadow, shadow, shadow
Being in your shadow

When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your shadow
How you magnetize
While you're lightin' fi-i-ire

When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your sh-
When I'm standin'
When I'm standin'
When I'm, when I'm standing

When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your sh-
When I'm standin' near you
I can't get my words out
Like I feel you
Being in your shadow

Shadow, shadow
Being in your shadow
Shadow, shadow, shadow
Being in your shadow
