		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, oh yeah
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your give the nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well

I'm not a fool (oh yeah)
I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool (oh yeah)
I'm just lifeless too
But you to taught me how to feel (mhm)
When nobody ever would (nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love
What nobody ever could

Ooh girl (oh babe)
I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world (oh babe)
And ooh girl (oh babe)
I want to embrace you (oh babe)
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world

And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment till my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right
You've been the only one to make me smile
In such long
I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby

I'm not a fool (I'm not a fool)
I just love that you're dead inside (that you're dead inside)
I'm not a fool (oh no)
I'm just lifeless too (I'm just lifeless too)
But you to taught me how to feel (you taught me how to feel)
When nobody ever would (nobody ever would)
And you taught me how to love (you taught me how to love)
What nobody ever could

Ooh girl (oh, babe)
I should leave you (I know I should leave you)
And learn to mistreat you (and learn to mistreat you)
'Cause you belong to the world (oh yeah, oh yeah)
And ooh girl (oh, babe)
I wanna embrace you (I wanna embrace you)
Domesticate you (domesticate you)
But, you belong to the world (oh, baby)
You belong to the world

You belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need (oh no)
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream

Ooh, ooh girl
I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world (oh, yeah)
And ooh girl
I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world

You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
