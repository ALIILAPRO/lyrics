		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Didn't know how much I would love Santa Barbara
Never driven up, but I know that it's gotta be so beautiful
That's where you were born
Long brown hair that your mom doesn't like
You got a moon tattoo that you don't even hide
You're so unusual
Haven't met someone like you before

Wanna be that guy that's makin' it hard for you to sleep at night
I want you to call me when it's gettin' late
You can tell me anything

From time to time, you give me the smallest look
Behind your eyes, and baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
From night to night, it's takin' you longer
When you say, "Goodbye," baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone

I've been carried away tryin' to get inside your brain
And what do you know? Do you live alone?
And do you pray?
And do you believe there is a life where it's just you and me, and I
With only the way, with only the signs
It's only you and me, and I

From time to time, you give me the smallest look
Behind your eyes and baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone

From time to time, you give me the smallest look
Behind your eyes, and baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
From night to night, it's takin' you longer
When you say, "Goodbye," baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone

Someone to help, someone to hold
Somewhere to go when nights get cold
Somebody to love, somebody to be
Someone to sweep you off your feet
Someone to help, someone to hold
Somewhere to go when nights get cold
Somebody to love, somebody to be
Someone to sweep you off your feet
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) that someone is me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh) that someone is me

From time to time, you give me the smallest look
Behind your eyes, and baby, it's almost like you need someone
I promise I can be someone
