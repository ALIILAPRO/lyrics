		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the car
Cruising around with you
And my baby
You know that I got you
Hit the road
I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry
There's something about you
Ah

Leave the car
At the valet
Cash only
Check me in
Pop the champagne
Dom PÃ©rignon
Pour me a glass
She's got good taste
So good
Take off our clothes
By the fireplace
Sexy
Yeah

She looks just like a dream
The prettiest girl I've ever seen
From the cover of a magazine

In the car
Cruising around with you
And my baby
You know that I got you
Hit the road
I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry
There's something about you
Ah

We stayed up all night and slept 'til noon
It's so nice to wake up next to you
Let's start the day with breakfast in bed
Think I'm gonna love you 'til I'm dead

I can't wait to buy you things
A brand new diamond ring
This is more than just a fling

In the car
Cruising around with you
And my baby
You know that I got you
Hit the road
I'm taking off with you
Not in a hurry
There's something about you
Ah
There's something about you, girl
There's something about you
Ah
Something about you
Something about
