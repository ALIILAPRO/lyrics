		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm thirty-something going on thirteen
Still a sponge to everything
Saucer eyes wide, yeah, I still believe
And a sparkle in my steps
Smiling with my teeth

They say that I might lose my Midas touch
They also say I may become irrelevant
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age just need a little bit of
Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

So, I recommend that you lose your mind
It was the only thing that
Was keeping me behind

They say curb your curiosity
They also say prepare to amend your dreams
But who the fuck are they anyway?
I don't care what they say

'Cause I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age (c'mon)
Just need a little bit of
Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

How old would you be? yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know, yeah
How old you really were?
How old would you be? yeah
How old would you really be
If you didn't know (Know)
How old you really were? (Hey)

I won't act my age
Time is just an invention man has made
No, I won't act my age
It's just my reflection that is out of date
'Cause it's all in your attitude
It's all in your point of view
I won't act my age just need a little bit of
Peter Pan and some imagination
No, I won't act my age

Oh oh, I won't act my age ooh, yeah, ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh i won't act my age
