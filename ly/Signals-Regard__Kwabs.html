		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Am I seeing signals up ahead?
Or am I imagining it all up in my mind?
Looks like there's something there
Yeah, there's something there
Should I follow the smoke or burn my own fire?

To burn my own fire
Live by my own laws
That's my desire
To burn my own fire
And wage my own wars
This soul ain't for hire
Go alone
No hand to hold
Go alone
No hand to hold

Am I seeing signals up ahead?
Or am I imagining it all up in my mind?
Looks like there's something there
Yeah, there's something there
Should I follow the smoke or burn my own fire?

Am I seeing signals up ahead?
Or am I imagining it all up in my mind?
Looks like there's something there
Yeah, there's something there
Should I follow the smoke or burn my own fire?

And if nothing's wrong
I must be seeing things, seeing things
For a moment I believed my eyes, oh

But I wanna know am I seeing signals up ahead?
Or am I imagining it all up in my mind?
Looks like there's something there
Yeah, there's something there
Should I follow the smoke or burn my own fire?

Am I seeing signals up ahead?
Or am I imagining it all up in my mind?
Looks like there's something there
Yeah, there's something there
Should I follow the smoke or burn my own fire?
