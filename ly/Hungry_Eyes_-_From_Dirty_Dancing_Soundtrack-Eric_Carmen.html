		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been meaning to tell you
I've got this feelin' that won't subside
I look at you and I fantasize
You're mine and tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I want to hold you so hear me out
I want to show you what love's all about
Darling tonight
Now I've got you in my sights

With these hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

With these hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With these hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise
I need you to see
This love was meant to be

I've got hungry eyes
One look at you and I can't disguise
I've got hungry eyes
I feel the magic between you and I

I've got hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With the hungry eyes
Now did I take you by surprise?
With my hungry eyes
With my hungry eyes
Now I've got you in my sights
With my hungry eyes
