		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mr. Blue Melville was a sailor at dawn
He sailed on his ship as I walked through the shore
He took all the glitter and left me away
And Mr. Blue Melville has gone

The night was brighter when you lingered
And love was a mystery 'til you walk by my side
But now my heart's singing
And tonight I'll be fine without you
I'm walking back home

The night was brighter when you lingered
And love was a mystery 'til you walk by my side
But now my heart's singing
And tonight I'll be fine without you
I'm walking back home
