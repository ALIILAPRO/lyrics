		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, Father, please, please forgive all my sins
The water is way too deep, the deep end is where I live
Father, please, there's blood all over these sheets
The Devil is in the mirror, he's staring right over me

I always thought it would be easy
To get you out my mind
I think I found a new addiction
And it feels so right

Run, baby, run, run for your life
I'ma tear out your heart, it'll always be mine
Run, baby, run, run for your life
Gonna tear out your heart, it'll always be mine

Oh, there she go, losing my head
Say you'll love me to death 'cause I will
Oh, there she go, show me you care
Say you'll always be there 'cause I will
Oh, Father, please, please don't waste any time
The sirens are turning red, I found a whole another vice
Father, please, she's perfect in your design
She's covered in Saint Laurent, you've shown me the holy light

I always thought it would be easy
To get you out my mind
I think I found a new addiction
It feels so right

Run, baby, run, run for your life
I'ma tear out your heart, it'll always be mine
Run, baby, run, run for your life
Gonna tear out your heart, it'll always be mine

Oh, there she go, losing my head
Say you'll love me to death 'cause I will
Oh, there she go, show me you care
Say you'll always be there 'cause I will
Run, baby, run
Run, baby, run
