I'm a misfit, people run away when I'm in distance (okay)
Hell is closer to me than I thought, I see the visions (wassup?)
Life is so alone when the color's monochrome (huh?)
Life invades your mind and now you think you're in the zone (uh-huh)
Body bags like leaves as they litter through the streets (okay)
You can see 'em breathe, only alive in their dreams (wassup?)
Life is so alone when the color's monochrome (huh?)
Life invades your mind and now you think you're in the zone (haha)

They just float away, they just float away
They just float away, they just float away
Float away, they just float away
They just float away, they just float away (Sleezy)

Now, Vinny used to go to school but he dropped out (fuck outta here)
Started movin' coke with some dude at his pops' house (work)
Started movin' dope, now his jewels lookin' rocked out (work)
Moms found out, now his ass gettin' locked out (fuck outta here)
Only child, he ain't have a big brother now (run out)
Stomach growl, now he count up like two hundred thou' (Mula)
School zone with it (work), heroin, two-tone with it (work)
Servin' college students to the group home with it (work)
Run away from home, I probably'll never call you (fuck outta here)
Own friends killin' new friends, them niggas cross you (boom, boom)
Put bloody all on this money, them hunnids all blue (Mula)
I was fifteen on that block, I'm servin' dog food

I'm a misfit, people run away when I'm in distance (okay)
Hell is closer to me than I thought, I see the visions (wassup?)
Life is so alone when the color's monochrome (huh?)
Life invades your mind and now you think you're in the zone

They just float away, they just float away
They just float away, they just float away
Float away, they just float away
They just float away, they just float away
