		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When everything's great
And not as blue
And everything's great
When I come back to you
But everything great
Is never as good
'Cause everything that's great is always misunderstood

And I don't wanna know
Where I wanna go

If I lived up to be where I am
And gave it all away
Would I do it all again?
If it all worked on the other hand
To be unafraid
Maybe then I'd have a chance
If I only knew
There's less that I can lose
Save
Save myself the pain
But that's something I can't do

When everyone's gone
But everyone's around
Whichever way you look
You don't feel safe and sound
No matter how it hurts
You'll never find the words to
Explain how you suffer because it only gets worse

And I don't wanna know
Where I wanna go

If I lived up to be where I am
And gave it all away
Would I do it all again?
If it all worked on the other hand
To be unafraid
Maybe then I'd have a chance
If I only knew
There's less that I can lose
Save, save myself the pain
But that's something I can't do
