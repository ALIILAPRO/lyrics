		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Its been such a funny day
I don't know why
Walking on an endless lane
Life passing me by
tomorrow is calling
But I'm dragging my feet
The skies are indecently clear
But I can't dtand the heat
Sleepwalking in a haze
Stumbling like a child
Dragons that I used to chase
Tease me from inside
The future's uncertain
Just like yesterday
Memories of heaven
Can't be taken away

You know, time flies
And the rebels, one day
They all go quiet
Ain't no money, ain't nobody
That can buy you peace of mind

They say you can learn from your mistakes
It's a lie
My redemption has been staged
Numerous times
But the angel of passion
Still taunt me, in my sleep
they keep throwing petals and thorns
Underneath my feet

You know, time flies
And the rebels, one day
They all go quiet
Ain't no money, ain't nobody
That can buy you peace of mind
