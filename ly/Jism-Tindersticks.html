		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If she'd have known
She'd have shown me in
I need to taste her pain
For encouragement

If she'd have known
She'd have shown me in
I need to taste her pain
For accomplishment

See, I can only take it out on you
There's no-one else I can trust
See, I can only take it out on you
There's no-one else but us around

You hide these things so well
There's no finding
You hide these things so well
There's no finding, no finding

And the pink runs into the blue
There are no edges
How do I know where you are tonight?
Need these paper cuts

Need those gravel grinds
Need those pinches to wake me
Give up the drugs
Take the power I offer

Oh the deeper I go
The further I fall
The more I know
The tighter your grip around me

So easily broken
Running down your skin
And the pink runs into the blue
If there's ever anyone else, I'll understand

And kill them
And I'll overflow your every inlet
You will not cough and spit
You'll welcome me in

And I tell you with my tongue between your toes
If there's ever anyone else
Don't let them do this
And I'll laugh and revel

As you scratch and crawl
If there's ever anyone else
Just show them the ugly mess
You hide these things so well

There's no finding
You hide these things so well
There's no finding, no finding
