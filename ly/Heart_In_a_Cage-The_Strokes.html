		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't feel better when I'm fuckin' around
And I don't write better when I'm stuck in the ground
So don't teach me a lesson 'cause I've already learned
Yeah, the sun will be shinin' and my children will burn

Oh, the heart beats in its cage

I don't want what you want, I don't feel what you feel
See, I'm stuck in a city but I belong in a field
Yeah, we got left, left, left, left, left, left, left
Now it's three in the morning and you're eating alone

Oh, the heart beats in its cage

All our friends, they're laughing at us
All of those you loved, you mistrust
Help me, I'm just not quite myself
Look around, there's no one else there

I went to the concert and I fought through the crowd
Guess I got too excited when I thought you were around
Oh, he gets left, left, left, left, left, left, left
And I'm sorry you were thinking I would steal your fire

Oh, the heart beats in its cage
Yes, the heart beats in its cage, alright

Oh, the heart beats in its cage
