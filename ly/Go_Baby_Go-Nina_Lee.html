		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Go with your gut, don't go with your head
It don't matter what the people say
You got a soul that you just ain't willing to sell
Oh, oh
Don't stop doin' 'cause you're scared of yourself
Look at you go, you don't need no help
And a diamond in the rough can shine all by itself

And even if the climb is slow

I said, "Go, baby, go, go, go"
Oh, I said
"Go 'til you can't go (can't go) no more (no more) no more (no more)"
I said, "Go, baby, go, go, go"

I been to a place where the drifters go
It brought me trouble, yeah, it brought me low
Time was flying but I was rooted in my blues (I was rooted in my blues)
When I looked up, all I saw was myself
Standing in my own way 
Nobody else but me can set me free

So now when I'm looking at that winding road

I said, "Go, baby, go, go, go"
Ooh, yeah
Go 'til you can't go (can't go) no more (no more) no more (no more)
I said, "Go baby, go, go, go"
Oh, I said
"Go 'til you can't go (can't go) no more (no more) no more (no more)"

Go with that feeling
Go on crazy dreaming
Hear that fearless heart beat in your chest
Put it, put it, put it to the test

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You gotta put it to the test
Oh, oh, oh, oh 
I wanna hear your heart beating outside your chest
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
You're braver than you know, wanna watch you steal the show
Baby, go, go, go

Oh, I said
"Go 'til you can't go (can't go) no more (no more) no more (no more)"
I said, "Go, baby, go, go, go
Oh, go 'til you can't go (can't go, no more) no more (no more)"
I said, "Go, baby, go, go, go"
