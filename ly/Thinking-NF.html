		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, growing up, yeah
Know a lot but I don't know enough
What you doin' here?
Why you even showin' up? Yeah
Showin' up for tryna show me love
Why you look confused like, you don't really know, what's up? Yeah
Why you always tryna judge?
I know who you are, yeah
Why you tryna tryna front, yeah
I am not the man I was, look
Ay, made me a promise, I just hope you keep it
I don't like to get involved with things I don't believe in
I don't like to hang with people I don't trust to speak with
If you tell me that you mean it, then I hope you mean it
Yeah, feel like I don't deserve you when I hurt your feelings
I'm vulnerable, you got the keys to open all my secrets
You've always been there when I'm low to help pick up the pieces
I know I act like I don't need it yet but lately I been thinking

Yeah, lately I been thinking
Yeah, yeah, I have been thinking
Yeah, I have been thinking

Yeah, I wish, that I was optimistic
I wish that I could trust my intuition
To most negative thinking makes you a pessimist but
To me negative thinking means I'm just realistic
That's how I feel, ain't that a twisted view?
Claim that I don't care what people think but is that really true?
Those the type of questions that I struggle with
That's the type of thing to keep me up at night
Wondering I wonder if the pressure I've been under is too much for my shoulders
Who gon' care when this all fades, I turn grey and get older?
Yeah, that's the type of thing that I don't wanna answer
But just 'cause I don't wanna do it don't mean I don't have to
See, these are lessons that you learn in life
And we only get one of 'em, hope I'm learning right
I know that everything comes with a price
Yeah, yeah, everything comes with a price
Y'all got no clue what I have sacrificed and lately, I've been thinking

Yeah, lately I been thinking
Yeah, yeah I have been thinking
Yeah, I have been thinking (I have been thinking)
