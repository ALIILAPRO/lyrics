		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do

'Cause we lie, we cheat and we learn
From each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt
'Til somebody's in despair

Boom, keep in tune
Hollywood will zoom left of the point
Right to the point
Smoke it, like it's a joint

Makin'
Ain't got time to be fakin'
It's my turn and I'm takin'
Everything without shakin', yo, here with the bacon

Happy, is how we should be
Realizin' we are wealthy
Livin' here on this Earth
Enjoy what it's worth

Anger left behind you
Just don't let it find you
Love will not remain
As long as you complain

More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do

Yeah we lie, we cheat and we learn
From each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt
'Til somebody's in despair

More and more and more
More and more and more

More, more, bam, don't give a damn
Pump the music and jam
There's no time for the problem
Not a thought to some

But just make sure you get it
Show the fellas you with it
Being prompt, you get it
Never will you forget it

There's a way to stop this
Listen to the prophets
Everything they said
Yo, it should be read

More, he had to tell
Things that made him well
L-I-G-H-T is shinin'
And my brother's heart cryin'

More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do

'Cause we lie, we cheat and we learn
From each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt
'Til somebody's in despair

More and more and more
I don't know where we're going to
More and more and more
There's so much we don't wanna do

'Cause we lie, we cheat and we learn
From each and every heart affair
Yes, we lie, we cheat and we hurt
'Til somebody's in despair

More and more and more
More and more and more
