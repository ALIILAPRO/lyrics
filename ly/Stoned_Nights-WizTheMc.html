		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sitting in the same park
Where this love was
Picture perfect rainstorm
But I'm lost in
Thoughts that I'm afraid of
First we close, now we strangers
Butterflies turned out to be dangerous

Worked every day shift
Spent nights at your place
And we vibed 'til your eyelids 
Turned purple like violets
What should I change?

Stoned nights
Passing red lights
I feel dead inside
But I won't ever let you know
Stoned eyes
I been taking flight
Far away from where we sat
And you said goodbye

Waiting for the takeoff
I can't stop now
Every little danger 
Makes my heart drop down
Running outta paper
Smoking green with new strangers
Deep down, I wish I could've saved us

Sound of the sirens
Had my heart beating violent
I've been fighting feelings
Got no number to dial in, uh
Throw my phone away and hope for some silence

Stoned nights
Passing red lights
I feel dead inside
But I won't ever let you know
Stoned eyes
I been taking flight
Far away from where we sat
And you said goodbye

I wish I never fell so hard
Wish I never knew your heart
'Cause now we're too far apart
I wish I never fell so hard
I wish I never knew your heart
'Cause now we're too far apart

Stoned nights
Passing red lights
I feel dead inside
But I won't ever let you know
Stoned eyes
I been taking flight
Far away from where we sat
And you said goodbye

Stoned nights
Passing red lights
I feel dead inside
But I won't ever let you know
Stoned eyes
I been taking flight
Far away from where we sat
And you said goodbye
