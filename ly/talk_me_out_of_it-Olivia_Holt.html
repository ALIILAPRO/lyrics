		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Blue
The lights we were under
When you took your phone out
And gave me your number

Now it's two
We've asked all the questions
We've done all the small talk
Now there's nothing left except

Taking shots, sharing lines and spilling truth
I wonder if you're gonna try to make a move
A move

'Cause I'm 'bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talking me out of it
My friends are leaving the party
But I'm down for one more drink

It's my first time in this outfit
But maybe you'll talk me out of it
What's gonna slow it down a bit?
Boy, you could talk me out of it
So talk me out of it

Your eyes
Is all that I stare at
They're saying the things
That your lips wouldn't dare know

And I
I won't say it's working
But right now I'm thinking
That you might be worth it

And we're taking shots, sharing lines and spilling truth
I wonder if you're gonna try to make a move
Make a little move, make a little move
A move

'Cause I'm 'bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talking me out of it
My friends are leaving the party
But I'm down for one more drink

If it's my first time in this outfit
But maybe you'll talk me out of it
What's gonna slow it down a bit?
Boy you could talk me out of it
So talk me out of it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah yeah yeah

'Cause I'm 'bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talking me out of it
My friends are leaving the party
But I'm down for one more drink

It's my first time in this outfit
But maybe you'll talk me out of it
What's gonna slow it down a bit?
Boy you could talk me out of it
So talk me out of it

'Cause I'm 'bout to go to my apartment
But you could keep talking me out of it
My friends are leaving the party
But I'm down for one more drink

It's my first time in this outfit
But maybe you'll talk me out of it
What's gonna slow it down a bit?
Boy you could talk me out of it
So talk me out of it
