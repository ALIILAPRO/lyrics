		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All things work for better (gotta work together)
When people learn to love

We know that all things work together for our good (let me sing about it)
And that's alright (so right)
Alright (so good)
We know that all things work together for our good (and that's alright)
And that's alright

We know that all things work together for our good (think about it)
And that's alright (so right)
Alright (alright)
We know that all things work together for our good (I know, I know)
And that's alright
So right
So good

And it feels good
(Work together for our good)
Let me shout it out
(That's alright, so right)
(Alright, so right)

Said it's all good
So good
(Work together for our good)
(And that's alright)
(That's alright)
