		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill

In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?

Broken heart and broken bones
Finger plaster cast and horse pills
One more quirky clich√© phrase
You're the one I wanna refill

In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?

Most people don't realize that large pieces of coral
Which have been painted brown and attached to the skull with common wood screws
Can make a child look like a deer

In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?

Runny nose and runny yolk
Even if you have a cold still
You can cough on me again
I still haven't had my full fill

In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
In the someday
What's that sound?
