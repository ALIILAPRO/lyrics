		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You throw stones at my window
The darkness can now get inside
But I like the wind flow
I like how it makes me collide
Reflected in broken mirrors
I don't know what i came here for
What I came here for
What I came here for

I am one with the discord
Take me with the darkness oh
I used to be soft and
Used to hate the silence oh
I am one with the discord
Hiding on the sidelines oh
I used to be soft and I
I enjoy the silence

I am one with the discord
Take me with the darkness oh
I used to be soft and
Used to hate the silence oh
I am one with the discord
Hiding on the sidelines oh
I used to be soft and I
I enjoy the silence

Tears falling on the ground
Tried to water it with my sorrows
Tried to water it with my sorrows
With my sorrows
With my sorrows
With my sorrows
With my sorrows
With my sorrows
With my sorrows

I am one with the discord
One with all my sorrows
I sit in the dark and
I like the silence
Cuz I am the discord
Cuz I am the discord
