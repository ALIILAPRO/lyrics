		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alone, I greet the empty silence
A face I've yet to meet
Void of words and without feeling
Unsure of how I'm supposed to be
The days so short, the years so few
As we walk these sands of time
The times I've walked with you

Come tomorrow
I'll be waiting forevermore (I'll be waiting forevermore)
Come tomorrow
I don't want to say farewell
Farewell anymore

Tears have been forsaken
Hollow and numb
Just like a bird who's wings have been broken
I have become
The days so short, the years so few
As we walk these sands of time
The times I've walked with you

Come tomorrow
I'll be waiting forevermore (I'll be waiting forevermore)
Come tomorrow
I don't want to say farewell
Farewell anymore

Come tomorrow
I'll be waiting forevermore (I'll be waiting forevermore)
Come tomorrow
I'll be waiting forevermore (I'll be waiting forevermore)
Come tomorrow
I don't want to say farewell
Farewell anymore
