		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Because only a fool wouldn't trust himself
Either way I can't explain why you trusted me
Is there a way to explain atrocities
If to live this way I chose to sleep
To prevent my eyes from bleeding
The lights could be deceiving
Deceitfulness grows long
Just like a typical radio song
That does not seem to want to shut the hell up
That's why I chose to be faithful
To the way I see things
Funny all the ways animosity brings
You're simply to acidic for my much refined palate
You must taste at least like sashimi to get that cat wet
Because only a fool wouldn't trust himself
Either way I can't explain why you trusted me
Is there a way to explain atrocities
If to live this way I chose to sleep
Brag? I gotta get a bag
No intention in drowning in thought like that
Not because I bought a fast car
And I got a six pack but it could go down like that
If I wouldn't be sick with the pressure
Battling against the idiocratic gesture
I'm almost at peace though no need for a 44
I'm good I already let it go look
So dance with me like your memory isn't that of pain and misery
Because I'm not really bringing myself down
I can only get down like my name James Brown
Watch me rub my nose to this heavy sound
Because only a fool wouldn't trust himself
Either way I can't explain why you trusted me
Is there a way to explain atrocities
If to live this way I chose to sleep
Coming down the road to see improvement
To the terror of my eyes I saw you dancing
But damn you look beautiful (but damn you look beautiful)
But damn you look beautiful (but damn you look beautiful)
But damn you look beautiful (but damn you look beautiful)
But damn you look fucking beautiful
Because only a fool wouldn't trust himself
Either way I can't explain why you trusted me
Is there a way to explain atrocities
If to live this way I chose to sleep
Because only a fool wouldn't trust himself
Either way I can't explain why you trusted me
Is there a way to explain atrocities
If to live this way I chose to sleep
