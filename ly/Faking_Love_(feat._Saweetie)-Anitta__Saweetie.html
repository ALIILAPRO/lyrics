		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You tell me you're leaving today
You're packing your bags up for good
I'm not gonna stand in your way
Baby, I'd cry if I could, but

I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true

Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you

Boy, bye, thought I was a fool, nice try
Need a invoice for my time
You done killed my vibe, thinkin' I'm a ride or die
Matter of fact, click-clack, bye

They know why
Ain't no one surprised I'm in these streets
Let me live my life
Throw a party when you leave, leave, leave

Hey, Anitta, we're the divas
With a 401k and a Visa
And she bonita, I wanna meet her
Can you balance work and pleasure like a libra?
I'm at Ipanema with a couple bad bitches (yeah)
Tannin' topless and we takin' mad pictures (uh-huh)
Fragile ego, now you gotta gas niggas
Faking love, I need somethin' that's realer

Feel like I'm running out of ways to say (say)
That I ain't feeling any type of way about you
Keep getting caught up when your hands on me
Like ooh, I want it (I want it), I got it (I got it)
Ain't sorry, but I got

All I'm needin', all I need
I'll be leaving, I'll be gone (gone)
Gone
Do as I please, oh, baby
It's too easy to let you go 
So (yeah)

I keep faking love
I keep faking love with you
I been faking love
I been faking love, it's true

Now we breaking up
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you

I been faking love with you

I keep faking love (yeah, yeah)
I keep faking love with you (yeah, yeah)
I been faking love (ha)
I been faking love, it's true (oh)

Now we breaking up (breaking up)
Now we breaking up, boo-hoo
But I been faking love
I been faking love with you
