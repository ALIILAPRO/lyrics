		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
$Licky, $licky, $licky
Lil Remains, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hunnid K on a fuckboy, hmm (fuckboy)
Fuck I look like? Think I trust boys, yeah
Full of hate, I'ma kill joy
$Licky ridin' on blades like a hot boy
Aye, 50k on the chain, chain, chain (chain, chain)
Grey, Grey, that's the gang, gang, gang (gang, gang)
Load the K's, leave a stain, stain, stain (stain, stain)
Fucking right I'm out my brain, brain, brain (brain, brain)

Spin the block out with the Glock out like a menace (like a menace)
Gimme a minute, I'ma make sure that it's finished
If I'm ridin', bendin' corners, say your penance
Should've listened to your bitchin the beginning, ayy, yeah
K-I, double-L-E-R
So many bodies, made a hobby at the ER
Rollin' with Oddy, smoking a gaudy for my leisure
Whipping the mazi, pumpin' the shotty, trigger squeezer
Breakin' a bitch, swervin' the Benz, fuckin' the means
Gonna fuckin', I murdered her pussy and her friends
My reality is hell, I don't pretend, yeah, yeah
I just learn to blend in with the sin (ayy, ayy)
Here we go again, here we go (here we go)
Wanna come and try $licky? You should know (you should know)
I got a thousand ways for you to end in yellow tape
And I got plenty people 'round me wanna earn they way (ayy)

Hunnid K on a fuckboy, hmm
Fuck I look like? Think I trust boys, yeah
Full of hate, I'ma kill joy
Ruby ridin' on blades like a hot boy
Aye, 50k on the chain, chain, chain
Grey, Grey, it's the gang, gang, gang
Load the K's, leave a stain, stain, stain (hunnid, hunnid, hunnid)
Fuckin' right I'm out my brain, brain, brain

Hunnid K for the car, half a mil' for the addiction
They shipped me off the rehab 'cause I started questionin' my existence (huh?)
Gimme the prescriptions and I'll show you repetition (yuh)
Stubborn motherfucker you know Ruby never listens (uh, what?)
Grey59, by time to the grave, time flyin' every day
It's on my name, I'm confined to the page 
Until a spine and a stain is the only thing remaining (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pullin' up in the Mercedes, bitch, I'm pushin' up daisies
Vision always blurry and my memory hazy
Grey bandana out the window wave it while I'm racin'
Raisin' my hand to the sky until the angels come and take me (I'm waitin')
Awaken my demons, breakin' me down to my knees, they wanna break me
They wanna isolate me, leave me naked, fuckin' shaky
Grip on that .380, voices tellin' me I'm crazy (tellin' me I'm crazy)
Sold my soul, I'm Grey until my final destination (final destination)
