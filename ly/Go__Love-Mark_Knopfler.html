		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had to leave for certain
I like to come back now and then
Maybe I'm just returning
So I can leave again

The wind comes softly blowing
From the cold grey sea
She leans into my collar
Starts whispering to me

Go, love, if you're going
You keep looking down the track
Go, love, if you're going
I'll be here when you come back

Go, love, if you're going
Go, love, if you're going

So go, love, if you're going
Don't stay on account of me
Go, love, if you're going
If that's the way it's got to be

Go, love, if you're going
You keep looking down the track
Go, love, if you're going
I'll be here when you come back

Go, love, if you're going
Go, love, if you're going
