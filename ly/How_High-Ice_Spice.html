		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a baddie, but I got feelings too
I remember you had both of us skippin' school
We were so young, had niggas actin' a fool
You was cryin' out for help, I promise, I never knew
When I found out, I was feelin' wocky
You said that you love me 'cause I'm bougie and I'm cocky
Climbin' up the ranks on your own could get rocky
But I keep it pushin' knowin' that they'll never stop me

Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?"
And I know his fears, but he never met mine
Never met mine, never, never met mine (damn)
Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?"
And I know his fears, but he never met mine
Never met mine, never, never met mine

He like, "Na-na-na-na, I just want us to make up"
He like, "Na-na-na-na, like, how far can we take us?"
On my m-m-m-mind (grrah), it's already made up
Missin' when we was laid up, I'm busy chasin' the paper (grrah)
When I wanted Givenchy, remember I couldn't buy it
So then I linked up with RIOT, but first, we prayed to the highest
And started gettin' them write-ups, and then they crowned me the princess
So, I'm most grateful, your highness, and now we poppin' them ciders (like)
Let me put you on to how a bad bitch think
And it's all tens when my bad bitch link
Wanna see me fall is a mad bitch kink (grrah)
Let me get my strap, and I hit her like, "Bink"
She gon' catch what I'm throwin' (grrah)
I see the snakes when I'm mowin'
And, yeah, they pop up like clonin'
So I just pop it like hoein'
Now, she on the floor when I'm kickin' the door (like)
How you mad I do less 'cause you gotta do more? (Damn)

Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie (grrah)
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?"
And I know his fears, but he never met mine
Never met mine, never, never met mine (damn)
Yeah, I know he want me, but he rather just lie (lie)
If I tell him, "Jump," he gon' ask me, "How high?"
And I know his fears, but he never met mine
Never met mine, never, never met mine

Mine, met mine
Met mine
Met mine
Met mine
Met mine
