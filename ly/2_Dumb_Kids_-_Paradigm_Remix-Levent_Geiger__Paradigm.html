		  (Duh-duh-duh, duh, duh, duh-duh)
(Makes me wanna do it again)

I don't wanna die, don't wanna young
And you've been on my mind, yeah, for some time now
Haven't felt alive since you and I
But tell me everything, how you been?

And I just wanna know, was it hard for you?
Did someone take my place while we went through changes?
You know I would give it all up for you
Just to see where this could go

'Cause we were only two dumb kid with too many problems
All those years that we tried to solve 'em
Now I see you're all that I wanted
Makes me wanna do it again
Yeah, we were only two dumb kid with too many problems
All those feelings I had forgotten
Now I see you're all that I wanted
Makes me wanna do it again, yeah

Tryna make it all make sense
This the night to get faded
Yeah, girl, you know I be waiting
This don't have to be complicated
Yeah, uh, uh, uh
Know you wanna say yeah, uh, uh, uh

I just wanna know, was it hard for you?
Did someone take my place while we went through changes?
You know I would give it all up for you
Just to see where this could go

'Cause we were only two dumb kid with too many problems
All those years that we tried to solve 'em
Now I see you're all that I wanted
Makes me wanna do it again
Yeah, we were only two dumb kid with too many problems
All those feelings I had forgotten
Now I see you're all that I wanted
Makes me wanna do it again

Makes me wanna
Makes me wanna do it again

'Cause we were only two dumb kid with too many problems
All those years that we tried to solve 'em
Now I see you're all that I wanted
Makes me wanna do it again
Me wanna do it again
