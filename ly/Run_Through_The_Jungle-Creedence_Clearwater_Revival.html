		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whoa, thought it was a nightmare
Lord, it's all so true
They told me, don't go walking slow
The devil's on the loose

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see

Thought I heard a rumblin'
Calling to my name
Two hundred million guns are loaded
Satan cries, "Take aim"

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see

Over on the mountain, thunder magic spoke
Let the people know my wisdom
Fill the land with smoke

Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Better run through the jungle
Whoa, don't look back to see
