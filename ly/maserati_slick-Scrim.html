		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (You did good, $lick)
(It's a smash)
Let's go, let's go, ayy, ayy (yeah)

I just hopped out new whip, already high as fuck
I just took a few hits, too gone, new phone
Pick up, I'm like "Who this?"
I've been sipping mud, dirty cup like it's sewage
Only love her when I'm faded off the fluid (okay)
I can feel the drugs running through my body
I was on thin ice, now my neck on hockey (damn)
When I die, I hope my bitch is buried, shotty (shotty)
When I die fill my coffin up with codeine (let's go)
Yeah, my bitch, she sober but she love a fucking dope fiend
I put Molly in my water, she thought it was protein
I can't tell you what it is, but can say what it don't mean
Northside crashing out, baby, I might OD (Northside)

Okay okay, I'm on the new wave, ayy (okay, ayy, turn me up)
been pushing Hellcats, I'm on a new pace, yeah (skrrt, yeah)
Iced-out Rollie, this here a new face, yeah
Still on the same shit but in a new way
They got twin bitches, I got twin Benz's
I got killers 'round me and they killing senseless
Can't tell who's who no more, I can't tell the difference
Don't think I'm from this earth, dawg, I'm just too different
Pop another perc, I just upped my senses, ayy
Two Glocks on me, that just my essentials, ayy
Listen to yo' daddy, better pushing pencils
Now pause the instrumental, ay

I just hopped out new whip, already high as fuck
I just took a few hits, too gone, new phone
Pick up, I'm like "Who this?"
I've been sipping mud, dirty cup like it's sewage
Only love her when I'm faded off the fluid (okay)
I can feel the drugs running through my body
I was on thin ice, now my neck on hockey (damn)
When I die, I hope my bitch is buried, shotty (shotty)
When I die fill my coffin up with codeine (let's go)
Yeah, my bitch, she sober but she love a fucking dope fiend
I put Molly in my water, she thought it was protein
I can't tell you what it is, but can say what it don't mean
Northside crashing out, baby, I might OD
