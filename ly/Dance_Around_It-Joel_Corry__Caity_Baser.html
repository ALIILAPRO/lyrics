		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody's got problems
I got a way you can solve it, baby
And it's pretty straight forward
Keep it movin' 'til it's sorted, baby
We all need a little crazy
To get away from the daily
To get away from the daily

Oh, the dancefloor's callin' me, callin' me
All my friends just follow me, follow me
If you wanna have a good time, say "ay-ay-ay-ay"
And tell the bad vibes "goodbye"

I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it

I just wanna dance around it

(Okay, say what? Ah)
I'ma just shut my eyes
Do a little, oof, to the right, hands held high
Waitin' all day for the night
Waitin' all day for the lights, why-y-y
Why don't you just shut your eyes?
Tequila on the rocks two times, one for the ride
Waitin' all day for the night
Waitin' all, waitin' all day for the night

Oh, the dancefloor's callin' me, callin' me
All my friends just follow me, follow me
If you wanna have a good time, say "ay-ay-ay-ay"
And tell the bad vibes "goodbye"

I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna dance around it

I just wanna dance around it
I just wanna dance around it
