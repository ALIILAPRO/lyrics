		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Seventeen ways to lose myself in you again
Seventeen ways to fall down at your feet
Time is violent, leaves no light on for the girl
Madness makes us feel that we're alive

We are creatures of the fire
We burn so close before we expire
We are creatures of the wind
Time to let it out or let it in

In this shallow grave all my troubles lay
Try to find the weakest parts of me
Ghosts are sleeping, banks don't weep at your mistakes
The wrong man is the chief of your police

We are creatures of the fire (can we go fast but slow?)
We burn so close before we expire (can we grow, reap or sow?)
We are creatures of the wind (and you know it's all for show)
Time to let it out or let it in
Let it in

Are we here for pleasure?
Are we here for pain?
Are we here for healing?
On an altered plane
Was I meant to find you?
Were you ever here?
Are you the end of someone?
Or the love I fear?

We are creatures of the fire (can we go fast but slow?)
We burn so close before we expire (can we grow, reap or sow?)
We are creatures of the wind (and you know it's all for show)
Time to let it out or let it in

We are creatures of the fire
We are creatures of the fire

Time to let it out or let it in
Let it in
