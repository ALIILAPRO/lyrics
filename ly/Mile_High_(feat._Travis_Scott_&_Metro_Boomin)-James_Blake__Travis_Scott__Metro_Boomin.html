		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

We on a drive, looped in
Two seat ride, couped in
Who gon' slide? Who's in?
Big rocks 'round of ten
Fleetwood down new sand
Two seat ride, couped in
Don't leave 'round loose ends
Don't be around new friends, yeah

We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

If I give it to you, will you leave?
Tell it to you, will you speak?
Got it tatted on my sleeve
Fell in love oversea
Ass fatter than a peach, uh
Ocean water kinda deep, uh
Rolling up out the reef, uh
Put me down, shake the sleep

Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
Forty days, forty nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
Never come up short
Never come up short
Never come-

Watch the fan as it spins
In my arms, wrapped in
Don't know where you start
And where I begin
Like I found myself an imaginary friend
And when we stay in
I'm missin' everything

We just be mile high clubbin'
I'm on a thousand miles runnin'
Hit it, go downtown Sunday
Then move it uptown Monday

Don't wanna see you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself

Hi-Vis, never seem
Lowkey as it's been
Fell in love overseas
Fell in love like it's easy
Put to sleep without dreams
Under the moonbeam
Call you for no reason
Hold on like it's greasy

Lasting like Duracell
Lasting like Duracell
Forty days, forty nights
Feel like a holy night
The lesson's always there
That less is always more
And in the back and forth
I'm not keeping score
Lesson's always there
That less is always more
When you're alone with me
You never come up short
You never come up short
Never come up short
Never come up short
Never come-

See you by yourself, by yourself
By yourself, by yourself, by yourself
