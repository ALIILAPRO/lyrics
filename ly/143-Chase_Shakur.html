		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, four, three
You love me so
No, I can't wait to start your way
Bet you may start shaking
I lose face when you go down
Knock your shit right out the frame
No, I ain't the same
Took time, made some change
Got changed

Told you like last time, made some change
Love me like one, four, three
I'm a Zone 6 nigga, 'til I D-I-E
I got five fingers with a fuck down to the side
Let me inside, let me inside

One, four, three 
You love me so
No, I can't wait to start your way
Bet you may start shaking
I lose face when you go down
Knock your shit right out the frame
No, I ain't the same

No, I can't play
Close my eyes, see your face
These hoes can't take your place
I mean, what else can I say?
Said you don't want space
I bring you close
You say space your place
It's not you, it's me

One, four, three 
You love me so
No, I can't wait to start your way
Bet you may start shaking
I lose face when you go down
Knock your shit right out the frame
