		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The hands have been well-used
To turn it on or turn it up
Maybe someone can turn it off

When it gets too late
And the heat is tauntious
The air is on fire
And the hands have become clawsious

So rock out
Rock out
Rock out
Rock out

And all the kids fell out and wrote a story
They should sell it to the magazines
They all turn out to be crazy

In the middle of the night
The dogs will bark
And the wheels of the wagon
Turn off and turn out

In your hair, I can see the topical solution
And no one can shut up for a minute
