		  Ha (huh?) 
Hey bel, la bastichi
La papaya, du la potato (yeah, la potato, oh, yeah)

I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I swerve in a Humvee (nuh-nuh-nuh)
I just went crazy, I did it
I just went crazy, I did it, huh
I just went crazy, I did it, huh
I just went crazy, I did it
I made a song for the Minions, uh
How much they paid me? A million, uh
I shop and then donate to charity (woo, I donate it to charity)
Take a cranky, I be smackin' the ceiling, uh
I call my Minion my children (children)
I call my children my Minions
We takin' over the world (the world)
We make a whole lot of millions

I need you to listen (yeah)
I'm a rich Minion (yeah)
We touch lot of millions
Yeah, I don't like Vector (I don't like, I don't like Vector)
Yeah, I don't like Vector (take 'em out)
Yeah, my diamonds glitter (yeah)
I just pulled up in Tonka with all of the Minions 
We takin' a picture (ooh, ah-ooh)
I had to make me some cents (what?)
I had to make me some bands (yeah)
I had to make me some money (the money)
You know that I'm in high demand (a lot)
I called that Minion up and this what he said
Ha (huh?) 
Hey bel, la bastichi
La papaya, du la potato (yeah, la potato, oh, yeah)

I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I swerve in a Humvee (nuh-nuh-nuh)
I just went crazy, I did it
I just went crazy, I did it, huh
I just went crazy, I did it, huh
I just went crazy, I did it
I made a song for the Minions, uh
How much they paid me? A million, uh
I shop and then donate to charity (woo, I donate it to charity)
Take a cranky, I be smackin' the ceiling, uh
I call my Minion my children (children)
I call my children my Minions
We takin' over the world (the world)
We make a whole lot of millions

I got diamonds on my body, I got every flavor
I'm in high demand, got a lot of millions
I got a high demand, I got all my millions, uh
I'm in high demand, I got all my millions
I'm inside that Tonka, inside with all my twins
Pull up with all my goons, pull up with all my Minions
If my Minions, they don't want you, we can't let you in
Made this song for like two million, you know I always win
Tried to save my Minions, make money, man, that's all we did
I call my Minions up, they said that boy on red
It's bananas for the Minions and my pockets bread
We do not think 'bout these haters, we just count this bread

I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I count money (nuh-nuh-nuh, nuh-nuh-nuh, no)
I swerve in a Humvee (nuh-nuh-nuh)
I just went crazy, I did it
I just went crazy, I did it, huh
I just went crazy, I did it, huh
I just went crazy, I did it
I made a song for the Minions, uh
How much they paid me? A million, uh
I shop and then donate to charity (woo, I donate it to charity)
Take a cranky, I be smackin' the ceiling, uh
I call my Minion my children (children)
I call my children my Minions (ha, hey, bel, la bastichi)
We takin' over the world (the world) (la papaya, du la potato)
We make a whole lot of millions
