		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you help me?
I think I'm drowning
And if I was, would you stay or would you go?
Can you see me?
Am I fading?
'Cause I feel like I'm still searching for my soul

It's okay for you to leave, I know
I've been through it once upon a broken road
Pain's my only home
I've learned to be alone
Feared the sea out of mystery
But now the sea is where I wanna be
Quiet and unknown
But pain's my only home

Do-do-do
Do-do-ooh
Hmm

Are you worth me?
'Cause I think I'm crazy
And if I am, please feel free to walk away
You don't hurt me
I hurt myself
And even if you killed me, I'd still feel the same

It's okay for you to leave, I know
I've been through it once upon a broken road
Pain's my only home
I've learned to be alone
Feared the sea out of mystery
But now the sea is where I wanna be
Quiet and unknown
But pain's my only home

Do-do-do
Do-do-ooh, quiet and unknown
Hmm, but pain's my only home

Do-do-do
Do-do-ooh, quiet and unknown
Hmm, but pain's my only home
