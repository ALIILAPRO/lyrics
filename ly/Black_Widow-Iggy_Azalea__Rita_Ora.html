		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me
And I'm gonna show you
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to somethin', likin' to lovin'
It was us against the world and now we just fuckin'
It's like I loved you so much and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you never mean
Like it'll last forever but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last but now you got a mirror
And as it all plays out I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (it's all over with now)

I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show you (show 'em what? Show 'em what?)
What's really crazy
You should've known better
Then to mess with me harder (it's all over with now)
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

(Black, black widow, baby)
I'm gonna lo-lo-lo-love you until it hurts
Just to get you I'm doin' whatever works
You ain't never met nobody
That'll do you how I do ya
That'll bring you to your knees
Praise, Jesus, hallelujah
I'ma make you beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breath for it
'Til you do any and everythin' for it
I want you to fiend for it
Wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air
And you lean forward
'Til they have a CAT scan to check on your mind
And it's nothin' but me on it (on it, on it)
Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours when you want it
I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at
I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here is fatal attraction
So I take it all or I don't want shh

You used to be thirsty for me (right)
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, the web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace (it's all over with now)

I'm gonna love you
Until you hate me (right)
And I'm gonna show you (show 'em what? Show 'em what?)
What's really crazy (woah)
You should've known better
Then to mess with me harder
I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Black, black, black, black widow, baby
