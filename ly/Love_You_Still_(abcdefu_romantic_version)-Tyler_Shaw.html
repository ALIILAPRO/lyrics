		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I love you still
And you know I always will
'Til the end of time
I won't change my mind

I swear I'll always give my best, no pretending
Give you breakfast in bed every morning
There ain't no answer to this complex question
I just keep falling for you every day

Won't ever take up too much time or attention
Take a second just to make our connection
I would do anything for your affection
Kinda fun tryna go about it all the wrong ways

I'm just so into you, I wanna let it all out
You're so perfectly fine
I could talk all day but let me spell it out
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H

I love you still
And you know I always will
'Til the end of time
I won't change my mind
Love you, I'll be here
I will never disappear
Said forever, I swear
So I will be there

You said you didn't wanna be like everybody else
Wanted something only you and I can have ourselves
Picture perfect isn't something that I've ever felt
Love when you smile right in front of me

I'm just so into you, I wanna let it all out
You're so perfectly fine
I could talk all day but let me spell it out
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H

I love you still
And you know I always will
'Til the end of time
I won't change my mind
Love you, I'll be here
I will never disappear
Said forever, I swear
So I will be there

I love you still
And you know I always will
'Til the end of time
I won't change my mind
Love you, I'll be here
I will never disappear
Said forever, I swear
So I will be there
