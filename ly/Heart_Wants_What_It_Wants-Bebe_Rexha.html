		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart only wants what it wants, what it wants, what it wants 
'Til it doesn't 
I can't promise you love it was love, it was love, it was love 
'Til it wasn't, oh

Already met a man like you 
Already seen all your moves 
One step ahead I'm on to you 
I feel nothing 
When we're loving when we're touching, so 

Go ahead and cry a river (go ahead and cry a river) 
You can go and fill the sea (you can go and fill the sea) 
Don't you know that you're just a game to me 

My heart only wants what it wants, what it wants, what it wants 
'Til it doesn't 
I can't promise you love, it was love, it was love, it was love 
'Til it wasn't, oh

So good 'til I get enough 
So good 'til I give it up 
So good but I'm only zoned on you, 'cause
My heart only wants what it wants, what it wants, what it wants 
'Til it doesn't, oh

I've learned it all and numbed the pain 
There's just so many ways a heart can break 
Can't hold a candle in the rain 
I feel nothing 
When we're touching when we're loving, so 

Go ahead and cry a river (go ahead and cry a river) 
You can go and fill the sea (go and fill the sea)
Don't you know that you're just a game to me 

My heart only wants what it wants, what it wants, what it wants 
'Til it doesn't 
I can't promise you love, it was love, it was love, it was love 
'Til it wasn't, oh

So good 'til I get enough 
So good 'til I give it up 
So good but I'm only zoned on you, 'cause
My heart only wants what it wants, what it wants, what it wants
'Til it doesn't 

And it don't want you-ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh-ooh)
You-ooh-ooh ('til, 'til, 'til it doesn't)
You-ooh-ooh 
And it don't want you-ooh-ooh ('til, 'til, 'til it doesn't)

'Til, 'til, 'til it doesn't
