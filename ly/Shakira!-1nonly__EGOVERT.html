		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (Woo, NateGoyard)
I got so much motherfucking designer on right now

Break it down, bring it back, make it clap
I got three old thots, new guap, where it at?
Thick bitches on my line and you know they got a strap
Pulled up wit' a .9, .45, scope attached
Like whoa, I ain't fuckin' with these hoes
I pull up the greatest and now I'm selling all these shows
Doing this 'til I make it because you know that's how I go
Got me all in her playlists because
She fuck with me the most, like damn

Break it down, bring it back, make it clap
I got three old thots, new guap, where it at?
Thick bitches on my line and you know they got a strap
Pulled up wit' a .9, .45, scope attached
Like whoa, I ain't fuckin' with these hoes
I pull up the greatest and now I'm selling all these shows
Doing this 'til I make it because you know that's how I go
Got me all in her playlists because
She fuck with me the most, like damn

Ayy bust it down, bust it down, bust it down, bust it (bust it)
I just fucked a fangirl flew her out from Russia (whoa)
I just spent 3K, what the fuck a budget?
Chrome Heart jeans, 10K can't touch 'em
Shake them hips that don't lie like Shakira
I'm so damn high in da coupe I'm T'd up
I don't drink Tito's, only drink expensive liquor
Fuckin' on yo' bitch in my green Prada slippers
She said, "EGO, oh my God, you're underrated"
She got itty bitty titties I bust upon 'em quickly
I bought that bitch Versace garments just because of pity
If she is a Fashion Nova bitch she cannot be with me
I pull up with the .55, pocket rocket, pow pow
Aim it at yo' top top, while she gimme top top
My bruddas on top top, yo' bruddas just fall off
My dick make her jaw lock like she took some M rock (Molly)
Hey, yo, I'm the greatest (no cap)
Every single time I drop, yo' bitch add me to her playlist
And I know her boyfriend get mad when she play this
And he always complain when she say I'm her favorite

Break it down, bring it back, make it clap
I got three old thots, new guap, where it at?
Thick bitches on my line and you know they got a strap
Pulled up wit' a .9, .45, scope attached
Like whoa, I ain't fuckin' with these hoes
I pull up the greatest and now I'm selling all these shows
Doing this 'til I make it because you know that's how I go
Got me all in her playlists because
She fuck with me the most, like damn

Break it down, bring it back, make it clap
I got three old thots, new guap, where it at?
Thick bitches on my line and you know they got a strap
Pulled up wit' a .9, .45, scope attached
Like whoa, I ain't fuckin' with these hoes
I pull up the greatest and now I'm selling all these shows
Doing this 'til I make it because you know that's how I go
Got me all in her playlists because
She fuck with me the most, like damn

The world is yours
