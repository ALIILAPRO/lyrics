		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I leave this world with a glint in my eye
I've untold all of my lies, and all the joy
I leave behind, I'll miss you too
Love of mine

Today no tombstone, no goodbyes
My soul is full, watch it fly
When I return, prodigal son
This wounded world will be as one
Be as one

I leave this world a hopeful song
Without a tear, I will prolong
My bruises healed, my scars are gone
And every beating made me strong
So please don't cry, don't think it's wrong
My soul is pure, it sings along
When I return a better me
You'll see that sorrow can set you free

Set you free
Set you free (I'll set you free)
Set you free (I'll set you free)

I leave this world to you all
The constellations will never fall
And if you're fearful, bare no mind
The sun will rise, heed your call

No open casket, no sullen wake
Your heart will mend if you break
So without greed, and without pride
Shout I'm alive, I am alive

I'll set you free
I am alive
I'll set you free
I am alive

I'll set you free
I am alive
I'll set you free
I am alive

I'll set you free
I'll set you free
