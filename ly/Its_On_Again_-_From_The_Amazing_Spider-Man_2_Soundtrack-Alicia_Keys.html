		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
Battle wounds on me, you watching me lick 'em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by her, what?

I am a freedom fighter
The name that history wrote
And even through disaster
Eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back
There's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired
Go is the only word I know

And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

I'll bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say it's on again
It's on again, whoa
The world don't stop, it's on again
It's on again, whoa

I am a lonely hero
Trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind
Sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness
I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish
We do it for the people

And the night is takin' over
And the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen
And it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken
By the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward

I'll bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say it's on again
It's on again, whoa
The world don't stop, it's on again
It's on again, whoa

Say the work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto (ghetto)

How I go on, go on
I'll bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say it's on again
It's on again, whoa
The world don't stop, it's on again
It's on again, whoa
