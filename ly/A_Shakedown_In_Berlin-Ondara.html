		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well it's been a long time coming
Well it's been a long time coming
I don't know how to let you go
Will you show me samantha held her hair
Deliberating a shake down
My heart it was a spare
Anticipating a break down
Everyone was talking loud
We were on the second round
I was ready working overtime

Well it's been a long time coming
Well it's been a long time coming
I don't know, how to let you go
Will you show me some other one was there
Searching for courage on a bass line
I was already bare
Watching you driving through the state-linе
Saying that you want me now
Is like drinking water from thе ground
I was ready curving up my time

Well it's been a long time coming
Well it's been a long time coming
I don't know, How to let you
I don't know how to let you go
Will you show me
I don't know how to let you go
Will you show me
