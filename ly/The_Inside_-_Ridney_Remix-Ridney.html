		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No matter how he looks baby
Give up
It's what's up front that counts

The inside
Give up
No matter how he looks baby
Give up
No matter how he looks baby
Give up

It's what's up front that counts

You see when you got somebody that loves you
You know they love
It's what's up front that counts
You see that
No matter how he looks baby
No matter how he looks baby

The inside
The inside
It's what's up front that counts

The inside
Give up
No matter how he looks baby
Give up
No matter how he looks baby
Give up

You see that
It's what's up front that counts


Give up
Give up
Give up
Counts
