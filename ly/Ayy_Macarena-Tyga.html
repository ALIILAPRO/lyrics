		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dale a tu cuerpo alegría Macarena
Que tu cuerpo pa' darle alegría y cosa buena
Dale a tu cuerpo alegría, Macarena
Hey Macarena (aight, uh)

Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (ayy)
Put the chopper on a nigga, turn him to a sprinter (yee)
Bitches on my dick, told 'em give me one minute (one minute)
Ayy, Macarena, aight (ayy)
Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (woo)
Put the chopper on a nigga, turn him to a sprinter (woah)
Bitches on my dick, tell 'em give me one minute (minute)
Ayy, Macarena, aight (ayy)

Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (hah)
Bitches on my stick, but my name ain't Harry Potter (no)
She lick it up, make it disappear like ta-da (wow)
She ask for some dollars, now the bitch get nada (nothing)
And I'm in this bitch for my clique, what? (Clique, what?)
I'ma throw twenty racks on the bitch, what? (Bitch, what?)
Three phones on my lap (ayy), world on my back (back)
She gon' be tapped in if a nigga tapped (tap in)
Look like someone that I used to know (used to)
Undefeated with the bitches, I'm invincible
Diamond set invisible, nigga, I invented you
Want me to be miserable, but I can never miss a ho (woo, uh)

Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (hah)
Put the chopper on a nigga, turn him to a sprinter (baow)
Bitches on my dick, told 'em give me one minute (one minute)
Ayy, Macarena, aight (ayy)
Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (go)
Put the chopper on a nigga, turn him to a sprinter (boom)
Bitches on my dick, tell 'em give me one minute (one minute)
Ayy, Macarena, aight (ayy)

I find a spot, then I post up (woo)
Bitches wanna know if I'm single, tell her, "yes, sir" (yeah)
And I seen you dance on the 'gram, tell her shake some'
I ain't even gon' lie, I'ma eat the chocha (yeah)
And I like it when she got the toes out, yeah (tom ford)
Get you iced down, now you glowed out (bust down)
Got a new bitch (new bitch), took a new route (new route)
She a rockstar (rockstar), that's no doubt (no doubt)
I'm a fire to the flame, don't be burning me out (hot)
I'm the nigga that she told you not to worry about (hot)
Why you think she in a rush when she leaving the house?
I'ma sip, I'ma clip, I'ma dip, then I'm out (ayy)

Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (bih')
Put the chopper on a nigga, turn him to a sprinter (baow)
Bitches on my dick, told 'em give me one minute (yeah)
Ayy, Macarena, aight (woo)
Ayy, Macarena, Macarena, Macarena (ayy)
Put the chopper on a nigga, turn him to a sprinter (boom)
Bitches on my dick, tell 'em give me one minute (one minute)
Ayy, Macarena, aight
