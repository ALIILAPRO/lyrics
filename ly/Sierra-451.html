		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In the middle of the city, fucked up, baby
And I ain't really have nobody I could call
And this liquor got me talkin' hella crazy
Baby
But easily right now, I'd like to hit it raw
And you go out in that dress to break necks
Baby and that's the reason why I'm
Saying "Put it on"
A couple shots of 42, I'm fired up, baby
And we can go until the sun comes up

Oh yeah, yeah still got half a pill
We can split it right here
And that's the move right there
Bitches imitating what you do, baby
And all these niggas wanna do is use you
Babe but I won't let 'em catch up
To the coupe, oh yeah, to the coupe
Yeah, yeah, coupe, yeah, yeah
I'm preeing the lace through your top
I can't deny ya
I already know what's 'bout to happen
Like a writer
I can't be like this with someone else, uh
I don't wanna do this by myself
I would've just poured up a glass of the gin
And drank that shit until my heart gave in
'Cause I can't take it no more
I been doing this too long
I'm gettin' closer and closer to
Ending it all, it all, it all

In the middle of the city, fucked up, baby
And I ain't really have nobody I could call
And this liquor got me talkin' hella crazy
Baby
But easily right now, I'd like to hit it raw
And you go out in that dress to break necks
Baby and it's the reason why I'm
Saying "Put it on"
A couple shots of 42 and then I'm up, baby
And we can go until the sun comes up
