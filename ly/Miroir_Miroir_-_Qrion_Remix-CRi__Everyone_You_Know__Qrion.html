		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is there a song
Maybe some chords
Is there a melody that I could sing
That you ain't heard before

Is there a God
Is there a prayer
Is there an answer to all of my questions

With blue eyes
And blonde hair

Or is there just you
Or is there just you

Is there a song
Maybe some chords
Is there a melody that I could sing
That you ain't heard before

Is there a God
Is there a prayer
Is there an answer to all of my questions

With blue eyes
And blonde hair
Or is there just you
Or is there just you
Or is there just you
Or is there just you
