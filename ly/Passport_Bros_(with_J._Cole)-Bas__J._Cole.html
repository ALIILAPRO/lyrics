		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Clase Azul got me singin', "I love you too"

No more dares, only truths, girl, how 'bout we go?
Go up shelf, we not drinkin' Casamigos
Are you impaired? You're not there, but I'm a little
Clase Azul got me singin', "I love you too"

Bassy, Captain Clase, girl, come drive my boat
Ring that bell, bet they follow wherever we go
DZL will got that Captain Morgan, pour him three more
Then stand up, please
Let me see you put your hands on your knees

No more dares, only truths, girl, how 'bout we go?
Go up shelf, we not drinkin' Casamigos
Are you impaired? You're not there, but I'm a little
Clase Azul got me singin', "I love you too"

Where you work on the weekend?
Where you go on a Sunday?
Heard that place is the hot spot
I'ma take you to brunch there
I'ma get you the Rollie
I'ma take you to Italy
I'ma need you to show me everything that's gon' be

No more dares, only truths, girl, how 'bout we go?
Go up shelf, we not drinkin' Casamigos
Are you impaired? You're not there, but I'm a little
Clase Azul got me singin'-

Yeah, Cole and Bassy, the passport bros
But we ain't shellin' out cash for hoes
No, I'm a little old fashioned
Coast to coast out in Shoko, smashing
Shots of Clase, me and lil' Bassy in Barcelona
The news just dropped, I'm a partial owner
What can I say?
Tell coach Cliff to suit me up and I'll play
I'm winning
We at Tape Mayfair, you can't get in
The little back room where not many fit in
The prettiest girls all be grinnin'
They say I'm they favorite
They want me to lay with, it's blatant
Now we on our M.I.A. shit, we just hit playa
They're playing the Durk song, damn, I'm on fire
A little redbone
She looks like Mya and want me to try her, oh Lord

No more dares, only truths, girl, how 'bout we go?
Go up shelf, we not drinkin' Casamigos
Are you impaired? You're not there, but I'm a little
Clase Azul got me singin', "I love you too"
