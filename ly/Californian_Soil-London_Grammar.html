		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I left my soul 
On Californian soil
And I left my pride
With that woman by my side
I never had a willing hand
And I never had a plan
But I'm glad I found you here
But I'm glad I've got you here

But I never had a name
And I never felt the same
They keep on trying oh
And they will keep on trying it oh
And they will keep on trying it oh
And I never felt the same

I am young, I am old
And so you do what you're told
I never had a willing hand
And so you pack up all your bags
But I'm glad I've got you here
Well I'm glad I've got you here
But I never felt the same
And this life is just a game 

They keep on trying it, oh
They keep on trying it, oh
And they will keep on trying it oh
Until you never feel the same
