		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't fuck with anybody
And I don't fuck with myself
Every single fucking day I wish I could be someone else
I'm a fucking burden
So I roll up and burn it
Til' I'm not fucking hurting
While I whip in a hearse yuh
I don't fuck with anybody
And I don't fuck with myself
Every single fucking day I wish I could be someone else
I'm a fucking burden
So I roll up and burn it
Til' I'm not fucking hurting
While I whip in a hearse yuh
Rolling round the 4 rolling dutch up for my lungs yah
Bill Nye with the beaker while I'm mixing chemicals yah
Mixing all my drugs every night it ain't for fun yah
Celebrate the fact that I might not wake up tomorrow
All the time
I done waste
In disguise
Of my face
I don't rise
I'm gon' lay
I'm so high
Out of faith
Out of, motivation to get up and get elated
I think life ain't what you make it
Life is nothing but a payment yuh
Every night I go to sleep
Make a wish I wasn't me
Every day I fail to see
Any light in front of me
Every night I go to sleep
Make a wish I wasn't me
Every day I fail to see
Any light in front of me
I don't fuck with anybody
And I don't fuck with myself
Every single fucking day I wish I could be someone else
I'm a fucking burden
So I roll up and burn it
Til' I'm not fucking hurting
While I whip in a hearse yuh
I don't fuck with anybody
And I don't fuck with myself
Every single fucking day I wish I could be someone else
I'm a fucking burden
So I roll up and burn it
Til' I'm not fucking hurting
While I whip in a hearse yuh
Every night I go to sleep
Make a wish I wasn't me
Every day I fail to see
Any light in front of me
Every night I go to sleep
Make a wish I wasn't me
Every day I fail to see
Any light in front of me
Every night I go to sleep
Make a wish I wasn't me
Every day I fail to see
Any light in front of me
Every night I go to sleep
Make a wish I wasn't me
Every day I fail to see
Any light in front of me
