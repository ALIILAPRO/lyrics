		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream (in my dream)
Forgive me my weakness but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go
Want you in my life

Your arms are my castle 
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry (that I cry)
The good and the bad times 
We've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side

'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so?
I can't let you go
Want you in my life

'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast?
I want this to last
Need you by my side
