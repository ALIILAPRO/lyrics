		<p>
		  Telephone ring the unknown (what you want?)
My friends don't leave me alone (yeah, yeah, yeah)
The night is getting too old (yeah)
My feelings on hold (hold)
Never been so bold (yeah)
We've been here before (go, go, go)

Take me down to the coast on Sunday morning (oh)
I gotta shake off this bad cold (woo)
I wanna see the world with you, oh, darling (woo)
But just gotta shake off this bad cold

I just wanna shake off this bad cold
I just wanna shake off this bad cold (woo, let's go)

My enemies do not know (mh, I cut them slack)
My lasers ready to blow (mh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I tell myself to let go (go)
But don't let it show (no)
You'll get them involved (yeah)
We've been here before (go, go, go)

Take me down to the coast on Sunday morning (oh)
I gotta shake off this bad cold (woo)
I wanna see the world with you, oh, darling (woo)
But just gotta shake off this bad cold

I just wanna shake off this bad cold
I just wanna shake off this bad cold (cold)

The crosswalk is on red light
Wavy lines running through your hair
And you're no longer here
Have you ever been here?
The crosswalk is on green light
I miss the moments when I really cared
You're no longer here
Have you ever been-?

Your eyes are running cold (yeah, yeah)
Sometimes it's hard to show (yeah, yeah)
I lied to let you go (yeah, yeah)
And now you'll never know (yeah, yeah)

(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
