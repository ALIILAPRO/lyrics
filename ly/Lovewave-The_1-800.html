		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It didn't make sense
How it got to be this way
Emotions are your weakness
That's your greatest mistake
And cheers to all my friends
Well maybe they had your back from the beginning
But you only had to do it once
You only had to fake it once
You made friends with the enemy
I had to cut them off
Make peace with your past
Pay it off if you must
I thought
That maybe you were on your way
I had to move on
From the things I shouldn't, know I shouldn't, know I shouldn't say
Making sure
That you are her
I had to make sure
That you are her
Don't look at me the same
Im not who I was
There's no going back
Take off from here and run
So please don't follow me
As I walk into the dark
All this pressure in your heart
I can feel it from this far
And I'll never stop to believe
You know I wasn't listening
So just
Celebrate the mistake and accept the hate
And if you ever felt trapped
I can relate
No one's ever alone
So dry your tears now
And let me take you home
Making sure
That you are her
I had to make sure
That you are her
