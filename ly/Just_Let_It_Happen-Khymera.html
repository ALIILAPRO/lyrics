		  Just Let It Happen

 I watch in silence to give you guidance
There's always something trying to break you
You felt so headstrong, how could things go wrong?
Your overthinking is getting you nowhere

And you feel like your heart has fallen from heaven
So lets climb, our wings sometimes let us down

Every time you see the light of day
It should dry those tears away 
We must all accept the price we pay
Just let it happen
It's a beaten road to travel down
Get yourself off of the ground
There will be no need to turn around 
Just let it happen

The days, they rush by. We learn or just try
There's no disgrace in waiting for wisdom 
You search for a meaning to logical reasoning 
The answer's in you but can you hear?

Every time you see the light of day
It should dry those tears away 
We must all accept the price we pay
Just let it happen
It's a beaten road to travel down
Get yourself off of the ground
There will be no need to turn around 
Just let it happen
