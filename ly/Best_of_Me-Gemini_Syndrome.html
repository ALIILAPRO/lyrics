		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take another trip around the world again
Buy the ticket, take the ride
No one took the time to show you anything
Boy you’re lucky you survived

Seems to be you always get the best of me 
And I don’t seem to mind
I suppose that I could build a better me
But I don’t have the time

Sitting back just waiting for the world to end
Fighting just to stay alive
No one seems to recognize the war within
And I’m too scared to go outside

Seems to be you always get the best of me 
And I don’t seem to mind
I suppose that I could build a better me
But I don’t have the time

Buy the ticket take the ride
Buy the ticket take the ride
Buy the ticket take the ride
Buy the ticket take the ride

Seems to be you always get the best of me 
And I don’t seem to mind
I suppose that I could build a better me
But I don’t have the time

Seems you always get the best of me
Seems you always get the best of me
Seems you always get the best of me
