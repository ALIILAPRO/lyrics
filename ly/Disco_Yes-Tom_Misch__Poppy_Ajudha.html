		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I want to stay
But I need to go
I want to be the best for you
But I just don't know what to do
'Cause baby, yes I've cried for you
The time we have spent together
Riding through this English weather

And as the pressure builds
So does the tension between you and me
Time has gone so fast
Watching the leaves fall from our tree

Baby I just want you to know
I still love you
Love you
Love you
Love you (love you, love you)

And the grass is always greener
On the other side
Maybe you should come and take a trip sometime
Oh you seem keener
When day turn to night
But you trippin out your mind
Baby, tell me it's a sign

As the pressure builds
So does the tension between you and me
Time has gone so fast
Watching the leaves fall from our tree

Baby I just want you to know
I still love you
Love you
Love you
Love you (love you)
