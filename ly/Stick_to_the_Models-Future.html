		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, bro, is that Jambo?
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob
Yeah, Pluto
Went through the clouds, ain't I never, never comin' down
Never comin' down, oh
Yeah yeah, yeah

Told my bitch to find us a bitch we can fuck on together tomorrow
Fuckin' my wrist up, fuckin' a brick up, yeah, go'n and hop on a charter
I go to sprintin', I go to take off for cash, yeah, I'm not a jogger
I went to Neptune, I went to Mars, yeah, streets get hotter than lava
'Cause I'm in that mode, everything on go, I got a deal with my goggles
Suicide doors, oh, reachin' my goals, thankin' my heavenly father
I'm on my grind, ain't no slowin' down, I done put up the bottle
I'm on that pretty boy shit, yeah, I'ma just stick to the models

I'ma just stick to the models and hit it
I'ma just stick to the guala and get it
I can't come up short, I'm goin' to get it
I can afford to keep all my bitches
I got her laid up, she bad and sadity
I got my weight up, I'm carryin' my city
I got vicarious, my ears, they blurry
Put up, no worries, she know she insured
I keep it real, ain't talkin' absurd
I lost the feelin' of drankin' on syrup
Put up them M's, my Federal Reserve
Tell you the truth, I got caught in the urge
Tell you the truth, I come up from the dirt
She play with no panties, a lil' bitty skirt
I hit it on Xanax and I made it squirt
A really rich nigga, and I'm goin' berserk

Told my bitch to find us a bitch we can fuck on together tomorrow
Fuckin' my wrist up, fuckin' a brick up, yeah, go'n and hop on a charter
I go to sprintin', I go to take off for cash, yeah, I'm not a jogger
I went to Neptune, I went to Mars, yeah, streets get hotter than lava
'Cause I'm in that mode, everything on go, I got a deal with my goggles
Suicide doors, oh, reachin' my goals, thankin' my heavenly father
I'm on my grind, ain't no slowin' down, I done put up the bottle
I'm on that pretty boy shit, yeah, I'ma just stick to the models

I got two blonde snow bunnies
Sendin' me pics to the 'Gram
I got some bitches, they linin' up
They wanna fuck me just 'cause who I am
I fucked them gold digging bitches
I never will love her or trust her, but pay her
Lookin' out for her, but ain't takin' care of her
She know it ain't no way in hell
I keep it real with you, keep it real with me
That's all we can do
Know how to deal with you, know how to deal with me
Shawty get wet as a pool
We call it fair game
When it come down to my bros and swappin' the hoes
I send my main thang to get your main thang
We gon' fuck that hoe on the low

Told my bitch to find us a bitch we can fuck on together tomorrow
Fuckin' my wrist up, fuckin' a brick up, yeah, go'n and hop on a charter
I go to sprintin', I go to take off for cash, yeah, I'm not a jogger
I went to Neptune, I went to Mars, yeah, streets get hotter than lava
'Cause I'm in that mode, everything on go, I got a deal with my goggles
Suicide doors, oh, reachin' my goals, thankin' my heavenly father
I'm on my grind, ain't no slowin' down, I done put up the bottle
I'm on that pretty boy shit, yeah, I'ma just stick to the models

I keep it real, ain't talkin' absurd
I lost the feelin' of drankin' on syrup
Put up them M's, my Federal Reserve
Tell you the truth, I got caught in the urge
Two blonde snow bunnies
Sendin' me pics to the 'Gram
Deal with you
Who know how to deal with you, know how to deal with me
Shawty get wet as a pool
Who know how to
Deal with you
