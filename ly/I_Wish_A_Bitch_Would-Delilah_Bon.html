		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish a bitch would when I'm walking down the street
I wish a bitch would just to find some release
Don't trust no man
Don't trust the police
I wish a bitch would

I wish a bitch would when I'm walking down the street
I wish a bitch would just to find some release
Don't trust no man
Don't trust the police
I wish a bitch would

Today I woke up wish I didn't
Wanna break somebody's face
I read the news another story
Of a girl murdered and raped
It was a cop, he had a family
He didn't know her
Didn't know, didn't know, didn't know

Intrusive thoughts run through my mind
When I'm out alone, hands by my side
And I can't help thinking maybe one day
It'd be my body they find
But part of me just wants to fight
Most of me is sick and tired
Part of me just wants to lose my fucking shit
And let him have it bitch no

Not this time won't go your way
You can beg me to play
Play along with your games
When I'm the one that's screaming no
When I'm the one that's screaming please
Get him down on his knees
Role reverse look at me
Aren't I sweet

I am the rapture, your captor
Rip every single limb off of this child molester
Inside me are the cries of every grown up you fucked up
Who cannot sleep at night because of flashbacks of childhood
The innocence you took and fuck
I won't let you get away
The justice system might have failed
But tonight i'll paint this town red for those that you took
Look you right in your face
See this girl say her name
Say her name, say her name, say her name

I wish a bitch would when I'm walking down the street
I wish a bitch would just to find some release
Don't trust no man
Don't trust the police
I wish a bitch would

I wish a bitch would when I'm walking down the street
I wish a bitch would just to find some release
Don't trust no man
Don't trust the police
I wish a bitch would

Cold case after cold case
Those bodies in the ground
How do you feel knowing you covered it up
Knowing she'll never be found
How do you sleep
How do you eat
How do you live with such inner peace
How do you sit with your wife and your kids
And just carry on acting so normal like this

Not enough evidence found at the scene
But how do we trust, trust the police
How do we ever go out on our own and truly feels safe 'cos I really don't
So they're gonna blame girls for their clothes
But what does that even mean
She was eleven years old, only a child
Wearing a hoodie and jeans
The cycle repeats
I feel the rage inside
I feel the rage inside
A demon in me
I wanna make em' pay
I wanna make em' bleed
Cos they don't feel this
Trauma, trauma, trauma, traum, trauma

Evil little predator your name ain't on no register
The system failed that little boy
But I am here to rid him of his monster
Under the bed, under the bed, under the bed
It's all in his head, he was afraid, he was so scared
Never again, never-a-never again

Never again, never again, never again
Never-a-never again
Never again, never again, never again
Never-a-never again
Never again, never again, never again
Never-a-never again
Never again, never again, never-a

I wish a bitch would when I'm walking down the street
I wish a bitch would just to find some release
Don't trust no man
Don't trust the police
I wish a bitch would
Never again, never again

I wish a bitch would when I'm walking down the street
I wish a bitch would just to find some release
Don't trust no man
Don't trust the police
I wish a bitch would
Never again, never again

I wish a bitch would
Never again, never again
I wish a bitch would
Never again, never again
I wish a bitch would
Never again, never again
I wish a bitch would
Never again, never again
I wish a bitch would
