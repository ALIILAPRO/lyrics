		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The light of day
Gives me no relief
Because I see you
You in everything

You've frozen my thoughts
You've frozen me out
I'm in the same place
You left me, baby

Oh, our ending
Lit a fuse in my heart
Devouring, devouring
The night, the night
Chilled my bones with
A seething quiet, shaking me

Oh, our ending
Lit a fuse in my heart
Devouring, devouring
The night, the night
Chilled my bones with
A seething quiet, shaking me

Tell me, tell me
Since you went away
Does the space breathe?
Do you feel a change?
Is this the way
You thought it would be?
Do you feel the same
Without me, darling?

You have my arms
You have my legs
We are one contented skin
We are one continued pain
Oh, our meeting
Lit a fuse in my heart
Devoured me, devoured me

You have my arms (the light of day)
You have my legs
We are one contented skin (gives me no relief)
We are one continued pain
Oh, our meeting (tell me, tell me)
Lit a fuse in my heart
Devoured me (since you went away), devoured me

You have my arms (the light of day)
You have my legs
We are one continued skin (gives me no relief)
We are one continued pain
Oh, our meeting (tell me, tell me)
Lit a fuse in my heart
Devoured me, devoured me
