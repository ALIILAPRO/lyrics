		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The workers all march to the beat of the drum
Their spirits are broken
They have nowhere to run

They dream of courage and a loaded gun
But the slaves all know
They better bite their tongue
Track marks across the planet 
Are there any veins left for them to infect?
They would kill one another just to disconnect 

Three cheers for desperation
God bless the Godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win 
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin

The workers all march to the beat of the drum
They fell into the trap, taken one by one
The medicine is poison, but it makes them numb
'Cause all that they feel is pain and regret
Existence is just something they would rather forget 

Three cheers for desperation
God bless the Godforsaken
We will arm them to the teeth
To fight, to fight the war on peace

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win 
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin

Is this freedom?
Is this the life you chose?
If this is living the dream, we've hit an all-time low

All love is lost, so carry the cross
'Cause there's no human in us left
We are music made for the deaf
They play a game that they know they'll never win 
Sick and tired of the world they're living in
The messiah showed up high on heroin
On heroin
