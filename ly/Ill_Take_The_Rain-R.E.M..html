		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The rain came down the rain came down
The rain came down on me
The wind blew strong and summer's song
Fades to memory

I knew you when i loved you then
In summer's yawn now helpless
You laid me bare you marked me there
The promises we made

I used to think as birds take wing
They sing through life so why can't we?
We cling to this and claim the best
If this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain i'll take the rain

The nighttime creases summer schemes
And stretches out to stay
The sun shines down you came around
You loved the easy days but now the sun
The winter's come i wanted just to say
That if I hold i'd hoped you'd fold
Open up inside, inside of me

I used to think as birds take wing
They sing through life so why can't we?
We cling to this and claim the best
If this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain i'll take the rain

This winter's song i'll sing along
I've searched it's still refrain
I'll walk alone if given this, take wing
Celebrate the rain

I used to think as birds take wing
They sing through life so why can't we?
We cling to this and claim the best
If this is what you're offering
I'll take the rain i'll take the rain
I'll take the rain

I'll take the rain i'll take the rain
I'll take the rain i'll take the rain
I'll take the rain i'll take the rain
