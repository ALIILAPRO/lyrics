		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Color me your color, baby
Color me your car
Color me your color, darling
I know who you are
Come up off your color chart
I know where you're coming from

Call me (call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (call me) I'll arrive
You can call me any day or night
Call me

Cover me with kisses, baby
Cover me with love
Roll me in designer sheets
I'll never get enough
Emotions come, I don't know why
Cover up love's alibi

Call me (call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (call me) I'll arrive
When you're ready we can share the wine
Call me

Ooh-ooh, he speaks the languages of love
Ooh-ooh, amore, chiamami, chiamami
Ooh-ooh, appelle-moi mon cheri, appelle-moi
Anytime, any place, anywhere, any way
Anytime, any place, anywhere, any day, any way

Call me (call me) my love
Call me, call me any, anytime
Call me (call me) for a ride
Call me, call me for some overtime
Call me (call me) in my life
Call me, call me in a sweet design
Call me (call me), call me for your lover's lover's alibi
Call me (call me) on the line
Call me, call me any, anytime

Call me (call me)
Ooh, call me, mm-hmm
Call me (call me) my love
Call me, call me
