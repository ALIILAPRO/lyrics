Maroon 5
Let's go

Yo, I got them Now & Laters and Jolly Ranchers, too
It ain't a question but I got the answers, too
These shoes is Cavalli, and the pants is, too
When I see him I'ma strip like the dancers do
I'ma show them how to do it like the pamphlets do
Show these girls how to do it off campus, too
Yo, as long as you know he got the baddest, I'm flattered
I'm the only one that he answers to
And if you need it then I'ma put it on ya
Ain't nothin' sweeter, you want this sugar, don't ya?
Up, down, inside, water park it, slip slide
Woulda, coulda, shoulda got ya sugar, get ya sugar

Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Ay)

My broken pieces
You pick 'em up
Don't leave me hanging, hanging
Come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm living for

I don't wanna be needing your love (hey)
I just wanna be deep in your love (hey)
And it's killing me when you're away, ooh, baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar
Yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Yeah)

I want that red velvet
I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be your man, there ain't no other way
'Cause, girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
I don't wanna play no games
You don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No make-up on, that's my sugar

Your sugar
Yes, please (please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
I'm right here (I'm right here)
'Cause I need ('cause I need)
Little love, a little sympathy (so baby) 
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar (sugar)
Yes, please (yes please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)

Your sugar
Yes, please (ooh)
Won't you come and put it down on me? (Down on me)
I'm right here (right here)
'Cause I need ('cause I need)
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good loving
Make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar (your sugar)
Yes, please (yes, please)
Won't you come and put it down on me? 

Down on me, down on me
Ooh!
