		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  cnother pulse from everybody in the room
c woolen glance but I'm not ready to attune
I wanna call it off and leave 'em where it looms
I wanna dance I wanna make a perfect view 

Lay me down
What did you do
To keep yourself around
See me out
I know what it means
Left it on the ground 

You got what you wanted (no fun)
I won't let you down 
But if you could see it (undone)
cnd turn it upside down
I'm not gonna beat it (say something)
Tell me it's not fair
You got what you needed (all done)
When I wasn't there 

I'm up the wall waiting forever to amend
The water coming up its cooling off my neck
I wanna float around it wear it to the tread
I wanna slip away but right before it ends 

Lay me down
What did you do
To keep yourself around
See me out
I know what it means
Left it on the ground 

You got what you wanted (no fun)
I won't let you down 
But if you could see it (undone)
cnd turn it upside down
I'm not gonna beat it (say something)
Tell me it's not fair
You got what you needed (all done)
When I wasn't there
