		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There were days when each hour was a war I fought to survive
There were nights full of nightmares and I dreaded closing my eyes
There were skies that burst open with a downpour to drown me alive
But the world took a spark like a match in the dark and the fire brought me to life
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die

And you'll find, there'll be mornings when the ashes and embers are cold
But you'll fight with a passion and you'll never stop 'cause you know
Yeah you know it gets better and your story is yet to be told
Every push, every shove, every war, every love
Yeah the coals are beginning to glow
So I'm fanning the flames to climb so high 'cause there's no other way we can stay alive

'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die

Don't let the fire die
It gets better
Just don't let the fire die, no

'Cause we're burning bright as we all unite
And when it's all said and done we'll shine like the sun so don't let the fire die
And we'll watch the sky as it fills with light
And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die

And though the embers are new, whatever you do just don't let the fire die
Don't let the fire die
