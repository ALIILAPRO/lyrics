		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in the jungle
I start bangin' my first bongo

Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

I went to the big town
Where there is a lot of sound
From the jungle to the city
Looking for a bigger crown

So I play my boogie
For the people of big city
But they don't go crazy
When I'm bangin' on my boogie

I'm the king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie

I'm a king without a crown, hanging loose in a big town
But I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come

They say that I'm a clown making too much dirty sound
They say there is no place for little monkey in this town
Nobody'd like to be in my place instead of me
'Cause nobody go crazy when I'm bangin' on my boogie

I'm the king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come

Bangin' on my bongo, all that swing belongs to me
I'm so happy there's nobody in my place instead of me

I'm a king without a crown hanging loose in a big town
I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come, baby
King of the bongo, king of the bongo bong
Hear me when I come

Mama was queen of the mambo
Papa was king of the Congo
Deep down in a jungle
I start bangin' my first bongo

Every monkey'd like to be
In my place instead of me
'Cause I'm the king of bongo, baby
I'm the king of bongo bong

Hear me when I come
Hear me when I come, baby (king of the bongo, king of the bongo bong)
Hear me when I come
