		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm driving to my mama
'Cause she was right about you
I feel so stupid
For ever putting my trust in you

I bet she's amazing
I guess she entertains your wish
Of having us both now
The things you did

She was my best friend
And you went behind my back
Oh wow, oh wow
Do you feel sorry now?

Fool me once, shame on you
That's okay 'cause I never knew
Fool me twice, shame on me
'Cause I put it on my jealousy

Fool me once, shame on you
Boy, you don't even get the clue
Fool me twice, shame on me
'Cause I put it on my jealousy

'Cause I put it on my jealousy

Daddy always told me
I should find myself a guy
Who loves more than I do
And buys me flowers when I cry

Clearly that's not you
And I hope you love her right
But revenge is the sweetest
An eye for an eye

She was my best friend
And you went behind my back
Oh wow, oh wow
Do you feel sorry now?

Fool me once, shame on you
That's okay 'cause I never knew
Fool me twice, shame on me
'Cause I put it on my jealousy

Fool me once, shame on you
Boy, you don't even get the clue
Fool me twice, shame on me
'Cause I put it on my jealousy

'Cause I put it on my jealousy

How can you blame me for what you did
My head is under water, but now I see it clear
I was your queen but you weren't my king
But now it doesn't matter (I washed you off my skin)

Fool me once, shame on you
That's okay 'cause I never knew
Fool me twice, shame on me
'Cause I put it on my jealousy

Fool me once, shame on you
Boy, you don't even get the clue
Fool me twice, shame on me
'Cause I put it on my jealousy

'Cause I put it on my jealousy
