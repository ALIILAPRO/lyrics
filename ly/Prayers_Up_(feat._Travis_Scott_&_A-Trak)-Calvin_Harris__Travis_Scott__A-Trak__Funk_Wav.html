		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take a molly like a million
My lil' girl like "what you doin'?"
I'm just tryna even tho my eyes
Sip and sip 'til I feel like a god
Yeah my cup overflowin'
Fucked up and you know it
I swear I feel like I'm floating
Feel like everybody knows it
Yeah, I'm up, yeah, I'm up, yeah
Everybody must know it
Yeah, I'm up, yeah, I'm up, yeah
Tell the world, yeah, I'm floatin' (it's lit!)
They ain't think I'd ever go and flex like this
Never had plans of gettin' less than this
My god, I know where the blessing is
Thank God I know where the blessing is (bless up)
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
My god, I know where the blessing is
Thank God I know where the blessing is (yeah!)

Smoking loud like to pour lean (pour lean)
Luxury wheels, that you know whip (know whip)
Mama said she wants me in the church (praise God)
Before the day they put me in a hearse (thank God)
But I just feel like God when I lick it (straight up)
If only God can judge me, then I'm innocent (straight up)
'Cause everytime I'm adding up my dividends
At the same time I have my blessings up
Yeah I'm up yeah I'm up yeah
Everybody must know it
Yeah I'm up yeah I'm up yeah
Tell the world yeah I'm floatin'
They ain't think I'd ever go and flex like this
Never had plans of getting less than this
My god, I know where the blessing is
Thank God I know where the blessing is (bless up)
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
Purple drank in my prayer cup
Whole squad sending prayers up
My god, I know where the blessing is
Thank God I know where the blessing is (yeah!)

Straight up!
Pour up!
Alright!
Straight up!
Yeah!
It's lit!
Blessing blessing blessing blessing
Alright!
