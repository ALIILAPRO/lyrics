		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Truly, truly, truly here

Into the override, how we ride the brake
Sleeker and cheaper, the wind change
Following people, they I say
Expect your incentives have paved the way

Everything is wrong, oh, everything is wrong
I guess we open time, what is now is overcome

Truly, truly, truly

I think I know why, I say what I say
Inverse achievements, I rule the daze
Am I more soulful? Am I coming down now?
Can we start over as agents of peace?

Everything is wrong, wrong, everything is wrong
All we have is time, but my heart is going wrong
We're taking a part of both of us
But nobody likes to wait
Everything is wrong, truly wrong
Everything is wrong
Everything is wrong

Truly, truly, truly

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

We made our home, without begging a pardon
We made our home, with time alone
It's taking apart the best of us
And nobody likes to wait

Everything is wrong, truly wrong
Everything is wrong
