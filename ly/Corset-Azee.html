		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My halo on my head 
Take it off with care 
You can hold my hand 
But when it goes down in bed 
I wanna feel all your strength
In between my legs
Let angels want my head 
I'll Fall without regret 

Drinking Hennessy like a contest 
You'll be under me, ‘fore the sun sets 
Strip away, my corset  
Handle me, don't slow pace
Dripping onto me, feel the heat spread
Hands all over me, like you're obsessed 
Eyes on me, your conquest
Full release, don't restrain

You say you got a thing for me
cnd then you say you're a fan of me
You saw the stain of my cherry lipstick online
Now you're craving their kiss on your thighs
Is it lust if I'm wanting you mine
Is it wrong if i'm wanting you twice
Even if it's only just for the night

I wanna feel all your strength
In between my legs
Let angels want my head 
I'll Fall without regret 

Drinking Hennessy like a contest 
You'll be under me, ‘fore the sun sets 
Strip away, my corset  
Handle me, don't slow pace
Dripping onto me, feel the heat spread
Hands all over me, like you're obsessed 
Eyes on me, your conquest
Full release, don't restrain
