		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm still here in this bed that I crawled in
I hope that I'm someone else in the morning
So take this one
Wash it down and you'll be fine
Then walk around in a floating chalk outline

But so it goes, let it be
In the gallows, I balanced on my toes
So I can breathe

But little by little, bit by bit
I push it back down with a new habit
If not for long, just for a while
I'll bury myself with a great big smile
Oh my my, oh my my
We trace ourselves in these chalk outlines
Oh my my, oh my my
Erase ourselves in these chalk outlines

Sertraline and a sip of serotonin
Don't cry 'cause there's a
Pill for everything take this one
Wash it down and you'll be fine
The feeling goes and you draw a chalk outline

And so it goes, let it be
In the gallows, I balanced on my toes
So I can breathe

But little by little, bit by bit
I push it back down with a new habit
If not for long, just for a while
I'll bury myself with a great big smile
Oh my my, oh my my
We trace ourselves in these chalk outlines
Oh my my, oh my my erase ourselves

It's such a perfect day
Take it just in case, take it just in case
I'm scared of being okay
'Cause all things change, all things change
It's such a perfect day
It's a beautiful shame
It's a beautiful shame
I'm scared of being okay
'Cause all things change

But little by little, bit by bit
I push it back down with a new habit
If not for long, just for a while
I'll bury myself with a great big smile
Oh my my, oh my my
We trace ourselves in these chalk outlines
Oh my my, oh my my
Erase ourselves in these chalk outlines
