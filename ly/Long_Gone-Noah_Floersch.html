		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put yourself into my skin for moment and
Give it back cuz my skeleton's showing
I'm long gone, long gone
Paramour, troubadour, I'll be the token, yeah
There's the door, guess I'm leavin' it open
I'm long gone, long gone
So don't wait up for me
I'm getting real lost
Don't know where I'm goin
But I'm goin on
I was a child when I first met you
You were as sweet as could be, but that child is
Long gone, long gone
Nowadays I go for things that are bitter, hell
You come 'round with your sugar, go figure
I'm long gone, long gone
So don't wait up for me
I'm getting real lost
Don't know where I'm goin
But I'm goin on
You don't know what you want anymore
You don't know what you need
And what you need
It sure as hell isn't me, cmon
Now I'm long gone, long gone
