		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When there is nothing there is still time
When there is nothing there is still time
There is still time, mountains of time

When there is nowhere there is still time
When there is nowhere there is still time
There is still time, oceans of time

When there is something there is no time
When there is something there is no time
There is no time, canyons of time

When there is somewhere there is no time
When there is somewhere there is no time
There is no time, dry bed of time
