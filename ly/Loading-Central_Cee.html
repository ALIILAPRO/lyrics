Cee don't be on the road too tough
But I still cut through with the local thugs (thugs)
Could've ran off the plug
But I kept it real and I showed him love (showed him love)
Lil' bro got the poker tucked
Where we grow up, it's so corrupt
Fans see me on the block, go nuts
I'm not in my bag, I'm loadin' loadin'
Back then it was hand to hand
Nowadays I don't have no involvement
In the trap, I stay on my own
I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
WhyJay no commented it
It's complicated 'cause the case still open
The boys in blue tryna find them clues
In the station, problem solvin' (solvin')

Bro just jumped out the ride
With a mask on face like he dodgin' COVID (bap)
Jumped off the porch and went my own way
No way, I don't owe no olders (no way)
Free all the guys and rest in peace
To all of the fallen soldiers
The world full up of impactive distractions
So we all lose focus (haha)
I think out loud, what comes out my mouth
I can't control it
"Live Yours" on the chain, I'm so lit
Soon come out with the custom clothin'
Fuck sake, you must be jokin'?
CIDs outside of the cut patrollin'
How did they know bout the ins and outs?
Somebody must have told them

Cee don't be on the road too tough
But I still cut through with the local thugs (thugs)
Could've ran off the plug
But I kept it real and I showed him love (showed him love)
Lil' bro got the poker tucked (tucked)
Where we grow up, it's so corrupt (so corrupt)
Fans see me on the block, go nuts
I'm not in my bag, I'm loadin' loadin'
Back then it was hand to hand
Nowadays I don't have no involvement
In the trap, I stay on my own
I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
WhyJay no commented it
It's complicated 'cause the case still open
The boys in blue tryna find them clues
In the station, problem solvin' (solvin')

Cee don't do no field, I trap
Say, "Yo" to the local cat (yo)
See me on the road all black
My foot on the gas and I won't fall back
Bro been in jail and he won't go back
I fucked bare hoes and it ain't all that
I'm missin' their call and I won't phone back
It's time that I find me a wife
More time I don't have no type
But I wouldn't mind me a Liyah Mai (okay, okay)
Treat her right I try (alright, alright)
Finer things in life I'd buy (okay, okay)
Wanna wine and dine? That's fine
If we go uptown gotta hold that (whoosh, whoosh)
Wanna fly Dubai tonight?
Lastminute.com, I'll book that flight

Cee don't be on the road too tough
But I still cut through with the local thugs (thugs)
Could've ran off the plug
But I kept it real and I showed him love (showed him love)
Lil' bro got the poker tucked
Where we grow up, it's so corrupt
Fans see me on the block, go nuts
I'm not in my bag, I'm loadin' loadin'
Back then it was hand to hand
Nowadays I don't have no involvement
In the trap, I stay on my own
I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin
WhyJay no commented it
It's complicated 'cause the case still open
The boys in blue tryna find them clues
In the station, problem solvin' (solvin')
