		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again?
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear

Your/my spirit and your/my voice
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind

He's there
The Phantom of the Opera
Beware
The Phantom of the Opera

In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery
Were both in you

And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your/my mind

Sing, my angel of music
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
