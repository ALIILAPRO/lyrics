		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Whenever you here I stay close to you
But you wanna take me over
Baby, you can't take my love to
Know you wanna take me lower
I just need to feel a touch
But for you it's not enough
Want me to stay, just fade away
When you're burning in the sun
I'm with another on the run
Want me to stay, you need a fade away

I've been doing bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
But tell me where you at, at, at, at, at
I've been doing bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
But tell me where you at, at, at, at, at

I see in your face
You say it's all good
Stuck in our ways
Would leave them behind if I could
I've been living too fast
Can't stay by your side
I've been feelin' the air taking me over
I know I stumble over you
But I don't know what I can do
Oh, I can't say, I gotta fade away
I fall in and out of love
'Cause too many is not enough
I go astray
I gotta fade away

I've been doing bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
But tell me where you at, at, at, at, at
I've been doing bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
But tell me where you at, at, at, at, at, oh
