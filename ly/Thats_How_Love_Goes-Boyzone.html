		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How many times
Have I told you tonight
There's no need to worry
It'll all be alright
So don't walk away
At the end of the day
I'll make you sorry
If you decide to stay
Sometimes it's hard to hold on
That's when your heart needs to be strong

[Chorus:]
That's how love goes
(that's how love goes)
Don't ask me why
Only love knows
What you're feeling inside
That's how love goes
(that's how love goes)
One day it's goodbye
Then it's just one more try
Nobody knows how love goes
(how love goes, how love goes, how love goes)

More than I see
(more than I see)
More I believe
That nothing is certain
When you're following your dream
So all I can do
(all I can do)
Is keep holding you
(holding you)
Maybe together
We can make them dreams come true
Sometimes it's hard to hold on
That's when your heart needs to be strong

[Chorus]

Sometimes it's easy
To think you understand
Just then you see it
Slipping through your hands

[Chorus: x2]
