		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I feel alone
But not at home
The voices call
I'm not alone
I felt it once
You heard me twice
I felt this love
No paradise
Becoming so loud
Like sirens they shout
I'm thirsting for clouds
They giving me drought
I wanted to smile
They told me to weep
A million times
I go in too deep
Lie to yourself until you're forced to believe
Lie to yourself until you're forced to believe, yeah
Deep down, you're taking over me
Said I love you then I guess I must believe
Don't drown, you'll never get it out
Said the voices in your head are gonna scream
Said they scream for me
They cheer for me
They bleed for me again, like
Dead now, I'm just a memory
Reminiscing of the time I set you free
Slow, slow it down
(Slow, slow it down)
Don't, make a sound
(Don't, make a sound)
Let me take control
(Let me take control)
So they won't provoke you
It's hysterical, I never thought I'd end up like that
Unbelievable, I look at you with blood in my eyes
So deceivable, you believe what you wanted to see
Not the real me
They don't hear you when you
Speak like you bigger
Smile through the winter
Feel like a sinner, babe
Stay put and don't pull the trigger
Lights getting dimmer
Drink all your liquor, baby
Spliff in your hand, catching a vibe , moving it side to side
Running off track, baby don't hide, come along for the ride
Go realize, that you decide, where I end up tonight
Come along for the ride
Lie to yourself until you're forced to believe
Lie to yourself until you're forced to believe, yeah
Deep down, you're taking over me
Said I love you then I guess I must believe
Don't drown, you'll never get it out
Said the voices in your head are gonna scream
Said they scream for me
They cheer for me
They bleed for me again, like
Dead now, I'm just a memory
Reminiscing of the time I set you free
