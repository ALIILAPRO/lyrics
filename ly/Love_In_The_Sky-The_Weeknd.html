		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's no one inside
But you're free to relax
If you commit to this ride
There's no turning back
You've been here before
Remember these sheets, uh
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

You'll learn to love how to dream
Dream
You'll learn to love how to dream
Dream, uh

There's no need to hide
Don't overreact
You said you've been to the sky
We'll go beyond that
You've been here before, girl
Remember these sheets
This world's not for us
It's not what it seems

You'll learn to love how to dream
Dream, hey
You'll learn to love how to dream, uh
I could teach you to dream

Oh, woah-oh
We'll find our love in the sky
We'll find our love in the sky
Oh, we'll find our love in the sky
Oh

Oh, whoa
We'll find our love in the sky
Oh, we'll find our love in the sky
Oh, we'll find our love in the sky
Oh, oh (oh, ooh)

(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh) how does it feel?
Do you feel like you did before?
Do you see the world getting small?
How does it feel
Are you free?
As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me
Been flying around the world
I've been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high, 'cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush, ain't no time to fuck slow
And even if I try, it's not something I would know
But I'm sure I'll make you cum, do it three times in a row
And I'm sure you would have left with that pussy in control
Got that pussy in control
I got it in control
Oh
Control, control, control
Mhm
