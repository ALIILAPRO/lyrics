		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Chorus:
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.

Got many money honey,
I'm a superstar.
My life is funny honey,
Have you seen my car?
I know a lot of people,
I'm a superstar.
Everybody know me,
Right from near to far.

I got a plane (I got a plane)
I love the fame (I love the fame)
You know my name (you know my name)
And I just want you to know...

Chorus:
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.

I got a red Ferrari,
I'm a superstar.
I really like to party,
Am I cool or what?
I love a lot of women,
I'm a superstar.
Star's got a freaky living,
That's the way we are.

I got a plane (I got a plane)
I love the fame (I love the fame)
You know my name (you know my name)
And I just want you to know.

Chorus:
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.

I got fortune, I got fame,
Love it when you say my name.
Love to party, I am naughty,
Prettier than everybody!

I got muscles, I'm a stud,
Jealous people kiss my butt.
I'm so fly I'll make you cry,
Cross my heart and hope to die.

Chorus:
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.

I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.
I am a superstar with a big big house and a big big car,
I am a superstar and I don't care who you are.
