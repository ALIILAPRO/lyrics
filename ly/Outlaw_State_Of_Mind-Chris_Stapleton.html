		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cut my teeth on Daddy's old LGO
And I lost my mind somewhere in New Mexico
And TW put a snake on my back
I keep a red bone on my side

And there's people all across the land
From East Kentucky down to Alabam'
Whole lotta like I am all the time
In an outlaw state of mind

I got friends that know how to have a good time
Yeah, they roll their own and drink Carolina shine
I've seen the devil in a dark coal mine
I've been higher than a Georgia pine

And there's people all across the land
From West Virginia to the Rio Grande
Whole lotta like I am all the time 
In an outlaw state of mind

Yeah, there's people all across the land
From New York out to old San Fran
Just don't give a damn all the time
In an outlaw state of mind
