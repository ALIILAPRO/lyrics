		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The voices in my head keep on telling me to pray
'Cause I'm spinning like a carousel, circling the drain
Hit the bottom of the bottle, I don't wanna feel the pain
But that is all I got for now, I don't wanna talk about it
The voices in my head keep on begging me to stay
If I pull the trigger now then the demons go away
And I know my time is coming so there ain't no time to waste
So that is all I got for now, I don't wanna talk about it

The voices in my head keep telling me to choose a side
It's heaven or hell like it's do or die
I'm a sad boy, you know better
Please don't make this last forever

The voices in my head keep telling me I'm not okay
It's feeling like a hurricane in my brain
Dark clouds, hard times, bad weather
Please don't make this last forever

The voices in my head keep telling me I'm gonna (die)
And I don't wanna talk about the drama, I'm trauma (tized)
They're tellin' me I'm fine but we both know that's a fuckin' (lie)
I'm losing my mind but I don't wanna talk about it

The voices in my head keep giving me the worst advice
Kamikaze crash like a suicide
I'm a lost boy, you know better
Please don't make this last forever

The voices in my head keep telling me I'm insane
And maybe I'm a little bit, that won't change
Dark clouds, hard times, bad weather
Please don't make this last forever

The voices in my head keep telling me I'm gonna (die)
And I don't wanna talk about the drama, I'm trauma (tized)
They're tellin' me I'm fine but we both know that's a fuckin' (lie)
I'm losing my mind but I don't wanna talk about

The voices in my head keep telling me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don't wanna make it any worse
We're all gonna die but first things first
I'ma take the world with me when they put me in the dirt
The voices in my head keep telling me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don't wanna make it any worse
We're all gonna die but first things first
I'ma take the world with me when they put me in the dirt

Move
(Move)
Voices in my head keep telling me I'm cursed
I'm paranoid, I don't wanna make it any worse
We're all gonna die, first things first
I'ma take the world with me when they put me in the dirt

The voices in my head keep telling me I'm gonna (die)
And I don't wanna talk about the drama, I'm trauma (tized)
They're tellin' me I'm fine but we both know that's a fuckin' (lie)
I'm losing my mind but I don't wanna talk about it

The voices in my head keep on telling me to pray
'Cause I'm spinning like a carousel, circling the drain
Hit the bottom of the bottle, I don't wanna feel the pain
I'm losing my mind but I don't wanna talk about it
