		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Walk around the room with a glaze in your stare.
In your tuxedo suit.
I will give it a name.
Lower your defenses.

Lower your casket.
Open the door and open your grave.
Murder.
Now you're doing the waltz with your murderer.

Mediocrity is the killer.
You find yourself helpless.
Christ is not a fashion, fleeting away.
He laid emeralds in her eyes,

But I'd already tried a bracelt made of gold
And a scarlet thread around her wrist.
Everything was wrong 
So we sang sentimental songs.

"Oh how seldom we belong 
But how elegant our kiss."
We painted crooked lines
But danced in perfect time 

To a love so much refined,
We know not what it is until 
Like a dullen wine we pour into a grief 
Know before but never quite like this.

All I know now is regret,
It follows like a silhouette 
Along the cobbelstone behind us,
But has nothing to say except to innocently ask,

It's voice delicate as glass,
"Do you see me when we pass?"
But I continue on my way
