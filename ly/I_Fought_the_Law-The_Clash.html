I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I needed money 'cause I had none
I fought the law and the law won

I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the

I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I lost my girl and I lost my fun
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won

Guess my race is run
She's the best girl that I ever had

I fought the law and the

I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the
