		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never been one to trust

Never saw the gain in lust

It's all too real when the love you feel's forgotten

When another lays in the bed you made 

And your best days are forgotten

Is he all you need?

Do you look at him the same way you looked at me?

You looked at me


Cause when you say that I'm the only one, 

Did you mean that I'm the closest one around?

Around

You know that talk is cheap and don't mean a thing

Did you say you loved me cause you liked the way it sounds?

It sounds now, darling

The past it hurts,

But the future ain't got nothing to do with you

Your loving words

Are for the weak at heart or the simple minded fools

Fools

Now I know so much better, babe

Than to go around feeding snakes like you


Everybody wrestles with their demons

But who would've known the devil I chose

Is an angel when she's sleeping

Sweet legion, release me

The devil in heaven was still God's favorite

Divine irony


Cause when you say that I'm the only one

Did you mean that I'm the closest one around?

Around

You know that talk is cheap and don't mean a thing

Did you say you loved me cause you liked the way it sounds?


Lover of mine

Is it a sign

That I haven't slept in weeks?

The sun it shines

And it's so bright in my eyes

But I still cannot see

Oh, honey, look at the time

You're still in my mind

And it's half past time you leave


Cause when you say that I'm the only one

Did you mean that I'm the closest one around?

Around

You know that talk is cheap and don't mean a thing

Did you say you loved me cause you liked the way it sounds?

It sounds now, darling

The past it hurts

But the future ain't got nothing to do with you

You

Your loving words

Are for the weak at heart or the simple minded fools

Fools

Now I know so much better, babe

than to go around feeding snakes like you
