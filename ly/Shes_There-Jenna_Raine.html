		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I got a dollar every time I let you back in
Boy, I'd be richer than any doctor, could you imagine?
I'd try to fix you, take your issues
And treat them like they're mine
Sit there while you cry

I'm tired of giving and giving and giving
'Til I'm out of battery
And it ain't a decision
I got a condition, I only know how to be

Little Miss forgives too easily
Little Miss walk all over me
Little Miss never gets checked up on
A therapist for everyone
Little Miss tryin' to do her best
Little Miss needs more hours of rest
Little miss running on a tightrope in thin air
Just to show she's there
Do you know she's there?

Night of your birthday
I made a big deal, I bought you flowers
Mine three weeks later
You didn't text me, how hard is two words?
I'm never the voice who disappoints you
And I show up every time
When you don't then it's fine

I'm tired of giving and giving and giving
'Til I'm out of battery
And it ain't a decision
I got a condition and now I don't wanna be

Little Miss forgives too easily
Little Miss walk all over me
Little Miss never gets checked up on
A therapist for everyone
Little Miss tryin' to do her best
Little Miss needs more hours of rest
Little miss running on a tightrope in thin air
Just to show she's there

I've got it down
I've got it down now
I've got it down
I've got it down now
I've got it down
I've got it down now
I've got it down
I've got it down now

Little Miss forgives too easily
Little Miss walk all over me
Little Miss never gets checked up on
A therapist for everyone
Little Miss tryin' to do her best
Little Miss needs more hours of rest
Little Miss running on a tightrope in thin air
Just to show she's there
Do you know she's there?
