		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You did good, $lick

.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it off
.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it, blow it
Dirty Sprite, pour it in my cup and then I'm noddin' off
I get to this money, count these hunnids, then I blow it off
.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it off
.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it, blow it
Dirty Sprite, pour it in my cup and then I'm noddin' off
I get to this money (yeah), count these hunnids, then I blow it off

Bitch, I put down the heroin and picked up all these bitches
But both the dope and the hoes always in my ear hissin'
I'ma ghost, the whole globe peel off in a Phantom
Driftin', decisions damagin' my image
Picture me ridin' into the horizon, throwin' up sixes
From a shed in the yard to hirin' guards
Snow Leopard still right off of St. Bernard at the hornet's nest
All my bitches born again (ayy, ayy)
All I gotta say to my partners is, "Of course" and "When?" (Ayy, ayy)
Generation*59, drip a drop of acid in my mind's eye
Now I'm thinkin' everything is tie-dye, Wock' up in a Mai Tai
All this ice on my neck, why would I fly? (Ayy, ayy)
Make a bitch wet, but maybe I'll just leave her high and dry (ayy, ayy)

.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it off
.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it, blow it
Dirty Sprite, pour it in my cup and then I'm noddin' off
I get to this money, count these hunnids, then I blow it off

Got this big drank, big syrup, I just poured a little soda in it (ha-ha, ha)
Doctors be on top of me, they prolly worried 'bout my kidneys
Who you kiddin'? Never stop, it's B-J-T-S to the top (to the top)
I pull her weave when shorty bop, I bob and weave until he knocked (until he knocked)
1-8-7 on your block, it's just another homicide
You was feelin' safe and warm until I let that chopper slide (fah-fah, fah-fah)
Hellpup sic 'em, kill 'em all, I drown in downers 'til I fall
I'm blackin' out in bathroom stalls, I'm always on that break the law
Wakin' up to Satan's call, God be on the other line
Poppin' pills until I'm gone, I'll call him back another time
Rappin' easy, spittin' facts, now go and put that shit on wax
Trappin' harder, that's a fact, but both 'em got them snakes and rats (Big Juice tha' Sip)

.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it off
.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it, blow it
Dirty Sprite, pour it in my cup and then I'm noddin' off
I get to this money, count these hunnids, then I blow it off (7th Ward)

I went from, "Lemme rest in peace," to "Let me flex in peace"
Playin' Russian roulette with them pressed thirties
Gold cross on the revolver, Devil's hand on the grip
Holy Water in my 'script so I get blessed as I sip
Sony want my Sig (north), that's gon' cost a Urus (side)
Shawty want my kid (north), that's gon' cost a jurist (side)
Sage match the Benz (north), both them bitches German (side)
You know what it is (north), I'm Grey until the furnace (side)
Told my bitch, "Go shoppin'" and she brought me back a Draco
Actin' like they Grey but they ain't gang unless I say so
SHAMELESS $UICIDE, this shit deeper than a K hole
Feel like Hillary with all these killers on my payroll

.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it off
.45, put it to your brain and then we blow it, blow it
Dirty Sprite, pour it in my cup and then I'm noddin' off
I get to this money, count these hunnids, then I blow it off
.45, blow it off
.45 (it's a smash), blow it, blow it
Dirty Sprite, noddin' off
I get to this money, hunnids, blow it off
