		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, K Swisha
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

She say Mr. Tokyo, do your thing
I don't need it baby girl, do your thing
Iced out hockey diamond ring
This my first time baby, but ain't new to things
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween

Diamonds on me lookin' like some rain drops
Maybe I should get the 'Rari or the Maybach
Drop that new shit, woah
Drop that new shit, woah
Teach you like a student, woah
He booted, woah
Okay they mad at me, pour the gasoline
I'm bout to fire up it, I'm 'bout to fire up it
I'm bout to fire up here
Pour the gasoline, oh they mad at me, woah
I'm 'bout to fire up it, I'm 'bout to fire up it
I'm 'bout to fire up it, I'm 'bout to fire up it
I'm 'bout to fire up it, I'm 'bout to fire up it

She say Mr. Tokyo, do your thing
I don't need it baby girl, do your thing
Iced out hockey diamond ring
This my first time baby, but ain't new to things
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween

You could call me but don't call me broke
Yeah I'm never broke, yup I'm never broke
You could call me but I'm never broke
Yeah I'm never broke, never broke

She said Tokyo, yeah I'm proud of you
Bitch I don't even like your attitude
Treat me nice then I ice your finger boo
These niggas like why you hangin' with them fools?
Give me the beat, I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween
Shawty the baddest queen
I take her out of them jeans
I be the flyest thing
You niggas not in my lane, oh

She say Mr. Tokyo, do your thing
I don't need it baby girl, do your thing
Iced out hockey diamond ring
This my first time baby, but ain't new to things
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
Smokin' that Halloween, smokin' that Halloween

You could call me but don't call me broke
Yeah I'm never broke, yup I'm never broke
You could call me but I'm never broke
Yeah I'm never broke, never broke
