		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a record player that
Was made in 2014 dyed my hair blue
It came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they
Fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them
Climbing in the trees
Sometimes, I think all I'm ever doing is
(Trees)
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)
Sometimes, I think all I'm ever doing is
(Trees)
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)

Wipe my eyes and cut me off
(Wipe my eyes, I'm crying)
I'm just crying for attention
(For attention)
Wish I'd been a teenage rebel
(A teenage rebel) never even got detention

I don't really love you
I just said that for a change of pace
I'm sorry
Sometimes I don't recognize my face

I've got a record player that
Was made in 2014 dyed my hair blue
It came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they
Fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them
Climbing in the trees
Sometimes, I think all I'm ever doing is
(Trees)
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)
Sometimes, I think all I'm ever doing is
(Trees)
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)

I need a dictionary
Someone look me up and define me
Please remind me who I'm supposed
To be around you
So you will do what I want you to
I'm always winning the wrong game
I don't remember my real name

I've got a record player that
Was made in 2014 dyed my hair blue
It came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they
Fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them
Climbing in the trees
Sometimes I think all I'm ever doing is
(Trees)
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)
Sometimes I think all I'm ever doing is
(Trees)
Trying to convince myself I'm alive (Trees)

I've got a record player that
Was made in 2014 dyed my hair blue
It came out a seasick sort of green
I like vintage dresses when they
Fall just below my knees
I pretend I scraped them
Climbing in the trees
I've got a record player that
Was made in 2014 (Trees)
Dyed my hair blue
It came out a seasick sort of green (Trees)
I like vintage dresses when they
Fall just below my knees (Trees)
I pretend I scraped them
Climbing in the trees (Trees)
