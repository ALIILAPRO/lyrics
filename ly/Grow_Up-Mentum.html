		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Verse 
When I was 17 my dreams were large 
Now the pressure's heavy on my heart 
Sleepless nights tryna make people proud 
In times like these your words keep ringing loud 
I hear you say 

Pre 
Run run as fast as you can my boy 
Don't look back till the world is yours 
Run run don't mind what people say 
I know you, you will find your way 

Hook 
You will 
Grow up, grow up too 
Conquer all your fears, make your dreams come true 
You will 
Grow up, grow up tall 
Maybe fall in love, grow together old 

Verse 
A couple scars I need to cover up 
Fill the space of a half empty cup 
Thinking if I get these voices out my head 
There may be truth in words left by the bed 
I hear you say 

Pre 
Run run as fast as you can my boy 
Don't look back till the world is yours 
Run run don't mind what people say 
I know you, you will find your way 

Hook 
You will 
Grow up, grow up too 
Conquer all your fears, make your dreams come true 
You will 
Grow up, grow up tall 
Maybe fall in love, grow together old 

Maybe fall in love, grow together old 

Bridge 
Run run as fast as you can my boy 
Don't look back till the world is yours 
Run run don't mind what people say 
I know you, you will find your way 

Hook 
You're gonna 
Grow up, grow up too 
Conquer all your fears, make your dreams come true 
You're gonna 
Grow up, grow up tall 
Maybe fall in love, grow together old
