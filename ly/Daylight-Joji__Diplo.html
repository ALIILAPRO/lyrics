		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wide awake, getting half-past zero
It's getting heated so I leave the windows open (leave the windows open)
Preoccupied with a late night B-roll
Right now, laying here alone is heaven (here alone is heaven)

And I've been a hero
Helpless
I'm in hell
And I've cried up and down in these hallways
Blamed myself

Bad luck, I don't wanna be home at midnight
Sun's up, I don't really wanna fight the daylight
I don't care if you moved on
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up head
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up

Sun-dried on the backyard patio
Drunk eyes 'cause I didn't give it a home run
Yeah, yeah
You're hiding on the FM radio
I sing along just to sing my thoughts at someone
Yeah, yeah

And I've been a hero
Helpless
I'm in hell (I'm in hell)
And I've cried
Up and down in these hallways
Blamed myself

Bad luck, I don't wanna be home at midnight
Sun's up, I don't really wanna fight the daylight
I don't care if you moved on
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up head
I'm not laying in bed with a fucked up
