		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' up the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
Little bit of sunshine

Yeah, crazy lately, I'm confirmin'
Tryna write myself a sermon
You just tryna get a word and life is not fair
I've been workin' on my tunnel vision
Tryna get a new prescription
Takin' swings and even missin' but I don't care

I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo hoo
I'm makin' more just a little bit
Spend a little more to get rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it

I, I, I, I, I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' up the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
Little bit of sunshine

A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine

'Nother day, another selfish moment
I've been feelin' helpless
Sick of seein' all the selfies, now I don't care
Found myself a new vocation
Calibrated motivation
No more static, change the station
Headin' somewhere

I'm dancin' more just a little bit
Breathin' more just a little bit
Care a little less just a little bit
Like life is woo hoo
I'm makin' more just a little bit
Spend a little more to get rid of it
Smile a little more and I'm into it

Honestly man, lately 
I, I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' up the shade for a little bit of sunshine
Hit me with them good vibes
Pictures on my phone like
Everything is so fine
Little bit of sunshine

A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine

I don't really know any other way to say this
Can't slow down, tryna keep up with the changes
Punch that number and the name when I clock in
Now I feel like Michael with a cane when I walk in
Basically, life is the same thing unless you don't want the same thing
Probably shoulda went and got a feature, but I didn't
I've been savin' up the money 'cause it's better for the business

I, I've been runnin' through this strange life
Chasin' all them green lights
Throwin' up the shade for a little bit of sunshine (yeah)

Woo, woo
A little bit of sunshine
A little bit of sunshine
