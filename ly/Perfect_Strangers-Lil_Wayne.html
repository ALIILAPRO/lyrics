		<p>
		  Yeah

I don't know who you are anymore
Talking to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous
Sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman doing the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switching women
Putting cups up, getting fucked up

And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's a fuck up

Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say "Why you leave your shit here?"
I'm tryna' be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight

We don't even make love anymore
Acting like our phones got our attention
Or we watching television
And it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore

I'm, I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me, "Stay all night"
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout, what about how she feel
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
"Baby where my keys at?"
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked

I don't know who you are anymore
Talking to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous
Sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman doing the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switching women
Putting cups up, getting fucked up

And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's a fuck up

I was talking to myself the other day
My homies call me cray
My momma tell me "Pray"
She said I need a day
I said I need a bae
She said believe in faith
Mom, they love me either way
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say don't sweat your alarm
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception preforms
And then that silence is awkward
Like, am I deaf or alone?
I gotta jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman in scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
Now her temperature's showing
And I just weathered her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like "Let go my arm!"
She said

I don't know who you are anymore
Talking to the man in her mirror
I been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous
Sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman doing the same shit
And she say, "You don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?"
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switching women
Putting cups up, getting fucked up

She say, "We don't even talk anymore"
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's whats fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's a fuck up

She say, "We don't even make love anymore"
Acting like our phones got our attention
Or we watching television
And it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore
Perfect strangers
