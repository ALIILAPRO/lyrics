		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Don't trouble the water)
I won't (leave it alone)
(Why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
(Still water run deep, yes it do)
I know that
(Whoa-o-o-yeah)
If you only believe

(Don't trouble the water)
Said I wouldn't (leave it alone)
(Why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
(Still water run deep)
Yes it do
(Yes it do' whoa-oh-ho yeah)
If you only believe

When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
Oh when darkness comes
And pain is all, is all around

Just like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
(Like a bridge)
Just like a bridge
(Over troubled) over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on silver girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All of your dreams are on their way
(See how they shine?)
Ooh and if you ever need a friend
(Need a friend)
Look around, I'm sailing right behind

Just like a bridge
Over troubled water
I'll be there to lay me down
(Like a bridge)
Like a bridge over (troubled water) troubled water
I will lay me down
Ooh I'll be your bridge
Yes I will

(Don't trouble the water)
Said I wouldn't
(Leave it alone)
Well (why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
(Still water run deep)
I know that
(Yes it do) yeah (oh-oh-oh yeah)
Still water (don't trouble the water)
Yeah
(Leave it alone, why don't you, why don't you, let it be)
Talking 'bout still water
(Still water run deep)
You know they run deep
(Yes it do, oh-ho-ho-yeah)
Well I'm gonna be your bridge yeah!
(Don't trouble the water)
The troubled water (leave it alone)
Oh!
(Why don't you, why don't you, let it be?)
Come on come on
Walk out on me
(Still water run deep)
Oh
(Yes it do)
