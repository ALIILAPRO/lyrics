		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you look at the morning sun

Do you see what I see
Or could I be the only one
Seeing just what I need

I envision a different man
Than the one I've become
Pray the ocean will understand
That my time isn't done

Everyone's leading
But nobody's dancing
You stand on the stage

Just to turn all alone
I have waited this way
For a lifetime of days

I can't wait for the morning sun
As I stand with the sea
And the ocean she understands

Just the man I could be

Somewhere else there's a different world

With a sun that will rise
And a moon that will take its place
In another man's eyes

And perhaps it's a better world
Than the one that I see
Or if better for no one else
Perhaps better for me

Here in the dark where the sky shows its graces
Revealing each star while the moon plays the fool
Saying how it must be while the night disagrees

I can't wait for the morning sun
As I stand with the sea
And the ocean she understands

Just the man I could be

No, no, time doesn't wait for you
No, no, leave it alone
No, no, your days are far too few
This thing I have always known

When your time is up it's through
They never give another day to you

When your time is up it's through
No one cares how

Can't keep it

Can't save it
Can't take it away with you
So I say we use it now

Now his thoughts gave way to anger
And he loudly cursed at fate
That in a world of opportunities
That he was doomed to wait

That his life could be predestined
To be stuck here on this shore
He could not make himself believe
That there was nothing more
