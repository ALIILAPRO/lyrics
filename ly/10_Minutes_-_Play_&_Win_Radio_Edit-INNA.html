		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Rock your body come on everybody
Somebody stop me
When I dance I'm losing control
You see me yo this is stereo
I wanna hear my song one time on the radio

I'm gonna do this step by step do it anyway got to feel your loving
I'm gonna break even the law of the gravity to see you in the morning

Let me see your body move on the floor like ten minutes ago
Shake shake shake your body
Move on the floor like ten minutes ago
Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace
DJ turn off the bass
Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace
Everybody do it on the floor

I'm gonna do this step by step do it anyway got to feel your loving
I'm gonna break even the law of gravity to see you in the morning

Let me see your body move on the floor like ten minutes ago
Shake shake shake your body
Move on the floor like ten minutes ago
Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace
DJ turn off the bass
Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace
Everybody do it on the floor

Rock your body come on everybody
Somebody stop me
When I dance I'm losing control
You see me yo
This is stereo
I wanna hear my song one time on the radio

I'm gonna do this step by step do it anyway got to feel your loving
I'm gonna break even the law of gravity to see you in the morning

Let me see your body move on the floor like ten minutes ago
Shake shake shake your body
Move on the floor like ten minutes ago
Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace
DJ turn off the bass
Winning in every place 'cause your my lucky ace
Everybody do it on the floor
