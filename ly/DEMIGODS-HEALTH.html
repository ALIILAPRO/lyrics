		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And they pronounced
That a child was born long ago
Hear me now, you demigods
Either lift me up or let me burn

Sorrow, sorrow now (we turn the other way)
Sorrow, sorrow now (we turn the other way)

Didn't you want to run?
Didn't you want out?
Death shall come to the child in me
Did you want to know?
Or did you want the lie?
A long goodbye to what we had

Shall we renounce
From where we've come and who we were?
You'll hear me now, you demigods
Either let me go or put me in the dirt

Sorrow, sorrow now (we turn the other way)
Sorrow, sorrow now (we turn the other way)
(We turn the other way)

Luckless child, born still
Lay your weary head down
Loveless child, burden of many
May they bury you deep

(Loveless child, burden of many)
(Loveless child, bury you deep)
(Bury you deep)
