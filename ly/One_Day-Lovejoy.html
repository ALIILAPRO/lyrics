		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And stop
'Cause why'd you have to kill my cat?
Why'd I have to take you back?
Time and time, I play the empath
I don't know why
Put some lights on in an empty pub
A toilet with the seat left up
It's closure like a deer in headlights

One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?

She said, "Let's talk about
What I want to do
'Cause all I want to do
Is turn back time
At least a couple Tuesdays
To before I found one life, turn two"
I said it last time
But I'm not afraid of empty rooms
I'm not afraid of new perfume
And, in fact, my dear
I'm fucking terrified

One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?
Woo

'Cause I know that
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?
One day, I know that you will be there
One day, I'll focus on the future, maybe
One day, oh, baby, isn't life so fucking inconsistent?
