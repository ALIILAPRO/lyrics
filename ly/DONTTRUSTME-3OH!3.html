		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Black dress with the tights underneath
I got the breath of the last cigarette on my teeth
And she's an actress (actress)
But she ain't got no need

She's got money from her parents in a trust fund back east
T-t-t-tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girls teeth
T-tell your boyfriend if he says he's got beef
That I'm a vegetarian and I ain't fucking scared of him

She wants to touch me (whoa)
She wants to love me (whoa)
She'll never leave me (whoa, whoa, oh, oh)

Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
'Cause a hoe won't trust me

She wants to touch me (whoa)
She wants to love me (whoa)
She'll never leave me (whoa, whoa, oh, oh)

Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
'Cause a hoe won't trust me

X's on the back of your hands
Wash them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And your set list (set list)
You stole off the stage

Had red and purple lipstick all over the page
Be-be-be-bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is (best is)
No one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar

She wants to touch me (whoa)
She wants to love me (whoa)
She'll never leave me (whoa, whoa, oh, oh)

Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
Cause a hoe won't trust me

She wants to touch me (whoa)
She wants to love me (whoa)
She'll never leave me (whoa, whoa, oh, oh)

Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
'Cause a hoe won't trust me

Shush girl shut your lips,
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said, Shush girl shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said, Shush girl shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

Whoa, whoa, whoa

She wants to touch me (whoa)
She wants to love me (whoa)
She'll never leave me (whoa, whoa, oh, oh)

Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
'Cause a hoe won't trust me

She wants to touch me (whoa)
She wants to love me (whoa)
She'll never leave me (whoa, whoa, oh, oh)

Don't trust a ho
Never trust a ho
'Cause a hoe won't trust me
