		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yesterday, I was alone and blue
My heart was heavy and then came you
Oh, I can see! That you were meant for me
Now, I have found you, I'll never let you go

You know that I love you, I need you
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life

Many lovers they come and go
But your sweet loving lingers on and on
Oh, I can feel! That this time it's for real
So, hold me closer and never let me go

You know that I love you, I need you
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life

Well your sweet love is all I need
Without you I just can't go on

You know that I love you, I need you too
You know that I'm caring, sharing everything I've got
Don't you know that I want you? I need you too
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
I'll be happy with you for the rest of my life
I will be happy with you for the rest of my life
