		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You act like you can't pick up your phone
And when you do you're raising your tone, yeah
Tell me why you feel a way (feel a way)
Don't act like you ain't got shit to say, uh
I know, you hurt me then I hurt you, uh
I know, you learn from me, I learn from you
I know, I know what you've turned into
I know-know, you don't know what else to do, yeah

I don't feel like I'm needed (needed)
And I don't feel like I'm breathing (breathing)
Without I don't know the reasons (reasons)
Don't wanna be here for a season
I don't know if I believe you (believe you)
I been dealing with your demons
Now you wanna up and leave me?
What about the love we shared and all your secrets?

All your secrets
All your secrets, babe
Don't forget I know your secrets
Don't forget I know your secrets
I know your secrets, babe, so don't act like you can't speak to me

You don't know what you want
But you want everything your way (your way)
You text me at three in the morning (yeah)
Playing them same ol' games
What am I supposed to think? (Supposed to think)
What am I supposed to do? (Supposed to do)
I saw the potential in you (you)
I had so much hope for you
I know we've got issues
But you know I miss you still
Girl, why is you trippin'?
You don't wanna listen still
Gave you all of me why can't you make up your mind?
You so out of line
But you still know it's mine

I don't feel like I'm needed (needed)
And I don't feel like I'm breathing (breathing)
Without I don't know the reasons (reasons)
Don't wanna be here for a season
I don't know if I believe you (believe you)
I been dealing with your demons
Now you wanna up and leave me?
What about the love we shared and all your secrets?

All your secrets
All your secrets babe
Don't forget I know your secrets
Don't forget I know your secrets
I know your secrets babe, so don't act like you can't

Tell me you love me
