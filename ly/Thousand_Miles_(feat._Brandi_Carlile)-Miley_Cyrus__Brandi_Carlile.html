		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Amazing, I'm driving around town
In a beat up old Mercedes
You think I'm crazy
You might be right
But when he smiles, I don't care about the past
Just like that

I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I've been

I'm not always right
But still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind
But still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere

I look in the rearview
I was talking to you 'fore I realize it's madness
Before the sadness
Oh, I pick up the phone and I call back home
But all I get is a dial tone and instead of hangin' up
I hang my head

I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I've been

I'm not always right
But still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind
But still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere

I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I've been

I'm not always right
But still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind
But still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere
