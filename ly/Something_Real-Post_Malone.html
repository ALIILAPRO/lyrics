		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
Seven hundred feet off the coast of Greece
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah)
No reservation, pull up twenty deep
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
I would trade it all just to be at peace

Stop, the gear's too high, this is overload
And no matter what car is sittin' outside, it's a lonely road
It's a double-edge sword, cuttin' off ties with the ones I know
So tell me, how the fuck am I still alive? It's a miracle, oh

(No-o-o) and I can't believe, ran through a B at Louis V
It's what I need right now
(No-o-o) it's just money at the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line

So give me somethin' I can feel
720S, 750V
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
I was in Maldives sippin' burgundy
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah)
Prada on my dick, Prada on my sleeve
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
I could play that pussy like it's "FÃ¼r Elise"

I got real habits, I'm a snowmobile addict
Teal Patek, steel when I feel panic, ah-ah, ahh
Throw a mil' at it, problem, throw a pill at it
Still at it, sign-another-deal addict (ah-ah, ah)

And I can't believe everybody gets to drink for free
So give me one more round (oh-oh-oh)
No cover fee at the gates of hell, no VIP
Everybody waits in line

So give me somethin' I can feel
Light a cigarette just so I can breathe
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
How much psilocybin can a human eat?
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah)
Whiskey lullaby just to fall asleep
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah)
And it's what I want, it ain't what I need
Give me somethin' I can feel (yeah, ooh)
Got everything, guess I'm hard to please
Give me somethin', somethin' real (yeah, ooh)
I would trade my life just to be at peace

Give me somethin' I can feel (ah, ooh)
Give me somethin', somethin' real
