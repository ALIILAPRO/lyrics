		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Forward yesterday makes me wanna stay
What they said was real makes me wanna steal
Living under house, guess I'm living, I'm a mouse
All's I got is time, got no meaning, just a rhyme

Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause it likes to heal
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be 

Feeling uninspired, think I'll start a fire
Everybody run, Bobby's got a gun
Think you're kind of neat, then she tells me I'm a creep
Friends don't mean a thing, guess I'll leave it up to me

Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause it likes to heal
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be 

Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause it likes to heal
Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause I like to steal
Take time with a wounded hand 
'Cause it likes to heal
I like to steal

I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
(For as I feel as the dawn it fades to gray)
Well, I'm half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be 
Half the man I used to be
