		  (D.A. Got That Dope)
Yeah, ayy

Yeah, ayy
How my demons look (how them demons)
Now that my pockets full? (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy)
How my demons look (ayy, yeah)
Now that you bitches shook? (Bitch)
Yeah, how my demons look (ayy, yeah)
Now that my pockets full? (Yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)
How my demons look (bitch, ayy)
Yeah, now that you bitches shook?

I am on to bigger things
I just bought a limousine (a limousine)
You live like me in your dreams (yes, you do)
I just quit the nicotine (I did)
If you throwin' dick at me (do it, nigga)
That shit should be big at least (do it, nigga)
Nigga, I'ma bring the heat
I'ma bring the cold (the cold)
You should bring your skis (brr)
I'm a fuckin' queen (queen)
I am expeditiously (see it, bitch)
Are you off a key? (You off a key?)
I would never let you in my V.I.P
We are enemies, we are foes
Who are you and what are those?
You are gross
Percocet got you playing with your nose

Yeah, ayy
How my demons look (how them demons)
Now that my pockets full? (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy)
How my demons look (ayy, yeah)
Now that you bitches shook? (Bitch)
Yeah, how my demons look (ayy, yeah)
Now that my pockets full? (Yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)
How my demons look (bitch, ayy)
Yeah, now that you bitches shook?

I'm a puppet, I'm a sheep, I'm a cash cow
I'm the fastest-growing bitch on all your apps now
You are tired of me 'cause I'm on your ass now
You are mad at me 'cause I am all they slap now
I can nap now
Lots of people that were sleeping say I rap now
Lots of people's hopes and dreams are finally trashed now
Lots of people say they met me in the past now
I done took the spotlight and made 'em black out
I done took the whole dick and blew my back out
I just swallowed all his kids and spit the class out
I take the trash out, mm
I'm finna cash out, uh
Bitch, do not pass out

Yeah, ayy
How my demons look (how them demons)
Now that my pockets full? (Ayy, ayy, ayy, yeah, ayy)
How my demons look (ayy, yeah)
Now that you bitches shook? (Bitch)
Yeah, how my demons look (ayy, yeah)
Now that my pockets full? (Yeah, ayy, yeah, yeah)
How my demons look (bitch, ayy)
Yeah, now that you bitches shook?
