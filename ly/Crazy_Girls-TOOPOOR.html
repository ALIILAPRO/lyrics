		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk-
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
Just 'cause I'm fucked up, it doesn't mean I don't feel
If you scream at me a little louder
Let me know it's real
You're my enemy and my remedy
But if you're not gonna bleed for me, go
You're my enemy and my remedy
But if you're not gonna bleed for me, go (Go)
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
I know I can be destructive in the things I do
Will hurt you, and might make you hate me
But I'll still love you
You're my enemy and my remedy
But if you're not gonna bleed for me, go (Go)
You're my enemy and my remedy
But if you're not gonna bleed for me, go
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
Said he likes crazy girls
Crazy girls
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
Said he likes crazy girls
But he hates when I act crazy
It takes two to talk sick
You've been getting to me lately
Said he likes crazy girls
Crazy girls
Crazy girls
Said he likes crazy girls
