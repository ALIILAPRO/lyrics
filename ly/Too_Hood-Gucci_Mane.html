		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's so damn hood

Come help me mow yo lawn, mama
Turn you up into a soldier
Head to the dreams
And your pretty legs on my shoulders
So don't lie to me I know you're scared of me
You ain't gotta be
Cuz I'll have yo back as long as
You stay on top of me
First I let her drive me
(nyum) , then I make her ride me (nyum)
She change her hair like every day
Like she miss Dennis Rodman
Say paying wit yo waist, shit
She can overcharge
Still rough around the edges
But money's not a problem
Take it to the hood, move out the
Hood, but I park the booth, got a pocketbook
Then I call the jeweler, bring the cooler
Make it look like Gucci look (burr)
Shawty got a mean swag, I wanna fuck with her
She don't need no lame nigga
She need a thug nigga

I ain't gotta worry about nothing
He's makin' trouble, always give me something
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Down, keep it so right, and he do it good

I'm too hood for my own good
But we can ball to the mall down
It's all good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good

She know I like to smoke, love to gamble
I'm in my hood sittin' low in my Lambo (nyum)
And we can be a duo, a tandem
Come through Atlanta in back to back Phantom
Her mama like he ain't got no manners
But her mama like "damn, Gucci, handosme"
It's a date night, yeah I got my cake right
The diamonds in the air, flashin' brighter
That's some brake lights
No I'm not a trouble maker
I just make it double take (burr)
Shawty staring at me
But it's something make her hesitate
Maybe it's my reputation
Maybe it's my entourage
I'm straight out the hood
But ain't no need to try to camouflage

She ain't gotta worry (worry for nothing)
I hold it down, she too much for you suckers
She's hanging off in jewelry all on her
And all the girls want him
So you can tell them nothin
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
He's so hood, he's too hood for his own good
He's so hood, he's so damn hood
Crazy guy, but too hood for his own good

Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it
Can't put it down like this
Find them in the (sun) , find them in the 6
Find them in the air, somewhere in the bricks
Keep it til' you die, but you can't be sick
Start rootin' for it
Can't put it down like this
Find them in the room, find them in the bay
Find them in New York, find them in LA
