		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One of these days and probably soon
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
Gonna press that flame to the silver spoon
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
One of these days I'm telling you, boy
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
I'm gonna slip right into that big black void
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord

(Ooh) Your rose is red but you're turning blue
(Ooh) Silver cord wrapped around your neck
As you dangle from the moon

Sold my body for all it was worth
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
Still couldn't buy any peace on Earth
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
You could sleep with a hundred girls
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
No man alive ever fucked the world
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord

(Ooh) I tried money, I tried drugs
(Ooh) There's no pill so translucent
Ain't no powder white enough
I heard it said, though they never told
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
The nose of an angel is lined with gold
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
And if I make it to holy ground
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
I'm gonna bag it up, sell it by the pound
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord

(Ooh) And if you find yourself in Hell
(Ooh) Kiss the devil on the lips
And you swear you would never tell

One of these days and it won't be long
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
They're gonna glorify me in a tragic song
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
One of these days I'm telling you, boy
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
I'm gonna slip right into that big black void
I'm gonna go up to Heaven and meet my Lord
