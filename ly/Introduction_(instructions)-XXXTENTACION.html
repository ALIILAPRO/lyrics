		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words
To say less but to say more, was ideal for this project
And till my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way 
But a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album
To show the versatility and to show th- to open minds in a self 
Was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion
And love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album
Loyalty to myself was the goal of this album
So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions
If you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind
If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been 
Into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things
Open your mind before you listen to this album
You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car but it can be played anywhere
This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last
It's something you can find comfort in, it's very comforting but discomforting at the same time
So, with this project, again me entering my mind
Feeling my insanity, feeling my genius, my energy, enjoy
