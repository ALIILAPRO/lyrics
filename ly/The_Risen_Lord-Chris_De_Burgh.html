		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Brother can you spare me food,
And give me a drink of wine,
I've been traveling on this road,
For such a long long time,
I have seen the wonders,
But most amazing of them all,
I believe I've seen the face,
Of the risen Lord;

On a night like this there came,
A stranger on the road,
I saw him stumble, heard him fall,
I helped him with his load,
The further that we walked,
Well the heavier it became,
And I believe I've felt the weight,
From another world
