		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again

We gon' make it through

I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again

Your face again
You are just living your life
Your face again
Fred, just do you

Your face again
We gon' make it through

I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again
I can't wait to see your face again
