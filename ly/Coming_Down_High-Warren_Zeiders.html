		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I go again, tossin' in bed
Girl, you got my heart in over my head
Every time you leave, perfume on my sheets
'Minds me that you ain't here next to me
Ain't sleepin' anytime soon
Just thinkin' 'bout what we do

Keep me up all night
Lookin' in your eyes
It's a hell of a ride
Coming down high

When it comes to you, nothin' I can do
Couldn't quit you even if I wanted to
Baby, that goodbye kiss
Still taste it on my lips

Keep me up all night
Lookin' in your eyes
It's a hell of a ride
Coming down high

It's like runnin' on top of a runaway train
Chasin' down the tail of'a hurricane
Standin' in a fire goin' up in flames
Holdin' on for dear life
Coming down high
Coming down high

Keep me up all night
Lookin' in your eyes
It's a hell of a ride
Coming down high

Coming down, coming down
Coming down high
Coming down high
