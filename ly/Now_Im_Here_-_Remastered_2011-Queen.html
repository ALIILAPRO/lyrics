		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I stand (here I stand)
Look around around around around around
But you won't see me (but you won't see me)

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Now I'm there (now I'm there)
I'm just a
Just a new man
Yes you made me live again, wow

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
The people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Ooh whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be, ooh, don't worry baby I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just peaches 'n' me

Don't I love her so
Yes you made me live again, yeah

Yeah, ooh, a thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With the rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so
Ooh, don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here (now I'm here)
Think I'll stay around around around around around around
Down in the city justa you 'n' me (down in the city justa you 'n' me)
Don't I love you so
Go, go, go, little Queenie
