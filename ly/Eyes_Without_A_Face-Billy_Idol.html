		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm all out of hope
One more bad break
Could bring a fall

When I'm far from home
Don't call me on the phone
To tell me you're alone

It's easy to deceive
It's easy to tease
But hard to get release

(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face

I spend so much time
Believing all the lies
Keep the dream alive

Now it makes me sad
It makes me mad at truth
For loving what was you

(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face (face, face, face)

When you hear the music, you make a dip
Into someone else's pocket then make a slip
Steal a car and go to Las Vegas
Ooh, the gigolo pool

Hanging out by the state line
Turning holy water into wine
Drinkin' it down, oh, oh-oh, ow

I'm on a bus on a psychedelic trip
Reading murder books, tryin' to stay hip
I'm thinkin' of you, you're out there, so
Say your prayers
Say your prayers
Say your prayers (ooh)

Now I close my eyes
And I wonder why
I don't despise

Now all I can do
Love what was once
So alive in you
But it's gone from your eyes
I better realize

(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
(Les yeux sans visage)
Eyes without a face
Got no human grace
You're eyes without a face

Such a human waste
You're eyes without a face (face, face, face)

And now it's getting worse
