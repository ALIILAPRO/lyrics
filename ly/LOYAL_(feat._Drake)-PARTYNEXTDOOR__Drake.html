		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  True, you're a star in my head
You, nuh need fi raise war with my friends
True, you're so bad, we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you or my friends

You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Please stay true, probably can par again, yeah, yeah
Because, true, you're my best friend

All the way around, I'm loyal
I got money on me and I'm loyal
I got money in my pocket, I'm loyal, ooh
Pain goes away when I'm tipsy
Pain goes away when you're with me (me)
Even when troubles all look risky, it's all under control

Shawty, just don't let this go (just don't let this go)
We spent the last three summers on the road (spent the summer on the road)
We get it on and then you go
I just don't want any war (no war)
No one at home

True, you're a star in my head (it's the truth)
You, nuh need fi raise war with my friends, no, no
True, you're so bad, we don't need to pretend
But I don't want war with you, or my friends

You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Because, true, when we can par again
You'll see, you, you're my best friend

All the way around, I'm loyal
I got money on me and I'm loyal
I got money in my pocket, I'm loyal, ooh
Pain goes away when I'm tipsy
Pain goes away when you're with me
Even when your troubles all look risky, it's all under control

Shawty, just don't let this go (just don't let this go)
We spent the last three summers on the road (spent the summers on the road)
We get it on and then you go
I just don't wanna let go
No one at home

Please, don't let this go
We spent the last three summers on the road

You're my best friend
You're my best friend
I just don't want any war
No one at home
