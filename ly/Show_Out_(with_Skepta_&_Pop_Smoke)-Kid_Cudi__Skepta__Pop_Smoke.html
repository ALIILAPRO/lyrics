		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
Look

Show out, show up (grrt)
Back out, pole out
Man down, roll up
Man down, roll up
Show out, show up (grrt)
Back out, pole out
Man down, roll up
Man down, roll up

All my niggas is ready to go, Pop Smoke, big smoke
Clip in the stick, stick in the coat
And they got guns same size as Kevin Hart
Please don't think it's a joke
Back on tour with the gang and it's sold out
Twenty-two dates, I ain't missin' a show
Got the ladies hittin' my phone (brrt)
Got the mandem hittin' the whoa (greaze)
Me plus ten on the list, they know how I'm comin', I'm bringin' the bros
And I've got G's that's stuck in the trap, no government name, they stick to the code
Left wrist Audemar Piguet, right wrist whippin' the whip on stove
He don't care 'bout fame
He just tryna get rich on the low (boom, boom, boom)

Show out, show up 
(See us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole out
(Got 'em runnin, runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up
(Roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up
(We are supremes, you see what I mean)
Show out, show up 
(See us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole out
(Got 'em runnin, runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up
(Roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up
(We are supremes, you see what I mean, uh)

Me and the team 
Runnin' up, hittin' up, sendin' up, get 'em on impact
Pull up on scene
Have 'em all look and we stuntin', no, cannot forget that
Gather my niggas, the realer mane (yeah)
Look in that mirror, see who you are (uh)
All of this evil that's in my way
I pray to God with open arms
No, can't trip, get grip
Hands all over these chips, watch this flip
No, see, I ain't no bitch but I'm bent
I parlay with chicks, the man, the myth
See I'm not dwelling on that (uh)
Focus on runnin' these laps, believe (believe)
Who could it be? Why are my feelings so hellish? The devil, indeed (huh)

Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (yeah)
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (huh)
Am I lost? Pray for me, ooh yeah (yeah)
Dream on, fly away (yeah), dream on
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (yeah)
Lord, are you hearin' me call out? Ayy (go)
Am I lost? Pray for me
What's the cost? Everything
Dream on, fly away, dream on

Show out, show up 
(See us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole out
(Got 'em runnin, runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up
(Roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up
(We are supremes, you see what I mean)
Show out, show up 
(See us pull up, pull up, grrt)
Back out, pole out
(Got 'em runnin, runnin', runnin')
Man down, roll up
(Roll the Fronto, get right)
Man down, roll up
(We are supremes, you see what I mean, uh)
