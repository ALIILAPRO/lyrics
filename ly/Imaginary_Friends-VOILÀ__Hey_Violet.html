		  Na na eh oh na na na na eh oh na na
Na na eh oh na na

Every one of my exes they left and
Say good luck on your own (damn)
It's kinda hard to confess
This my death wish
Is to know if you're not real
'Cause I don't need no fake friends
Or faking pretending their crying
So if i'm being honest bon voyage
Bitch i'm good on my own (yeah)

I can make you up if
Make believes enough 'cause
This facade feels real when it's just us

I never get too lonely
With my imaginary friends
I got everyone around me throwing
A party in my head
And even on the worst of days I
Count on them to keep me sane
Can't fucking trust nobody like
My imaginary friends

Na na eh oh na na na na eh oh na na
Na na eh oh na na

Yeah I could show them my dark side I
Won't hide and they'll never judge me
And I know every secret they'll keep it
And they will still love me
And we will go through the make up
Or stay up and talk until morning
And even though it's unhealthy it helps
Me wouldn't change it for nothing, nothing

I can make you up if
Make believes enough 'cause
This facade feels real when it's just us

I never get too lonely
With my imaginary friends
I got everyone around me throwing
A party in my head
And even on the worst of days I
Count on them to keep me sane
Can't fucking trust nobody like
My imaginary friends

Na na eh oh na na na na eh oh na na
Na na eh oh na na na na eh oh na na
Na na eh oh na na na na eh oh na na

My mom and dad always told me they
Worried i'd end up alone yeah
I want somebody to see me and know
Me stay through my bones yeah
But when I take all my walls down
I'm let down leaving me hallow
So if i'm being honest
