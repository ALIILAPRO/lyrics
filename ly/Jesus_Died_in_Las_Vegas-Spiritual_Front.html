		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do you think you'd love him 
All the same? Even if 
he'd lose 
everything faith Too you gave your blood 
and the rest of That ri--
--diculous crown of all Your rags 
for just 
one dollar. You will ask men 
to follow you And serve you to leave their lands 
And their fathers who will love you 
But cheaters and whores 
Maybe they will follow 
you at the same But they will 
wait for a reward 
Richer than your word.

Jesus died in Las Vegas 
And here the lights have that
have the taste of his blood pain and regret. 
Jesus died in Las Vegas 
And he died with the arrogance 
Of who feels loved 
feels loved and betrayed

In a dim motel 
you betrayed your friends 
And married a beautiful for few dollars
A cigar one day wedding three nails 
Are enough to be part of history
if one accepts it an one believes in 
it someone will follow him 
And abandon flags and kings
With sandals or a cadillac, 

You will have his place
But they will forget you 
And you don't know 
How easy is to substitute a god.

Jesus died in Las Vegas 
And here the lights have that
have the taste of his blood pain and regret. 
Jesus died in Las Vegas 
And he died with the arrogance 
Of who feels loved 
feels loved and betrayed

Nothing is more contagious than sin.
Nothing is more contagious than sin.
Nothing is more contagious than sin.
