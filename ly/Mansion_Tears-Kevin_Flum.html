		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Titties are cool but I really like butts
Got a bad chick man I don't need sluts
Pack coming in and I might need struts
Always get gas so I don't need Runtz
Pull up in that Elon Musk
Backwood smelling like must
On a full send like Nelk
Do what I really wanna do I don't give 2 fucks
And I get her wetter than a moat
Got me feeling like I'm on a boat
Dick got her calling me the goat
Funny that it's coming from the throat
Pussy got me dead got me feeling like a ghost, dead
Backwood so fat, obese
I stay low key no police
Tryna get me a Benz and a Rollie
Only with the friends and the shorty
I don't give a fuck
I don't give a shit
I don't give a damn
Bitch I'm going ham
Everybody know, do it cause I can
I got everything that I need up in my hand
I'ma keep going and flowing and showing these bitches
I'll blow up and act like I ain't knowing these bitches
They holding me back, you holding me back
Why it feel like I'm towing you bitches
Two zero, two one, send it
I ain't dead or apprehended
If you stupid you won't comprehend it
If you broke then you just got to mend it
How you ballin' if you never spend it
Only posing for the pics at Lenox
Ooh shit Kevin is a menace
I just sit here serving like it's tennis
I got money coming from the left
I got money coming for the right
Only difference between you and me
Is that you got money coming for your life
I ain't never stopping what I'm doing
Money speaking to me yeah it's fluent
Everything it's say it sound congruent
You just mad cause you could never do it
You just mad cause you up in the past
You just mad cause you ain't get no ass
I've been drinking water make it splash
Light work money it's a flash
This shit a job for you it's a hobby
I feel like a rockstar like Ozzy
I take it shake it bake it Ricky Bobby
They taking my bags when I walk in the lobby
It's easy, sometimes I feel like I'm on TV
These haters can't see me like Stevie
You mad cause they don't want your CD
Well build you a bridge and get over it
I'ma keep dropping this shit and u know that I got them all dancing
And they say that money cannot buy you happiness
Well then I'd rather just cry in a mansion
