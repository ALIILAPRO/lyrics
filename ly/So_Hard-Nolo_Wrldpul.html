		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Cups of liquor just to get you started
Then you call me when the thrill is calling
Hit me when you're faded, nothing new
Drugs, sex and money that's the move
You acting like it's good for you
But that ain't true
And all I know
Yeah all I know
The way that you can ball
The way you take control
Girl I think you're a pro
Ooh girl you're too raw
Ooh can I have it all
Cause I need it all

You wanna run away
Come right away
Then I grab you by the waist girl
I just wanna taste you
You're going so hard, so hard, so hard
To show me who you are, who you are, you are

Cause I got high, come down I'm anxious
Baby lets go ride on this wave
Cause I want you to feel what you're taking away
And baby just hold me down I pray

I love your silhouette in my vision girl
I'm hoping you accept all my decisions girl
I know it's hard to trust in your position girl
I still need all your love from a distance girl
But I still make mistakes, I still make mistakes
And I know you're gassed up and my foot off the brakes
This is what it takes, oh this what it takes
Why you think I'm telling lies now straight to your face

You wanna run away
Come right away
Then I grab you by the waist girl
I just wanna taste you
You're going so hard, so hard, so hard
To show me who you are, who you are, you are
