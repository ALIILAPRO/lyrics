		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She's just a lover, who makes me high
Is it worth the giving, is it worth the try
You cannot cleave it, or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it, you cannot burn it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Dare me
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) Yea
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Whatever we do to each other
For now we take a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

If you can get it, it's worth a try
I really want it, I can't deny
It's just desire, I really love it
'Cause if it's aching, you have to rub it
She wants to give it

She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) dare me
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)
She wants to give it
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it) yeah
(She wants to give it, she wants to give it)

Just open the door, and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you

Because there's something about you baby

Just promise me, whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet

She wants to give it,
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
She wants to give it,
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
She wants to give it,
She wants to give it, oh she want's to give it
