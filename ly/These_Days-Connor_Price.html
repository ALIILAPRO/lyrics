		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  These days I don't take advice from anybody
Who gon tell me how to do it if they never even did it right
These days I don't waste a minute of my time
Reminiscing on regrets of the past that's a different life
These days I don't need nobody's validation
These days I don't need nobody's invitation
These days I don't tell nobody what I'm doing
I just do it, if I fail keep it pushing till I get it right
These days I been wide awake I never sleep late
Got a lot to do I treat a Sunday like a week day
Do it for my son set the table I need three plates
Have my cake and eat it baby don't forget the cheesecake
Got it
Yeah they know I got it
Confidence contagious so the ones around me cough it
Everybody waiting on me hoping I'm a drop it
I feel like all this weight on me still I'm never stopping
No that is not a
Pushing myself to the limit
I set a goal but still I never feel enough when I get it
Cause when I go and all these feelings overflow to the celling
It's like a hole just opened up and I don't know how to fill it
I tell em
I don't make mistakes, the mistakes made me
Drop songs when I write them, I don't wait 8 weeks
They too focused on the image now but that ain't me
Lotta rats taking pics thats why they say cheese
Lately I been feeling like there's something off
Lotta friends used to show me love ain't showing love at all
Yeah, only cheer me on when I was under-dog
Running up the numbers everybody keep on running off
Funny how they wanted me to win until I passed them
Now all of a sudden they be talking in the past tense
He was this, he was that, like I changed up
Had a kid, I'm a dad, gotta make funds
These days everybody focused on the he say and she say
Acting up and trying to make a scene like a screenplay
Try to be original but end up as a remake
Spend a lot of time thinking bout how I'mma be great
I just stick to the plan
Focused on the music not a pic for the gram
Stay true to my supporters yeah I did it for them
So even when I get hot never switch on a fan
These days I don't take advice from anybody
Who gon tell me how to do it if they never even did it right
These days I don't waste a minute of my time
Reminiscing on regrets of the past that's a different life
These days I don't need nobody's validation
These days I don't need nobody's invitation
These days I don't tell nobody what I'm doing
I just do it, if I fail keep it pushing till I get it right
