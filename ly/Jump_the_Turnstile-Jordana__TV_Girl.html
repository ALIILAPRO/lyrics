		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll

If the southbound train keeps
You away from me and the stations are all
The spaces in between
Found a ticket without a dollar in my jeans
You looked up to kiss me
But you were always taller in my dreams

Who really understands how the
Night connects to day?
When you can't even understand how
It all connects today
All the working stiffs who had
To work can say
I wonder why that little girl
Was crying on the train

Found a friend found a home
Found a foe all alone, so far away from home
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll

Everybody pretending that they don't see
That they don't know
That you're thinking of yesterday
But you're wearing tomorrow's clothes
It isn't fair when you pay the
Fare and he sends you back
You're left laying flat like a
Penny on the tracks

So hop the turnstile, baby
Take the Q until you're sick
Stand on the platform
See the light through the wind
One second you're moving along and the next
You feel like shit never a free ride
Never a yang without the yin

Found a friend found a home
Found a foe all alone, so far away from me

Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Jump the turnstiles, never pay the toll
Doo-wah-diddy and bust in with the pre-roll
