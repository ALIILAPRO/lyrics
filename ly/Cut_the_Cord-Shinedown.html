		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me)
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom) 
Cut it!
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me)
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom)

Let me tell you, I'm vicious
Not pass-aggressive
I got my finger on my pulse
Staring straight into a hole and I'mma get it
And I'm a savage
It's automatic
I got a way of making noise
The power to destroy with no static

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can I get a witness? (Witness)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!

(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me) cut the cord!
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom)

You gotta feel the courage
Embrace possession
If it was easier to shatter everything that ever mattered
But it's not, because it's your obsession
Be a fighter, backbone, desire
Complicated and it stings
But we both know what it means
And it's time to get real and inspired

Now victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten, just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can you witness (witness)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!

Cut it!
Cut it!

'Cause victory is all you need
So cultivate and plant the seed
Hold your breath and count to ten
Just count to ten

I'm gonna make it rain, so ring the bell
I know it all too well
Switchblade on the edge of your wrist
Can you witness? (Witness)
'Cause agony brings no reward
For one more hit and one last score
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!
Don't be a casualty, cut the cord!

(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me) cut the cord!
(Freedom, la la la la)
(Freedom, follow me, me, me)
