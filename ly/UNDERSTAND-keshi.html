		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never thought that I'd find
That the one in my life would be so near
And now you're here

I got you, you got me
When it's us, babe, you make me feel complete
You're all I need

Ooh, ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands

So I guess that it's time
I asked you to be mine for all my days
I hope you'll stay

I'll admit that I'm scared
'Cause I've never really cared as much as this
It's worth the risk

Ooh, ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands
