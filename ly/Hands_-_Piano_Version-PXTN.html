		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh no I've done it again
Let the breeze blow into a wicked wind
Oh god where do I begin to tell you I'm sorry
We're in the middle of it tonight
Three hearts, one fight for my love
And somehow everybody's losing

Is it too late now, to turn back, to turn around
Is it too late now, to start again

These hands
I hold
Are turning my heart into stone
Oh tonight when your all mine
I feel your love and I know it's wasted
Here in these hands I own
Here in these hands I own

So how can we try again
When every wall built starts caving in
We're now waiting for the end to say it's all over

Is it too late now to turn back, to turn around oh
Is it too late now to start again oh

These hands
I hold
Are turning, my heart, into stone
Oh tonight, when your all mine
I feel your love and I know it's wasted
Here in these hands I own

In these hands
I own
Yeah yeah yeah
In these hands, I own
In these hand, In these hands
No we can't win
No we can't win
We're losing
In these hands I own

These hands
I hold
Are turning, my heart, into stone
Oh tonight, when your all mine
I feel your love and I know it's wasted
Here in these hands I own
Here in these hands I own
