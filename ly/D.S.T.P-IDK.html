		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They got me pulled over again so I'm finna perform a concert
In front the police
They got me pulled over again
You wanna talk shit
You wanna run yo' mouth
You want some gangstas front yo' mothafuckin' house
We'll set this bitch off
Set this bitch off
We'll set this bitch off
Set this bitch off
Look, I'm performin' in front of the, uh, fans
On the highway
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Without that badge you a bitch and a half
Nigga, fuck the police
Fuck the police
Are we going to jail or not?
That's the question, I don't know, the money ready
This is pocket change
Fuckin' pocket change, if we goin' to jail, the money is ready
That's what we need to know
