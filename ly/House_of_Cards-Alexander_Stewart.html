		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Changing flights
And changing my mind everyday 
I cope with the pain
But to be honest thing don’t feel the same
Since you left LA

All the stars couldn’t lead me where you are
Shoulda known that in the dark I’d be
Too dumb too see
Even though you’re laying next to me
Can’t give me what I need
Oh
And God I have some questions

How many drinks does it take to walk away?
How many times will I fuck it up and stay?
I don’t know how to love you from a far
You have my heart
Till we fall just like a house 

Of cards
Of cards

Call your bluff
Tell me who are you trying to convince?
It’s not enough
If your words never lead you to commit
You know it feels like shit

All the stars couldn’t lead me where you are
Shoulda known that in the dark I’d be
Too dumb too see
Even though you’re laying next to me
Can’t give me what I need
And God I have some questions

How many drinks does it take to walk away?
How many times will I fuck it up and stay?
I don’t know how to love you from a far
You have my heart
Till we fall just like a house 

Of cards
Of cards
Of cards
Of cards

If we’re made of paper there’s bound to be flames
I’ll hold us together but is it in vain
If one gust of wind could be all that it takes
Oh
If we’re made of paper there’s bound to be flames
I’ll hold us together but is it in vain
If one gust of wind could be all that it takes
All that it takes
All that it takes (to walk away)

How many drinks does it take to walk away?
How many times will I fuck it up and stay?
I don’t know how to love you from a far
You have my heart
Till we fall just like a house 

Of cards
Of cards
Of cards
Of cards
