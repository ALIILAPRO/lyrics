		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Girl when you hold me
How you control me
You bend and you fold me
Anyway you please
It must be easy for you
The loving things that you do
Are just a pastime for you
I could never be

And I never know, girl
If I should stay or go
'cause the games that you play
Keep driving me away

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Kisses and caresses
Are only minor tests, babe
Of love lead to stresses
Between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting
Isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass, girl
I'm proud to take a stand

I can't continue guessing
Because it's only messing
With my pride and my mind
So write down this time to time

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

I'm just a little old-fashioned
It's take more than physical attraction
My initial reaction is honey give me love
Not a facsimile of

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love

Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
