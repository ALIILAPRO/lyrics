		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You hear me calling
I been waiting so long I cant hold it
And I just saw it
All the starts in my head started falling
You follow me?

Cos I've been feeling down
Way more than I should've
And if I'd make it out
You know that I would've

Cause i run away
Run away from problems
You were right
But I'm still in torment
I just just break
When the breaks wont hold me

You can not holla me
When you wanna hold me
Give me back
Like I'm one to borrow
Take all the good and leave me at the back of your heart
Cause when i wake up
I get away
Cant get away from emotions
And if i break down
I'll be okay
Don't be afraid of the moment
I'm so alone
I feel alone
I'm so alone
I feel alone
So alone

You can't ignore it
And you and I both know you can't afford me
Mmm
And i can feel your esteem
Take a hit when I'm just being honest
I'm sorry

Cause i run away
Run away from problems
You were right
But I'm still in torment
I just just break
When the brakes wont hold me

You can not holla me
When you wanna hold me
Give me back
Like I'm one to borrow
Take all the good and leave me at the back of your heart

Cause when i wake up
I get away
Cant get away from emotions
And if i break down
I'll be okay
Don't be afraid of the moment
I'm so alone
I feel alone
I'm so alone
I feel alone
So alone

Cause when i wake up
I get away
Cant get away from emotions
And if i break down
I'll be okay
Don't be afraid of the moment
I'm so alone
I feel alone
I'm so alone
I feel alone

I just hope you hear me calling
