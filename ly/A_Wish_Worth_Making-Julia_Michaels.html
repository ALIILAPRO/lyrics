		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Take it from someone like me
When your hopes are in despair
If your desires have strings
Free them, give them some air

'Cause any wish that's got your heart
On the edge of breaking
Is a wish worth making

Yeah, everybody dreams
To be something someday somewhere
Even kings and queens
Daydream to be free from their royal chairs

Well, any dream that's got your heart
Even when you're not sleeping
Is a dream worth dreaming

Yeah, we all start as wildlings
Playing in the sun
Then we grow up with wild dreams
Just waiting for our day to come

So if hope schemes against time
Tell them, "be nice, play fair"
Yeah, they may kick and cry, yeah
But just show them they're better when paired

'Cause if they both can hold your heart
There's no way you're not sowing
A dream that will never stop growing

Yeah, any wish that's got your heart
On the edge of breaking
Is a wish worth making
