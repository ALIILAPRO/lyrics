		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come, husk your limbs to my floor
Bones sucking stones, her coming storm
Under the lights, you went
Chemical ashes head down
Heart on a diamond thread
Fennel and lashes went down

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-hmm
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-hmm

Young star, haunted lynx
Ring of silver om
I want your bones inside my bones
Under the lights, we went
Wearing our chimes, we bled out
Fennel and lashes wet
Heart on a diamond thread (ah-ah-ah)

You're making me sweat, sweat, sweat
My love down deep into your bones
You're making me sweat, sweat, sweat
My heart down deep into your soul
I can't take it

Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-hmm
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-hmm
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-hmm
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh-hmm

You're making me sweat, sweat, sweat
My love down deep into your bones
You're making me sweat, sweat, sweat
My heart down deep into your soul
I can't take it, I can't take it
