		  Who let the dogs out? 
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?

When the party was nice, the party was bumpin'
Hey, yippie, yi, yo
And everybody havin' a ball
Ha, ha, yippie, yi, yo
I tell the fellas stop the name callin'
Hey, yippie, yi, yo
Then them gyals respond to the call
I hear a woman shout out

Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?

I see ya' little speed boat head up our coast
She really want to skip town
Get back ruffy, back scruffy
Get back you flea infested mongrel

I'm gonna tell myself I might not get angry
Hey, yippie, yi, yo
To hear dem gyals calling them canine
Hey, yippie, yi, yo
But they say, "Hey man dat is part of the party"
Hey, yippie, yi, yo
Them woman in front and they man behind
I hear a woman shout out

Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?

A doggy is nothing if he don't have a bone (yeah, yeah, yeah)
All a doggy hold ya' bone, all doggy hold it
Ah doggy is nothing if he don't have a bone
All doggy hold ya' bone, all doggy hold it (hol' it, hol' it)

Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?

I see ya' little speed boat head up our coast
She really want to skip town
Get back fluffy, back scruffy
Get back you flea infested mongrel

Well if I am a dog
The party is on
I gotta get my groove on 'cause my mind done gone
Do you see the rays coming from my eyes?
Walking through the place the diji-man just breaking 'em down
Me and my white socks 
Short and I can't see color
Any color but you
I'm figuring that's why they call me pit bull
'Cause I'm the man of the land when they see me they say, "ooh"

Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who?

Who let the dogs out? 
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)

Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
Who let the dogs out?
Who, who, who, who, who? (yippie, yi, yo)
