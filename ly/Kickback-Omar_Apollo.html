		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I been away, but now I feel you, yeah
Wonder what made you feel like I could be the one, oh ah

Lately, it's been me, I pissed you off
I let you in my feelings, you really feel, yeah
Uh-huh, sayin'

You been high, I get that
I been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter

I thought you came from nothin'
Trade, I'll ask my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah

I've had a taste of how you feelin', yeah
Yeah, I've been hiding how I feel for way too long, oh

Lately it's been me, I pissed you off
I let you in my feelings, you really feel, yeah
Uh-huh, sayin'

You been high, I get that
I've been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter

I thought you came from nothin'
Trade, I'll ask my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah

You been high, I get that
I've been at the kickback
Nothing will content me
Doesn't matter

I thought you came from nothin'
Trade, I'll ask my cousin
You should like my brother
Doesn't matter, ah
