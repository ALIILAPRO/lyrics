		  Alright now, alright now
God has a plan for you
And all you've got to do is believe, believe, believe
Yeah

This shit gon' get hard, keep your head strong
If I quit now, then I'm dead wrong
Fightin' off this hunger for hours
Big stepper, nigga, don't get stepped on
The money might fade, but respect don't
Still gon' be me when success gone
I don't speak the language of cowards
I walk through the flame like I'm Teflon

I sucked up the pain and I kept goin'
Whole world know my name, bitch, my rep strong
We sold out in less than a hour
These words I still sang like I'm slept on
I sin, so I can't cast the next stone
Unless it's baguettes 'round my neck bone
Inside of my frame lies a power
You can't get this game from no TED Talk
I wanna know if they understand me
I put it all on A, ain't no plan B
Hopin' all this weight ain't gon' drown me
Fucked around, got grey hairs already
Runnin' up the stairs on a tower
Runnin' up these Ms by the hour
If I drop a gem, money showers
When you get your taste, they get sour

This shit gon' get hard, keep your head strong
(Just keep your head strong)
The money might fade, but respect don't
(The ultimate price is regret now)
Still gon' be me when success gone
(Still gon' be me, ah-ah-ah)
Big stepper, nigga, don't get stepped on

Waitin' my turn like grains of sand inside a hourglass
Mainly concerned back in the day with how long I would last
Make a few thousand dollars stack with every hour passed
I catch you playin' inside my lane and I'ma foul your ass
Put the whole game on top my back, don't need no chiropract'
They callin' me young PWC, I got my power back
Ain't fuckin' around, beefin' with me gon' get you hollered at
Niggas can't see me one-on-one, that's word to Kyla Pratt
You hittin' them weights, congratulations 'cause you built somethin'
You takin' a lot of boxin' lessons, but you still pussy
I see right through you niggas just like 2Pac hologram
Ain't doin' Coachella, bookin' me gon' be a lot of Ms
I'm feelin' myself, I'm buildin' my wealth up 'til it's towerin'
I put my tongue all in my bitch, she get to hollerin'
I ain't doin' no dirt no more, I stopped creepin' six years ago
Fun fuckin' them hoes until you realize that you is the ho

This shit gon' get hard, keep your head strong
If I quit now then I'm dead wrong
Fightin' off this hunger for hours
Big stepper, nigga, don't get stepped on
The money might fade, but respect don't
Still gon' be me when success gone
I don't speak the language of cowards
I walk through the flame like I'm Teflon

Can't be afraid of sunlight
Spotlights when it glows
All the pain you hold
Makes you worth your weight in gold
Can't be afraid of sunlight
Spotlights when it glows
All the pain you hold
Makes you worth your weight in gold

God has a plan for you
And all you've got to do is believe, believe, be-
