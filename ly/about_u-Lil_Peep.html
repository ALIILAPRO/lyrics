		<p>
		  Uh-uh
Ayy

Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Runnin' out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die
Would you even cry?
If I end my life
Would you hold me tight then?

Uh-uh
Ayy

Ain't nobody ever told you how I love you
Nobody ever told you how I feel about you
Okay, I admit I wanna fuck you
But it doesn't change the way I feel about you
I been by myself for a long time
I just wish that I could know if I was on your mind
Runnin' out of time
I just wish that I could know if you were by my side
On the day I die
Would you even cry?
If I end my life
Would you hold me tight then?
