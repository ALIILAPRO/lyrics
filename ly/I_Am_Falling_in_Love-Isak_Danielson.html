		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I told you what I felt
I'd watch you walk away
You're not ready to feel what I feel, my babe
Sorry for my words
Sorry for the distance
But I can't pretend like I'm not falling in love

If I should be honest, I miss you, I miss you
I would give my heart to be near you, near you

Baby, you need time, I might too
When I am back home, will I be finding you?

I wanted to stay
I wanna do everything for you
Wish I could say something only we knew
To make you fall
Into the feelings I feel
I can't pretend like I'm not falling in love
'Cause I'm falling in love

I met some of your friends the other day
They say you want to but your heart is afraid

I will be honest, I miss you, I miss you
I will give my all to be near you

I wanted to stay
I wanna do everything for you
Wish I could say something only we knew
To make you fall
Into the feelings I feel
I can't pretend like I'm not falling in love
'Cause I'm falling in love

I've grown so used to this
Your touch is what I missed
So I still need you to promise
You can't tell me you want less
I will call you in August
And sing you my chorus, oh baby

I wanted to stay
I wanna do everything for you
Wish I could say something only we knew

I wanted to stay
I wanna do everything for you
Wish I could say something only we knew
To make you fall
Into the feelings I feel
I can't pretend like I'm not falling in love
'Cause I'm falling in love
