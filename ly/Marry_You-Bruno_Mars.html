		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you

Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard
We can go
No one will know
Oh, c'mon girl

Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow
Shots of Patron
And it's on girl

Don't say no, no, no, no no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you

Oh
I'll go get a ring
Let the choir bell sing like, ooh
So what you wanna do?
Let's just run girl
If we wake up and you wanna break up
That's cool
No, I won't blame you
Uh, it was fun girl

Don't say no, no, no, no no
Just say yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
And we'll go, go, go go, go
If you're ready, like I'm ready

'Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you

Just say I do
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby
Just say I do
Tell me right now baby
Tell me right now baby, baby

Oh
It's a beautiful night, we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby, I think I wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes, or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby, I think I wanna marry you
