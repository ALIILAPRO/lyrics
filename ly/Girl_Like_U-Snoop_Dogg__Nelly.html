		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  [Chorus]
If I didn't have no dough would you love me,
If we didn't have a place to go would you still be
There or would you leave me alone when the chips are down
Or would you stay around, and lay down,
Oh girl,
I gotta have a chick like you,
I gotta have a girl like you,
I gotta have a chick like you,
I gotta have a girl like you,

[Nelly]
Oh yeah who that is standing there like that looking from the front
But I can see what's in the back, hips like oh,
Eyes like wow, pretty toes in the room and they be looking like wow

[Snoop]
I don't know nephew lets just do what we do, 
Lets just slide up on these hoes and put this pimping
In do, (agree) and then what we do (what we do) 
You take the one in the white I'll take the one in
The blue

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
Hey yo I don't know if you been told but you look like you should be gold, 
You're so preasus the
Way you shape up I'm just hear to help you 
Step you're game up you look like you might die for me
Hop in front of the bullet and die for me 
Cause when I fly you be fly and when I fly to other
Countries you going fly with me

[Chorus]

[Snoop]
Now as the night wines down and the weed gets down, 
Players till playing and I'm still on the floor, 
I groove to the beat until my feet get tired I just want to be you're desire, 
Eva caneva Best believer you're not a dime pice you're a diva 
Take it from me you can be the O.N.E if you roll
With me

[Nelly]
If looks were the case babygirl id be a federal the top perfect incredible 
The bottom As editble 
Uh I ain't telling you what I heard man 
I'm telling you what I know and I ain't telling 
Her what to say but where to go, 
But if she wants we can take trip down with the homie d-o double
G and if she wants we can form a lil down if its low key yes we would go down

[Chorus]

Clap your hands everybody,
Everybody claps your hands, and if you came to party with the d-o double g and any double one
Lets bounce, I said clap your hand everybody, 
Everybody clap your hands, and if you came to party with the d-o double g and any double one
Why bounce
