		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  People talking but it ain't the truth
Lyin' ain't no substitute
You ought to be ashamed of yourself
Try to put the blame on somebody else
Ain't no reason I know
To stop you reaping what you sow
You must know right from wrong
Don't make out, you don't know what's going on.
A man's gotta do it right
And if we gotta fight all night
That's alright. I got time.
And fighting liars suits me just fine
A man oughta tell it true
According to his point of view
And whatever you want to be
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
People talking round and round
Whisper rumours try to bring you down
You can't make shit into gold
And nothing's over 'til the story's told
People talking all around the world
Eating facts and throwing up words
Turn around so I can see your face
I don't care if you need your space

A man's gotta be a man and you can see just what I am
There ain't no room for mistakes
Everybody knows the moves they ought to make
A man's gotta tell the truth.
And if it's good, he don't need proof
And whoever you think you see
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me.

People talkin' but they just don't know
Ain't got no pride no more
Want to be on TV so bad
They give away all the honour they had
Ain't no way I can see that people gonna listen to me
But I know what I know
And I'll see more than you'll ever show

A man's gotta play the game
And save the worth of his name
Cause waiting out there on the edge
Is everything you need to make a fool of yourself
And if you want to know the score
It that's what you're waiting for
Don't look at me, I won't tell
You better get out and see yourself
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
Don't lie to me
You know I hate that shit baby
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
Uh-huh honey, can't you see
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
