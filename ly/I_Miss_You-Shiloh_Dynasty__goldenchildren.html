		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss you
I hate that I love you
Cause had no words to say
We don't talk anymore we lack of discussion
I’m chasing your heart away

You say that you love me
But we all know that's some bullshit
You're playing with my mind again

But I still want you
Though your no good for me
But I still want you
Though were not meant to be

I love you
I hate that you don’t feel the same way as me
We don't know anymore
What happened between us, but we both know it's time to go
