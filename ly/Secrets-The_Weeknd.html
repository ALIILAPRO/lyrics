		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody here wants you
My love, my love
And I know that you want 'em too
My love, my love
I ask you what your heart desires
My love, my love
You tell me I'm the only one
My love, my love

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

You told me not to worry 'bout
Those guys, those guys
You told me that you left it all behind
Behind

It's a lie, a lie
I catch you every time
In your lust, your lust
Every time you close your eyes

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'

Wipe the lust from your eyes
I see that you're not mine
I can see the lust in your eyes (wipe the)
You can't hide it (lust from your eyes)
You can't be the one (I)
I rely, we're divided (see that you're not mine)

I hear the secrets that you keep (the secrets that you keep)
When you're talkin' in your sleep (talkin' in your sleep) 
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep (the secrets that you keep)
When you're talk, talkin', talkin' (oh)
I hear the secrets that you keep (hey, the secrets that you keep)
When you're talkin' in your sleep (talkin' in your sleep) 
I hear the secrets that you keep, keep, keep (the secrets that you keep)
When you're talk, talkin', talkin'
