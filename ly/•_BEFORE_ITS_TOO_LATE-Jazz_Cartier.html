		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look
I don't follow suit
My backhands like Serena when I follow through
I'd end up in a ditch if I followed you
My focus is gettin' rich and taking care of the clique, oh shit
Flowers in the bed, you know where I been
I can name a lot friends that done came and went
And my emotions like, "Money well spent"
I'm a cold-hearted nigga, I don't ever feel shit (ice, cold)
My walls can talk, my phone is tapped
My heart is gold, my lungs are black
My account in call, my funds intact
I ain't burn no bridge, that bitch collapsed
Off a sick stage read the Bible backwards
Get the money out the case and get the title after
No time for surfin' Tidal rappers
And when I lapse around you niggas, we can cycle after
I ain't even shine the vision on 'em
Had hits and I was sittin' on 'em
I get it daily like the vision on 'em
I got it written on me
I got the spot 'cause you was slippin' on it, yeah
And I can never take advice from a broke nigga
I got plenty opportunities to show, nigga
It's La Fleur, have you not see the growth nigga?
Wake up in the morning, think about it, then I go get it, oh nigga
No fisher on me, I'm not long John Silver
Forced along and I gotta strong arm niggas
And my momma need a house in Jamaica
Now how I'm finna get it if I talk on Twitter?
Now you boys don't work with me in the slightest
I just think about it then I write it
I pour gas and ignite it
I got your girl on her knees, if you seen her you would think she's gettin' knighted
I'm tap dancin' upon broken glass
My accounts open over draft
As I stumble out the overpass
They upset, everything I do wet
Try to stop me at net, I could've swear my name was Arthur Ashe
Heaven's no destination
I'm playin' fetch with Satan
I got the world in my hands, watch me decorate it
I fell asleep in the trap, woke up the blood on my lap
City's still on my back, I got this sinister vision of how I should be livin'
I'm no angel momma, I've made some wrong decisions
That's why I'm stuck inside the stu' to make an honest livin'
My only flaw is women, can't get it robbing, giving
Nah, now this the part where the plot thickens
Headshots and I'll drop niggas
On every track a whole pack listens
Until it made, you got a stock vision
Yeah, the name is Cartier but that ain't never mean that I watch niggas
I feel the pressure more than ever now
I keep tellin' myself to settle down
Friends askin' for a favor, they was never 'round
Y'all know my time is comin', you ain't even gotta wonder, say the name, nigga
Cuzzi
