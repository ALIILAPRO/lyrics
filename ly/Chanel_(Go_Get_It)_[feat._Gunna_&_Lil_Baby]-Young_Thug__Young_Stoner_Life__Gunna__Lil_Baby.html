		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Anything she want she can get, oh, give her (get her)
Oh, Anything she want she can get (she want, she can get)
(Wheezy outta here)

She want Chanel, go get it
She want Chanel, go get it
She want this Fendi, go get it
She want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it
She want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it
Everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley sedan, she get it
Hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it
The Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it
Asanti the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty 
Anything she want she can get it

Anything you see, you can get it (get it)
Here go the keys to the Bentley
When I fuck her, I got good intentions (yeah)
I just can't get my palms to stop itchin'
Water on me like I live with the fishes (fishes)
I done ordered every color in tennis
Got the diamonds put in by my dentist (my dentist)
I'ma shine when I'm skinnin' and grinnin' (shine)
Ice my watch, I'm not wastin' my time (my time)
Gunna drippin' with Uzi and Slime (Slime)
Connect with my bitch like Wi-Fi
Slidin' in her DM like a cha-cha
I got M's, I can take care of the southside
I've been bettin' the billionaire ties (ties)
Got the Yves Saint Laurent heels in your size
Get the penthouse and fill it with vibes (vibes)
Got Marc Jacob's, they cover my eyes
She need help, I'ma send her a dime (dime)
I can't pour nothin' less than two lines
Ocean view, yeah, the back seat reclines
She want me to put that dick in her spine (spine)
Take her shoppin' and keep her from cryin' (cryin')
Give you stones, think you one of a kind
Got Chanel with the C's on both sides

She want Chanel, go get it
She want Chanel, go get it
She want this Fendi, go get it
She want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it
She want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it
Everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley sedan, she get it
Hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it
The Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it
Asanti the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty 
Anything she want she can get it

She want Chanel, she can get it
Louis V bag and Dior her titty
They locked the door when we walk in Fendi
Save the hunnids, them dubs, we spendin'
Real dope boy, ain't chargin' no card
New G-Wagon, she already got
Real grown woman, she ain't post her body
Check price tags, you want it, you get it
You a big Thugger fan, he scared to admit it
Gettin' sixty for a show, I'm handlin' business
L.A. for a month, get away from the city
Been sippin' this syrup, I'ma need a new kidney
Just tell me where it's at and I'ma go in and get it
'Ever I say, she on it
New Range Rover, she want it
We don't do notes, she own it
Runnin' out of space for the bags in her closet
Runnin' through checks every day, no fraud shit
Rose gold Presidential Rollie look polished
Bad lil' bitch, good brain, go college
You ain't really gotta pay for nothin', I got it
Big bankroll, I ain't totin' no wallet
I don't withdraw, nigga, name deposit
T-Pain, Plies, I call her my shawty
My shawty

She want Chanel, go get it (she want Chanel, go get it)
She want Chanel, go get it (go get it)
She want this Fendi, go get it
She want a Birkin, go get it
She want this Gucci, she get it
She want this Louis, go get it
Loubs with the spikes, she get it
Everything I got, she gettin' it, yeah
Bentley sedan, she get it
Hop out the Benz, she gettin' it
Hop out the Lamb, she gettin' it
The Porsche Cayenne, she gettin' it
Hop out the coupe, she get it
Asanti the shoes, she get it
I put my kids on her titty, 
Anything she want she can get it
