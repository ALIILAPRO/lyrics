		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ah-ooh!
Let's go!

S.O.S she's in disguise
S.O.S she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me
Darling it is no joke this is lycanthropy
The moon's awake now with eyes wide open
My body's craving so feed the hungry

I've been devoting myself to you 
Monday to Monday and Friday to Friday
Not getting enough retribution
Or decent incentives to keep me at it
I'm starting to feel just a little abused 
Like a coffee machine in an office, uh
I'm gonna go somewhere cozy to get me
A lover and tell you all about it

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free, ah-ooh!
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe

Standing across a bar staring right at her prey
It's going well so far she's gonna get her way
Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent
The moon's my teacher and I'm her student

To locate the single men I got on me a special radar
And the fire department hotline in case I get in trouble later
Not looking for cute little divos 
Or rich city guys that just want to enjoy
By havin' a very good time and behave
Very bad in the arms of a boy

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Open up and set it free, ah-ooh!
There's a she-wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe

S.O.S she's in disguise
S.O.S she's in disguise
There's a she-wolf in disguise
Coming out, coming out, coming out

All right, girls
I'm gonna need your help with this
You're gonna help me she-wolf style
I need to talk to my cameraman
John, I want you to locate the best she wolves in the house
And put 'em on the big screen, okay? Got me?
Remember the ah-ooh!
Are you ready girls?
Are you ready girls?

S.O.S she's in disguise (all right, let's do it)
(Ah-ooh!)
S.O.S she's in disguise (come on)
(Ah-ooh!)
There's a she-wolf in disguise
(Ah-ooh!)
Coming out, coming out, coming out
(Ah-ooh!)
S.O.S she's in disguise (last one)
(Ah-ooh!)
S.O.S she's in disguise (come on girls)
(Ah-ooh!)
There's a she-wolf in disguise (awesome, one last time)
Coming out, coming out, coming out (here we come)
(Ah-ooh!)

There's a she-wolf in the closet
Let it out so it can breathe
