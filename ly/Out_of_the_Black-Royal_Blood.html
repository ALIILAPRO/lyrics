		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How did it feel 
When it came alive and took you
Out of the black?
It broke your skin and shift through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to
I got a gun for my mouth 
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Bleeding blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why
And you didn't care when
It closed every door
And washed away no sin
And I promised you 
Like you promised me
But those vows we made
We fucked it up for free, yeah

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to
I got a gun for my mouth 
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Bleeding blood from an empty pocket

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to
I got a gun for my mouth 
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Bleeding blood from an empty pocket

And it tortures slow
Never lets you go
Deals a crooked hand
