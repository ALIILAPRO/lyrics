		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Time don't make it better
I just keep on fallin' for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep waitin' for you

You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard tryna cope living without you

Oh, please don't change your smile
You're the only one I love, please never doubt
That you're gonna be the only one for me
I've been sitting down waiting so desperately

Time don't make it better
I just keep on fallin' for you
Ah, we change like the weather
I just can't keep waitin' on you

You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard tryna cope breathin' without you
Ooh

Oh, I've got no fear in me
But it feels too good tryna make a scene
'Cause you got me feelin' high like a kite you see
If it don't make sense, it ain't meant to be

But tears don't make it better
I just can't keep fallin' for you
We change like the weather
I just can't keep fallin' on you

You can clearly see God made a masterpiece
And it's getting so hard tryna find the key
If I wait any longer, my heart will bleed
Can't spend my whole life in a lucid dream
When my friends tell me that I got a love disease
'Cause I said I won't live if I have to do life
Without you

(All I think about is you)
(All I think about is you)
(All I think about is you)
(All I think about is you)
(All I think about is you)
(All I think about is you)
(All I think about is you)
