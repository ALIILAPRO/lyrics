		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dame with eyes of green
Legs lie soft on the sand beside the sea
With tilted shades, beaming eyes, they looked at me
As if to say, "pull in your reel, pretty boy
And stop lookin' this way"

But, ooh, I love it
When you talk to me like you do

Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me

Your voice it blooms the flowers on the beach
With lips that glisten in the moonlight every time you speak
A somber tone of men I've known, being lonely
Oh, so lonely
But, luckily, luckily she's got her eyes on me

But, ooh, I love it
When you talk to me like you do

Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me

Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me
Oh, my lady by the sea, yeah
Come and lie next to me
