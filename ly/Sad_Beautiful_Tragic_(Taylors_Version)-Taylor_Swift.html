		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long handwritten notes, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons, and darlin', they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

Oh oh, oh oh-oh-oh

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up
And for the life of us, we can't get back

A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic
Beautiful

What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
