		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Oh my God, he on X games mode)

All you do is lose, you come in last 
I come in first
All she want me to do is make her laugh
And take off her shirt
When I fuck my bitch, I don't even make her take off her skirt
'Cause when we fuck and spit, yeah
She know I'ma make her cum first
If you ain't talkin' money, lil' boy, I don't wanna converse
And just before I do anything, I roll up a blunt and pour some syrup
And when I'm not high it's easy for you to get on my nerves
And if the Feds catch me, they gon' try to put me under the dirt

I got a Glock with a switch and a stick with a shell catcher
If I up this, boy, I swear I won't miss, I put that on my gang, yessir
I put that on my gang yessir, I put that on my gang for sure
And like you want some smoke? And you want some problem? 
You wan' see it, lil nigga, let's go, huh
I just fuck my bitch good and rock out my show
I'm on the Southside, I got that big gun and a big K to tote
If I wanna get high, I gotta whole pint and a whole P to smoke
Bitch, I got more money and more weed than George Jung off Blow
And I stay low key but I'm still poppin' my shit on the low
That Maybach drive itself, I don't even gotta touch the wheel, that bitch just go
And before I got rich I was been poppin' my shit from head to toe
Swaggin' shit from head to toe, fuckin' bitches that you know, huh
Let me switch up my flow, I been performin' coast to coast
Ridin' in a Rolls, bitch, yeah, this a Ghost
I celebrate every day, yeah, make a toast
I be flexing every day, yeah, shit don't post it
She say you look cute and she love how I stroke it
Dressed up in Margee it's hard for her to stay focused 
She say she love me but I already noticed
She want double C, I bought that lil' bitch a Coach
All I see is me 'cause, I know all these hoes on go
I'm stiff on everybody, I'm not easy to approach
And I don't fuck with nobody, I'll up that stick if I don't know you
Wet ya whole gang up like water, yeah, this stick a Super Soaker
Hit him in his leg, made him do the hokie pokie
I hit her from the back, this bitch can't do nothing but fold up
I done told this bitch all lies, she believed everything I told her
I told the bitch I got six wives and she ain't give no fucks 
She just wanna live it up, yeah 
She just wanna go shopping and go on a lil' date, huh
She just wanna get laid, uh
I just wanna get paid, uh
Designer my shades, yeah, designer my fit
Diamonds all white like grits
I was down bad on my dick
I ain't have nothin', nigga, I ain't have shit
Now I'm gettin money, yeah, yeah, I'm the shit, huh
You ain't gettin nothin', yeah, yeah, you ain't shit, huh
You ain't got no money, but you worried 'bout that bitch, huh
And if you ain't got no bitches, why you all on my dick?
I been puttin' in too much time, too much work for this shit
And I ain't never in my feelings, I don't never got a vent

All you do is lose, you come in last (yeah)
I come in first
All she want me to do is make her laugh
And take off her shirt
When I fuck my bitch, I don't even make her take off her skirt
'Cause when we fuck and spit, yeah
She know I'ma make her cum first
If you ain't talkin' money, lil' boy, I don't wanna converse
And just before I do anything, I roll up a blunt and pour some syrup
And when I'm not high it's easy for you to get on my nerves
And if the Feds catch me, they gon' try to put me under the dirt
