		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never thought you'd end up with me for long baby
Running in quick sand to keep you here with me
I had you in my head baby every day
But towards the end I just couldn't hear your name
It's stress relief from everything
It's stress relief from everything
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, wont you let me be myself
I was holding on but you didn't see my shots baby
All the times that I couldn't speak my thoughts well maybe
Well this is what I wanted please don't feel so bad
In love with a ghost please won't you come back
Well this is what I wanted please don't feel so bad
In love with a ghost please don't come back
It's Stress Relief from everything
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, wont you let me be myself
Si puedes venir con migo amor
Yo te enseno todo lo que hay
Porque me tratas asi?
Como no soy nadien
Tell me you love me
Come back to haunt me
Won't you just let me be myself
Tell me, tell me you love me
Come back, come back to haunt me
Won't you, wont you let me be myself
