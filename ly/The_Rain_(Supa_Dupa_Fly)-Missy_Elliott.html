Me, I'm supa fly, supa dupa fly
Supa dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (against my window) 
Supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (against my window) 
Supa dupa fly, supa dupa fly (I, I can't stand the rain)
Me, I'm supa fly (against my window)

When the rain hits my window
I take a-, me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight, that you get our styles tangled
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
Can we get kinky tonight? 
Like Coko, so-so
You wanna play with my yo-yo (uh-huh)
I smoke my hydro on the d-low (d-d-d-d-d-low)

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I, I can't stand the rain 
Against my window

Yeah
Beep beep, who got the keys to the Jeep? Vroom
I'm driving to the beach 
Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be (who it be?)
It be me, me, me and Timothy
Look like it's 'bout to rain, what a shame 
I got the Armor-All to shine up the 'Stang
Oh, Missy, try to maintain
Flicky-flicky-flicky-flicky-flicky-flicky

I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
I, I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window 
I can't stand the rain

I feel the wind 
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten (nine, ten)
Begin, I sit on hills like Lauryn
Until the rain starts, coming down, pouring 
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves be dazed, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me (dump me)
To have me, yes, you lucky (yes, you lucky)

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I, I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain 

I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I, I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain 
Against my window
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
I can't stand the rain
