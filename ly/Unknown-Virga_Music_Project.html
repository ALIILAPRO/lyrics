		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Wonder why
I wonder why I keep on trying to stay
Can't break away
I realized
That I might just need to find another way
Another day

Take it all out of me again
I need to get away
I need to get away
I don't care yeah just go ahead
Back for me to stay
But I need to get away

And all I know
Is that I need to let go
I can make it alone oh
So just take it slow
Walking to the unknown
I can make it alone
I'm diving into the unknown
The unknown

Behind your eyes
See the lights and I wonder why
I was blind out of my mind
Right from the start
You were sworn my missing part
And you took my heart
Until read apart

Wonder why
I wonder why I keep on trying to stay
Can't break away
I realized
That I might just need to find another way
Another day

Take it all out of me again
I need to get away
I need to get away
I don't care yeah just go ahead
Back for me to stay
But I need to get away

And all I know
Is that I need to let go
I can make it alone oh
So just take it slow
Walking to the unknown
I can make it alone
I'm diving into the unknown

Behind your eyes
See the lights and I wonder why
I was blind out of my mind
Right from the start
You were sworn my missing part
And you took my heart
Until read apart

And all I know
