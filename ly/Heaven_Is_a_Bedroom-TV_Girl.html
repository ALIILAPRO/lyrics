		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And I remember how the
Pillows felt like clouds
Or was it the other way around
And how your neighbor came in to yell at you
When the party got too loud

And when I snuck into your living room
And I wished that you would follow
At first you didn't but then you did
And it was already tomorrow

And you told me how you had an uncle
Who played the villain in those movies
And how he died and then you cried
You apologized profusely
I was nervous that this was as
Good as I could ever feel and I was right

I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
But really they just start
With the letter 'S'
You'll forgive me for thinking
Heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

And I'll always remember picking up my
Favorite records from your apartment
Kissing you before you left me for New York
Weren't you a princess, or an heiress
Or just the daughter of a rich man
In this land of constant sunshine I
Thought you'd never have to work
New York City's cold and
When you love someone
You should hold on to them so tightly
Till you crush them
Or they wriggle from your grasp
You don't just stand there and say nothing
But at least I learned my lesson

I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
But really they just start
With the letter 'S'
You'll forgive me for thinking
Heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get

If I ever make it to New York
Like I said that I would
Would it do me any good?

If I ever make it to New York
Like I told you on the phone

I confess to thinking sex was my salvation
When really they just start
With the letter 'S'
You'll forgive me for thinking
Heaven was her bedroom
It's as close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
As close as I would ever get
