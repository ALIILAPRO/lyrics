		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Imagine if we made peace by peace
A lot of ups and harmonies
Everyday we're broken piece by piece
Need to remedy our minds
Recover us

Oh, clouds paint the naked sky tonight
Oh, dreaming

I just wanna feel the world
Around me more and more
'Cause everybody
Fears the one, the one thing they can't cure

Just tear the page
Spoken parts
Broken pieces of our hearts

To find a way to heal the world
Without a single word
Recover us
Oh

Over complicating simple things
All the good things come alive
Where's the eye to the impulsive kings
Need to remedy our minds
Recover us

Oh, clouds paint the naked sky tonight
Oh, we're dreaming

I just wanna feel the world
Around me more and more
'Cause everybody
Fears the one, the one thing they can't cure

Just tear the page
Spoken parts
Broken pieces of our hearts

To find a way to heal the world
Without a single word
Recover us
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I just wanna feel the world
Surrounding more and more
'Cause everybody
Fears the one, the one thing they can't cure

Lightening and the thunder going under
Let the rain fall and wash away

To find a way to heal the world
Without a single word
Recover us
Oh, oh, oh, oh
