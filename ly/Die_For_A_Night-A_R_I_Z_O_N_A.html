		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know this is what I came for
But now I'm not so sure
Everything I wanted
Is right behind that door

Bright green eyes
And warning signs
They've got me surrounded
A bad idea's a good idea
If you don't think about it, about it

You've got a cold, cold touch and it's giving me chills
I've got a real bad feeling that your lips could kill
Well, maybe that'll be alright
I always wanted to die for a night
You've got a shoot first, drive fast mentality
I think your kiss might be the death of me
Well, maybe that'll be alright
I always wanted to die for a night

Oh, I get so tired
Of four white walls
So push me, don't catch me
Baby, if I fall

Bright green eyes
And warning signs
They've got me surrounded
A bad idea's a good idea
If you don't think about it, about it, about it

You've got a cold, cold touch and it's giving me chills
I've got a real bad feeling that your lips could kill
Well, maybe that'll be alright
I always wanted to die for a night
You've got a shoot first, drive fast mentality
I think your kiss might be the death of me
Well, maybe that'll be alright
I always wanted to die for a night
