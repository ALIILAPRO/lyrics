		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayy

I got three whips (three), holy trinity (yeah)
Man, I swear you ain't never gettin' rid of me (rid of me)
I got bands now (bands) to infinity
Put a bitch in quarantine 'cause she sick of me
Ooh, if I said it then I mean it
Already did that thang you want, I don't repeat shit
We hit Miami and get toxic for the weekend
For the weekend, yeah (ooh)

Ayy, I'm doin' well (well)
I be overseas makin' money like Adele (true)
Laps in the pool with my chains, Michael Phelps (laps)
Plaques comin' in, put it right there on the shelf
All I know is green, bitch, it's better for my health
Blow a hundred with you, baby girl, I might as well
Crash the party, after party right at the hotel
Said that we in love when the clock is strikin' twelve

New whip lookin' black, bitch, I feel like Christian Bale
Diamonds on my neck with YSL
Bad lil' bitch up on me, fly as hell
She gon' give me brain like she from Yale
Oh hell, yeah

I got three whips (three), holy trinity (yeah)
Man, I swear you ain't never gettin' rid of me (rid of me)
I got bands now (bands) to infinity
Put a bitch in quarantine 'cause she sick of me
Ooh, if I said it then I mean it
Already did that thang you want, I don't repeat shit (I don't repeat)
We hit Miami and get toxic for the weekend
For the weekend, yeah (ooh)

Rich
Stars in the ceilin' Wraith just for the weekend (the weekend)
My lil' bitch a whole dime, she ain't decent (woo)
When I'm on the way I got her leakin' (leakin')
Pussy so good I'm singin' to her like The Weeknd (Weeknd)
Pull out the Lamb', Wraith and the 'Rari (skrrt)
Killed the lot but I'm not sorry (not sorry)
Flexin' up, might get the Bugatti (flex)
It's an all-black whip 
I'm in the back, she give me the lip 
It's the weekend, take a trip

In the all black whip like Christian Bale
Diamonds on my neck with YSL
Bad lil' bitch up on me, fly as hell
She gon' give me brain like she from Yale
Oh hell, yeah (ooh, ooh)

I got three whips (three), holy trinity (yeah)
Man, I swear you ain't never gettin' rid of me (rid of me)
I got bands now (bands) to infinity
Put a bitch in quarantine 'cause she sick of me
Ooh, if I said it then I mean it (then I mean it)
Already did that thang you want, I don't repeat shit (I don't repeat it)
We hit Miami and get toxic for the weekend (for the weekend)
For the weekend, yeah (yeah, yeah)
For the weekend (hey)
