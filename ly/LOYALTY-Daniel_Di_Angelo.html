		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I got that thang shawty
Got all these girls callin' my name shawty
I'm speeding fast way through the lanes shawty
Come and catch me, bet you can't shawty
Yeah yeah
I'm fuckin' noble
I see through your eyes, I see that pussy, don't need focals
She say that she masturbates to the sound of my vocals
She don't hear nobody else for night time
She says she wants to give me head, she's in her right mind
Good deal
Tell me that's real
I'll roll, you seal
I'll drive, you steer
Pop off the game for you baby, don't let me down
Kill any man for you, baby, don't let me down
Take any enemy, baby, without a question
They fuck with you, then they'll learn their ass a lesson now
I'm switchin' lanes on 'em baby, don't let me down
I'll never change on you baby, don't let me down
I'd pave the way for you, I'd stay the same for you
I need your loyalty for me, I would wait for you
Yeah yeah yeah
Give me your loyalty baby, I'll wait for ya
Keep it a hundred, no change for ya
Benjamin Franklin, I'll pay for ya
Sing out my soul on a stage for ya
Baby, I'll catch a grenade for ya
So many lives that I'd save for ya
So many lives that I'd take for ya
All you gotta do is stay loyal
Good deal
You know, that's real
I swerve so far
Brain so good, girl you're so smart
Pop off the game for you baby, don't let me down
Kill any man for you, baby, don't let me down
Take any enemy, baby, without a question
They fuck with you, then they'll learn their ass a lesson now
I'm switchin' lanes on 'em baby, don't let me down
I'll never change on you baby, don't let me down
I'd pave the way for you, I'd stay the same for you
I need your loyalty for me, I would wait for you
Pop off the game for you baby, don't let me down
Kill any man for you, baby, don't let me down
Take any enemy, baby, without a question
They fuck with you, then they'll learn their ass a lesson now
I'm switchin' lanes on 'em baby, don't let me down
No baby, don't let me down
Loyalty for me, I would wait for you
