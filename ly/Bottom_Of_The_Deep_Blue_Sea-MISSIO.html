		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The berth surrounding my body crushing every bit of bone
The salt, it seeps in through the pores of my open skin
I wait on you inside the bottom of the deep blue sea
I wait on you inside the bottom of the deep blue

Welcome to my cage, little lover
Attempt to rearrange with you, baby
Still don't know your name, Miss Honey
Let's go up in flames, pretty lady

The sweet surrender of silence forces me to live alone
Locked and loaded, where the hell is peace of mind?
I wait on you inside the bottom of the deep blue sea
I wait on you inside the bottom of the deep blue

Welcome to my cage, little lover
Attempt to rearrange with you, baby
Still don't know your name, Miss Honey
Let's go up in flames, pretty lady

Welcome to my cage, little lover
Attempt to rearrange with you, baby
Still don't know your name, Miss Honey
Let's go up in flames, pretty lady

The bottom of the deep blue see
The bottom of the deep blue sea

Welcome to my cage, little lover
Attempt to rearrange with you, baby
Still don't know your name, Miss Honey
Let's go up in flames, pretty lady

Welcome to my cage, little lover
Attempt to rearrange with you, baby
Still don't know your name, Miss Honey
Let's go up in flames, pretty lady
