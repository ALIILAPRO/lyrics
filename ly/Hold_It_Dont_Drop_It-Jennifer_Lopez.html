		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need

You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

Every time I try to run
Something keeps stoppin' me (oh keeps stoppin' me)
I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave
Uh uh, yeah yeah

I cant control it
You put something inside of me, ooh
'Cause you're a problem
Boy, you must've poisoned me oh ho

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need

You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand (oh, I can't understand)
I'll be the yo-yo on a string
Goin' down I come right back to your hands
Uh uh, that's right, uh

I make excuses, but we keep on rockin' anyway ooh
But it ain't workin', when I let you go you make me stay

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need

You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

Don't let me (me) leave (leave)
Control (control) of me (of me)
You got what (you got what) I need (I need, yeah)
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

Won't let you go, can't let you leave
I need your love inside of me
You got control, control of me

Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin' to stop it, cant stop it
'Cause you got what I need

You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

You don't know what you're doin'
What you're doin' to me
Tryin to stop it, cant stop it
'Cause you got what I need

You got me all open
And now you're tryin' to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
