		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come away with me
We'll find our home, we'll find our peace
Stolen from the sun, you shine for me, you shine for me

Walk through city streets and hold my hand, you hold my hand
Tell me anything, just speak to me, that's all I need

I am, I am a fool now, I am a fool now, for you

Take me through your thoughts I know them well, oh can you tell
Open up your heart, and let me in, just let me in

I am, I am a fool now, I am a fool now, for you
I am, I am a fool now, I am a fool now, for you
I am, I am a fool now, I am a fool now, for you
I am, I am a fool now, I am a fool now, for you

Oh hear it coming 
Feel it coming 
cll the walls are falling down
I know your coming 
Feel it coming 
Feel it calling on the lord's name
