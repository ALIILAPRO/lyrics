		  Feeling like getting this work
Feeling like getting this work
I'm just tryna get high first
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high first
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high first
But they keep on blowing my shit
I'm just tryna water my bitch
Really won't take no shit
2k a day that's rent living like im overdue
Clip in the semi on full play if you want
That's a fool
You know how I rock on the cool

You know I rock like a cut off stocking
You know I got it i keep a rocket
I might just pass it dennis rodman
All of my life been a bull
All of my life I had pull selling dope
All in middle school while you lame dudes
Made honor roll i ain't switch up
No audibles put in work
I broke all the tools feeling good
Eating on shrooms i just gotta do
What I gotta do plain jane my Glock ouu
10k in my pocket ouu
Only time on my clock ouu
Is when to get to that gwoup ouu

Feeling like getting this work
Feeling like getting this work
I'm just tryna get high first
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high first
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high first
But they keep on blowing my shit
I'm just tryna water my bitch
Really won't take no shit
2k a day that's rent living like im overdue
Clip in the semi on full play if you want
That's a fool
You know how I rock on the cool

You know I'm rocking i beat it up
Give me the script and I eat it up
Heard that you hoes is some leaches bruh
All of my life I been down
All of my life I don't play
Need me a zip everyday
Fuck what they say aye racks in they face
Don't wanna catch me a case
But baby I might on one of you lames
Come in and fuck up the game
Baby what's life oh switch up my chains
I want everything and more marry the gwoup
Need a ring get you lit up like spring ouu
I need mine highkey ouu

Feeling like getting this work
Feeling like getting this work
I'm just tryna get high first
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high first
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high
I'm just tryna get high first
But they keep on blowing my shit
I'm just tryna water my bitch
Really won't take no shit
2k a day that's rent living like im overdue
Clip in the semi on full play if you want
That's a fool
You know how I rock on the cool
