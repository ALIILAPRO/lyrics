		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead, a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction

So tell me, what would you say?
I'd say it's time to listen

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance and understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding?
How far will we take this?
It's not hard to see through the fakeness

So tell me, what would you say?
I'd say it's time to listen

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
Tell me (tell me, tell me, tell me)
So

What have we done
With a war that can't be won?
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe 

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating?
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe
