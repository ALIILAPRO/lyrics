		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Livin' life through the night
Thin line of a lightnin' strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Pistons pumpin'
Minds are racin'
It's hard to sleep, man
When I'm shakin'
Bad news surrounds me
It's always found me
Creepin' up when things are good
Yeah, the dark days find a way

Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Livin' life through the night
Thin line of a lightnin' strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

The camera captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always movin'
It don't stop rollin'
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?

Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Livin' life through the night
Thin line of a lightnin' strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
It's a long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Livin' life through the night
Thin line of a lightnin' strike
Is sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

Loud thunder, heavy rain

Loud thunder, heavy rain
Thin line 'tween joy and pain
A long strange trip, it's all insane
You ain't never gon' be the same

Loud thunder, heavy rain
Loud thunder, heavy rain
