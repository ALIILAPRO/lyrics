		<p>
		  You could have anyone you want
Why would you want to be with me?
I'm nothing special

You could have anyone you want
Why would you want to be with me?
You know I'm nothing special
Be with whoever you want
I don't care, I don't care
I don't wanna know
Don't tell me about your problems
If your not trying to solve them
Don't ask me for my help

Fix it yourself
She tried to call me yesterday
But I didn't pick up
'Cause I don't got time
I don't have time 
I don't have time
I don't have time
I don't have time (no)

Do whatever you want
I don't care, I don't care
Don't even tell me
I don't really wanna know
Don't ask me how my day's been
I just wanna be alone
Stop talking about your past
I don't wanna hear it
Just leave me alone
Just go

I don't care about myself
'Cause everyone is trying to hurt me (jealous)
Just leave me alone (jealous)
Just leave me alone
Just leave me alone
I just wanna be alone
