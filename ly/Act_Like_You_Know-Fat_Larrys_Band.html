		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, you oughta know
Act just like
Act just like you know (ooh)
Whoa whoa
You just ought to know (ooh), yeah

When you're feelin down and low
And you need a place to go, oh
Just pick up your shoes and go 
To the hottest place you know, oh

When you can free your mind
And have a good time
Just step right up (hurry, hurry, hurry)
To the fire line

Act like you know
This is your way to shine
Act like you know
There's only stars in the fire line (act like you know)
When the thoughts are real (act like you know)
Start kicking up your heels

Yeah, you oughta know
Well, well, well

The fashion here is dressed to kill 
So if you dare put on your dancin' wear
Yeah, hey
And you'll find yourself
Under a spot that'll make you hot to trot

So if you move in time
And you're feelin' fine
Just step right up (hurry, hurry, hurry)
To the fire line

Act like you know
This is your way to shine
Act like you know
There's only stars in the fire line
When the thoughts are real (act like you know)
Start kicking up your heels

Yeah, you oughta know
Well, well, well (woo)
Act just like you know (woo, woo, woo, woo)

Act like you know 
You'll be in the show
Act like you don't and you won't

So we set the stage for you to see that 
Dancin' makes you really wanna be, yeah, yeah
The ladies hit 
You can count on it
You'll be a star, always by far
Just remember this
To feel so fine
Just step right up (hurry, hurry, hurry)
To the fire line

Act like you know
This is your way to shine
Act like you know
There's only stars in the fire line (act like you know)
When the thoughts are real (act like you know)
Start kicking up your heels

Yeah (woo)
Well, well, well (woo)
You oughta know
Act just like you know, yeah
You oughta know
Well, well, well
Act just like you know, yeah, huh

Act like you know
This is your way to shine
Act like you know
There's only stars in the fire line (act like you know)
When the thoughts are real (act like you know)
Start kicking up your heels (act like you know)

Mmm, and you can be a star (act like you know)
Just let the world know who you are (act like you know)
When the thoughts are real (act like you know)
