		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I stay with you if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all (care at all)
If I'm loosing now but I'm winning late
That's all I want (all I want)

I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on

If I stay with you if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all (care at all)
If I'm loosing now but I'm winning late
That's all I want (all I want)

I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on

I don't have it all, I am gone
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
