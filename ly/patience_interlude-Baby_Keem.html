		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, food
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb

Don't grip on possessions, that's one of my lessons
It's never been that deep, I can't be desperate
I turn to Alexa, when I can't find Alexis
This feel like a rainy day in Texas
My niece holdin' a baba, and she deserve the blessings
A mess I made back home is manifested

I can't turn a blind eye, the feelings here are restless
Resentment weighing heavy, and I've been understeppin'
Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute

I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, food
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb
Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute
I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, food
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb

Don't grip on possessions, that's one of my lessons
It's never been that deep, I can't be desperate
I turn to Alexa, when I can't find Alexis
This feel like a rainy day in Texas
My niece holdin' a baba, and she deserve the blessings
A mess I made back home is manifested

I can't turn a blind eye, the feelings here are restless
Resentment weighing heavy, and I've been understeppin'
Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute

I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, food
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb
Can't let them take my patience, put the phone on mute
I know the lonely feeling when you've been consumed, food
Lie on my resources when I scope the room
They should've left these bloodsuckers inside the womb
