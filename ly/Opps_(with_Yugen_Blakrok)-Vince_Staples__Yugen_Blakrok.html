		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck y'all want from me?
Y'all don't want money
Y'all don't want from me
Y'all wanna die in the chase of things
We all gon' die and break the thing
Trapped inside a burning church
Made it out alive
God know my worth
Raw face, Scarface, your face
More defeat, I know it hurts
20 of 'em
20 on call
Got 20 in my hand
Got 20 on judge
Gave 20 to my dog
Got 20 on girls
That'll fuck you then (zoom zoom)
That'll fuck you then fuck you over
Take your safe, take your keys, take your Rover
Take the heart you thought you had
Speed off, rollin' up life in a taxi cab

Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
Takes all (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (you're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)

Hey hey
Ready, set, go crazy
Here to finesse, you see I'm getting mines
Life hit a nigga with a lemon's lime
Like what at night we still committing crimes, spitting rhymes
Bought a coupe with the spinning rims, get inside
Bring a friend, bleeding hands from the genocide
Clean me up, beam me up to the other side
Brothers die, 'cause coons turn to butterflies
They don't wanna see me sittin' in the Benz
They don't wanna see me livin' on the end
Of the city in a citywide bend
Show no pity in the city full of sin
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimming in the debt
Don't drown on ground wait until you hear
911, freeze (zoom zoom) dead

Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
Takes all (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (you're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)

I move like a millipede
When I flex them tendons like rubber trees
Young Millie Jackson back to the shit
Mouthpiece drawn, got a verbal armory
Stack bodies, not figurines
Move beneath the surface, submarine
I'm half machine, obscene with a light sword
Look inside the brain, it's a ride in the psych ward
What you standing on the side for?
Roar like a lioness, punch like a cyborg
Spit slick, attack is subliminal
Flowers on my mind, but the rhyme style sinister
Stand behind my own bars, like a seasoned criminal
Gotham city streets I'll blame the
Crushing any system, that belittles us
Antidote to every poison they administer
Switch it like time signatures
Colours in my aura tend cover the perimeter
Brown bodies that the blues wanna shoot through
Hi-rez lasers wanna (zoom, zoom, zoom)
Roll over your eyes
My strength ain't nothing like my size
Blades on the top, Kathleen Cleaver
Tangle my chords like a weaver

Opps on the radar (you're dead to me)
How you wanna play ball? (You're dead to me)
Takes all (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me, you're dead to me)
You know what zone I'm in (you're dead to me)
Don't care who you with (you're dead to me)
Watch me do my shit (you're dead to me)
(You're dead to me)
