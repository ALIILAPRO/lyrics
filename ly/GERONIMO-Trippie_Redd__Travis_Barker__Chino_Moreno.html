		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Latch onto me
Because time is running out
You are now aware
You are now awake

Tell me the things that you wanna do
Show me the places you wanna go
I'm more than the voice in your radio
Take a look at the sky, baby, Geronimo (ah, oh)

I'll kill for you (oh yeah, here I come)
I'll care for you (oh, baby, Geronimo)
I'll kill for you (here I come)
I'll care for you (baby, Geronimo)

Tell me the things that you wanna do
Show me the places you wanna go
Oh, I'll take you there (take you there)
You have my heart, baby, so play fair
You've been crazy lately, baby, I like it
You're one of a kind, yeah (oh)
You're too beautiful to even be mine, yeah
One of a kind (hey), baby, Geronimo

I'll kill for you (oh yeah, here I come)
I'll carry you (oh, baby, Geronimo)
I'll kill for you (here I come)
I'll carry you (baby, Geronimo)

I'll kill for you (here I come)
I'll carry you (baby, here I come)
I'll kill for you (here I come, here I come)
I'll carry you (here I come for you)

I'm alone on the sky
Basin, nothing gray
I want you out of mind, mind, mind

I'll kill for you (oh yeah, here I come)
I'll carry you (oh, baby, Geronimo)
I'll kill for you (here I come)
I'll carry you (baby Geronimo)

I'll kill for you (here I come)
I'll carry you (oh, baby, Geronimo)
I'll kill for you (here I come)
I'll carry you (baby, Geronimo)
