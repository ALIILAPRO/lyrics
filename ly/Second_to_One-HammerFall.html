		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Never be somebody's second, but always be second to one 
You can never escape from your heart, that inner guide, the voice in the dark
Stop and listen, just once in a while, to what it has to say
I remember the day when we met, your love was true, my life was a mess
I knew fate was a one way street but we were ment to be 
You're my honest cause
Never-ending strive to become better than I am 
You're the sweetest sound 
The note that explains the symphony 
I can not hide anymore, my head is up, my feet on the floor 
And you know I can not lie anymore, when I look into your eyes 
Fear of failure will all bring us down to darkened places where dreams go to die
I pretend to be strong, but I'm weak, you make my life complete
Everything must change
Yet remain the same, but nothing stays forever 
I will take your pain
You are my everlasting flame 
My Second to One
Oh I can not lie 
No, I can not hide when I look into your eyes
Everything I say 
Everything I do I do for you 
I will resurrect 
I have found myself, a knight in shining armour
When you call my name
I will be your needle for the pain 
My Second to One
