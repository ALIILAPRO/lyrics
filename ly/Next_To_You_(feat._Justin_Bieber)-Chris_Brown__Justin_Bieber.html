		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God everyday
That you keep that smile

Yeah, you are my dream
There's not a thing I won't do
I'll give my life up for you
'Cause you are my dream

And baby, everything that I have is yours
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely
Girl, 'cause you are
The only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
Nothing will ever come between us
'Cause I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you
If you had my child
You would make my life complete
Just to have your eyes on a little me
That'd be mine forever

And baby, everything that I have is yours (oh, everything)
You will never go cold or hungry
I'll be there when you're insecure
Let you know that you're always lovely
Girl, 'cause you are
The only thing that I got right now

One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you, oh
Nothing will ever come between us
I'll be standing right next to you
Right next to you

We're made for one another (one another)
Me and you (and you, and you, and you)
And I have no fear
I know we'll make it through

One day when the sky is falling
I'll be standing right next to you
Whoa-oh, oh oh, oh-oh

One day when the sky is falling (when the sky is falling, falling)
I'll be standing right next to you (right next to you)
Right next to you (right next to you, oh)
Nothing will ever come between us (nothing will ever)
I'll be standing right next to you (come between us)
Right next to you (right next to you)

Oh nah nah
Oh yeah
Stand by my side, side, side
When the sky falls down
I'll be there, I'll be there

You've got that smile
That only heaven can make
I pray to God everyday
To keep you forever
Ooh
