		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Haven't been to my favorite restaurant in months
I can't drive down Santa Monica without thinkin' 'bout ya
And what you're doin' now
I thought about movin' to a different state
A different country, yeah, maybe that'd be better
So I'm not around you

I wish we didn't have so many friends in common
I wish we didn't have to walk around our problems
I wish we didn't have to take all these precautions
So many birthdays that I missed, that I missed, that I missed

So I don't run right into you
So I don't run right into you
So I don't run right into you
Even though that's what I wanna do (What I wanna do)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Even though that's what I wanna do (What I wanna do)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

I don't wanna give you all this power
I'm so defenseless when it comes to you
And everybody knows when we're in the same vicinity, I dodge you

I wish we didn't have so many friends in common
I wish we didn't have to walk around our problems
I wish we didn't have to take all these precautions
So many birthdays that I missed, that I missed, that I missed

So I don't run right into you
So I don't run right into you
So I don't run right into you
Even though that's what I wanna do (What I wanna do)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Even though that's what I wanna do (What I wanna do)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh

And every time that a friend gets a text
Sayin' you're gonna be there, I just don't go
Yeah, every time that a friend gets a text
Sayin' you're gonna be there, I just don't go, oh

So I don't run right into you (Right into you)
So I don't run right into you
So I don't run right into you
Even though that's what I wanna do (What I wanna do)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh (What I wanna do)
Even though that's what I wanna do (What I wanna do)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Even though that's what I want
