		<p>
		  (Outtatown, we never outta money)

Ayy, ooh (Star Boy, you're my hero)
We ain't never running out of money, we ain't running out of loot
We ain't never running out of funds, we ain't running out of jewels
We ain't never running out of guns, got a hundred shots for you
Yeah, I feel like 2Pac, yeah, ayy, I just got the juice
I feel like 2Pac, uh, ayy, I just got the juice
I'm pouring lean on the rocks, baby, but I got Cîroc for you
Ayy, I'm pouring lean on the rocks, baby, but I got Cîroc for you

Ayy, I ain't never been drunk, yeah
So I'm pouring this lean up
And I'm rocking Celine, yeah
And I'm off of this bean, yeah
Ecstasy, call me teen, yeah
I stay rolling up green, yeah
And your bitch all on me, yeah
Turn her into a fiend
And if it's a problem, my boy shaking shit just like a tambourine
I came from the bottom, I jumped to the top ain't use no trampoline
He think he the shit but we know he ain't it, baby, don't gasoline him
I was riding by myself, I signed to Opium
Had to grow out my tree limbs
Now all of these hoes wanna fuck
All these hoes wanna suck, all these hoes in my DM's
Now these niggas stealing swag, yeah
They wanna be Ken but can't be him
I been getting on planes, I been switching lanes 
Just so these lil' niggas can see him
Did a pop-up today, perform the same day 
Just so these lil' niggas can greet him

Ayy, ooh
We ain't never running out of money, we ain't running out of loot
We ain't never running out of funds, we ain't running out of jewels
We ain't never running out of guns, got a hundred shots for you
Yeah, I feel like 2Pac, yeah, ayy, I just got the juice
I feel like 2Pac, uh, ayy, I just got the juice
I'm pouring lean on the rocks, baby, but I got Cîroc for you
Ayy, I'm pouring lean on the rocks, baby, but I got Cîroc for you

I feel like 2
Ayy, I feel like 2Pac
Ayy, I'm pouring up the juice
Ayy, I'm pouring lean on the rocks, yeah

Yeah, I just ran up them bands (Outtatown, we never outta money)
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands (Star Boy, you're my hero)
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I ran, I ran, I ran, I ran
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I ran that shit up as fast as I can
I stayed down and came up, I stuck to the plan
You know I don't give a fuck 'bout shit that you sayin'
You said I couldn't do it, I showed you I can

These niggas thought I couldn't do it
I been the one, I already knew it
I leave my opp stank, he smell like some sewage
I ain't do it myself, then my boy, he get to it
I'm sippin' drank, codeine be my fluid
I ran up that check like Nike, just do it
When it come to that money, you know I get to it
I just fucked on that bitch, you be buying her Louis
I swear these niggas be dumber than Doofy
I'm talking about that boy from the scary movie
I was in military school not juvy
They be judging a nigga, yeah, think that they knew me
He talking down, but his bitch'll do me
Thought she was the wind the way that she blew me
Shawty a ten and she got a big booty
And her coochie warm and wet like a jacuzzi
I ran up my bands, lil' bitch, I am not stupid

I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I ran, I ran, I ran, I ran
I just ran up them bands
I just ran up them bands
I ran that shit up as fast as I can
I stayed down and came up, I stuck to the plan
You know I don't give a fuck 'bout shit that you sayin'
You said I couldn't do it, I showed you I can
