		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On the day I was born
The nurses all gathered 'round
And they gazed in wide wonder
At the joy they had found
The head nurse spoke up
Said, "Leave this one alone"
She could tell right away
That I was bad to the bone

Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad 
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

I broke a thousand hearts
Before I met you
I'll break a thousand more, baby
Before I am through
I wanna be yours, pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya, honey
That I'm bad to the bone

Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad 
B-B-B-B-Bad 
B-B-B-B-Bad 
Bad to the bone

I'll make a rich woman beg
And I'll make a good woman steal
I'll make an old woman blush
And I'll make a young girl squeal
I wanna be yours, pretty baby
Yours and yours alone
I'm here to tell ya, honey
That I'm bad to the bone

B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad
Bad to the bone

Now when I walk the streets
Kings and queens step aside
Every woman I meet
They all stay satisfied
I wanna tell ya, pretty baby
What I see I make my own
And I'm here to tell ya, honey
That I'm bad to the bone

Bad to the bone
B-B-B-B-Bad
B-B-B-B-Bad 
B-B-B-B-Bad 
Woo, bad to the bone
