		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just genetic, it's written in your DNA
It's symptomatic, at least that's what the doctors say
It's in your nature, findin' darkness in the brightest day
But here we are

'Cause you were made from stars to live a life you'll never love

So if this is the last night and you're feelin' hollow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow
There isn't anywhere that I wouldn't follow
I'm chasin' your last light to wherever I go
Oh, our elements change into chemical traces
Reactions that they'll never know
If this is the last time that we'll ever borrow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow

You know I said it, I'd never let you fade away
It's energetic, the bond was never meant to break

You were made from scars to live a life you'd rise above

So if this is the last night and you're feelin' hollow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow
There isn't anywhere that I wouldn't follow
I'm chasin' your last light to wherever I go
Oh, our elements change into chemical traces
Reactions that they'll never know
If this is the last time that we'll ever borrow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow

If this the last time that we'll ever borrow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow

So if this is the last time
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow
There isn't anywhere
I'm chasin' your last light to wherever I go
Oh, our elements change into chemical traces
Reactions that they'll never know
If this is the last time that we'll ever borrow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow

If this is the last time that we'll ever borrow
I'll give you my half life so you'll see tomorrow
