		  Beat me up
Beat me down
Mess me up
Beyond all recognition

For what it's worth
I'd do it again
With no consequence
I will do it again

Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun bust a cap in your crown

Yo yo yo, word
My tendency's never returned
Received like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
'cause you know that's what I heard
Tell ya thoughts that's mostly pure
So everything's splended, sure
I just there to in-jure

On the fence
The consequence
What do they know
About that

On the track
Ahead in the back
What do they know
About that

I'm quite depressed
I'm quite a mess

Beat me up
Beat me down
Mess me up
Beyond all recognition

For what it's worth
I'd do it again
With no consequence
I will do it again

Hard up, so hunt me down, down, down
Jump the gun bust a cap hit the ground

Yo yo yo, word
My tendency's never returned
Received like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
'cause you know that's what I heard
Tell ya thoughts that's mostly pure
So everything's splended, sure
I just there to in-jure

On the fence
The consequence
What do they know
About that

On the track
Ahead of the pack
What do they know
About that

I'm quite depressed
I'm quite a mess

Hey, someone to stab in the back
Hey, someone to fall through the crack
Hey, someone to punch in the face
Hey, someone to fall through the crack

Written all over my face 
Written all over my face 

Yo yo yo, word
My tendency's never returned
Received like a big fat jerk
I been silly, but not absurd
'Cause you know that's what I heard
Tell ya thoughts that's mostly pure
So everything's splended, sure
I just there to in-jure

On the fence
The consequence
What do they know
About that

On the track
Ahead in the back
What do they know
About that

I'm quite depressed
I'm quite a mess
