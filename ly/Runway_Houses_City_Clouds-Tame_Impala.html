		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  But don't remind me of home
There's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
Oh no

And don't remind me of home
Or I might notice where I am
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
Oh no

I'm gazing out the window
As I ascend into the sky
But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change
Oh yeah, I do
Yeah, I do

But don't remind me of home
In case it isn't quite the same
