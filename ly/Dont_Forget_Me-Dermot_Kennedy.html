		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately I've been living in a dream
The past feels like a better place to be
The days we spent just sitting by the sea
Empyrean skies can't compete with those eyes
The colors of that dress you loved to wear
The way the sun got tangled in your hair

I remember everything
So why do I

I get this feeling like I'm fading from your memory
So I wrote this song and called it "Don't Forget Me"
Every time you hear it will you smile?
And tell the one you're with I was that guy
Ooh, even though you had to let me go
Don't forget me
Just don't forget me

Every time I think about it now
I guess we never really figured out
To hold each other through the ups and downs
The difficult nights, the times that we cried
I hope he knows it's special what he has
I hope he thinks it's magic when you laugh

'Cause I remember everything
So why do I

I get this feeling like I'm fading from your memory
So I wrote this song and called it "Don't Forget Me"
Every time you hear it will you smile?
And tell the one you're with I was that guy
Ooh, even though you had to let me go
Don't forget me
Just don't forget me

On that one night, it was so right
You were all mine
How could we let it go?
That one night was my whole life
And we stopped time
How could we let it go?
That one night, it was so right
You were all mine
How could we let it go?
That one night was my whole life
And we stopped time
But I

I get this feeling like I'm fading from your memory
So I wrote this song and called it "Don't Forget Me"
Every time you hear it will you smile?
And tell the one you're with I was that guy
Ooh, even though you had to let me go
Don't forget me
Just don't forget me
