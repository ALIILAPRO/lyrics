		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off
Dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair
Throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens

Blood all on the Rick's, Rick's, Rick's, Rick's, Rick's
I'm richer than a bitch, bitch, bitch, white bitch
Blue face everywhere
Pull up, they stare
Fendi, my underwear
She suck my dick she like "Damn"
I didn't need a money counter, counter
Money all on the kitchen counter, counter
I think I need a money counter, counter (counter, counter)
Money all on the kitchen counter
Call my doctor to handle my pain
Perky's taking my life away
I'ma bag your bitch, because I can
I'ma go take your wife away
Choppa on me, Afghanistan
That bitch kill many men
Over the bag, over the cash, yeah
I'm a money fan
Over the bag, on your ass, yeah
Hoppin' out the van
Switched up to the Lamb
How you niggas like me now, yeah
No limit, the gang
Try it, they gonna shoot you down, yeah
Loaded up, they gon' gun you down

They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off
Dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair
Throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens

They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Dripping on them everyday, snakes off
Put the chopper at your head, take it off
Fast lane, taking it off
Breaking your ankle, Chris Paul
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so on 'em now my legacy will never fade
I've been traumatized before but still I'm not afraid
I done seen friends turn foe, it don't amaze me
Came from the bottom of the creek that shit was ugly
Made it to the top of the mountain drankin' muddy
Everybody around you change and I felt so neglected
Hopping on the bird, with some birds, they respected (yeah, yeah)
24/7, everyday we get it in (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, started living out my dream, feet like I was born again

They say hard work pays off, I've been feeling paid off
Tryna take it then you dead, Nate Dogg
Put the chopper to your head, and take it off
Fast break, taking off
Dunk on the bitch, John Wall, woah
Keep niggas on they toes
I ain't never play fair
Throwin' elbows
This an AK, yeah, bullet to your skull
Damn, now it's blood all on my Rick Owens
