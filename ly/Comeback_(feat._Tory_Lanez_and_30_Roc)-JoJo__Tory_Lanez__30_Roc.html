		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Trust me
It's so much better when you trust me
So fuckin' good, boy, it's disgusting
Tell me it's mine or I'ma lose my fuckin' mind
I need that dick all the time

It's crazy how we didn't talk for years
But we don't need to say much to get caught up
My body knows you like you've been the only one
Baby, when we're makin' love

I'm selfish, gimme all that
Greedy bitch when I want that
Hit them splits like an acrobat
Talk my shit 'cause I'm so bad
With the lights off you can see me
Feel you right underneath me
You and me back with the repeat
Repeat

It's a comeback, missed your lovin' so bad
You make me come so fast
Oh yeah
And you know that I'ma keep this on track
Glad we made a comeback
Oh yeah, yeah

Look
I wanna put you in seven positions for seventy
Wait, we already did it, your wig was been splitted
Fuckin' you down on these countertops in kitchen
I'm lickin' your neck and I'm feelin' your spine twitch
You wake up and I hit from the side quick
This a trick when I lick from the back of you
Then my tongue will flip that shit like a spatula
I like it nasty and you like it nasty
Shut the fuck up and come throw that shit at me
I got my tongue in your throat when I'm strokin' it fastly
And JoJo, you know I don't play no games in this
I got that type of dick that make a white girl crazy
Fuck you lazy, have you sayin'

I'm selfish, gimme all that
Greedy bitch when I want that
Hit them splits like an acrobat
Talk my shit 'cause I'm so bad
With the lights off you can see me
Feel you right underneath me (underneath me)
You and me back with the repeat
Repeat

It's a comeback, missed your lovin' so bad
You make me come so fast
Oh yeah
And you know that I'ma keep this on track
Glad we made a comeback
Yeah, yeah

(Hit them splits like an acrobat)
(Talk my shit 'cause I'm so bad)
(You and me back with the comeback)
(Comeback, yeah)
