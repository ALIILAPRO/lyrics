		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back off, you know it ain't worth it
I'm the one running the circus
My words don't have any purpose
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
Prada on all of these purses
Nowadays I feel like I'm worthless
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
I'm the one running the circus
My words don't have any purpose
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
Prada on all of these purses
Nowadays I feel like I'm worthless
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
I'm the one running the circus
My words don't have any purpose
Stop now beforе you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
Prada on all of thesе purses
Nowadays I feel like I'm worthless
Stop now before you get nervous

I just ran up on that boy
And now he tryna ran away
I don't really give a fuck 'bout
What you think or say
Had to let some friends go
They were getting in the way
I wish I could I make you proud
You want me to go away
Think I ran all out of words
Don't even know what to say
I don't want you lookin at me
Could you please just turn away
I don't want the paparazzi shoving
Cameras in my face
You want to be the villain but
You're better in my place
You'd look better in my place
You'd be better in my bed
And i know i really want you
But ur better in my head
Lotta things I wanna say
But they're just better off unsaid
Lotta ways that this could go
But I don't know if you're my friend

Back off, you know it ain't worth it
I'm the one running the circus
My words don't have any purpose
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
Prada on all of these purses
Nowadays I feel like I'm worthless
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
I'm the one running the circus
My words don't have any purpose
Stop now before you get nervous
Back off, you know it ain't worth it
Prada on all of these purses
Nowadays I feel like I'm worthless
Stop now before you get nervous
