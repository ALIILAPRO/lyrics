		<p>
		  Blue Screen, good luck getting past me
Do your research, you'll know that I'm ghastly
You underestimate, your system I will decimate
No need to demonstrate, attention's what I captivate
Blue Screen, good luck getting past me
Do your research, you'll know that I'm ghastly
You underestimate, your system I will decimate
No need to demonstrate, attention's what I captivate
You haven't ever heard of the blue screen?
I cause so much problems, I make people scream
The tech team, they're no match, they amateurs
I'm the one thing that always seems to reoccur
I'm not a virus, I'm a malfunction
I cease all function, it's nothing
You're better off cussing and busting
Your PC into fragments and crushing
Check all the forums, ain't nothing to see
None of those niggas could ever beat me
Go ahead and wipe all your drives
Erase all your valuable files
Laugh as I watch all you cry
You're never regaining your life
Really, you're wasting your time
Your PC's now mine
Blue Screen, good luck getting past me
Do your research, you'll know that I'm ghastly
You underestimate, your system I will decimate
No need to demonstrate, attention's what I captivate
Blue Screen, good luck getting past me
Do your research, you'll know that I'm ghastly
You underestimate, your system I will decimate
No need to demonstrate, attention's what I captivate
Blue Screen, good luck getting past me
Do your research, you'll know that I'm ghastly
You underestimate, your system I will decimate
No need to demonstrate, attention's what I captivate
Blue Screen, good luck getting past me
Do your research, you'll know that I'm ghastly
You underestimate, your system I will decimate
No need to demonstrate, attention's what I captivate
