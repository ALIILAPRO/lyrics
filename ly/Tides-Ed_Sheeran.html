		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet

I still love getting out of my mind, I should it cut down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

Freight cargo, DOT stops, and aeroplanes
Late night calls, signal is in and out again
Feeling low, serotonin known better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes

I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasize I disappear without a trace
Have no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, princess and the face scar
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changing tides
