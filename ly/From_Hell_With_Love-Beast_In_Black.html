		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Here I am, where all this began
A night that would not die
Left me sleepless
Caught in the timeless
Tale of you and I
Memories painful
Turned into baleful
Blackness in my heart
Killed my light
To serve your delight
Now see me ripped apart, ripped apart

Another voiceless cry
Another hopeless try
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
From hell with love I write
Confess my passion crime
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind, you are Kryptonite
Oh babe

Lovelorn soldier
Seeking a closure
To his vague crusade
Silenced by the
Heartless and violent
Mother of all pain, all pain

Another voiceless cry
Another hopeless try
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
From hell with love I write
Confess my passion crime
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind, you are Kryptonite
Whoa

Another voiceless cry
Another hopeless try
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
From hell with love I write
Confess my passion crime
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind, you are Kryptonite

Whoa
Whoa
I wish you'd open your wings and take me inside
Whoa
Whoa
'Cause to my heart, soul and mind, you are Kryptonite
Oh babe
