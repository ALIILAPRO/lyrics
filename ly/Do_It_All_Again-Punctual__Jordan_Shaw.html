		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We'll do it all again when all the lights go down
'Til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round

Tell me everything
Tell me all your deepest secrets, be my remedy, yeah
If I lose my way
Will you bring me back to focus, be my clarity? Huh

Every night you been on my mind
But all I find is nothing by the morning
By the morning
All that's left is the emptiness
But no regrets
'Cause you know that I want it

We'll do it all again when all the lights go down
'Til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round
We'll do it all again when all the lights go down
'Til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round

Oh, you know we'll do it all again
And again
And again
When the light's go down we'll do it all again
And again
And again
Oh, you know

It feels so innocent
'Til we go back 'round in circles, right back here again, yeah
You're my adrenaline
It should hurt so good and we should both be sick of it, oh-oh

Every night you been on my mind
But all I find is nothing by the morning
By the morning
All that's left is the emptiness
But no regrets
'Cause you know that I want it

We'll do it all again when all the lights go down
'Til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round
We'll do it all again when all the lights go down
'Til we both pass out
Then we come back 'round

Oh, you know we'll do it all again
And again
And again
When the light's go down we'll do it all again
And again
And again

When the light's go down we'll do it all again
