		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh

The difference in between
All the faces you read
When the grass ain't green
When you fix everything

I don't know about you
But I got to get it out
And I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Ooh

Who cares about a game
When it's all been replaced
Each level feels the same
It really goes either way

I don't know about you
but I got to get it out
And I don't know how soon
But if we die
I want to bring the whole thing

Ooh

Just another world 
That I gotta get a grip of
And hold onto

Just another world 
That I gotta get a grip of
And hold onto (ooh)

Just another world 
That I gotta get a grip of
And hold onto

Just another world 
That I gotta get a grip of
And hold onto

Oh, oh, oh, oh
