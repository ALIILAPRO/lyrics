		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told you that I'd never leave you out there alone
Told you you could never make it out on your own
That's why I try to follow you anywhere you go
To make sure that you're okay and whenever you're not home
And I call you please answer me just want you to pick up your phone
Told you that I'd never leave you out there alone
Told you you could never make it out on your own
That's why I try to follow you anywhere you go
To make sure that you're okay and whenever you're not home
And I call you please answer me
Just want you to pick up your phone
Cleaning up your mess yeah you know that I'd do it for you
Driving me crazy but still I'll always be there for you
I know that, you know you really mean a lot to me
We got love but sometimes
I'm rude and you're mean to me
No I'm not leaving you what am I leaving you for?
Heard you like fashion them Gucci and Christian Dior
I work hard cause I wanna get you all and even more
And what's gon' be next is it a pony or a horse?
Moving forward never looking back
Looks great yeah we're keeping it like that
You're amazing you'll always be in my heart
I never ever wanna see you go
Not moving fast we're tryna keep it slow
What you saying
Tell me cause I don't even know
No do not leave me if you leave me I'm not gon' be okay
I always wanna talk to you but I really don't know what to say
Always wanna be with you and not just today
I wanna be with you all day everyday
Told you that I'd never leave you out there alone
Told you you could never make it out on your own
That's why I try to follow you anywhere you go
To make sure that you're okay and whenever you're not home
And I call you please answer me just want you to pick up your phone
Told you I'd never leave you out there alone
Told you you could never make it out on your own
Cheating is a behavior I cannot condone
Where is that guy I saw in your posts
I just looked under your bed I can see his clothes
Is he here I can smell his cologne
Now I can't trust you anymore
I'm gonna pop pills till it's dawn
And I swear you gonna hear this song
Look at the trauma you put me through
My heart transparent you should see our love
If you ever want love again bring more tissues
Everyday I go on my knees pray to Allah
To keep us sustained and guard us from the pain
Although sometimes we lose and we gain
I pray our love never fades
Told you ill never leave you out there alone
Told you you can never make it out on your own
That's why i try to follow you anywhere you go
And please would you just stay home when i call
Please pick up the phone
