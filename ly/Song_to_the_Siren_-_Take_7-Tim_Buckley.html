		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Long afloat on shipless oceans
I did all my best to smile
'til your singing eyes and fingers
Drew me loving to your isle

And you sang
Sail to me
Sail to me, let me enfold you
Here I am
Here I am
Waiting to hold you
Did I dream you dreamed about me?
Were you hare when I was fox?
Now my foolish boat is leaning
Broken lovelorn on your rocks
For you sing
'Touch me not
Touch me not, come back tomorrow
O my heart, o my heart, shies from the sorrow'

Well I am puzzled as the newborn child
I am troubled at the tide
Should I stand amid the breakers?
Should I lie with death my bride?
Hear me sing swim to me
Swim to me, let me enfold you
Here I am, here I am
Waiting to hold you
