		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  After you go, I can catch on my reading
After you go, I have lot more time sleeping
And when you go, it looks like thing's gonna be lot easier
Life would be at ease you know
I really should be glad.

chorus:
But I'm bluer than blue
Sadder than sad
You're the only life this empty room was ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue..

After you go, I have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I can stay out long if I feel like it
And when you go, I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

[chorus]

I don't have to miss no tv show
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
but the night will sure be colder.

And I'm bluer than blue
Sadder than sad
You're the only life this empty room was ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue...

Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue..
