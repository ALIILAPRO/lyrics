		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Told your mama I'd take care of you
Loaded up the car, drove into the dark
Billboard signs and skylines painted blue
We made it a home, but I felt alone

We were growing, growing apart
And I knew I had to break your heart
So off I went, haven't seen you since
I went from

Someone you held, you held when you were lonely
Someone you called, you called your one and only
I threw it all away
I went from someone you loved, to someone you hate

Summer nights, were feeling kinda strange
Sleeping back to back
I knew we'd never last

We were growing, growing apart
And I knew I had to break your heart
So off I went, haven't seen you since
I went from

Someone you held, you held when you were lonely
Someone you called, you called your one and only
I threw it all away
I went from someone you loved, to someone you hate
I know we talked, we talked about forever
I know you thought, thought we'd end up together
I threw it all away
I went from someone you loved, to someone you hate

Told your mama I'd take care of you
They say people change, well I guess it's true
I went from

Someone you held, you held when you were lonely
Someone you called, you called your one and only
I threw it all away
I went from someone you loved, to someone you hate
I know we talked, we talked about forever
I know you thought, thought we'd end up together
I threw it all away
I went from someone you loved, to someone you hate
