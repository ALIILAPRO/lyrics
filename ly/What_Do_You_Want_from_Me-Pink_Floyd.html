		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  As you look around this room tonight 
Settle in your seat and dim the lights 
Do you want my blood do you want my tears 
What do you want?
What do you want from me?
Should I sing until I can't sing any more 
Play these strings until my fingers are raw 
Ah ah ah 
You're so hard to please 
What do you want from me?

Do you think I know something you don't know (What do you want from me?)
If I don't promise you the answers would you go (What do you want from me?)
Should I stand out in the rain 
Do you want me to make a daisy chain for you 
Ah ah ah 
I'm not the one you need 
What do you want from me 

You can have anything you want 
You can drift, you can dream, even walk on water 
Anything you want

You can own everything you see 
Sell your soul for complete control 
Is that really what you need?

You can lose yourself this night 
See inside there is nothing to hide 
Turn and face the light 

Ah ah ah, ah ah ah 
What do you want from me
