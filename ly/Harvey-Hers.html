		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  VERSE 1
Some people think I'm acting worse for wear
Suffice to say this is a quaint affair
But no one really knows me like Harvey 
And once you've met him I'm sure you'll agree 

PRE CHORUS
Yeah I get it, you wanna know 
Who he is, where we go 
Yeah I get it, you wanna see 
What it is, him and me 

CHORUS
Harvey nobody knows what I see
Nobody knows I'm waiting 
Waiting for you to call 
Harvey nobody knows what I see
Everyone thinks I'm crazy 
Crazy for you oh boy 

VERSE 2
Barked at the moon amid an empty street 
We felt the remnants of the evening heat 
Said Harvey let me be the one to say
I wouldn't dream this any other way

PRE CHORUS
Yeah I get it 
You wanna know 
Who he is, where we go
Yeah I get it, you wanna see
What it is, him and me 

CHORUS
Harvey nobody knows what I see
Nobody knows I'm waiting 
Waiting for you to call
Harvey nobody knows what I see
Everyone thinks I'm crazy 
Crazy for you oh boy
