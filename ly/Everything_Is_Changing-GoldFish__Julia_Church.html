		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Thanks for trying to find my feet
Been searching all along
Just tell me nothing's 'gonna change
Change when I'm gone

You and I we're far too similar
To be living separate lives
When we're apart, there's a part of me that's not
The only thing that I know for sure

'Cause everything is changing
Nothings stays the same
I'm scared, my heart is racing
It's just a silly game
'Cause everything is

Yeah, oh no
She didn't know my name (Hey, hey, hey)
Mmm, oh no
She didn't know my name
Thank heaven for the good times (Hey, hey, hey)

I'm still trying to find my feet
Find where I belong
And now that everything has changed
I'm feeling strong (Hey, hey, hey)

There's times we're far too similar
To be millions miles apart
When I'm away there's a part of me that stays
And that's the only thing that I know for sure

'Cause everything is changing (Yeah)
Nothings stays the same
I'm scared, my heart is racing (Yeah)
It's just a silly game

'Cause everything is changing, oh (Yeah, oh no)
She didn't know my name (Hey, hey, hey)
Mmm, oh no
She didn't know my name
Thank heaven for the good times (Hey, hey, hey)

'Cause everything is changing (Yeah, oh no)
Nothings stays the same
I'm scared, my heart is racing (She didn't know my name)
It's just a silly game (Hey, hey, hey)
'Cause everything is changing

Thank heaven for the good times
(Hey, hey, hey) You're mine
