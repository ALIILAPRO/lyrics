		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Watch you go
Cross the street like a dream out my window
Sucking nicotine down my throat
Thinking of you giving head
You said
You wondered 'bout the world
Well, I have since I was a little girl
Watching white birds graze the hedge

Took me all this long to figure out
It's not worth it if I can't touch the ground
Can't believe I let it turn me 'round
Turn me onto you

I see horses running wild, I wish
I could feel like that for just a minute
Would you come with me, or would you resist?
Oh, could you just give in?
I see horses and I know there's a way
I hear thunder, oh, and I start to break
Would you come with me or would you resist?
Oh, could you just give in?

I believe in you
But the truth about dreams
Is they're a feeling that meets you in between
What you want and what you really need

Took me all this long to figure out
It's not worth it if I can't touch the ground
Can't believe I let you turn me 'round
Waiting up for you

I see horses running wild, I wish
I could feel like that for just a minute
Would you come with me, or would you resist?
Oh, could you just give in?
I see horses and I know there's a way
I hear thunder, oh, and I start to break
Would you come with me, or would you resist?
Oh, could you just give in?

I can't wait up for you today
Oh
I'm leavin', are you coming with me?
Can't hold me back, can't hold me back
I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going away

Oh, I see horses running wild, I wish
I could feel like that for just a minute
Would you come with me, or would you resist?
Oh, could you just give in?
I see horses and I know there's a way
I hear thunder, oh, and I start to break
Would you come with me, or would you resist?
Oh, could you just give in?
Oh, could you just give in?
Give in, give in, give in, give in, oh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
