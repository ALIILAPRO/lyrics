		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One touch can bring us closer 
Don't want this to be over 
You know that you complete me 
Your love is what I need 
Don't rush to say you're leaving (leaving)
Stay with me while I'm sleeping 
'Cause you know what you do to me 
I'm weak and you know my heart is beating 

One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we 
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry 
You don't have to hold back or be shy 
I can tell you want me in your eyes 
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we 
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry 
Feels so good 'cause I know that you're mine 
Boy, I got my eyes closed, 'cause you know that I-

Love it when you kiss me (I love it)
Love it when our lips meet 
You intoxicate me 
I barely can breathe 
I love when you kiss me (baby)
Love it when you kiss me 
Love it when our lips meet 
You intoxicate me (I can barely breathe)
I barely can breathe 
I love when you kiss me

Ooh girl, I'm coming over (coming over, babe) 
You know I wanna hold ya 
Kiss you (kiss you), 'cause I know you want me too 
I wanna give you what you'll like 
So, so, please, don't be afraid to (afraid to)
To tell me what'll make you 
Reach the top (reach the top) 
(Baby) girl, I mean it (I mean it)
'Cause baby, I can feel your heart beating 

One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we (so fast, so fast)
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry (yeah)
You don't have to hold back or be shy 
I can tell you want me in your eyes (you know that I want to, uh)
One, two, three, kiss, that's when I know that we (ooh, yeah)
Four, five, six, kiss, have the right chemistry 
Feels so good 'cause I know that you're mine 
Boy, I got my eyes closed, 'cause you know that I-

Love it when you kiss me (love it when you kiss me)
Love it when our lips meet (it's intoxicating)
You intoxicate me (I barely can breathe)
I barely can breathe 
I love when you kiss me
Love it when you kiss me (and I love it when we)
Love it when our lips meet (love it when our lips meet)
You intoxicate me (baby, I love when we)
I barely can breathe (love it when you kiss me)
I love when you kiss me

Ooh
Baby, oh
Love it when you kiss me
Ooh, oh
I barely can breathe
I love when you kiss me

Love it when you kiss me
Love it when our lips meet 
You intoxicate me 
I barely can breathe 
I love when you kiss me
Love it when you kiss me 
Love it when our lips meet 
You intoxicate me
I barely can breathe 
I love when you kiss me
