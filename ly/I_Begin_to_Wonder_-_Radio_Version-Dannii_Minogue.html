		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When I'm Walking Down The Street I Call Your Name
Inside My Head I Go Insane
Don't You Know That It's Really Making Me Crazy
There Were Days When I Went Completely Blind
No Time To Think & I Lost Time
Won't Believe What's Happened To Me Lately

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause Everyday Is The Same Thing
Different Faces With No Name
Places I've Never Been Before
And Everyday Is The Same Thing
Different Faces With No Name
Places I've Never Been Before

[Chorus]
And I Begin To Wonder
Don't You Know That It's Really Making Me Crazy
And I Begin To Wonder
Won't Believe What's Happened To Me Lately

[Pre-Chorus]

And Everytime I'm Breaking Free
These Thoughts Return To Trouble Me
Hanging On To Love Has Left Me Empty
You're A Sinner But You Told Me You're A Saint
Too Fast I Tripped & Lost My Way
Can't Believe What's Happened To Me Lately

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

Walking Down The Street I Call Your Name
All This Time You Led Me Astray
And Making Love To You, I Do The Same
But Now I Know You Blinded Me
And There Were Days When I Went Completely Blind
I Thought I Was Over You, Really Over You
No Time To Think, I Lost Time
No, I'm Not Over You

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

And I Begin To Wonder...
