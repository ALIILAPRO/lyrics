		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Put your sneakers on
Put your sneakers on
We're goin' dancin' all night long

I got somewhere to be
(where to be)
I want you to come with me
(come with me)
See I put my sneakers on
'Cause I'm gone keep dancin'
After they all go home

So are you ready?
Did you eat?
Do you have the energy?
Are you reloaded?
Are you able to stay on your feet?
Don't want you passin' out after
A couple o' hours of beat
We gone keep goin' and goin'
And goin' yeah 'cause

Basically what we're
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
It will come easily
When you hear the beat
Basically what we're
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
All you gotta do
Is take a chance
Yeah that's right
It's sneaker night

So now they're closin'
(Close it up,shut it down,go home now)
But this is far from the end
(Second round,ding,it's about to begin)
'Cause I got comfortable foot wear
The weather is nice
So let's take it outside
This needs some hand claps
And the beatbox
And it's alright

Basically what we're 
Gonna do is dance(3 times)
It will come easily
When you hear the beat
Basically what we're
Gonna do is dance(2 times)
Don't you even worry 
'Bout other plans
Yeah that's right
It's sneaker night

When the sun goes down
We wake up
A good night sleep(ha!)
No need
No problem stayin' awake
When the beat is like
An earthquake!!

And we're unstoppable
We're uncontrollable
Just admit it
You can't stop it
It's addictive 
Yeah,yeah,yeah

Basically what we're 
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
Yeah that's right
It's sneaker night
Basically what we're 
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
It will come easily
When you hear the beat
Basically what we're
Gonna do is dance
Gonna do is dance
Don't you even worry
'Bout other plans
Yeah that's right
It's sneaker night

(Ooh put your sneakers on,
Oh, let's go all night long)
