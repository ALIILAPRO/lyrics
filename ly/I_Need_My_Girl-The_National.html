		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden
You got out and said, "I'm sorry"
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a Forty-Five percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I'll try to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was a Forty-Five percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good and I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
But I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
