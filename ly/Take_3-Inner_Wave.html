		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't believe it's real
Hope to find another day
Pick me up and let me stay
Sometimes it's hard to feel
Try again give it a shot
I can't wait for us to find our way
In this dark and lonely space
Someone helped me out today
I hope I could do the same

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

What is that I hear?
Hope to feel the words you say
Lift me up push me away
What's that I hear in your voice
Lately, lately?
Wait for me to find my way
In this godforsaken place
Someone helped me out today
I hope I could do the same

I can't wait to find
Wait to find
You

I can't wait to find
Wait to find
You

Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up (wake up)
