		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't care to dance
You know this
I have told you I don't dance
But the music and your beauty
Well they move me 
So I take you by the hand
But you will have to lead

And so we start to move
The tonic that is mixed up with the gin
Warm within and working on my limbs 
And as the room begins to spin
I'm happy to be near you

And you laugh as I stare down at my feet
Holy mother of the humble and the weak
You gently lift my chin so I can look into your eyes
And you rebuke the bullshit and the lies
All those people who told me how to be a man
Well I don't want to follow them any longer
So twirl me round the floor

I begin to hope
The tealights left to gutter and to smoke
We're sweating and we're laughing
And the band is only playing songs we know
And I think you really know me

And suddenly it's gone
The worry that has weighed upon my heart
The fear I'm undeserving 
Of the dance that I've been yearning 
To take part in
The blessed invitation

And you laugh as I stare down at my feet
Holy mother of the humble and the weak
You gently lift my chin so I can look into your eyes
And you rebuke the bullshit and the lies
All those people who told me how to be a man
Well I don't want to follow them any longer
So twirl me round the floor
