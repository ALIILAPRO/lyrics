		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There were nights when the wind was so cold 
That my body froze in bed if I just listened to it 
Right outside the window 

There were days when the sun was so cruel 
That all the tears turned to dust 
And I just knew my eyes were drying up forever (forever)

I finished crying in the instant that you left 
And I can't remember where or when or how 
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made 

But when you touch me like this 
And you hold me like that 
I just have to admit 
That it's all coming back to me 
When I touch you like this 
And I hold you like that 
It's so hard to believe but it's all coming back to me 
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now

There were moments of gold and there were flashes of light 
There were things I'd never do again 
But then they'd always seemed right 
There were nights of endless pleasure 
It was more than any laws allow 
Baby, baby 

If I kiss you like this 
And if you whisper like that 
It was lost long ago but it's all coming back to me 
If you want me like this 
And if you need me like that 
It was dead long ago but it's all coming back to me 
It's so hard to resist and it's all coming back to me 
I can barely recall 
But it's all coming back to me now 

But you were history with the slamming of the door 
And I made myself so strong again somehow 
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then 

But if I touch you like this 
And if you kiss me like that 
It was so long ago but it's all coming back to me 
If you touch me like this 
And if I kiss you like that 
It was gone with the wind 
But it's all coming back to me 
It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now

There were moments of gold 
And there were flashes of light 
There were things we'd never do again 
But then they'd always seemed right 
There were nights of endless pleasure 
It was more than all your laws allow 
Baby, baby, baby 

When you touch me like this 
And when you hold me like that 
It was gone with the wind but it's all coming back to me 
When you see me like this 
And when I see you like that 
Then we see what we want to see all coming back to me 
The flesh and the fantasies all coming back to me 
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now 

If you forgive me all this 
If I forgive you all that 
We forgive and forget and it's all coming back to me 
Now (it's all coming back to me now) 
And when I touch you like that 
(It's all coming back to me now) 
And if you do it like this 
(It's all coming back to me now) 
And if we
