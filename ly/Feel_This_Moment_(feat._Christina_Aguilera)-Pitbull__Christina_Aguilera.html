		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ask for money and get advice
Ask for advice, get money twice
I'm from the dirty, but that chico nice
Y'all call it a moment, I call it life

One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Whoa
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa
I just wanna feel this moment

Mr. Worldwide (come on)
Christina Aguilera
Oye mamita (come on), dale, que la cosa esta rica
(I wanna feel this moment)

Woo
Come on, yeah
Feel this moment

Reportin' live from the tallest buildin' in Tokyo
Long ways from them hard ways, bills, Os and oh-yays
Dade County always, 305 all day
Now baby, we can parley, or baby, we can party
She read books, especially about red rooms and tie ups (yeah)
I got her hooked, 'cause she seen me in a suit with the red tie tied up
Meet and greet, nice to meet ya, but time is money
Only difference is I own it, now let's stop time and enjoy this moment

One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Whoa (come on)
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa (hey, yeah)
I just wanna feel this moment

Woo
Come on, yeah
Come on
Feel this moment

I see the future but live for the moment, makes sense, don't it? Huh
Now make dollars, I mean billions (yeah), I'm a genius, I mean brilliant (brilliant)
The streets is what schooled 'em and made 'em slicker than Slick Rick the Ruler (yeah)
I've lost a lot and learned a lot, but I'm still undefeated like Shula ('72)
I'm far from cheap, I break down companies with all my peeps (that's right)
Baby, we can travel the world and I can give you an all-you-can-see
Time is money, only difference is I own it
Like a stopwatch, let's stop time and enjoy this moment, dale

One day while my light is glowin'
I'll be in my castle golden
But until the gates are open
I just wanna feel this moment

Whoa (come on)
I just wanna feel this moment
Oh (hey, yeah)
I just wanna feel this moment

Woo
Come on, yeah
Come on
Feel this moment

Whoa
I just wanna feel this moment
Whoa
I just wanna feel this moment
