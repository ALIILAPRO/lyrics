		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I went out with this boy once, yeah?
And I met all his family
Went to some, like, family barbecue
And in the end, "Oh no, you're not my girl
You know, we're just, we're just like
Hanging out, aren't we?"

Oh, my love, it's been a long, long road to get here
But you never said what you wanna do (no)
Oh, my love, it's been a long road
But you never, never said if you're letting me go, for sure
If you won't let me go, then you gotta try hold me close

I could be with anyone
I'm fussy like a pussy cat
You're the only one I want
Give love and then you take it back
Won't the kisses all be fun?
I hate it when you give me half
Never give me half
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Want your love, want your

You wanna waste the day, I wanna spend the night
When our rhythm be run away, I wanna make it right
You're just pushing me, pushing me
Pulling me, pulling me
Killing me, killing me
Softly, softly

Oh, my love, it's been a long, long road to get here
But you never said if you're letting me go for sure
What you wanna do?

I could be with anyone
I'm fussy like a pussy cat
You're the only one I want
Give love and then you take it back
Won't the kisses all be fun?
I hate it when you give me half
Never give me half
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy

When the sun sets
Are you in with no doubt?
When the sun sets
I need know what you think about (uh)
Let me know, let me out
Ohh, tell me, baby

Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Why you playing, baby boy, what's up?
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Everybody knows that I want your love
Want your love, want your

Nah, but seriously, on a level, you're beautiful
We've not got a long time here, so
Love yourself, know your worth, an'
Fuck crying over these stupid boys 
That don't even recognize the worth in themselves
Just tryna steal your youth, bye, bye
But I love you, and um
I wish you could see in you what I see in you
What everyone sees in you, because
That's the golden stuff right there
And these are your golden years so, have fun
