		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now's your chance to be big (to be a big shot)
Now's your chance to be a big shot
Be a big, be a big, be a big shot
(Now's your chance to, now's your chance to)
(Now's your chance to be a big shot)
Now's your chance to be a big shot
Be a big, be a big, be a big shot
(Now's your chance to, now's your chance to)
(Now's your chance to be a big shot)
I think he's coming for me, answer the phone. I can't explain till you're all alone
It pulls the strings and make them ring, until your heart starts to break up
I think he's coming for me, answer the phone. I can't explain till you're all alone-
It pulls the strings and- pull the strings-
I'll tell you what you big shot
Now's your chance to be big (to be a big shot)
Now's your chance, now's your chance
Now's your, now's your, now's your, now's your
Now's your chance, I'll tell you what big-
Now's your chance to be a big shot
Be a big, be a big, be a big shot
Now's your chance to be a big shot
Be a big, be a big, be a big shot
