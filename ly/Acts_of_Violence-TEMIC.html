		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hang my head in silence and  
await the final judgment for a  
lifetime of emotion masquerading 
as the truth  

From this act of violence, may there 
be a final moment, where the 
light bleeds into darkness, and  
illuminates the truth 

Ooh 
We both knew 
We could lose 
Me and you  

Raise a glass in silence, and  
applaud the final sentence, that a 
lifetime of devotion was no longer 
meant for you 

From your acts of violence, may there 
be a final moment, when the 
stars fade into darkness, and, at last, 
extinguish you 

Ooh 
We both knew 
We could lose 
Me and you  
Ooh 
Hang the noose 
Time to choose 
Me or you 

Why lie?

Break into the silence, drown all  
hope for a tomorrow 
Let the sun fade into shadow 
In the long pursuit of truth 

Let there be defiance 
In the war against what follows 
Let the past fade into darkness 
I will be what I pursue 

Ooh 
We both knew 
We could lose 
Me and you  
Ooh 
Hang the noose 
Time to choose 
Me or you 

Ooh 
We both knew 
We could lose 
Me and you  

Ooh 
Hang the noose 
Time to lose 
Me and...
