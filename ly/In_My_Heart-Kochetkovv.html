		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You were my sunshine on all my rainy days
The one to hold my hand and tell me "everything's okay"
So now I don't know what to do since you went away
But I know that you're gone and that there's nothing I can say

I hope you're happier living without me
I hope you're moving on to all that you can be
And I'm so sorry I wasted your time
But you're still in my heart and you're always on my mind
Yeah, you're still in my heart and you're always on my mind
