		<p>
		  Novocaine (wont hear your lies)
I can't think (no rest on mind)
Don't wanna feel my face (I might go blind)
Don't wanna make mistakes (but it feels so right)
Novocaine (wont hear your lies)
I can't think (no rest on mind)
Don't wanna feel my face (I might go blind)
Don't wanna make mistakes (but it feels so right)
They don't- they don't know bro
Hit me when I'm sober
Whipping that Toyota
Didn't know she novia
I don't wanna hold ya
I'm not coming over
I don't wanna do shit
I just wanna go up
Got some jack up in my cola, I'll call you when I'm sober
JZ in my motor, but I'm not talkin Hova
Shawty what's the hold up? I miss when we was closer
I was young and dumb, but lil' baby now I'm older
But girl, yo ex he needa watch just what he say to me
I got friends that keep a chop like gta for me
If she worth it then you know I'll treat her faithfully
And that pussy fit me tight like she was made for me, made for me
You think you gon break it off, I could make you turn right back
If we gon do more than talk, girl I wanna make it last
You think you gon break it off, I could make you turn right back
If we gon do more than talk, girl I wanna make it last
Novocaine (wont hear your lies)
I can't think (no rest on mind)
Don't wanna feel my face (I might go blind)
Don't wanna make mistakes (but it feels so right)
Novocaine (wont hear your lies)
I can't think (no rest on mind)
Don't wanna feel my face (I might go blind)
Don't wanna make mistakes (but it feels so right)
They don't- they don't know bro
Hit me when I'm sober
Whipping that Toyota
Didn't know she novia
I don't wanna hold ya
I'm not coming over
I don't wanna do shit
I just wanna go up
Oou
Oou (yeah)
Oou
Oou
