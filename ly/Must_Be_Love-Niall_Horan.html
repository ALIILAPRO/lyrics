		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a specialist at overthinkin' everything
I'll tell you all about it if you have the time
I've become a mastermind at goin' and vanishing
Until I feel as empty as this bottle of wine

Oh, if I'm being honest, I find it so hard
To just keep it simple and follow my heart

But if it feels like lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If it feels like lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If it feels like love
Then it must be love

I got a first degree in being my worst enemy
I got a PhD in always runnin' away

And if I'm being honest, it scares me to death
I'm trying to stop it, I'm trying my best

But if it feels like lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If it feels like lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If it feels like love
Then it must be love
Yeah, it must be love
Yeah, it must be love

Oh, if I'm being honest, I find it so hard
To just keep it simple and follow my heart

But if it feels like lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If it feels like lo-lo-lo-lo-love
If it feels like love
Then it must be love

It must be love (if it feels like love)
It must be love (if it feels like love)
It must be love (if it feels like love)
Then it must be love
