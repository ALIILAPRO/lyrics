		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you

So, please, don't break my heart
Don't tear me apart
I know how it starts
Trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again
I am delicate
Please, don't break my heart
Trust me, I've been broken before

I've been broken, yeah
I know how it feels
To be open
And then find out your love isn't real
I'm still hurtin', yeah
I'm hurtin' inside
I'm so scared to fall in love
But if it's you then I'll try

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you

So, please, don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't tear me apart
I know how it starts
Trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again
I am delicate
Please, don't break my heart
Trust me, I've been broken before

I know I'm not the best at choosin' lovers, mm (lovers, lovers, lovers)
We both know my past speaks for itself
(For itself)
If you don't think that we're right for each other (baby, no)
Then, please, don't let history repeat itself

'Cause I want you (yeah, I want you, yeah)
I want you (yeah, I want you, yeah)
There's nothing else I want
'Cause I want you (yeah, I want you, yeah)
I want you (yeah, I want you, yeah)
And you're the only thing I want

It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you
It's you, it's always you
Met a lot of people, but nobody feels like you

So, please, don't break my heart (don't break my heart)
Don't tear me apart
I know how it starts
Trust me, I've been broken before
Don't break me again
I am delicate
Please, don't break my heart
Trust me, I've been broken before

'Cause I want you, baby I want you
Baby, I want you, baby I want you
Baby, I want you, baby I want you
Baby, I want you, you, you

'Cause I want you, baby I want you
Baby, I want you, baby I want you
Baby, I want you, baby I want you
Baby, I want you, you, you
