		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stand up 
If you're the man with the plan 
Turn the lights out
Guide us straight to the end
Of this tunnel
Brothers 
Help us stand cause we're tired
Take me home to the place
We set fires

I turn my back against the sea 
And let the waves roll over me
Your bodies washed onto the beach
Your beating heart just out of reach
And thunderclouds above our heads
As we were sleeping in our beds
Spoke your name into my phone
Hiss and static all alone
Now buried deep in the darkest waves
Is where my body needs to stay 
It's where my body needs to stay
Buried deep in the darkest waves
I thought I saw your face before
Another life another door
That led us to a better end
At least I can pretend

Stand up 
If you're the man with the plan 
Turn the lights out
Guide us straight to the end
Of this tunnel
Brothers 
Help us stand cause we're tired
Take me home to the place
We set fires
