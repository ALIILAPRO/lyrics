		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know (I know)
You wanna go (nigga)(you wanna go)
I know-ow (I know-ow)
You wanna go (you wanna go)
Come on (come on), we taking off (we taking off)
And I know you don't wanna miss this plane (know you don't wanna miss this plane)

Started with a hundred bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, sold out, sold out
My mama say "stay patient" (mama)
Hunnid bands I ain't waiting
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
Girl you got me fucked up
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
God damn you got me fucked up

Fill my cup up then you got me fucked up
Every ugly bitch in here, they looking bad as fuck
She popped a molly ooh! Look at 'er tongue
The bitch that came with me said they want some
Just look at that, Forest, look at that, Forest, run!
Got pink in my cup, it's not lookin' like just a Bubble Gum
I'm asking the bitch "what's her name?" she telling me Cinnamon
I want to put all my glaze on you like a Cinnabon (Cinnabon)

Started with 100 bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, sold out, sold out
My mama say "stay patient" (mama)
Hunnid bands I ain't waiting
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
Girl you got me fucked up
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
God damn you got me fucked up

Lil' mama be looking so gorgeous
She ask me can I afford it
I told her bitch she got me fucked up
My Migos chain can pay her mortgage
24K on my toilet
Pockets enormous calling me Norbit
Take it from Migos I'm making Tostitos, illegal, I might get deported
You niggas be trippin, you fucked up
If you thinkin' you gon catch me slipping
Livin' like witness, crips comin' through your chimney
I got the Bobby, the Britney, the Iggy
Sorry I ran out of Whitney
Yeah nigga, I'm making history
Before I die, you gon' remember me

I know (I know)
You wanna go (you wanna go)
I know-ow (I know-ow)
You wanna go (you wanna go)
So come on (come on), we taking off (we taking off)
And I know you don't wanna miss this plane (know you don't wanna miss this plane)

(Go, go) Started with a hubdred bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, sold out, sold out
My mama say "stay patient" (mama)
Hunnid bands I ain't waiting
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
Girl you got me fucked up
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
God damn you got me fucked up

She grindin' her teeth like she hungry
Poppin' the molly, she horny
She talkin' too much, she annoying
She giving up blowjobs, no employment
My diamonds and then she sneaking and geeking
She said she got a nigga tonight, tonight she cheatin'
It's been a whole weekend, so when are you leaving?
Just suck on the dick baby girl, don't be teasing it
My niggas gon' send somebody, come and treat it
Migos and a bit of sold out arenas
Come get yo bitch 'out the session my nigga
She smokin' up all of the reefer
Leave my 2 liter, don't do margaritas
This shit that we're smokin' is louder than speakers

Started with a hundred bricks (bricks, bricks, bricks)
Now I sold out, sold out, sold out
My mama say "stay patient" (mama)
Hunnid bands I ain't waiting
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
Girl you got me fucked up
I'm figgity figgity fucked up
God damn you got me fucked up (damn, damn, damn)
