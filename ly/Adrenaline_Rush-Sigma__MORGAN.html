		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lately, I been feelin' differently
I don't know what to do, uh
Told myself I needed therapy
But I just needed you

You make my blood rise
It's a new addiction and I just can't stop
I just can't stop

You're my adrenaline rush
Oh, I can't live without the way you're liftin' me up
Said I'll quit this feelin'
But I want it too much, that getaway love
I crave it all night like a bittersweet drug
And I don't wanna give up

You're my adrenaline rush
You're my adrenaline rush
Ooh

I been fightin' every wrong desire
Tryna make it back
Every taste of you that takes me higher
Throws me off the track

You make my blood rise
It's a new addiction and I just can't stop
I just can't stop

You're my adrenaline rush
Oh, I can't live without the way you're liftin' me up
Said I'll quit this feelin'
But I want it too much, that getaway love
I crave it all night like a bittersweet drug
And I don't wanna give up
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't

You're my adrenaline rush

Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna give it up
Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna give it up tonight
Oh my, I ain't gonna give it up
Yeah
Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna give it up
Ain't gonna lie, I ain't gonna give it up tonight
Oh my, I ain't gonna give it up

You're my adrenaline rush
Oh, I can't live without the way you're liftin' me up
Said I'll quit this feelin'
But I want it too much, that getaway love
I crave it all night like a bittersweet drug
And I don't wanna give up
No, I don't, no, I don't, no, I don't

You're my adrenaline rush
