		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caught me off guard, I wish that I'd been sober
Still, here we are, back in Hanover 99
Just like old times all over
Under the exit lights as beautiful as ever
I really wish that I dressed up a little better
No regrets is what we said
We can't go back again

Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever

Head in my hands, cold coffee on the table
Wish you the best, I would if I was able
Morning light, it stings a little
Out of my mind, I don't remember calling
Had too much tonic wine, sometimes it does the talking
Hope you know I wish you all the love you're looking for

Darling, nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever
Forever
Forever
Forever

Nobody said that it would last forever
That doesn't mean we didn't try to get there
I never said that we would die together
That doesn't mean it was a lie
They'll never take those long summer days
When love was untamed
Two burning hearts are dared to break, remember
Nobody said that it would last forever
