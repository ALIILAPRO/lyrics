		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Winding you way down to baker street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day
You'll drink the night away 
And forget about everything

This city's dance makes you feel so cold
Its got so many people but its got no soul
And its taken you so long
To find out you were wrong
When you thought it had everything

You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're trying, you're trying now

Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're crying you're crying now

Way down the street there's a light in his place
Opens the door
He's got that look on his face
And he asks you were you've been
You tell him who you've seen 
And you talk about everything

He's got this dream about buying some land
He's gonna give up the crack and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down 
In some quiet little town 
And forget about everything

But you know he'll always keep moving
You know he's never gonna stop moving
'Cause he's rolling, he's the rolling stone

When you wake up its a new morning
The sun is shining its a new morning
You're going, your going' home
