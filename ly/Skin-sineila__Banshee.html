		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spent two days following myself
I’m trying to get it all from over here
I’m trying to get it all from over here
Won’t walk into the room but I’ll be near
A thousand steps closer
Feels like I’m farther than I’ve ever been
Do you think anyone remembers when
I locked the door and wouldn’t let them in?
I’m looking within
Find every person I’ve been
Never in place to begin with
Yeah I sinned
Guess it was under my skin
I caught my reflection grinning
And again
Time is slipping from my hands
All of the things I’m forgetting
Yeah, I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I’m looking within
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I’m looking within
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
You tried to get under my skin
Now I don’t let anyone in
I didn’t recognize myself until I killed you in my head
Please try to understand
This was my choice
Never my plan
I tried to rip off all my skin
I wanna rip off all your skin
I’m looking within
Find every person I’ve been
Never in place to begin with
Yeah I sinned
Guess it was under my skin
I caught my reflection grinning
And again
Time is slipping from my hands
All of the things I’m forgetting
Yeah, I guess it was under my skin, under my skin
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I’m looking within
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I’m looking within
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I guess it was under my skin
Guess it was under my skin
I’m looking within
I knew you were under my skin
I knew you were under my skin
