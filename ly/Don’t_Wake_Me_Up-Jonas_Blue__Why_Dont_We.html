		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun kissed, my face
Wishing for the real thing
Lonely, and out of place
When I don't have you with me

Does your heart say the same
On all these nights alone? Yeah
Or is it just me
Hoping you'll come home

'Cause I don't know if I can make you happy
No matter what the odds, I'm gonna try
A million miles away, I feel you with me
For now our love will live inside my mind
So

Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you
I feel your love every time I close my eyes
'Cause I finally found you
When the times are hardest
I'll find you in the darkness
You're a dream and that is enough (that is enough), yeah
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you (found you)

Summer days so far away
Only see 'em in the rearview, yeah (rearview, yeah)
How will I hold you again
To make you feel at home?

'Cause I don't know if I can make you happy
No matter what the odds, I'm gonna try
A million miles away, I feel you with me (I feel you with me)
For now our love will live inside my mind
So

Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you (found you, yeah)
I feel your love every time I close my eyes
'Cause I finally found you
When the times are hardest
I'll find you in the darkness
You're a dream and that is enough (that is enough), yeah
Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you (yeah, I finally found you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Finally found you (yeah, I finally found you)

Don't wake me up in the middle of the night
'Cause I finally found you
