		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ghosts circle my room
Specter that blooms from you, unsleeping
Your voice, echo the noise
Sing me a siren song, mislead me

This is how you haunt me

This is how you haunt me 
You talk but just to taunt me
You want but you don't want me
You're gone
This is how I haunt you
You want me just to want you
You think that I don't see through
You're wrong (you're wrong)

(You're wrong)

Go, I'm not alone
Turned off my phone, how are you sleeping?
Your spies, flies on my wall
Hard to ignore, they loom above me

This is how you haunt me
You talk but just to taunt me
You want but you don't want me
You're gone
This is how I haunt you
You want me just to want you
You think that I don't see through
You're wrong

This is how you haunt me
You talk but just to taunt me
You want but you don't want me
You're gone
This is how I haunt you
You want me just to want you
You think that I don't see through
You're wrong

This is how you haunt me

This is how you haunt me
(You're wrong)
