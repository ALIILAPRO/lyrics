		  J. Lo
Philly gettin closer
Stuntin' like I'm supposed to
Stop me ?

Philly gettin closer
Stuntin' like I'm supposed to
Stop me ?

When you make it your're the chosen (you're the chosen)
Sayin time you're in trouble (you in trouble)
Mama told me stay up by that corner (at that corner)
Thank God that we made that out that corner (out that corner)
Goin' crazy ? Suicidal (race boys)
Iris watchin' your money on a fork (on a fork)
Shorty you ?
Haters wanna see in me in a bodybath

My head's killing me
I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired, of it all
Early in the morning
And there's something already
With my name always involved

I'm tryin' to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them has-been
Yeah they mind on stuck
And it's OK if they don't show me luck , no

They want me to lock down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I've never fallen off

Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah

Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah

'Cause in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)

Show me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired
Of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
'Cause I'm on the same ground
No, I never changed, I loving every day
I know that I'm the same Jenny from around the way

They want me to lock down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I've never fallen off

Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah

Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah

'Cause in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)

I'ma keep on growin'
Keep on shinin'
Just wanna do me
I had a thing that 'cause he chose me
I'm still the same girl

When I was there broke, there was nobody (nobody)
Back to the walls, there's nobody
Still the same old nigga
Thirty new cars, thirty chains on nigga
Bein' real (bein' real)
Count money (count money)
Get high (get high) oh la la
Bein' real (been real)
Count money (count money)
Gettin' high (gettin' high) oh la la

Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah

Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody (I don't owe nobody)
Get off of me yeah
Get off of me yeah
