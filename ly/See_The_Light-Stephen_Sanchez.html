		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She was gone before the morning came
Down the fire escape
She went wild, wild
In my heart a burning flame
I thought it couldn't change
Her mind and mine

Love was such a scary thing
You didn't wanna fall
I didn't want you at all
Now I'm waiting by a cold window
'Til the sun has gone

Oh, my my
Oh, my my my
Now, don't think twice
Hold me up until you see the darkness
That I couldn't fight lying by your side
Hold me up until you see the light
Ooh, ooh, ohh

On words we fumbled in the strangest way
But, still we're losing space
We're tongue tied, tongue tied
And both our shadows spun all round the room
Then into one from two
We collide, collide

Love was such a scary thing
You didn't wanna fall
I didn't want you at all
Now I'm waiting by a cold window
'Til the sun has gone

Oh, my my
Oh, my my my
Now, don't think twice
Hold me up until you see the darkness
That I couldn't fight lying by your side
Hold me up until you see the light
Ooh, ooh, ohh

Oh, my my, oh my my my
Oh, my my my

Oh, my my
Oh, my my my
Now, don't think twice
Hold me up until you see the darkness
That I couldn't fight lying by your side
Hold me up until you see the light
Ooh, ooh, ohh

Oh, my my, oh my my my
Oh, my my my, hey
