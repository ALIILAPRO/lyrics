		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If all the children of the world would hold each other's hands
They'll be giving off such a strength
That all the walls of hate, war, and racism will fall down
Children know, understand, and believe
That there'll be more and more
Love and peace, for eternity, love and peace, for everybody

Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Children of the world, scream your dreams
Children of the world never fear
Children of the world, scream your dreams
Children of the world, get together, get together, get together

Scream your dream
Hear the crying (hear)

Scream your dream
Hear the crying (hear)

Children, children
Children
Children, children
Children

Children, children
Children, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Love and peace, for eternity, love and peace, for a future time
Love and peace, for you and I, love and peace, for everybody
Love and peace, for eternity, love and peace, for a future time
Love and peace, for everybody
For everybody

Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace

Children of the world, scream your dreams
Children of the world never fear
Children of the world, scream your dreams
Children of the world, get together, get together, get together

Love, love, love and peace, for everybody
Love, love, love and peace, love and peace
Love, love, love and peace, for everybody
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace
Love and peace, love-love and peace

Love and peace, for everybody
