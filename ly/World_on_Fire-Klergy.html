		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In a world on fire smoke is high, sun is low
Where did it go? Nobody knows, oh
In a world on fire
In a world on fire nothing ever as it seems
Even your dreams, they in gasoline, oh
In a world on fire

If you close your eyes and you pick a side
Will you follow blindly into the darkness?
If you close your eyes and you pick a side
Will you find yourself broken and heartless?
In a world on fire, in a world on fire

In a world on fire, in a world on fire
If you close your eyes and you pick a side
Will you follow blindly into the darkness?
If you close your eyes and you pick a side
Will you find yourself broken and heartless?

In a world on fire, in a world on fire
