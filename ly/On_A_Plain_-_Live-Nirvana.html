		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll start this off 
Without any words
I got so high 
I scratched 'till I bled

I love myself 
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

The finest day 
That I've ever had
Was when I learned 
To cry on command

I love myself 
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

My mother died 
Every night
It's safe to say
Quote me on that

I love myself 
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

The black sheep got 
Blackmailed again
Forgot to put 
On the zip code

I love myself 
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain

Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?

It is now time 
To make it unclear
To write off lines 
That don't make sense

I love myself 
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

And one more special 
Message to go
And then I'm done
And I can go home

I love myself
Better than you
I know it's wrong
So what should I do?

I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
