		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, did you miss me?
Walk on water just to kiss me
Oh, come and get me
Drag me out, destroy me
I've been expecting you, I'm ready
Deliver me that bad news baby

Am I your dream girl?
You think of me in bed
But you could never hold me
And like me better in your head
Make me evil, then I'm an angel instead
At least you'll sanctify me when I'm dead

Dream girl evil, dream girl evil
Dream girl evil, dream girl evil

Did I disappoint you?
Did mommy make you sad?
Do I at least remind you
Of every girl that made you mad?
Make me perfect, make me your fantasy
You know I deserve it
Well, take it out on me

Am I your dream girl?
You think of me in bed
But you could never hold me
You like me better in your head
Make me evil, then I'm an angel instead
At least you'll sanctify me when I'm dead

Dream girl evil, dream girl evil
Dream girl evil, dream girl evil

Watch me shimmer (shimmer)
A projection of your mother (mother)
But don't come crying (crying)
I am nobody's mother, center

It cannot hold, it cannot hold
It cannot hold, it cannot hold
It cannot hold, it cannot hold
It cannot hold, it cannot hold
It cannot hold (dream girl)
It cannot hold (evil)
It cannot hold (dream girl)
It cannot hold (evil)
It cannot hold (dream girl)
It cannot hold (evil)
It cannot hold (dream girl)
It cannot hold (evil)
