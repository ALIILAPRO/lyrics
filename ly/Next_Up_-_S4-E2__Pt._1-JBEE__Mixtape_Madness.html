		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Peace and lovely
All alone
Heart made of glass
My mind of stone
Tear me to pieces
Skin or bone
Hello, welcome
(Ooh, yeah)

(G.I, yo, yo)

They try claim that they had my back, them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski back, whatever the situation give me time and place (ahh)
I been working on trust and again, they don't know about the time it takes (take)
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like Drake

I can't live a normal life no more, this shit got me wishing I hid my face (ooh yeah)
I ain't been getting no sleep on a regular, think it's because of the money I chase (hey)
Gotta make sure that everyone eats, need to put food on my family plates
When bro shoulda been in school, he was putting numbers in the shit (yo, yo)

I put all of my heart into passion, I said I would blow, they were telling me, "No"
I'm guessing they must have been cappin', babe been upset that I ain't been present
'Cause I been focusing on the rapping but I need to leave the hood soon
'Cause the block too hot like tuna, gotta get bread, no room to be slapping

Yo, so many sleepless nights, grind don't stop 'til the whole gang eating right
You weren't there when I had no cake, but you're thinking of getting a slice? (uhh)
Ever since I been handled with fame, I been ducking from evil eye
And them girls that were moving tight, told them that there's been a change in price

They try claim that they had my back, them boys couldn't name me a time and date
I got broski back, whatever the situation gimme time and place
I been working on trust and again, they don't know about the time it takes (takes)
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like Drake

They try claim that they had my back, them boys couldn't name me a time and 
I got broski back, whatever the situation gimme time and
I been working on trust and again, they don't know about the time it takes (takes)
And I've always been DTB, I've never been CLB like
