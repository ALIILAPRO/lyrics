		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stay Awake,
Expectations always seem to complicate
6 feet under if we medicate
If I hold too tightly then you'll slip away
cause I know,
I'm a slight Disappointment 
and I never warned you
Time feels important
But I'm off the rails
I think I

Lost my way
Jumped across your borders tried to 
Infiltrate
Lie to Be alone 
I been 
MIA
Ask me how I'm feeling and I hesitate 
It's Easier to Lie 

Stay away
Expectations always seem to complicate
6 feet under if we medicate
If I hold too tightly then you'll slip away
cause I know,
I'm a slight Disappointment 
and I never warned you
Time feels important
But I'm off the rails
I think I

Lost my way
Jumped across your borders tried to 
Infiltrate
Lie to Be alone 
I been 
MIA
Ask me how I'm feeling and I hesitate, 
It's Easier to Lie
