		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The feeling's deep inside 
As waters break the tide 
And fade into view 
A promise that I have to forget 
I'm falling away 
Falling away 

A sun that burns the scars 
Leaves no one left unharmed 
Its light shrines the truth 
Is time the only way to be healed? 
I'm falling away 
Falling away 
  
Into a black hole made of stars 
And all I see while fading is 
galaxies collapse into demise 
I will give into the eternal night 
Cause nothing lasts forever, son, 
Not even the sun that blinds your eyes 

There's nothingness in sight 
As time reclaims all life 
And death will exude 
Is that the truth the light would reveal? 
I'm falling away 
Falling away 

The sun that burned the scars 
Implodes into its heart  
And waves to the moon 
Is death the only way to be freed? 
I'm falling away 
Falling away
 
Everything falls 
Time will always make the call 
and pull us under 
Everything falls 
Gravity will take its toll 
and pull us to our grave 

Into a black hole 

Into a black hole made of stars 
And all I see while fading is 
galaxies collapse into demise 
I will give into the eternal night 
Cause nothing lasts forever, son, 
Have you ever really wondered why?
