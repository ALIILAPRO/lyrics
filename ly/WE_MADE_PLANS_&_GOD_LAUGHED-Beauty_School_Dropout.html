		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We made plans and god laughed
So please have mercy on me
We keep falling too fast
Still think you're all that I need

911
What is your emergency
I'm losing blood
As the angels start to sing

Dead on arrival
Always a little too late
Dead on arrival
The grass is on the grave
You can bury my heart six feet deep
But that ain't gonna help you sleep
So let me drown in denial
Dead on arrival

Resuscitate me just to let me go again
This back and forth hurts like hell
Still think we're heaven sent

911
Hurry it's an emergency
I'm losing blood
As the angel start to sing

Dead on arrival
Always a little too late
Dead on arrival
The grass is on the grave
You can bury my heart six feet deep
But that's ain't gonna help you sleep
So let me drown in denial
Dead on arrival
