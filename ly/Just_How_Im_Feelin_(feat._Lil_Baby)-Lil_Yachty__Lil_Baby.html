		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  (30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)

I befriended these niggas before they got famous
They turned on me
I give a fuck, ain't no friends in this game
All the bridges I had built, they burned on me
Whatever happens with me and the bitch after him 
And the bitch don't concern on me
When I was younger used to rock a cape
Tried to save me a ho, then I learned from it
None of these bitches deserve bein' saved
I'm an ape when I bathe, I'm a king, homie
She ain't my main, so go fuck who you want
When you get here, I make that chick sing for me
My brothers pick up whenever I call
Every time that I call, bought a ring for 'em
'Cause they never let the phone ring
And they honest even when it stings

I gotta stop takin' shit to the head and the heart
Niggas hated on me from the jumpstart
Niggas be actin' original
Low-key be studyin' all of my private parts
I never tried to be joker, I always was ace 
And my daddy was king of hearts (ayy)
Knew I'd be rich and be famous
I rapped in the mirror while cuzzo played Kingdom Hearts
I never let a bitch in 'cause if she don't get close
Then my heart won't get broke apart
All of the bitches wan' ride on the Boat
Let 'em in, now my shit look like Noah's Ark
He want the smoke, so we went to his mom's 
And we hit the front porch with a Molotov
Niggas ain't gangster, we know they soft
Niggas switched on the gang 'cause the score was off

I befriended these niggas before they got famous
They turned on me
I give a fuck, ain't no friends in this game
All the bridges I had built, they burned on me
Whatever happens with me and the bitch after him 
And the bitch don't concern on me
When I was younger used to rock a cape
Tried to save me a ho, then I learned from it
None of these bitches deserve bein' saved
I'm an ape when I bathe, I'm a king, homie
She ain't my main, so go fuck who you want
When you get here, I make that chick sing for me
My brothers pick up whenever I call
Every time that I call, bought a ring for 'em
'Cause they never let the phone ring
And they honest even when it stings

I put my feelings inside of a bottle
I'm somewhere chillin' inside of a model
She ate my children, she grabbed it and swallowed
I'll probably leave her a couple of dollars
I put on shit that don't come out 'til next year
Hold up, wait, let me in, this the best here
I told Pee to call me when the check clear
Told the pilot call me when the jet here
Got a lil' nigga deal in my left ear
I'm not one to mess with, you play, you get left here
Got some niggas don't care if they get caught
I won't stop if she tough, she can get bought
Niggas act like they twelve, make 'em bitch out
I won't say what I did, I don't need clout
There's the door, if you want, you can leave out
Boy, you play, we gon' spray when you leave out
I lost people I thought that would be here
That money start comin' and shit start to change people
Never switch on the gang, I was lit before fame
Kept it real and I'm still with the same niggas
We the one that was flippin' them thangs
You know what I'm sayin', don't play like we lame, nigga
Took the game I was taught and put flame with it
I ain't trippin', just don't put my name in it (Baby)

I befriended these niggas before they got famous
They turned on me
I give a fuck, ain't no friends in this game
All the bridges I had built, they burned on me
Whatever happens with me and the bitch after him 
And the bitch don't concern on me
When I was younger used to rock a cape
Tried to save me a ho, then I learned from it
None of these bitches deserve bein' saved
I'm an ape when I bathe, I'm a king, homie
She ain't my main, so go fuck who you want
When you get here, I make that chick sing for me (30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga)
My brothers pick up whenever I call
Every time that I call, bought a ring for 'em
'Cause they never let the phone ring
And they honest even when it stings

Damn
Ayy
Ayy
Ayy
