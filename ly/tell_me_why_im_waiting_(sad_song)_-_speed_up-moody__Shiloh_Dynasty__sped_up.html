		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-

Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-
Tell me why I'm waiting for someone
That couldn't give a fuck about me
No, I wouldn't-
