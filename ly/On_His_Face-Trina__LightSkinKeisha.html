		<p>
		  (Yea yea yea yea yea yea)
Stick it in the aux hole baby
(Ay, yea yea yea yea yea, look)

Sat on his face (Yea)
Said he want a taste
Told him give me head in the back of the Wraith (Skrt skrt)
Told him slow down
No it's not a race (Skrt skrt)
Got one hand on his head
Blunt to my face

Sat on his face (Yea)
Said he want a taste
Told him give me head in the back of the Wraith (Skrt skrt)
Told him slow down
No it's not a race (Skrt skrt)
Got one hand on his head
Blunt to my face

I'm a real greezy bitch (Bitch)
Don't take me to mama (No)
I just want the head (Yea)
You can keep the drama
I'm like fuck a wedding band
Let's fuck up some commas
Run a check up at Nobu
I don't fuck with Benihana's (No)

I'm not regular
I'm not basic
I can't relate (Can't relate)
I fuck on your man
I fuck up the plans
I tell him to scrape the plate (Skrt)
I heard you been talkin'
I heard you been trippin'
One question: How do I taste? (Mmm)
Your nigga missin' and you in your feelings
I told him it's gettin' late

I'm a real greezy bitch (Bitch)
Don't take me to mama (No)
I just want the head (Yea)
You can keep the drama

I'm a real greezy bitch (Bitch)
I'm a real greezy bitch (Yea)

Sat on his face
Said he want a taste
Told him give me head in the back of the Wraith (Skrt skrt)
Told him slow down
No it's not a race (Skrt skrt)
Got one hand on his head
Blunt to my face

Sat on his face
Said he want a taste
Told him give me head in the back of the Wraith (Skrt skrt)
Told him slow down
No it's not a race (Skrt skrt)
Got one hand on his head
Blunt to my face

Got good pussy on the menu (Delicious)
Keep a nigga bussin' like extendo
Make him tap out can't continue (Woo)
Head fine no game no Nintendo (Nah)
Wet like a sink
He want a drink
Gave him a taste, whoa (Whoa)
Wet wet got him sprung
Speakin' in tongues
Runnin' through that bank roll (Bank roll)

Hit it from the back in the Maybach (Yea)
Gotta use a rubber I don't play that (Yea)
I'ma put this pussy where his face at (Yea)
Got him like "damn, where your waist at?" (Where?)
Throw it back got him like "hold up" (Hold up)
Usain, got a nigga runnin'
Turn a boss nigga to a dummy
Got a nigga sayin' that he love me
Nigga I don't love you
Only thing I love is some money (Money)

I ain't catchin' feelings (Nah)
Only catchin' nuts (Catchin' nuts)
Give your nigga back (Back)
Right when I'm done (You can have him)
Just give me head and racks (Yea)
Money make me cum (It do)
Don't want no strings attached (Nah)
I just want that tongue (On God)

Sat on his face
Said he want a taste
Told him give me head in the back of the Wraith (Skrt skrt)
Told him slow down
No it's not a race (Skrt skrt)
Got one hand on his head
Blunt to my face

Sat on his face
Said he want a taste
Told him give me head in the back of the Wraith (Skrt skrt)
Told him slow down
No it's not a race (Skrt skrt)
Got one hand on his head
Blunt to my face
