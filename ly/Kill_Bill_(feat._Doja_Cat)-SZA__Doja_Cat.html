		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, I love you

I'm in a funk, so I bought a bouquet of roses
And cut 'em up at your doorstep, your new neighborhood is gorgeous
I paid a lot of money for the fragrances you wore when we were dating
And I sold some lemonade just to afford them
I know it's not a really good occasion to be bargin' in
I couldn't help but watch you kiss her by the kitchen sink
I swung the door open, tippy-toed for the win
I wasn't cryin', I was starin' and forgot to blink
She saw me standin' by the TV and she wouldn't stop screamin'
So I tried to be discreet and told her, "Calm your tits"
She grabbed the kitchen knife, so I pulled out the blick
Ain't got it all the time, thank God I did for this
'Cause she was seein' red, and all I saw was you
It happened in a flash, when she charged at me
You're criss-crossed, saw her fall to the floor
Then you paused, and in horror, that shot wasn't for her
(I might) Was it?

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I try to ration with you, no murders, no crime of passion
But, damn, you was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in amazement, playin' on my patience
Now you layin' face-down, got me singin' over a beat

I'm so mature, I'm so mature
I'm so mature, I got me a therapist to tell me there's other men
I don't want none, I just want you
If I can't have you, no one will, I (I might)

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him, though
Rather be in jail than alone

I did it all for love (love)
I did it all on no drugs (drugs)
I did all of this sober
I did it all for us, oh
I did it all for love (love)
I did all of this on no drugs (drugs)
I did all of this sober
Don't you know I did it all for us? (I'm gon' kill your ass tonight)

Oh, I just killed my ex, not the best idea (idea)
Killed his girlfriend next, how'd I get here?
I just killed my ex, I still love him, though (I do)
Rather be in hell than alone
