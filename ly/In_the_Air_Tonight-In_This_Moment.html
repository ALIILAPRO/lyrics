		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord

Well, if you told me you were drowning
I would not lend a hand
I've seen your face before my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off the grin, I know where you've been
It's all been a pack of lies

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Oh Lord

Well, I remember
I remember, don't worry
How could I ever forget, it's the first time
The last time we ever met
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up
No, you don't fool me
This hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows
No stranger to you or me

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment all my life, oh Lord
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
I've been waiting in this moment for all of my life, all of my life, all of my life
All of my life, oh Lord, oh Lord
Oh Lord (oh Lord)
