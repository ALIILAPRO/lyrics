		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Miss Judy was a awesome girl
She used to be a proper girl
Make her mom and pop proud
Until she went and tossed some rounds
One, two, she get feel of the drink
Three, four, its hard to hear or think
Five, six, she got her head In the sink
Couple more shots and everything went blank
Yeah, she never liked go out
Till she met the party now it's time to show out
All it took was college now she selling shows out
Started at McDonald’s she already own crowds
Nice smile she got her makeup on
Lights out they wanna take her home
She already know her name
She got everyone saying
Drunk Judy she walk so fine
Drunk Judy she almost mine
Don’t you see I’m on your time
Come to me and come to life
Drunk Judy she walk so fine
Drunk Judy she almost mine
Don’t you see I’m on your time
Come to me and come to life
She already rocking high heel shoes
Stumble the run way like she might still lose
Fun on a Sunday got a cup of the Rosè
And her tongue in the punch they wanna fight with you.
She don’t care she wanna good time
Ain’t no sharing cause it’s all mine
Diced pears with a little wine
I’m scared she could go blind
She say she don’t need to see to hear the music
On the speakers getting freaky when she lose it
When I see her got me thinking that she clueless
But we already knew this
Yet she still surprise when we all walk by
We know she’ll talk loud if we all get quiet
She a real pop star she ain’t got no car
But she can still walk to the bar
Drunk Judy she walk so fine
Drunk Judy she almost mine
Don’t you see I’m on your time
Come to me and come to life
Drunk Judy she walk so fine
Drunk Judy she almost mine
Don’t you see I’m on your time
Come to me and come to life
Drunk Judy she sober now
Staring at empty glasses sitting on the counter
I wonder how she doing now
Ain’t seen her in a minute and it’s only been an hour
Glass half empty but the glass half full
She spotted in a corner bout to break another rule, yeah
It’s been a hot minute how you doing
It’s been a long time since I seen Drunk Judy
Never mind never mind never mind
Somebody left some drink in they cup from last night
Running round the room she boutta take it to the head
I ain’t gonna lie I was getting kinda scared
Somebody called the police now they knocking on the door
Ain’t nobody here we just don’t know where to go
Sober Judy ain’t sober no more
Police knock down the door and now she laying laying on the floor
Drunk Judy she walk so fine
Drunk Judy she almost mine
Don’t you see I’m on your time
Come to me and come to life
Drunk Judy she walk so fine
Drunk Judy she almost mine
Don’t you see I’m on your time
Come to me and come to life
