		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't know why
I can't quite get you out my sight
You're always just behind
You're stored across my mind

Keep crawling back
To where we last
Left our love on hold
I'm always out for more
So what you waiting for?

Wait, before you burn me to the ground
Please stay 'til the beat of our heart runs out

I don't wanna let go, let go
'Cause I've been tryna
Hold on for so long
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

To save me, save me
From every single
Heartache, heartache
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

One by one and
Two by twice
I've watched all my loves
Move on to something more
Open out the door

Caught in between every passing hour
Oh, please stay 'til the taste of your love turns sour

I don't wanna let go, let go
'Cause I've been tryna
Hold on for so long
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

To save me, save me
From every single
Heartache, heartache
I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lover"

So let me know
Did we ever mean anything at all?
So let me know
Did we ever mean anything at all?

I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "Didn't hurt me"
Ooh, I feel like I'm lost without a trace
Take my heart and run away
She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover"

I've been looking for a lasting lover
Oh, and I've been looking for a lasting lover
