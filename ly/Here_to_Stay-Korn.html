		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This time, I'm taking it away
I've got a problem
With me getting in the way
Not by design

So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain

This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again

The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore

For what's inside awaking 
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything 
And, oh, I cannot give any more

My mind's done with this, okay?
I've got a question
Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine

So I take my time
Guiding the blade down the line
Each cut closer to the vein
Vein, vein

This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again

The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore

For what's inside awaking 
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything 
And, oh, I cannot give any more

I'm here to stay
Bring it down
I'm here to stay
Bring it down
I'm here to stay
Bring it down
I'm here to stay

Bring it down
Bring it down
Bring it down
Bring it down

Gonna break it down, gonna break it down
Gonna break it down, gonna break it down
Gonna break it down, gonna break it down
Gonna break it down, gonna break it

This state is elevating
As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again

The hurt inside is fading 
This shit's gone way too far
All this time, I've been waiting
Oh, I cannot grieve anymore

For what's inside awaking 
I'm not, I'm not a whore
You've taken everything 
And, oh, I cannot give any more

Give any more 
Give any more 
Give any more 
Give any more
