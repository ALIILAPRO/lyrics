		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We stay up until the light
Sunrise in the mornin'
And I can't wait until we reunite
I can help to ease your mind

And even if you're low, sometimes
I can be the one to
Pick you all the way up
Baby, when you're feeling down
You just gotta let me know

No, there ain't no problem
For love
With you and I, tonight
No, nothing can stop us
This time (this time)
Doesn't have to be complicated tonight

No, there ain't no problem (no, no)
For love (for love)
With you and I tonight
No, nothing can stop us
This time (this time)
Doesn't have to be complicated
No, there ain't no problem tonight

For your heart, I'm qualified
We don't need no conversation
We don't have to say goodbye
'Cause baby, you got me right, ooh

And even if you're low, sometimes
I can be the one to
Pick you all the way up
Baby, when you're feeling down
Just pick up the phone

No, there ain't no problem
For love
With you and I, tonight
No, nothing can stop us
This time (this time)
Doesn't have to be complicated tonight

No, there ain't no problem (no, no)
For love (for love)
With you and I tonight
No, nothing can stop us
This time (this time)
Doesn't have to be complicated
No, there ain't no problem tonight

Uh, ain't no problem for love tonight
Come and ride with me, we can dance tonight, yeah
Under the stars tonight
Yeah, your eyes shine brighter than neon lights uh (neon lights)
Bass loud, no we don't play (don't play)
For your love yeah, I will pray (oh, yeah)

Me and you that's one plus one (ooh!)
Me and you, no, ain't nobody better, come on

And even if you're low, sometimes
I can be the one to
Pick you all the way up
Baby, when you're feeling down
You just gotta let me know (know, know)

No, there ain't no problem
For love (for love huh)
With you and I, tonight
No, nothing can stop us
This time (this time)
Doesn't have to be complicated tonight 
Come on, baby, let's go

No, there ain't no problem (no, no)
For love (for love)
With you and I tonight (yeah-yeah-yeah)
No, nothing can stop us (yeah, yeah)
This time (this time)
Doesn't have to be complicated
No, there ain't no problem tonight
