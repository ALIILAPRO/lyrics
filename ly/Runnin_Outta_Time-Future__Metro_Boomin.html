		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe we just runnin' out of time
Ain't no need to try to hold you up 'cause you always mines
But I can't trust nobody, I was down, wasn't nobody left
They done turned they back on me, never turned on myself
Maybe we just runnin' out of time (of time)
Ain't no need to try to hold you up 'cause you always mines
But I can't trust nobody, I was down, wasn't nobody left
They done turned they back on me, never turned on myself

I can't trust nobody, I can't trust nobody I know
Left me alone, I was grindin', I had to find myself
Real one, had to remind myself
Sometimes even rich niggas get lost
I'm experiencin' more paranoia
Findin' love got me more paranoid
I can't tell who real anymore
It's the ones that I cherish and adore
It'll never be like it was before
Before I was climbin' up the charts
When you leavin', you leave me no choice
I'll come back and unpack the Rolls-Royce
I'll come through if you need me, of course
Hope it come to the day we rejoice
I got your back like a spine

Maybe we just runnin' out of time
Ain't no need to try to hold you up 'cause you always mines
But I can't trust nobody, I was down, wasn't nobody left
They done turned they back on me, never turned on myself
Maybe we just runnin' out of time (of time)
Ain't no need to try to hold you up 'cause you always mines
But I can't trust nobody, I was down, wasn't nobody left
They done turned they back on me, never turned on myself

Never could trust you, I still got your location on
Fell out of love, I delete all the nudes out your phone
Can't get a reaction out of me, that's what you want
It's not sexy to show your vulnerability, keep it calm
Had her eatin' sushi out my palm
Got a new penthouse, sittin' at the palms
Got a flock of birds wrapped around my arms
Tried to park the Bugatti in the lobby
Went to Puerto Rico, went to Bali
Got her body done just for a hobby (I did)
Got her skatin' on new ice like it's hockey (Pluto)
Made her throw away all the Versace
Bitches fuckin' each other, we watchin'

Maybe we just runnin' out of time (of time)
Ain't no need to try to hold you up 'cause you always mines
But I can't trust nobody, I was down, wasn't nobody left
They done turned they back on me, never turned on myself (never turned on myself)

Baby, we runnin' through timezones
You comin' back, no matter where you go

Ayy, respect
Yeah, I'm fried, yeah, I'm fried
Hold on, yeah, I'm fried
Hold on
And I'm tryna get fried, so pass the weed over here
Fried
And y'all ain't exempt
It's her birthday
Then let's do it
Who's birthday is it?
Alright, come on 
I'm finna cut the song back goin' so y'all can take shots
Yes, sir
