		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you could hold on to this
Thought we lost it long ago
You dream while we turn to this
In familiar fields before

And I thought we had forever and we would have it all
Secret on the breath like a path to lead you home

I hear your voice like you are still here
Part of a dream I can't remember
Just out of reach

If you could hold on to this
I thought we lost it long ago
Dream while we turn to this
In familiar fields before

And I thought we had forever and that we would have it all
The secret on the breath like a path to lead you home

I hear your voice like you are still here
Part of a dream I can't remember
Just out of reach

Wait for me there, coming to find you
Stars in the sea fade into nothing
Fall in too deep
