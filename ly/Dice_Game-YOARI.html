		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me what you want baby
It's just a one-off
You say it like you mean it
But I see through you
When you showed up, I knew it babe
Like a gamble, it's all about you
Searching all that secret of you, babe
Mmm, yeah, oh

You came in like a whisper
I just wanna think about you now
Got to find out
What you're trying to do, right now
Baby, you and I
Have no other way to go
Maybe you could be my one true love
You and I
Yeah, I know what you really are
Hidden secrets, is it worth it boy?

Say you want me baby
It's now or never
You better keep your distance
So, I can read you
You came in like a mystic light
Now all I ever do is think of you
Oh, you've stolen my heart
Baby, you and I
Have no other way to go
Maybe you could be my one true love
You and I
Yeah, I know what you really are
Hidden secrets, is it worth it boy?

You and I
I don't know what you're aimin' for
Is it all about me, maybe something else?
You and I
I don't know why you have come to me, babe
All I ever want it you
Baby, you and I
Have no other way to go
You and I
Yeah, I know what you really are
Hidden secrets, is it worth it boy?
