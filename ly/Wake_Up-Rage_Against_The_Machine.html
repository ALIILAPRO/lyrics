		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Come on

Come on, although ya try to discredit
Ya still never read it
The needle, I'll thread it, radically poetic
Standin' with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double I'm Mad
Still knee-deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose but it can never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air, in the land of hypocrisy

Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease
When their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police (what), the judges (what), the feds (the feds)
Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King when he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

Yeah, yeah, back in this
With poetry my mind, I flex
Flip like Wilson, vocals never lackin' that finesse
What do I got to, what do I got to do to wake you up?
To shake you up, to break the structure up
'Cause blood still flows in the gutter
I'm like takin' photos, mad boy kicks open the shutter
Set the groove, then stick and move like I was Cassius
Rep the stutter step then bomb a left upon the fascists
Yeah, several federal men
Who pulled schemes on the dream and put it to an end
You better beware of retribution with mind war
Twenty-twenty visions and murals with metaphors
Networks at work, keepin' people calm
Ya know they murdered X and tried to blame it on Islam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

What was the price on his head?
What was the price on his head?

I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard a shot
I think I heard, I think I heard a shot

Black Nationalism, he may be a brave new contender for this position
Should he abandon his supposed obedience to white liberal doctrine
Of non-violence and embrace Black Nationalism
Through counter-intelligence it should be possible to
Pinpoint potential trouble-makers and neutralize them

Through counter-intelligence it should be possible to
Pinpoint potential trouble-makers and neutralize them
And neutralize them, and neutralize them, and neutralize them

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

How long? Not long
'Cause what you reap is what you sow
