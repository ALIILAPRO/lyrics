Hey
Saweetie, hmm
Oh-oh
Let's go

We wanna celebrate like we in the club every day
Got all my friends here with me
And I don't need ya, I don't need ya
Got this dress up on me
So I don't need your stress up on me
Baby, we're done, c'est la vie
Now I don't need ya, I don't need ya

Should've left your ass from time ago
Didn't love me then, but now I do
I used to sit at home and cry for you
Diamonds on my neck, I shine for you
Ain't blocking my blessings anymore
Never be the girl I was before
I'ma let the good things in my life rain down

From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me (yeah), so V.I.P (yeah)
All of my dreams, from the sky, drop like confetti
Drop it down
You're missin' me, but I'm finally free
I got what I need, so let it rain down like confetti

Flashing lights, I ain't got no worry on my mind
Know that you're mad, I realized
That I don't need ya, I don't need ya
So, DJ, say my name like it's my birthday
You're just a memory
And, boy, I don't need ya, I don't need ya

Should've left your ass from time ago (time ago)
Didn't love me then, but now I do (now I do)
I'ma let the good things in my life rain down

From the sky, drop like confetti
All eyes on me (on me, yeah), so V.I.P (yeah)
All of my dreams, from the sky, drop like confetti (my dreams, woah)
Drop it down
You're missin' me (you're missin' me, yeah)
But I'm finally free (finally free)
I got what I need, so let it rain down like confetti

(Oh, la-la-la)
Let it rain down
(Oh, la-la-la)
Let it rain down (let it, let it rain down)
(Oh, la-la-la)
Let it rain down (let it rain down)
(Oh, la-la-la)
Rain

So my girl hit me up about a fuck-boy dude (what?)
I said, "Hold on, hold on, what he said he did to you?"
Caught him sending dick pics and a couple of nudes
Shit, we could chop it off and I'ma Bobbitt in stew
I don't play that shit (no, no), beat his ass up (slo-mo)
Ride or die on go-go, nigga, I'm a Yoko Ono (Ono)
I'm an artsy bitch, you gonna miss these lips
Now I'ma have to slap yours with my Swavorski tips (that's right)
I'm a Cancer baby, but I got Scorpio ways
Credit high on all my cards, top one is my face
Get a pedi' in my Tesi', yeah, there's plenty of space
New it-girl on the block, they all copy and paste
Face on Halle, body on Chloe, yeah
Ain't givin' you a chance, I'ma give it to your homie
Mood on petty, so promiscuous, you ain't gettin' this (oh)

From the sky, drop like confetti (yeah)
All eyes on me, so V.I.P
All of my dreams, from the sky, drop like confetti (all of my dreams)
You're missin' me (You're missin' me), I'm finally free (I'm finally free)
I got what I need (I've got what I need), so let it rain down like confetti

(Oh, la-la-la)
Let it rain down
(Oh, la-la-la)
Let it rain down
(Oh, la-la-la)
Let it rain down
Oh, let it rain down
Rain
