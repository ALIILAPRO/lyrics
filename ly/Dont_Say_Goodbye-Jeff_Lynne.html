		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't say good-bye don't even think about it
Don't even let it cross your mind
Things will be fine and there's no doubt about it
I always knew that we'd survive

So hold me close, never let me go
I need you now more than ever before
Don't change your mind don't even turn it over
Not after what we've been through

So hold me close, never let me go
I need you now more than ever before
Don't say good-bye don't even think about it
Don't even let it cross your mind
And please don't ever say good-bye

Don't say good-bye
Don't say good-bye
Don't say good-bye

Don't say good-bye
