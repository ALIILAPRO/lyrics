		  Ohh darlin'
My darlin' you're so fine
Ohhhh-hhh-hhh

Don't know if words can say
But darlin' i'll find a way
To let you know what you meant to me
Guess it was meant to be
I hold you in my heart
As life's most precious part

Oh darlin'
I dream about you often my pretty darlin'
(darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way you soften my life with your love
Your precious love uh huh oh

I was living like half a man
Then i couldn't love but now i can
You pick me up when i'm feeling sad
More soul than i ever had
Gonna love you every single night
'Cause i think you're too outta sight

Oh darlin'
I dream you often my pretty darlin'
(darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way soften my life with your love
Your precious love uh huh huh

Woah oh oh oh
Every night darlin'
Gonna love you every single night, yes i will
'Cause i think you're too doggone outta sight

Oh darlin'
I dream you often my pretty darlin'
(darlin' you're so fine)
I love the way soften my life with your love
Your precious love uh huh huh
Oh
