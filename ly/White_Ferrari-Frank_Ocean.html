		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mine on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet sixteen, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed
We're both so familiar
White Ferrari

Stick by me (good times), close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari (oh), good times

In this life (life)
In this life (life)

One too many years, some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might wanna know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life

I'm sure we're taller in 'nother dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of movin', your body's achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given
But we're so okay here
We're doing fine, primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam
