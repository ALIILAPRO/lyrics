		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Summer mood
Hot sand under my feet
Cold beer, cheap wine
Yeah, that's all that we need

We got the moves
We got the moves
And everybody's like
Oh fuck yeah, let's do it again

We got the moves
We got the moves
When everybody's like
Yesterday we drank too much
Let's do it again
We got the groove
We got the groove
So everybody put your hands straight up
Tonight is the night

We are young
We are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive
We believe
That summer time memories
Will never fade away

We're living the good life, high life
Everybody wants that hot vibe
We wanna feel it just all over and over again
More, just give me more
'Cause we're addicted to the groove
Oh yeah,, we do it again

We got the moves
We got the moves
When everybody's like
Yesterday we drank too much
Let's do it again
We got the groove
We got the groove
So everybody put your hands straight up
Tonight is the night

We are young
We are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive
We believe
That summer time memories
Will never fade away
Will never fade away
Will never fade away

We don't need no club
All we need is the sun
Yeah, we will rave like hell
'Till the weekend is done

We got the moves
We got the moves
And everybody put your hands straight up
Tonight is the night
We say

Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp
Döp dödödö döp

We got the moves
We got the moves
When everybody's like
Yesterday we drank too much
Let's do it again
We got the groove
We got the groove
So everybody put your hands straight up
Tonight is the night

Everybody hands up
We don't need a damn club
Get down 'cause we're gonna party like hell
And we won't stop until the sun up
Hits our glowing eyes like boom, boom
We gon' put the track on repeat

We are young
We are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive
We believe
That summer time memories

We are young
We are free
Sipping on booze on a sunny beach
We're alive
We believe
That summer time memories
Will never fade away
Will never fade away
Will never fade away
