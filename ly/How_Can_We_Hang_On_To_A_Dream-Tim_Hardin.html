		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream

How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems

What can I do, she's saying we're through
With how it was
What will I try, I still don't see why
She says what she does

How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems

What can I say, she's walking away
From what we've seen
What can I do, still loving you
It's all a dream

How can we hang on to a dream
How can it, will it be, the way it seems
How can we hang on to a dream
