		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah no
Yeah, mmh

Oh, my voice is a mystery
But they always tryna diss me
Same guys tryna get in my way
Keep the same vibe, you can't ruin my day
Oh, my voice is a mystery
Ride the wave of my history
I've been distant to keep my distance
Goodbye to a boring life
I like to seek but I'm never in sight
Even though I'm the type to ride
I like to care but it never reach fight
Swinging my waist like you never did see
And then I roll like I really get baked
And you can't believe what you heard about me

It's the magic for me
They keep trying to reach me, yeah, yeah
It's the magic for me
I make them weep 'til they run insane
So get me lit on a weekday
I'm on the way and my ways on a display
And I'ma shut 'em all down one of these days
It's my time so put me on a replay

Who this guy, when they say they wan try me?
Who this guy, when they wanna come play me?
Who this guy, when they say they wan break?
Who this guy, when they say they wan shake?
All this time when they say they wan break, yeah
All this time when they say they wan take, yeah
Who this guy when he say he wan pie me?
Who this guy when he wanna define me?
I've been 'round the world, nah, nah, nah
And when they call, nah me they call 
(Oh, ah, oh, yeah)

Back then when I ain't have no friends
And yah condescend but I really won't rest, see
Even though bro, I could let you go
But I really wan show that you really can't test me
Even on the days, when they tried to arrest me
But you live a lie, there's no way you could get me
Pissed 'em off, they locked me up in a celly
Then e shock dem when they see me on the telly
You know, I'm a vibe and I run it as usual
I didn't only come around just to make it
And I could shake things but I'll break it, you name it, boy
Who knew I won't care for the things that you do?
I could turn let everyone try me
'Cause you never gonna get what's for me, yeah

Back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back
Back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back
Back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back
Back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back then, back
