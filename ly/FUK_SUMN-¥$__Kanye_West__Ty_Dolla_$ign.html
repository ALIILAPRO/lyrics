		  Smokin' on a junt with my niggas drinkin' O.E
Stop off, stop off at the liquor store, get your 'Gnac, then we headed for the indo
Smokin' on a junt with my niggas drinkin' O.E
Stop off, stop off at the liquor store, get your 'Gnac, then we headed for the indo

I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now
I'm try-I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now

Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'
Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'
Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'
Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'

Ooh, ooh, right now
Shawty wanna fuck on me, I told her, "Let's go now"
Dressed in all her fashion, she tryna show out
Miami, Bal Harbour, before I tote, uh, ah
I'm on the G6 brackin' shit with my pole, hah
All black Brabus truck, lookin' like my soul just went out
All of my vibes is tens, gotta keep them close, they might jump out
We might go spin and spin, just clearin' that ho before we cool out

I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now
I'm try-I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now

Baby, don't keep me up, yeah, keep me up
Don't wanna beat me up, yeah, beat me up
Baby, don't keep me up, yeah, keep me up
Don't wanna beat me up, yeah, beat me up
We comin' down swervin'
This the real, not a version
Even Jesus ain't marry a virgin
No weapon formed against us will win

We comin' down swervin'
This the real, not a version
I don't care who you fucked, you a virgin to me
You a perv and to me, baby, perfect to me
Hold my coat, hold my drink
On my own, come with me
Shawty wanna fuck on somethin'?
Fuck on me, suck on me publicly (yeah)

La Flame, baby, you on fire (La Flame)
La Flame, baby, you on fire
La Flame, baby, you on fire (La Flame)
La Flame, baby, you on fire (fire)

Yeah, she feelin' herself (ooh-ooh), yeah, she feelin' on me (yeah)
Only stuff I can give you is that one plus two is three (ah)
Blocked her number, and that shit started with three-somethin'
Meetin' at the threesome, we 'bout to have a mean one
I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now (woo)
Brown skin, but you know I had her creamin'
Janet Jackson by the way I had her screamin'
She hit the group chat, said "That nigga had me fiendin'" (ah)

I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now
I'm try-I'm tryna fuck somethin' right now
That lil' ho, she tryna fuck somethin' right now

Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'
Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'
Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'
Shawty wanna fuck? Whoa
I'ma let her hop on somethin'

Beat me up (ooh)
