		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a charger that charges through the night,
Like an orange bolt of lightning passing everything in sight.
I'm the best pal that you boys ever had,
I'm thunder on the highway lookin' bad, bad, bad.

I'm a knight, like the kind in shining armor,
With my polished body gleaming, I'm a fighter and a charmer.
If trouble comes your way just ask for me,
My friends all know me as General Lee.

I'm the Gerneral Lee,
A pistol pumpin', steel belted cavalry.
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me;
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
Take a look back there:
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
We'll cross the fields and we'll be running free,
They'll eat dust compliments of me:

The General Lee

I'm a hero, and that's how I'll make you feel
When you're riding shotgun with me and the law is at your heels.
I'm glory bound, but when the chase is done,
I'll take off through the mountains and have fun, fun, fun.

I've got style, tearing through the curves;
Let my flag wave proudly to the people that I serve.
I'm number one, and I will always be
The pride of the South they call the General Lee.

I'm the Gerneral Lee,
A pistol pumpin', steel belted cavalry.
I'll never let you down when you're riding with me;
Buckle up and I'll show you what I mean.
Take a look back there:
Sirens blownin', red lights flashin' everywhere;
I'll jump that pond and we'll be running free,
And they'll go swimmin', compliments of me:

The General Lee
The General Lee
General Lee
