		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pull, feel my chest cave in
From the cold somewhere I feel safe in to
Loosen up the sutures all around me
Stitch it through my head, flood my surroundings
I'm not enough
I trace the pattern but
It's not enough
To erase the damage
So I leave it
Stay away so they won't see it
Hold my face so they believe it
But I know it won't cut
So I isolate
Drag my spirit down
Still wondering
Why I feel there's no life left in me
Cause I can't walk through my hopeless gravity
Cause it's killing me
So I isolate
Why is it so hard to breathe
Now you're gone and I am unraveling
I don't want to feel like I am drowning
A dagger in my heart when you're around me
I'm not enough
So I isolate
Drag my spirit down
Still wondering
Why I feel there's no life left in me
Cause I can't walk through my hopeless gravity
Cause it's killing me
So I isolate
Drown myself
To lose that I exist
And I can't move when I still feel like this
I'm so afraid
When the silence is suffocating me
Feels like I can't breathe
So I isolate
Drag my spirit down
Still wondering
Why I feel there's no life left in me
Cause I can't walk through my hopeless gravity
Cause it's killing me
So I isolate
So I leave it
Stay away so they won't see it
Hold my face so they believe it
But I know it won't cut
