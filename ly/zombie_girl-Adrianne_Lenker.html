		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What a dream that was
I almost couldn't wake because
I was frozen in bed with a zombie girl
Vacant as a closed down fair
Sleep paralysis, I sworn I could have felt you there
And I almost coulda kissed your hair
But the emptiness withdrew me
From any kind of wishful prayer

Oh, emptiness tell me about your nature
Maybe I've been getting you wrong
I cover you with questions
Cover you with explanations
Cover you with music

And the next night
Dreaming I could feel your skin
But the dream escapes so easily
And I woke up to the road again
How your words ring through
Something kinda sweet and blue
And I knew that you'd been understanding
Everything that I'd said too

About emptiness
Tell me about your nature
Maybe I've been getting you wrong
I cover you with questions
Cover you with explanations
Cover you with music

What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?
In your mind
