		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'll have it as soon as I earn the money to buy it
That's a long time away
Daddy, you gonna tell her what ma said?

I've been that boy since I was smoking banana peels
Back in Alabama where the ballpen
Hammer knocking hubcaps off the reel
Stealing bowties off the grills
Momma said, "No carbonated soda 'fore you go to bed"
But I never listened to her
A two-liter bong with a tinfoil bowl
Full of cheap hydro is illegal, I'm sure
But I learned from watching the neighbors
Yeah, watching the neighbors
Got me Jordache jeans
Feeling real hot, hangin' from my pocket, a pager
Yeah, buddy, boy, I'm clean
Cubic zirconium rocks in my earrings
Gimme that stone and a mobile phone
And I carry that gem like me and Irene
I'm getting totally stoked
Sipping Creek Water with me and my folks
I'm getting totally throwed
My flock is waddling around
Can't keep my ducks in a row
And I can't keep up with this bullshit they callin' dope, but I'm married to her
I can't leave this bitch neither
Rock and roll pussy I cannot turn down even though she's a liar, a thief, and a cheater, I need her

That long hair ain't gonna cover up that red neck, boy

Catfish Billy
The motherfucking Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Really like I'm really on the couch
Choppin' up dope boy, I ain't never seen a drought
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another from the South
Never be a mother with the style
To make another me, not now
The King of Alabama
That ain't never been a doubt, just bounce, I'm
Catfish Billy
The motherfucking Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Really like I'm really on the couch
Choppin' up dope boy, I ain't never seen a drought
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another from the South
Never be a mother with the style
To make another me, not now
The King of Alabama
That ain't never been a doubt, just bounce

Still got the bottom beating like gorillas
Checking my trunk like a killa'
You ain't fucking with Slumerican stop, uh
Bitch go to sleep, grab a pillow
Go to sleep with your stinking ass
I ain't got time, I ain't taking trash
Out to the bend, take you out with my pen
And then I take a bottle, and break the glass (ooh)
I done built me a fortress
And I didn't have to beg, plead, or force it
Got enough forces to sit on my porch and not move, and still be in orbit
An ancient alien, homosapien
Me and rappers like beats of Okra
Turn water to wine, one hell of a time
Drinking up this fire and there's no need to cork it
Gorgeous, mmm, gimme those
'Cause I remember me and momma making penny rolls
And if you wasn't with me when the shit hit the fan
Then you cannot get a penny, you ain't getting any, bro
Gotta pay the taxes, when the wood is out
And the kerosene can is filled up to the brim
Don't look at him, go get the matches
Lace up and then take a hike
I'm making shit that is major light
I'm pulling up in them big wheels
You couldn't pedal a baby bike
I do not hang at the same club in the same town every damn night
I am not making Hip-Hop for the Hip-Hop awards show or the 'Gram likes
'Cause I

Catfish Billy
The motherfucking Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Really like I'm really on the couch
Choppin' up dope boy, I ain't never seen a drought
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another from the South
Never be a mother with the style
To make another me, not now
The King of Alabama
That ain't never been a doubt, just bounce, I'm
Catfish Billy
The motherfucking Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Really like I'm really on the couch
Choppin' up dope boy, I ain't never seen a drought
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another from the South
Never be a mother with the style
To make another me, not now
The King of Alabama
That ain't never been a doubt, just bounce
