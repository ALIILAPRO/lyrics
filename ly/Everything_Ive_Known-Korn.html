		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Away, I see it's going down 
Today, hoping in time
We'll bury all this pain
And will awake something inside

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out, then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known

Our lives were good in every way
Too late, time after time
Our love just turned to hate
But we stayed by each other's side

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out, then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known

I keep holding on
I feel I'm where I belong

Every time we fight
It feels so wrong
I feel so enslaved, fuck my pride
Then we meet again

We pushed our buttons far inside
We tear our hearts out, then we fight

Hey, I know
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
I cannot survive alone
Feels like I've lost everything that I've known
