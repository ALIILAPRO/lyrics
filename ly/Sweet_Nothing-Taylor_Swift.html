		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?

Ooh, ooh

They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time

Ooh, ooh

'Cause they said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'

Industry disruptors
And soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore
"You should be doing more"
To you, I can admit
That I'm just too soft for all of it

Ooh

They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' (they said the end is comin')
Everyone's up to somethin' (everyone's up to somethin')
I found myself a-runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside they're push and shovin' (outside they're push and shovin')
You're in the kitchen hummin' (you're in the kitchen hummin')
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
