		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're far more cooler than your body could've known
I'll be your playgirl, could leave me on the floor
If only love weren't the neighbors on your street
You're far more cooler, the flavor of the week

'Cause I need your love
Save my body, step on me
Save my body, step on me

Cheese won't melt in the fire
Please don't turn into milk
Chili hit sweet in the sugar
If only I'd speak, if only

'Cause I want your love
Save my body, step on me
Save my body, step on me

'Cause I want your love
(Your love, your love, your love, your love)
Save my body, step on me
Save my body, step on me

But I don't think we can take much more
But I don't think we can take much more
Keep us waiting
Keep us waiting

But I don't think we can take much more
But I don't think we can take much more
Keep us waiting
Keep us waiting

You're far more cooler than your body could've known
I'll be your playgirl, could leave me on the floor
If only love weren't the neighbors on your street
You're far more cooler, the flavor of the week

'Cause I want your love (but I don't think we can take much more)
(But I don't think we can take much more)
Save my body, step on me
Save my body, step on me

'Cause I want your love (but I don't think we can take much more)
(But I don't think we can take much more)
Save my body, step on me
Save my body, step on me
