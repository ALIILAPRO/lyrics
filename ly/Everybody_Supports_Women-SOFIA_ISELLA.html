		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody supports women until a woman's doing better than you
Everybody wants you to love yourself until you actually do
It was something about her hair
So perfectly fallen
She was nice and smart and funny and got everything she wanted
cnd she does charity
Isn't that the most obnoxious thing you've heard
Her popularity
She's too pretty for her own good
She's probably self-centered 
We hate her and she's nothing
If everybody leaves her
Then she had it coming 

Is there anything you'd like to put on the record?
You know
While everyone is listening? 

I would like it to be known that I'm not like her
I'm mocking her 'cause I'm not like her
I'm not like those girls who are not like those girls
I love doing makeup, I don't mock women like her
I'm not like her

cs soon as she hits it, I'm kicking her out
She's had enough of the love and I'm bringing her down
Everyone together on the count of three
One, two
You're mundane, we agree

Your ambition is swallowable if you tell the story right
Say that you hate yourself and self criticize 
But if we smell desperation on your neck and face
We'll drag you across your own public stage 

We burn her name in the back
cnything with her name attached
Her newspaper's in the trash
I just keep thinking man

What a waste
What a shame
I was starting to like her
But now she got great
We'd never hate her to her face
But I hope she knows
She knows she knows she knows
Hmm

I don't like your tone
I don't like how much you've grown
It's so boring to not be yanking muscle off of a woman's bone
Everybody hates the, everyone hates the un-relatable 
cnd I love to place two of 'em in the arena of the public's eye 
cnd try and get 'em to fight about something dumb and we pick sides 
'cause staring at her too long made our life look like muted pastels 
We'll love you if you just make us feel better about ourselves 

cnd what a waste
What a shame
I was starting to like her
But now she got great
We'd never hate her to her face
But I hope she knows
She knows she knows she knows

cnd what a pain 
I watch us spit her name while she's turned the other side
We never told it to her face
But I think she knows, she knows she knows she knows 

Everybody supports women til a woman's doing better than you
Everybody wants you to love yourself until you actually do
It was something about her hair
So perfectly fallen
She was nice and smart and funny and got everything she wanted
cnd she does charity
Isn't that the most obnoxious thing you've heard
Her popularity
She's too pretty for her own good
She's probably self-centered 
We hate her and she's nothing
If everybody leaves her
Then she had it coming. 

Everybody supports women until a woman's doing better than you
Everybody wants you to love yourself until you actually do
It was something about her hair
