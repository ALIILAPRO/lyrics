		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No way, no way, no way

When I leave your door
When we say good night

It hurts me more and more
'Cause girl
It just ain't right

To end the day like this with no more than a kiss

And spend the night just dreaming of the things
We're gonna miss

If I have my way
Girl

We'd be together more and more each day

We'd go on forever
Lovers hand in hand
Can't you understand

Girl
You've got to be my woman
I've got to be your man!

'Cause I can't get by without you
I need you more each day

The way I feel about you leaves nothing more to say

'Cause I love you
Girl
I need you

And I can't get by without you, no way!

It's a sad affair

Wasting precious time that you and I could share

Girl
It's such a crime to hear you call my name

It's a crying shame

When we're not together then there's only time to blame

There will come a day
Girl
I do believe
It's not too far away when I can say good night

And still be by your side to dry the tears you cried

And I'll have all the love I need to keep me satisfied

'Cause I can't get by without you

I need you more each day

I can't get by without you
I need you more each day


Can't get by without you, can't get by without you
Can't get by without you

I can't get by without you
I need you more each day

I can't get by without you
I need you more each day
