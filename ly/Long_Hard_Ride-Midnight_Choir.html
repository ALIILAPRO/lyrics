		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There, there's no room for craziness
There, there's no room for you and I
You and me baby were born on the dark side
And our love for a long hard ride

What's good about love
That's easily conquered
What's good about love
That ain't gonna last
What's good about love
That leaves you shattered
Like windows broken by blast

There, there's no way to freedom
There, there's no way for you and I
You and me baby were born on the dark side
And our love for a long hard ride
What's good about love
That moves too fast
What's good about love
That pulls the trigger
Before any questions are asked

There, there's no way to freedom
There, there's no way for you and I
You and me baby were born on the dark side
And our love for a long hard ride
And our love for a long hard ride
