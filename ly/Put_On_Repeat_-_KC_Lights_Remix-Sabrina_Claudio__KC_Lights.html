		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If he could, he would have this for life
Mmh, make it lovely
It only gets better each time, yeah, yeah, yeah
And he likes to compare me to wine
Over and over he tastes me
Only gets better with time, yeah

So now he wants to put on repeat, put on repeat
Put on re- (put on re-), put on repeat
Put on repeat, put on repeat
(Put on re-, put on re-), put on repeat
Put on repeat

If I could, I would have him for life
Oh yes, I'm begging 
To touch on his perfect design, yeah
Yeah, yeah
'Cause his body is my favorite ride
Over and over, please let me 
Off and back on one more time, yes

I'm yours and you're mine
Anything for you so tell me that you wanna

Put on repeat, put on repeat
Put on re- (put on re-), put on repeat
Put on repeat, put on repeat
(Put on re-, put on re-), put on repeat
Put on repeat, ohh, oh, yeah

I'm yours and you're mine
Anything for you, just tell me that you wanna

Put on repeat, put on repeat
Put on re- (put on re-), put on repeat
Put on repeat, put on repeat
(Put on re-, put on re-), put on repeat
Put on repeat (ohh)
