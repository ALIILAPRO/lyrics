		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Life ain't how you pictured it
You're face down in your bed again
Screamin' in your pillow

Life ain't what you thought it'd be
When you were wide-eyed, seventeen
Learnin' how to let go

You're alright sometimes

Grass won't grow and the stars won't shine
Smoke all day but you don't get high
You can't find the words to say goodbye
Sometimes you get up but you can't get gone
Got a strong hand but you can't hold on
Hey there, tough guy
Even cowboys cry
Even cowboys cry

As you grow, you understand
Everything's just one big scam
Screamin' in your pillow

And you're alright sometimes

Grass won't grow and the stars won't shine
Smoke all day but you don't get high
You can't find the words to say goodbye
Sometimes you get up but you can't get gone
Got a strong hand but you can't hold on
Hey there, tough guy
Even cowboys cry
Even cowboys cry

And you're alright (you're alright)
Sometimes (sometimes)
Yeah, you're alright (yeah, you're alright)
But sometimes

The grass won't grow and the stars won't shine
Smoke all day but you don't get high
Hey there, tough guy
