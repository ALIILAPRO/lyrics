		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I I watch it fall apart
Just when I seem to
Pick up the pieces

No no I can't laugh this time
Turn up the TV
White noise I need it

I ring around the roses
Holding on, holding on
Current take me back
Current take me back

Disappearing slowly
Had enough, had enough
Current take me back
Current take me back

Lonely face where have you gone
I feel so far from home
The only thing I know

Is that I got lost
And I got questions why
This hurt I feel inside
Is becoming magnified

Feeling like ooh, ooh, yeah
Becoming magnified
Feeling like ooh, ooh, yeah
Becoming magnified

Sink or swim I made the jump
Into the water
Into the fire

Could my weakness be myself
My isolation
Is my sedation

I ring around the roses
Holding on, holding on
Current take me back
Current take me back

Disappearing slowly
Had enough, had enough
Current take me back
Current take me back

Lonely face where have you gone
I feel so far from home
The only thing I know

Is that I got lost
And I got questions why
This hurt I feel inside
Is becoming magnified

Holding on, holding
Current take me back
Current take me back
Had enough, had enough
Current take me back
Current take me back

Lonely face where have you gone
I feel so far from home
The only thing I know
Is that I got lost
And I got questions why
This hurt I feel inside
Is becoming magnified
