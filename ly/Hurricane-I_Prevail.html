		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me I was never good enough
Remind me of the demons that I've been running from
Tell me who the hell you thought I was
Or just blame it on the person, the person I've become

Lately, I don't give a fuck
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone
Maybe, I'm already gone
I'll never be the same

It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me

Tell me that I'm lost inside my mind
(I reach out but it's pulling me under)
Remind me I've been searching for something I won't find
Tell me I was never worth the time
(I reach out but it's pulling me under)
Or just blame it on the person you think I left behind

Lately, I don't give a fuck
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone
Maybe, I'm already gone
I'll never be the same

It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane (hurricane)
It hit me like a tidal wave (tidal wave)
And I don't know why I drown my mind it got the best of me

With your life on the line
Ready to die for something
When you're at the divide
And you're down to nothing
Look into my eyes
Believe me that the storm is coming

Believe me that the storm is coming
Down, down, down
It's coming down

It hit me like a hurricane
It hit me like a tidal wave
And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say
It hit me like a hurricane (hurricane)
It hit me like a tidal wave (tidal wave)
And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me

It's coming down, down
Believe me that the storm is coming down

Lately, I don't give a fuck
'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone
And maybe, I'm already gone
