		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's just something different about that funky wizard smoke
Could be the texture
Possibly the aroma
Or maybe it's just the feel (oh, oh, yeah)

If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, uh, yeah)

Pull up on the light, window tinted (nice)
Balls to the walls, says she can feel it
Buy it outright, never rent it (wow)
Patent leather where I'm sitted (damn)
One day boy got a crew and a life
Now I fly right by, get blessed on the flight
And this is the thing they say so priceless
Jewelery still on, they chill through the ride
Aw man, don't stress me, Lord
Keep it all together, so focused on reply
Can not stop or stop, I got the money on the ceilin'
Know you fuckers couldn't believe the nigga so nice
Chains so heavy, I be prayin' for the many (yeah)
My family don't lie, and I gotta keep prayin'
I be hearin' what I'm sayin', too blessed, huh

If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, uh, yeah)

Flyin' 'round with God's eyes, so enlightened
I pray so long that I find, He keeps a human home
Searched so long I realized, never quit inside
All in on a mission ride, angels got me, oh

Niggas thought I was bullshittin' (They did)
When I left home, now they feel dickish
Took it way back to the beginning (Really)
A Kid Named Cudi, shit was hittin'
Too many nights had tears in my eyes
I lay wide awake in the evenin' 'til light
And this is the thing they say so priceless
Sad don't last, that's what she write
Aw, man, I traveled the world
And I felt like I still ain't see shit
Got so much that a nigga wanna do
I'ma show you how to really get down (it's lit)
And, and I'm prayin', I'm thankin' the line
The world keep healin' me, the wall keep savin' me to the best time

If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, yeah)
If you got some cash, let's go
If you got that swag, let's go (uh, uh, uh, yeah)

Flyin' 'round with God's eyes, so enlightened
I pray so long that I find, He keeps a human home
Searched so long I realized, never quit inside
All in on a mission ride, angels got me, oh
