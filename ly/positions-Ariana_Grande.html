		<p>
		  Heaven sent you to me
I'm just hoping I don't repeat history

Boy, I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (ah)
Never need no (no), no one else, babe
'Cause I'll be

Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for

Perfect, perfect
You're too good to be true (you're too good to be true)
But I get tired of runnin'
Fuck it, now I'm runnin' with you, with you

Said, boy I'm tryna meet your mama on a Sunday
Then make a lotta love on a Monday (ah)
Never need no (no), no one else, babe
'Cause I'll be

Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you

This some shit that I usually don't do (yeah)
But for you I kinda, kinda want to
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too (and I'm down too)
Yeah, I'm down too
Switchin' them positions for you
This some shit that I (yeah) usually don't do (don't do)
But for you I kinda, kinda want to
'Cause you're down for me and I'm down too

Switchin' them positions for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you
Cookin' in the kitchen and I'm in the bedroom
I'm in the Olympics, way I'm jumping through hoops
Know my love infinite, nothin' I wouldn't do
That I won't do, switchin' for you

Yeah
Ah, yeah
Ah, yeah
