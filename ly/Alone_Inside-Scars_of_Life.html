		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to think that you were the best thing for me
I must be blind
Because I feel so helpless and hopeless
We close ourselves off from the world outside

Everything is gone that was between us
The world around us, and I don't mind
And this part of you is dead within me
I don't want you, I'm alone inside

I used to think the views we shared were common
I know you lied
This part of me that lives within you
Kill me quickly let the pain subside

Face down, with no place to hide..and my eyes burn
Because I'm alone inside.
