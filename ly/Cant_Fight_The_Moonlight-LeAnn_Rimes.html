		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Under a lovers' sky
Gonna be with you
And no one's gonna be around
If you think that you won't fall
Well, just wait until
'Til the sun goes down

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It'll steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight
No (no), you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart

There's no escape from love
Once a gentle breeze (once a gentle breeze)
Weaves its spell upon your heart
No matter what you think
It won't be too long (not too long)
'Til you're in my arms
Underneath the starlight, starlight
We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right
Feel it steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart
But you know
But you know that you cant, can't fight the moonlight
No (no), you can't fight it (no)
No (no) matter what you do (no matter what you do)
The night is gonna get to you

Don't try 
You're never gonna win, oh

Underneath the starlight, starlight
There's a magical feeling, so right
It will steal your heart tonight

You can try to resist (you can try)
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know 
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight (you know that you)
Deep in the dark (deep in the dark)
You'll surrender your heart
But you know
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it

You can try to resist (you can try to resist my kiss)
Try to hide from my kiss
But you know
(Don't you know that you can't) can't fight the moonlight 
Deep in the dark
You'll surrender your heart (surrender your heart)
But you know
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight
No, you can't fight it
It's gonna get to your heart
