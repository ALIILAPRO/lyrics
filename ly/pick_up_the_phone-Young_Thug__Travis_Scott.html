		<p>
		  Yeah, oh, yeah
Ooh, Thugger, yeah
Yeah, Travis Scott
Thugger, Thugger baby
Yeah

I pour a four up
I call your hoe up (yeah)
Just to fuck her and show her (just to fuck her)
I just went, got my dough up (I just went got my dough up)
Pullin' off and I'm gone (skrrt, skrrt)
Then I go and pour four up (then I go and up a four)
Then I roll up that roll up (roll up, roll up)
Then I'm callin' your hoe up (callin' your hoe up)
(Like, brrt)

Pick up the phone, baby, ooh (like, brrt)
I know you're home, baby, ooh (it's lit)
I'm in the zone, baby (zoned out, straight up)
I just poured up a four, baby (pour it up, yeah, yeah)

Never will I cheat on you (yeah)
Never will I commit treason
Blowin' a bag on you (yeah)
Do all of that for no reason
I'ma pull up MR2 (ooh, yeah)
Hittin' the block and I'm bleedin'
Throwin' that Rollie on you
I like the way it be freezin' (brr)

Pick up the phone, baby, ooh (like, brrt)
I know you're home, baby, ooh (it's lit)
I'm in the zone, baby (zoned out, straight up)
I just poured up a four, baby (pour it up, yeah, yeah)

Pour up a four of that Actavis (Act')
Lean like my mothafuckin' granny did (woo)
Super Bowl ring with big body Benz (hey)
I stacked it up, now I'm just better livin' (cash)
Got screws in my mouth, I'm just preppin' it (ha)
I'm fuckin' this cash, I'm not celibate (ha)
I'm packin' it up like a reverend (whoa)
I need all this cash, I got hella kids (woo)
I'ma play dumb and get left in the middle (yeah, yeah)
Back the fuck up, you too little (whoa, whoa)
Hit 'em with three like I'm Miller (yeah, yeah)
I don't talk to no man in the middle (uh-uh)
I don't talk to no man, I'm just kiddin' (I swear)
But I did pay my sister's tuition (woo)
I feel lucky, I should play the lottery (yeah)
Walkin' off with it like Sonny Liston (whoa)
Mama told me I'm her brightest star (yeah)
Mama told me don't hate on the law (ow)
Because everybody got a job (what?)
Because everybody won't be a star (real shit, real shit)
Please believe every motherfucker around here wan' be a part (swear, swear, swear)
She gon' do anything in her power to be with ya' boy (like, brrt)

Pick up the phone, baby, ooh (like, brrt)
I know you're home, baby, ooh (it's lit)
I'm in the zone, baby (zoned out, straight up)
I just poured up a four, baby (pour it up, yeah, yeah)

Never will I cheat on you
Never will I commit treason
Blowin' a bag on you
Do all of that for no reason
I'ma pull up MR2
Hittin' the block and I'm bleedin'
Throwin' that Rollie on you (ayy, ayy)
I like the way you be freezin' (Quavo)

Pick up the phone
Macaulay Culkin' baby, Home Alone (home Alone)
I thought I was right
Then I had to man up, I was wrong (I was wrong)
I hate when we fight (hate)
She in love with the pipe (pipe)
I draped her up in ice, I pour my four on ice
Birds in the trap sing Brian McKnight
Percocet and Codeine please don't take my life
She had a dream with Celine
So I bought it twice (Celine)
Young nigga make it right back tonight
Girl you're so cute and your ass is nice
Drinkin' on four and I'm shootin' dice
Wrist polar bear, Klondike
And I'm lovin' all races (all races)
Hell nah, don't discriminize (no)
Drinkin' on clean, sanitize
Ostritch seats with the frog eyes (skrrt)
If I ever call your phone, baby
Best believe it's only one time (brrt)

Pick up the phone, baby, ooh (like, brrt)
I know you're home, baby, ooh (it's lit)
I'm in the zone, baby (zoned out, straight up)
I just poured up a four, baby (pour it up, yeah, yeah)

Never will I cheat on you
Never will I commit treason
Blowin' a bag on you
Do all of that for no reason
I'ma pull up and murk too
Hittin' the block and I'm bleedin'
Throwin' that Rollie on you
I like the way you be freezin' (like, brrt)

Pick up the phone, baby (like, brrt)
(Like, brrt)
I'm in the zone, baby
Pick up the phone, baby (like, brrt)
(Like, brrt)
I'm in the zone, baby
