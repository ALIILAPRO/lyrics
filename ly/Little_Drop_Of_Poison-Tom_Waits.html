		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I like my town with a little drop of poison
Nobody knows, they're lining up to go insane
I'm all alone, I smoke my friends down to the filter
But I feel much cleaner after it rains

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

Did the Devil make the world while God was sleeping
You'll never get a wish from a bone
Another wrong goodbye and a hundred sailors
That deep blue sky is my home

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

A rat always knows when he's in with weasels
Here you lose a little every day
Well, I remember when a million was a million
They all have ways to make you pay

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison

And she left in the fall, that's her picture on the wall
She always had that little drop of poison
