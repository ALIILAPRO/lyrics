		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I scream? Yeah
We lack the motion to move to the new beat
Woo
We lack the motion to move to the new beat

It's here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it
If we can afford the luxury of turning our heads if we can
(If we can, if we can, if we can)
Adjust that thousand dollar smile and behold the creation of man
Great words won't cover ugly actions
Good frames won't save bad paintings

Woo
We lack the motion to move to the new beat, yeah
We lack motion

When the day is over, hey, the doors are locked on us
Money buys the access and we can't pay the cost
How can we expect anyone to listen if we're using the same old voice?
We need new noise, new art for the real people

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading
We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not, we're not
Leading

We dance (all the wrong songs)
We enjoy (all the wrong moves)
We dance (all the wrong songs)
We dance (all the wrong songs)
We enjoy (all the wrong moves)
We dance (all the wrong songs)

Here we go

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading, yeah, yeah, yeah

The new beat, the new beat, the new beat, the new beat
The new beat, the new beat, the new beat, the new beat
The new beat, the new beat, the new beat, the new beat
The new beat, the new beat, the new beat, the new beat
Thank you
