		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Dreamy night, morning sun
Breezes blow, rain's come
Feeling the moment
Hmm

You put the sun into my day
And bring a smile on my face
Every time I see you

I see a bird flying in the sky
When you're sitting right next to me
And the wind starts to sing
It makes my day, don't you see

I hear the silence calling me
Only you could see the way I feel
I never knew you were the one
When I close my eyes
You take me to your world
To your home

내 어깨를 스치는
떨리던 숨소리
보이는 듯해
마주한 너의 얼굴
웃음 뒤에 서 있는 넌
오늘도 나의 맘에
이렇게 인사를 해

I hear the silence calling me
Only you could see the way I feel
I never knew you were the one
When I close my eyes
You take me to your world

You light up my life
And bring me home
I wish I met you earlier
When I close my eyes
You take me to your world
To your home

To your home
Hmm
To your home
