		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Won't walk the earth a specter
Won't hold my tongue from lashing out
This is my writ of honor
Drawn by the blood that I have shed
The beasts will soon assemble
Conjoining in their putrid flesh
Their hearts don't beat desire
They pump violence and poison

Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Death's embracing, all is ending
Death's embracing, all is ending

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing
Down

The monsters walk among us
Leeching the blood out from what's good
Infecting at transmission
Swallowing innocence from life
Our time has come to stand forth
The wretched womb from which they feed
Behold the loathsome demons
Send them into the hell they made

Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Flesh opens up, blood's retreating
Death's embracing, all is ending
Death's embracing, all is ending

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing
Down on your face, ripping your veins out
Your insides win and kill you from within

And the seas will rise as serpents
Spawned from the mouth of earth's surface
Soon the skies will fall fast, burning
Open wide and eat the suffering

The pulse is now quickening
Softly, it's painstaking
Look within to calm the storm
Raging inside the form

There's no turning back

For I'm witness to the changing

Take all you have brought to sacrifice
For you will lose much more
If you succeed in this battle
You still will lose so much more

The pulse is now quickening
Softly, it's painstaking
Look within to calm the storm
Raging inside the form

There's no turning back

For I'm witness to the changing

Take all you have brought to sacrifice
For you will lose much more
If you succeed in this battle
You still will lose so much more

Time has come to face all evil

Time has come to face all evil

Time has come to face all evil

Time has come to face all evil

Now the seas rise up as serpents
Spawned from the mouth of earth's surface
As the skies now fall fast burning
Open wide and face the suffering

The inferno spews out hell's horde
Casting the flames upon our world
As death eclipses all the light
We make our last stand, 'til death: fight

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing

Time will not heal all of your pain
I cannot wait for it all to come crashing
Down on your face, ripping your veins out
Your insides win and kill you from within
