		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

Now it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Somewhere darker
Talkin' the same shite
I need a partner (high)
Well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And havin' bad ideas

Now it's three in the mornin'
And I'm tryna change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message you reply (message you reply)
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
(Why'd you only call me when you're) high?
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

And I can't see you here, wonder where I might
It sort of feels like I'm runnin' out of time
I haven't found what I was hopin' to find
You said you gotta be up in the morning
Gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?
