		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, I wanna touch you
I wanna breathe into your will
See, I gotta hunt you
I gotta bring you to my hell
Baby, I wanna fuck you
I wanna feel you in my bones
Boy, I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna tear into your soul

Desire, I'm hungry
And I hope you feed me
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?

Honey, I wanna break you
I wanna throw you to the hounds
Yeah, I gotta hurt you
I gotta hear it from your mouth
Boy, I wanna taste you
I wanna skin you with my tongue
I'm gonna kill you
I'm gonna lay you in the ground

Desire, I'm hungry
And I hope you feed me
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?

I wanna feel you, I want it all
I wanna feel you, I want it all

How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
How do you want me, how do you want me?
