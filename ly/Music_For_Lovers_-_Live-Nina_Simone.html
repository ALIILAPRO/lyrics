		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the sound
Of a sigh.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of a child.
When the whole world discovers
That love's the only thing worthwhile.
Then there'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.

In the willow tree
Made for you and me
There's a silver symphony of birds.
When the poets rhyme
In the summer time
You'll hear melodies
In the words.

There is music for lovers
It to be found
In the stream
Running wild.
And there's music for lovers
In the hush-a-bye dreams
Of you child.
When the whole world discovers
That love is the only thing worthwhile
There'll be music for everyone
And the whole world will smile.
