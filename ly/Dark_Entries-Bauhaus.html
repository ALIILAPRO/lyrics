		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Caressing bent up to the jug again 
With sheathes and pills 
Invading all those stills 
In a hovel of a bed 

I will scream in vain 
"Oh, please Miss Lane
Leave me with some pain "

Went walking through this city's neon lights 
In fear of disguising my warping, seething 
Pressure lines, among confidant heirs
Intangible of price 
Trying so hard to find what? What was right 

I came upon your room it stuck into my head (dark entries)
We leapt into the bed degrading even lice 
You took delight in taking down 
My shielded pride 

Until exposed became my darker side 
Puckering up and down those avenues of sin 
Too cheap to ride, they're worth a try 
If only for the old times, cold times 
Don't go waving your pretentious love 

He's soliciting on his tan brown brogues (dark entries, dark entries)
Gyrating through some lonesome devils row (dark entries, dark entries)
Pinpointing well meaning upper class prey (dark entries, dark entries)
Of walking money checks possessing holes (dark entries, dark entries)
He sleekly offers his services (dark entries, dark entries)
Exploitation of his finer years (dark entries, dark entries)
Work with loosely woven fabrics (dark entries, dark entries)
Of lonely office clerks (dark entries, dark entries)
Any lay suffices his eye (dark entries, dark entries)

I came upon your room it stuck into my head
We leapt into the bed degrading even lice
You took delight in taking down
My shielded pride
Until exposed became my darker side

Puckering up and down some avenue of sin
Too cheap to ride they're worth a try
If only for the old times
Don't go waving your pretentious love
