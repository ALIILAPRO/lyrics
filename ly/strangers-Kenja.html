		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Leave me in the dark
I promise I'll be fine
I will fall apart but I'll pick myself up in time
And maybe healing starts
At the end of the line
And I'll forget how nice it felt when I could call you mine

And I will mend my heart
And I will redefine
What love will mean to me and if it's something worth retrying
And I'll meet someone new
And they will love me kind
And you'll just be a memory living vaguely in my mind

And you'll regret you ever met me
And you'll move on and live your life
And soon enough you will forget me
And we will just be strangers in your eyes

And I'd come back if you'd had let me
But I bet it would end the same
And God I hate the way we left things
But I'm sure there is love that still remains

Someday I'll awake and feel good in my skin
Cause I won't feel like yours
That is where we'll end and I'll begin
Pleased to be alone and free to introspect
and only think for me
Like I don't ever wonder how you've been

And I will reminisce
The way you used to feel
Till I forget your kiss
How I believed that love was real
And when you come to mind
I won't feel any pain
We leave our love behind, but still your memory remains
And when I hear your voice
I won't feel anything
Like any other noise it plays without the suffering
And when I read your name
I'll feel a lesser sting
And I'll forgive my blame when I think back on everything

And I'll forget you ever met me
And you'll move on and live your life
And soon enough you will forget me
And we will just be strangers in your eyes

And I'll forget you ever met me
And I'll move on and live my life
And I will go and you will let me
'Til we're nothing but strangers in our eyes
