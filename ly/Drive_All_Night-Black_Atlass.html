		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You've been working all weekend while he's running up your accounts
You don't even know the amount
Probably twenty racks by now
And he's laid up in your living room
Smoking all day on your couch
You keep fantasizing about the day that you kick him out of the house
And you know that I've got you
Day or night I'll be right there when you want to
Take a ride down to L.A. to the beach side at my house
Any time all night or day you hit me up and
We can just drive all night long
And listen to the radio
Until you forget his name
Yeah baby you've got me till dawn
I won't steer you wrong
Just let me take away your pain
Yeah tell him you've been getting some
And when he finds out where from
He ain't coming back no
Yeah he can get where he's going
And I'll be along
So we can ride down to Santa Fe
Take a weekend and rebound
Any time all night or day you hit me up and
We can just drive all night long
And listen to the radio
Until you forget his name
Yeah baby you've got me till dawn
I won't steer you wrong
Just let me take away your pain
