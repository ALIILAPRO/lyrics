		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wish I knew how
It would feel to be free
I wish I could break
All the chains holding me
I wish I could say
All the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear
For the whole round world to hear

I wish I could share
All the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars
That keep us apart
I wish you could know
What it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree
That every man should be free

I wish I could give
All I'm longin' to give
I wish I could live
Like I'm longin' to live
I wish I could do
All the things that I can do
And though I'm way over due
I'd be starting anew

Well I wish I could be 
Like a bird in the sky
How sweet it would be
If I found I could fly
Oh I'd soar to the sun
And look down at the sea

Then I'd sing 'cause I know, yeah
Then I'd sing 'cause I know, yeah
Then I'd sing 'cause I know 
I'd know how it feels
Oh, I know how it feels to be free
Yeah, yeah, oh, I know how it feels

Yes, I know, oh, I know
How it feels
How it feels
To be free, Lord, Lord, Lord
