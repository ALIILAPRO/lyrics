		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So this is where I am
Hangin' on a feelin'
Driving through the valley just to chase the pain again
So this is where we are
I should've seen it comin'
Every time you say, "Goodbye," I say, "Hello" again

I cried in your dark brown eyes for the thousandth time
Did you love somebody?
I died when you left that night for the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody else
I tried to stop the door as it was closin', it was closin'
Can't help the way I keep ignorin' every omen, every omen
Heaven knows I should let go
It's nothin' that I don't already know

I kiss you on your neck (oh-na-na)
You were starin' at the ceiling (oh-na-na)
I shoulda known right then and there you were a runaway (oh-na-na)
Oh, just make it go away (oh-na-na)
Can you help me rearrange it? (Oh-na-na)
I'm still makin' sense of havin' nothin' left to say (oh-na-na)

I cried in your dark brown eyes for the thousandth time
Did you love somebody?
I died when you left that night for the thousandth time
'Cause you love somebody else
I tried to stop the door as it was closin', it was closin'
Can't help the way I keep ignorin' every omen, every omen
Heaven knows I should let go
It's nothin' that I don't already know

We go 'round again, you jump back in bed
That's what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens, I look right through them
That's what you do when you love somebody
We go 'round again, we jump back in bed
That's what you do when you love somebody
These bad omens, I look right through them
That's what you do when you love somebody

Else (when you love somebody)
Else (when you love somebody)
