		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All the things she said [2x]
Running through my head [3x]
All the things she said [2x]
Running through my head [2x]
All the things she said
This is not enough [2x]

I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
If I'm asking for help, it's only because
Being with you has opened my eyes
Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?

I keep asking myself, wondering how
I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out
Want to fly to a place where it's just you and me
Nobody else so we can be free [2x]

All the things she said [2x]
Running through my head [3x]
All the things she said [2x]
Running through my head [2x]
All the things she said
This is not enough [2x]
All the things she said [2x]

Head, all the things said
Running through my
[8x]

All the things she said [2x]
Running through my head [3x]
All the things she said [2x]
Running through my head [2x]
All the things she said
This is not enough [2x]

Head, all the things said
Running through my
[4x]

(Head, all the things said) [4x]

All the things she said [2x]
Running through my

Head, all the things said
Running through my
[4x]

All the things she said [2x]
Running through my
Head, all the things said
Running through my
All the things she said [2x]
Running through my

This is not enough [2x]
