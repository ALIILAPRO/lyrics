		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I won't tell you I'm lonely
'Cause it might be selfish
I won't ask you to hold me
'Cause that won't mend what's helpless

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing
For your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh, when did you fall out of love?
Out of love
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

I can't float in an ocean
That's already been drained
I won't cry at your feet now
I know my tears will fall in vain

There's not a thing I could say
Not a song I could sing
For your mind to change
Nothing can fill up the space
Won't ask you to stay
But let me ask you one thing

Oh, when did you fall out of love?
Out of love
Oh, when did you fall out of love with me?

No use wondering
While your change in heart has wandered
So I ask you this question
'Cause it might help me sleep longer

Oh, when did you fall out of love?
Out of love
Oh, when did you run out of love for me?
Out of love (out of love)
Out of love (out of love)
Out of love with me
