		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up and hit the lotto
(Lotto) , whip swerve
Twenty bad ones like a brothel
(Brothel) , whip swerve
And my new crib is colossal
('Lossal) , whip swerve
And my new bitch is colossal
('Lossal) , whip swerve

(Woah, woah)

I want some top, ayy
(Top) , so I park lot, ayy (Lot)
I need to scoop
(Scoop) , all my friends are some thots
Ayy (Thots) fuckin' robots, ayy
(Woah) , love me or not, ayy (yeah)
She come around, ayy
(Woah) , she whip the drop, ayy (yeah)
I keep the heater on me, night stand
Don't tell my bitch or my bands
(Ayy, wake up)
Ayy, whip the foreign with my Dyson
I crack two foreigns, that's exciting
(That's exciting, woah, yeah)

I woke up and hit the lotto
(Lotto) , whip swerve
Twenty bad ones like a brothel
(Brothel) , whip swerve
And my new crib is colossal
('Lossal) , whip swerve
And my new bitch is colossal
('Lossal) , whip swerve

Your opinions, they don't make me rich
