		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Is anybody home upstairs? 
It's been a shitty night 
If I'm honest, I'm a little scared
And a bit too high

Oh, I'm in a dark haze 
But you will never know 
What it's like in the shadows 
You say I'm bound for miserable 

So tell me how I'm meant to feel 
I'm dying to get out of here 
Ah, ah
I wish I was a shooting star 
I'd burn out as the world admired 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah 

Will anybody ever care?
As much as they don't
The universe seems unfair 
Maybe mine is broke 

Oh, I'm in a dark haze 
But you will never know 
What it's like in the shadows 
You say I'm bound for miserable
So tell me how I'm meant to feel 
I'm dying to get out of here 
Ah, ah
I wish I was a shooting star 
Burn out as the world admired 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Oh 
Oh (take me in from the night)
What I'd give to feel the light 
One taste of what it's like 
Burn out and never die 
Oh (take me in from the night)
What I'd give to feel the light 
One taste of what it's like 
Burn out and never die 

Is anybody home upstairs? 
It's been a shitty night
