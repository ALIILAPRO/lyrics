		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The sun leaves and I'm waving goodbye (but these)
Street lights, they're still shining bright
(Lately) I was getting kinda used to the dark
But it never got too close to my heart (eh, eh, yeah)

But then I saw you walk through the room
(And your) Sweet eyes, they were shining through
(Every) Little corner 'til our eyes would meet
And suddenly it's all I can see

All these complications
Lonely isolations
I can see them fade away

I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that's weighed in gold
I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that's weighed in gold
Weighed in gold
Weighed in gold
It's your love that's weighed in gold
Weighed in gold

I'm done, I'm ready for change
(I got) New shoes and a smile on my face
('Cause I'm) Walking on the sunny side now I'll never leave
Finally I start to breathe

All these complications
Lonely isolations
I can see them fade away

I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that's weighed in gold
I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that's weighed in gold
Weighed in gold, oh, whoa
Weighed in gold
It's your love that's weighed in gold
Weighed in gold

Weighted in gold, weighted in gold, weighted in gold
It's your love that is weighed in gold
I can feel the sunshine in my life
I'm just a little happier by your side
Hold my hand when I need you the most
It's your love that's weighed in gold
Weighed in gold
