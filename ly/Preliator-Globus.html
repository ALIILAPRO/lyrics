		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Kneel, in silence, alone,
My spirit bears me
Pray, for guidance, towards home
In darkest hours

Kneel (dream with your dream we travel)
In Silence (empires of faith unravel)
Alone (sealed with our virtues' treasures)
Kingdoms falling 

Down (whose hand commands this thunder?)
In silence (cry as we're torn asunder)
Alone (unto what gods do I call?)
Protects us in our

Fall, away
My soul wandered,
Borne by grace
I flew on high! Sheltered
From this thunder
Calling heaven

Take me away from time and season
Far, far away we'll sing with reason
Prepare our throne of stars above me
As the world once known will leave me

Take me away upon a plateau
Far, far away from fears and shadow
Strengthen my heart in times of sorrow
Light the way to bright tomorrows

Answer our call in desperate hours
Shelter our fall from earthly powers
Temper our souls with flame and furnace
Bear us toward a noble purpose

Heaven hides nothing in it's measure
Mortal men blinded by false treasure
Formless and vanquished we shall travel
Shield and sword will guide our battle

Take me away from time and season
Far, far away we'll sing with reason
Prepare a throne of stars above me
As the world once known will leave me

Take me away upon a plateau
Far, far away from fears and shadow
Strengthen my heart in times of sorrow
Light the way to bright tomorrows

Heaven hides nothing in its measure
Mortal men blinded by false treasure
Formless and vanquished we shall travel
Shield and faith will guide our battle

Salvation comes in desperate hours
Angels on high proclaim these powers
Lead us from chaos we shall follow
Bear us to a bright tomorrow
