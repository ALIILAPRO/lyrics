		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it
He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it

Big snack, Big Mac, hit him with the cardiac, mm-hmm
Light work, snap back, yeah, he loving that, mm-hmm
Drive-thru, take away, he can get it any day, mm-hmm
Order, co-collection but you know he finna stay, mm-hmm

He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it
He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it

Hands on my breast, hands on my breast, do it
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
Hands on my breast, hands on my breast, do it
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it

Oh, hands on my ass and my breast
Graduation pussy, wanna put me to the test
Got a new girl but he still tell me I'm the best (number one)
If you're first place, never worry about the rest (yes)
I'm known to shut a bitch down (shut it down)
I can take a break 'cause nobody fits my crown (fits my crown)
Talk when I'm away, zip it up when I'm around
She think she got jokes, guess it's really giving clown (ow)
I look like an angel but I'm known to give 'em hell
With you it was a secret, but with me, he's gonna tell
Thought you said that was your boyfriend, why he blowin' up my cell? (Uh)
Yeah, they gotta see me shinin', tell my haters wish 'em well (yeah)

He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I told him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it, ayy
He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it

He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it

Peri Peri, too hot to handle
Better get a piece, I'm a real handful
Too slick with it, always on call
Links for days, boys, girls, got 'em all
Too choosy, never sekkle down
I like what I like, yeah, I pick the best around
International (international), flights out
Touch down, hit me when you're back in town

He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it
He told me, "Nike, just do it"
Hands on my breast and my batty like he knew it
I tell him, "Lay the pipe" and he blew it
He tell me what he like, nothing to it
