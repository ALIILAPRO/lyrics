		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah, yeah

I know my wrist be dancing crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's fuck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

200k and VVS, yellow diamonds
They wanna run up but they won't ever find me
Sleep right next to the F&N, motherfucker the government
Shut down all the plottin'
One hundred bands on my body
Fuck with them boys, touch a body
Lil mama just want my pocket
'Rari take off like a rocket
Hold up, you too close (too close)
I don't know, I don't know ya
Had to run it, run it up
How I will roll, I will roll ya
It's like after you pop off
They all act like they know ya
And Young Post be like Pablo
And they all love to blow yeah, yeah

I know my wrist be dancing crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's fuck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

Two hundred, swerving, dipping, dodge on the highway
You may contain me but you won't ever stop me
On her way to my residence
Try message your boo again
She pullin' up probably
Yeah, strally inside of that Benz
Yeah, come take a tatt on my belly
Yeah, people acting too friendly man
They tryna get dividends
This shit is a problem
Yeah, you just be talking shit but ain't ever met me
DeChino fucked your bitch and now you resent me
I know them people but they don't represent me
Them wastemen, we gon' make 'em all pay
They will never stop the plan
Eighty jumping off my hand
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie
Bust it open
Holy moly

I know my wrist be dancing crazy
Been on some fly shit lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's fuck you, pay me
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my mama raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

Oh, oh, oh, oh, woahh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woahh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woahh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
