		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Four to the floor, I was sure
That you would be my girl
We'd rent our little world
Have a little girl

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah (I could have it all)
Ah, ah, ah (if only you were here)

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Four to the floor, I was sure
Never seeing clear
I could have it all
If only you were here

Four to the floor, I was sure
That you would be my girl
We'd rent our little world
Have a little girl

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah (I could have it all)
Ah, ah, ah (if only you were here)
