		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's like it was yesterday
I was a praying for a miracle
Scared to have a little hope
And now looking back today
Seeing all the things You've done
I can't even add them up

One, two, three up to infinity
I'd run out of numbers
Before I could thank You for everything

God, I'm still counting my blessings
For all that You've done in my life
The more that I look in the details
The more of Your goodness I find
Father on this side of heaven
I know that I'll run out of time
But I will keep counting my blessings
Knowing I can't count that high

And I know that seasons never last forever
So, God I will remember all of the reasons
My heart has to be grateful
All the times You've been faithful to me

God, I'm still counting my blessings
For all that You've done in my life
The more that I look in the details
The more of Your goodness I find
Father on this side of heaven
I know that I'll run out of time
But I will keep counting my blessings
Knowing I can't count that high

Oh, I can't count that high
High, oh, high
Oh, Your goodness, Your goodness

One, two, three up to infinity
I'd run out of numbers
Before I could thank You for everything

God, I'm still counting my blessings
For all that You've done in my life
The more that I look in the details (the details)
The more of Your goodness I find
Father on this side of heaven
I know that I'll run out of time
But I will keep counting my blessings
Knowing I can't count that high
I will keep counting my blessings
Knowing I can't count that high
