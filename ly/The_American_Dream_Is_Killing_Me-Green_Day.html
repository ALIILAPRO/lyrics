		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The American Dream is killing me
The American Dream is killing me
When it's all double-talk of conspiracy
The American Dream is killing me

Send out an S.O.S
It's getting serious
Bulldoze your family home
Now it's a condo

We are not home
Are we not home?
Goddamn, I am so grateful
Forever faithful to

The American Dream is killing me
The American Dream is killing me

People on the street
Unemployed and obsolete
Did you ever learn to read the ransom note?

Don't want no huddled masses
TikTok and taxes
Under the overpass
Sleeping in broken glass

We are not well
Are we not well?
Cracked up into the wild
We're pedophiles for

The American Dream is killing me
The American Dream is killing me
When it's all double-talk of insanity
The American Dream is killing me
Say

From sea to shining sea
Whitewashed upon the beach
My country under siege
On private property

We are not home
Are we not home?
Kiss me, I'm dead inside
Who needs suicide when

The American Dream is killing me
The American Dream is killing me
When it's double-talk of insanity
The American Dream is killing me
