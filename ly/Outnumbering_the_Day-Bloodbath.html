		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've had one desire since I was born
To see my body ripped and torn
To see my flesh devoured before my eyes
I'm here for you I volunteer as a human sacrifice

[Chorus]
Carve me up, slice me apart
Suck my guts, lick my heart
Chop me up I like to be hurt
Drink my marrow and blood for dessert
Eaten, my one desire, my only wish is to be
Eaten, the longer I live the more I'm dying to feel the pain
Eaten, I would do anything to be
Eaten, my one desire, my only wish is to be
Eaten,

I finally found you, my personal slaughter
As an appetizer, I let you taste my daughter
Call me sick but this is what I need
My only purpose here is for you to feed

Desecrate me
Tear me limb from limb
Eviscerate me
Chew me to death
