		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I had I dream I was a vigilante sidekick
My name is Tim I'm a lesser known character
I had a dream I was a vigilante sidekick
Fighting crime in the streets together

Down in Oakland
Off of west grand,
St Joseph relief
A program

A good place were good people get food,
Help your fellow man is a good thing to do
Government agency said
Be afraid of me,
I shut your doors down it won't phase me
Wolverine came through left
The agent for dead, opened up the doors
Back up everyone was fed

Do not bill the abandoned buildings,
It's nice to sleep when you've got a ceiling.
Neighborhood watch said we gotta put a stop,
Can't have people livin' for free call the cops. 

Here comes the SWAT team, and the M-16,
Shoot the walls in, destroy the building.
Wolverine was sad and it made him mad,
Every single cop got a bullet in the head.
