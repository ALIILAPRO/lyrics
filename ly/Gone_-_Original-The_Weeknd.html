		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ooh, oh why, oh why
Ooh, oh why, oh why

Got you (oh, yeah, yeah)
I got a hold of you (oh yeah, ooh whoa)
You said you out to see
How we roll
Well, then take a seat (ooh yeah)
Oh, take a seat
And watch your ass go

Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it, baby
Don't you worry, you gotta keep up

'Cause I've been gone (uh), I've been gone, ay
I've been gone, ay, I've been gone, ooh

Goodbye
Why don't you fuck what you heard, baby?
'Cause I been gone
You can see for yourself, little lady
Girl, I lit a little something
Something, something, for you
There's enough to pass around, oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah 

Oh, well just
Break it, drop it, drink it, spill it
Baby, touch your body, body
You gotta taste it, feel it, I've been on it, baby
Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up

'Cause I've been gone, ah
I've been gone, ay, ay
I've been gone, ay, yeah, I've been gone
Oh, I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been gone, ooh
I've been gone, I've been gone, whoa

I've been gone, whoa

Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, oh, ooh whoa

"Hope I make it home"
You'll be thinking, love
I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight
Watch us rock it out
Watch us leave the ground
After the show is done
You can take me to yours
But my lungs so muddy
I love the way it tastes
Drink it 'til I'm ugly, baby
Fuck me while I'm faded
Feel that through my denims
Baby girl, I gotcha
I'm only twenty-one, so I do it when I wanna
Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
Got me feelin' kinda weak
And it's kinda hard to breathe
But you're turning twenty-three, so I'll fuck you if you need
In your birthday suit
I'ma give you what you fiend, oh
But I ain't taking off my black boots, I'm fallin'
'Cause I'm numb from the neck down, I'm sorry
You won't know that I can't feel it
I can win a fuckin' Oscar
By the way I fuckin' hid it
And you'll never fuckin' know
I'll never fuckin' show it
Except when I be wheezy from another cup of potion
Dirty Sprite toastin'
Fast life, fuck slow
Low life for life

Let the meds flow, ooh whoa, let the night flow
I'm so, I'm so gone, let these meds flow, ooh
I'm so gone, oh, let these meds flow
I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Whoa, whoa, oh, ooh whoa
Said I'm gone, gone, gone
Ooh whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh
La, oh, oh
La-la-la, la, la
La-la-la, la, la, oh
La-la-la, la, oh whoa, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
I'm so gone

Gone
