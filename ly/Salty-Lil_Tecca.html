		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Yeah, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

You with it, I'm with it, I'm ballin' regardless
She broken, said, "Fix it," but I ain't the one to be callin'
I ain't tryna talk on that
Already gave you the sauce on cash
Said she want racks on racks on racks
Ain't shit, I been said, "Fall back"
I said I want it, now she on it
I said I walk it how I talk it
Show my face, got a bag, I'm exhausted
They could tell me when they presence is costin'
You out of line, oh, you lost me
Said that I'm tweakin', then inform me
They get a lil' bag, now they saucy
I already made 'em mad, now they salty

Clap for 'em, see they ran it up, need some stamina
And they similar to the other shit that you hearin' 'bout, that you readin' up
Not speedin' up
I don't answer, she don't answer, have my bro call like, "What's up?"
Got a new check, that's what's up
And you been good, that's yessir
I don't even flex for y'all
I might go and flex tomorrow
You ask me, it's "no" today
I'm not sayin' "yes" tomorrow
And I'm feelin' low today
I might feel the best tomorrow
Am I finna go today
I might take your bets tomorrow

You with it, I'm with it, I'm ballin' regardless
She broken, said, "Fix it," but I ain't the one that be callin'
I ain't tryna talk on that
Already gave you the sauce on cash
Said she want racks on racks on racks
Ain't shit, I been said, "Fall back"
I said I want it, now she on it
I said I walk it how I talk it
Show my face, got a bag, I'm exhausted
They could tell me when they presence is costin'
You out of line, oh, you lost me
Said that I'm tweakin', then inform me
They get a lil' bag, now they saucy
I already made 'em mad, now they salty

I don't answer, she don't answer, have my bro call like, "What's up?"
Got a new check, that's what's up
Ayy, clap for 'em, see they ran it up, need some stamina
And they similar to the other shit that you hear about, that you readin' up
