		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm always fucked up in the back of the whip
Gonna go rail another line while saliva roll tha spliff
Stayin out the drama I can't get caught in the mix
But if you talk down on my name u gone get tossed in a ditch
Imma make u suffer
99 tha bone crusher
Masked up menace
Steady huffing air duster
Lighting up a blunt
While I'm rolling up another
I can't feel my face
Got me talkin with a stutter
Imma kill a fuck boy with a butter knife
Smile on my face I stick it in his eye and twist it to the right
5150 cause a mental genocide
Visions from inside cauterize my third eye
Life's a shooting I got a target on my back
Only thing I know is hurt and so I feel like Johnny cash
Yeah I heard your new shit and it really made me laugh
Stupid motherfucka realize that you got lapped
Yung grey addicted to selling smoke
On the
Runway puffing on that jet fuel
I'm gon'
Saut√© the tendons all on my tongue
Feel like
Salt bae I sprinkle em wit my nut
You know
All of my team with the cream and the crop in the yard with a pound for ya broad
Powder all over my face I be looking like funnel cake licking the pot
Flicking the rivet I pivot I'm taking the screw and I dig in her box
Tracking down mailmen until I impale them for taking the pack in the dark
Yall ain't really fucking with Sally G though
Bitch pussy look like a bag full of Cheetos
Feel like Danny with the Brown on my pee hole
Seep through panty I be loving when it leak tho
We got loose screws two goons finna shoot you
Boo boo who you? don't gotta clue clue
Fool move ew ew you in the stu stu
.22 pew pew up in my shoe
