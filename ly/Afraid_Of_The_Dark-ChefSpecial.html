		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a monster under my bed
We pillow talking
Oh, how I long to be its friend
But I don't wanna end up in that same place again

I been doing better, doing better
Been through heavy weather, heavy weather
Never going back, going never
I've been doing better, but I

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on?

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on?
A little light on

Sing another song, come sleepwalk with me till it's dawn
Come sweet talk to me 'til my heart has got nothing but love for the dark
And I wish I was fast asleep, dreaming of my masterpiece
Demons come and dance with me, oh you best believe

There's a monster under my bed
And it grows when I forget

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on?

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on?
A little light on

A little light on

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on?

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on?
A little light on

I've been doing better
Been through heavy weather
Oh, can you leave a little light on?
A little light on
