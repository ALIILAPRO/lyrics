		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Billy, come home and Billy, don't stop
Daddy come home and daddy don't talk
Radio hides a shitty old cop
Maybe I'm high and maybe I'm not
There was sadness coming through to you

Wonder how I caught it
Wonder how it started
Angel in the garden
The razor was sharpened

I don't remember how it happened
Blood filled up the clawfoot bath and
I will fear no frontier
I don't remember how it happened
Blood filled up the clawfoot bath and
I will fear no frontier

Billy, come home and Billy's no punk
Daddy come home and daddy's on junk
Videotape, a fisherman's knot
Filling the tub and waiting for God
There was sadness in the water too

Wonder who will find me
Small stone in the quarry
No one ever told me the end of the story

I don't remember how it happened
Blood filled up the clawfoot bath and
I will fear no frontier
I don't remember how it happened
Blood filled up the clawfoot bath and
I will fear no frontier

Idaho alien
Idaho alien
Idaho alien
Don't cry

Idaho alien
Idaho alien
Idaho alien
Goodbye
