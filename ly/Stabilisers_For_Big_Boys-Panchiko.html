		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Softer, her laughter.
Harder, to see her.
She scares me and gives me the horrors. 
Follows me with her matters.

You’re half the way there, 
do you ever care?
Do you ever think, 
Suckling on a drink?

‘Cuz you’re half the way to me, 
Will you ever see?
Half the way to Earth,
do you feel my worth?

I’ll bathe the angels in blood, cus it’s that time and the month,
I want to worship the sun, don't pull that face when you cum.
You know yourself without truth, because you wasted your youth. 
I wanna do what I please, because they fuck up with ease.

Liar, the father.
Higher, the mother
She scares me, gives me the horrors. 
Follows me with her matters.

You’re half the way there, 
do you ever care?
Do you ever think, 
Suckling on a drink?

Half the way to me, 
Will you ever see? 
Half the way to Earth,
 do you feel my worth?

He wants to prove he can killl, he loves to live with the thrill. 
I wanna keep when I share, I wanna watch when you tear. 
I'll put salt in your wounds, I hope I lighten your mood.
I wanna open the door, and catch you on all fours.
I wanna break you like glass, I wanna do it with class. 
I wanna kiss like a girl, i wanna fuck up your world.
I wanna live like he loves, but it is never enough.
I wanna stand when I fall, cus I'll be taking it all.
