		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

I lick your ice cream (cream, cream, cream)
And you can lick my lollipop pop, pop
I lick your ice cream (cream, cream, cream)
And you can lick my lollipop, pop, pop

It's unbelievable what they say
You don't hear that everyday
Is it really what you got?
Show me that lollipop

I lick your ice cream (cream, cream, cream)
And you can lick my lollipop pop, pop
I lick your ice cream (cream, cream, cream)
And you can lick my lollipop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
My lollipop, your ice cream
We can get straight into it, and do it nicely
My lollipop, your ice cream
We can get straight into it, and do it nicely

It's unbelievable what they say
You don't hear that everyday
Is it really what you got?
Show me that lollipop
It's unbelievable what they say
You don't hear that everyday
Is it really what you got?
Show me that lollipop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

My lips go 'round like that
I lick your lollipop
My lips go 'round like that
I lick your lollipop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop

I lick your ice cream (cream, cream, cream)
And you can lick my lollipop, pop, pop
I lick your ice cream (cream, cream, cream)
And you can lick my (it's unbelievable) lollipop, pop, pop

I Wanna go to the candy shop
Yo, daddy, what you got?
Move closer; baby, don't stop
Give me some of that lollipop

I wanna go to the candy shop
Get me some of that lollipop
Take some of that wrapper off
Take my time and have a good time

I lick your ice cream (don't stop, don't stop, don't stop)
And you can lick my lollipop (your lollipop)
I lick your ice cream (don't stop, don't stop)
And you can lick my lollipop (your lollipop)

I lick your lo-lollipop
You lick my ice cream
I lick your lo-lollipop
You lick my ice cream
