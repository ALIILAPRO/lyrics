		  (The beat go off?) brrt, brrt
Hey, is this Sosa? 
Am I speaking to Sosa right now? (Bang, bang)
Who the fuck is you?
I don't know and I just wanted you to 'xplain some to me (ayy, ayy, what?)
Explain ya ass, nigga

I got some money on the way (brr-brr-brr)
Kill 'em with kindness then piss on they grave (on they grave)
Lil' nigga, don't get hit, don't get grazed (don't get grazed, phew)
I saw a Superman, now you saved (now you saved)
Pussy, before you eat, say your grace (say your grace)
You already know these Bs, they not Js (big Bs)
I got her too high, she think she laced (oh my God)
I be on her head like a lace (lace, ayy)

(Go)
Beaned up (off a bean)
Bottega jeans, I ain't even (I ain't even)
Bottega jeans, I ain't even (I ain't even)
Bottega jeans, I ain't even wear 'em yet (go)
Ain't walkin' in that bitch, they ain't pay me yet (go)
She mad, in the bed like, "You ain't strike me yet" (go)
Geekin' out of state, my DR bitch was Puerto Rican (mm)
Beat these hoes, flew in, we treat a Tuesday like the weekend
Suck me like you mean it, I'ma bless you like a deacon (mm)
'Til a nigga die, I ain't gon' lie, that shit ain't even (mm)
Catch her while she leakin', she gon' absorb all the semen (mm)
Worry 'bout your streamin', all that reachin' leave you bleedin'

I got some money on the way (brr-brr-brr)
Kill 'em with kindness then piss on they grave (on they grave)
Lil' nigga, don't get hit, don't get grazed (don't get grazed, phew)
I saw a Superman, now you saved (now you saved)
Pussy, before you eat, say your grace (say your grace)
You already know these Bs, they not Js (big Bs)
I got her too high, she think she laced (oh my God)
I be on her head like a lace (lace, ayy)

I'm with my crew, win or lose
Yeah, I'm a boss, Terry Crews (Terry Crews)
Them hunnid bands, huh, they Crip blue (Crip blue)
I'm in a Humvee with six troops (with six troops)
What you wanna do? No fist too (no fist too)
Get your bitch a sip of the wrist juice (wrist juice)
Ayy, she meltin' all on my wrist too (brr)
Ayy, but I'm a icy nigga, it's cool (brr)

I got some money on the way (brr-brr-brr)
Kill 'em with kindness then piss on they grave (on they grave)
Lil' nigga, don't get hit, don't get grazed (don't get grazed, phew)
I saw a Superman, now you saved (now you saved)
Pussy, before you eat, say your grace (say your grace)
You already know these Bs, they not Js (big Bs)
I got her too high, she think she laced (oh my God)
I be on her head like a lace (lace)
