		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, oh (oh, oh)
I just wanted you to comfort me
When I called you late last night, you see
I was falling into love
Yes, I was crashing into love
Oh, of all the words you sang to me
About life, the truth and being free
Yeah, you sang to me
Oh, how you sang to me

Girl, I live for how you make me feel
So I question all this being real
'Cause I'm not afraid to love
For the first time, I'm not afraid of love
Oh, this day seems made for you and me
And you showed me what life needs to be
Yeah, you sang to me
Oh, you sang to me

All the while you were in front of me, I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you, this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

Just to think you live inside of me
I had no idea how this could be
Now I'm crazy for your love
Can't believe I'm crazy for your love
The words you said, you sang to me
And you showed me where I want to be
You sang to me
Oh, you sang to me

All the while you were in front of me, I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you, this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

All the while you were in front of me, I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you, this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

All the while you were in front of me, I never realized
I just can't believe I didn't see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
When you sing to me

How I long to hear you sing beneath the clear blue skies
And I promise you, this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it (see it)
I can't believe it (believe it)
Oh, but I feel it (feel it)
