		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where do you think you're going?
Don't you know it's dark outside?
Where do you think you're going?
Don't you care about my pride?

Where do you think you're going?
I thing you don't know
You got no way of knowing
There's really no place you can go

I understand your changes
Long before you reach the door
I know where you think you're going
I know what you came here for

And now I'm sick of joking
I know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going?
I think you better go with me girl

You say there is no reason
But you still find cause to doubt me
If you ain't with me girl
You're gonna be without me

Where do you think you're going?
Don't you know it's dark outside?
Where do you think you're going?
I wish I didn't care about my pride?

And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
Where do you think you're going?
I think you better go with me girl

Come on
