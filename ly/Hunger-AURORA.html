		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been born for sometime
And I got death on my mind
Come on, follow me (ah)
Away from the nightlife
Sleeping in nirvana
And I will long for the gutter
When I'm in your arms (ah)
I long for my freedom (ah)

In many ways we're not the same
But in some ways we are
Looking for something new in the skin of an avatar

All we ever had is hunger
(Hunger, hunger)
All we never get is power
(Hunger, hunger)
Would you ever feel each other?
Eh oh eh oh
(Do we ever have power?)
All ever ever had is hunger
Hunger, oh

Your body is a garden
Cared for or forgotten
Kill me with medicine
Heal me with poison

Imagine all the naked people on the work machines
If I cannot open my mouth, then would you talk for me?

All we ever had is hunger
(Hunger, hunger)
All we never get is power
(Hunger, hunger, oh)
Would you ever feel each other?
Eh oh eh oh
(Do we ever have power?)
All we ever had is hunger
Hunger, oh

A yo, a yo, a yo
Oh, a yo
A yo, a yo, a yo
(Hunger)
A yo, a yo, a yo
Oh, a yo
A yo, a yo, a yo
(Hunger)

All we ever had is hunger
(Hunger, hunger, oh)
All we never get is power
(Hunger, hunger, oh)
Would you ever feel each other?
Eh oh eh oh
(Do we ever have power?)
All we ever had is hunger
Hunger, oh

Hunger
Oh, oh
Hunger
