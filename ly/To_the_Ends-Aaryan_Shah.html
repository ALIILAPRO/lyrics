		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swerving through the hills, she loves it when I'm dangerous
Life is different when they know you gone be famous
They don't do a budget, We don't do exchanges
Matter-fact, no, we don't do no conversations
You ain't talking bout the only thing I'm chasing?
I can't fuck with you I got high expectations
Yeah, I'm on the road cause I can't be complacent
Running out of time, I'm running out of patience

Left my girl at home I think I might replace her
Coming home with you cause I don't wanna face her
Put my phone away, cause I don't wanna say something
That I know she'll escalate anyways

Shawty ride with me to the ends, yeah
It get lonely at the top, I don't want no friends, yeah
What's an angel to a God? Don't you make me sin, yeah
I just want a little fun, don't make me repent, yeah
I just found another pill, I think Imma pop it
Still dependent on the drugs, she said I should stop it
I been cutting off the snakes, cutting all my losses
I don't do it out of love, send me my deposit (yeah)

I'm coming down, I swear I'm coming to my senses
All these girls just want to add to my expenses
I can't trust these bitches, can't give real addresses
If I let her stay the night I'm gone be stressing
Anything I want, she'll do it for attention
I get paranoid cause I'm her new obsession
I can't fuck her if I can't trust her intentions
Gotta let her go cause I don't make exceptions

Left my girl at home I think I might replace her
Coming home with you cause I don't wanna face her
Put my phone away, cause I don't wanna say something
That I know she'll escalate anyways

Shawty ride with me to the ends, yeah
It get lonely at the top, I don't want no friends, yeah
What's an angel to a God? Don't you make me sin, yeah
I just want a little fun, don't make me repent, yeah
I just found another pill, I think Imma pop it
Still dependent on the drugs, she said I should stop it
I been cutting off the snakes, cutting all my losses
I don't do it out of love, send me my deposit

Ride with me to the ends, yeah
Lonely at the top, I don't want no friends, yeah
Angel to a God? Don't you make me sin, yeah
I just want a little -- don't make me repent, yeah
I just found another pill, Imma pop it
Dependent on the drugs, I know I should stop it
Cutting all the snakes, cutting all my losses
Out of love, send me my deposit
