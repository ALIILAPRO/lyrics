		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please, allow me to show you something
Mmm, somebody give me, yeah

Somebody give me, uh
Somebody tell me the answers
Me and you isn't the answer (uh)
Me and you isn't (no)
Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be if I knew how you felt about me? (Yeah)

It could've been right but I was wrong (uh)
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone (yeah)
The part of me that cared is almost gone
And I know that I can't get caught up

We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been (yeah)
We could've (damn)

Remember?
Remember the night in Miami
First time you put your arms around me
I'm up reminiscin' (ooh, yeah)
Thinking 'bout you isn't helping
Thinking 'bout you doesn't tell me
What good it would do if I decide to face the truth

It could've been right but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
You only hit me up when she's not home
And that's why I can't get caught up

We could've been
And we try to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been (oh, yeah)
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been
We could've
We could've been
What we could've been, we could've been (easy as hell)

Every time I close my eyes, I see your face
Should I hit you up or keep giving you space?
I bet by now somebody's taking over my place
Yeah, I know deep down inside I'm making a mistake
Yeah, letting you walk away, uh
The memory's stalking me, uh
It's getting hard for me, uh
'Cause you're a part of me, uh
And I know we can't get caught up

We could've been
And we try to pretend (oh, oh)
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in (yeah, oh)
'Cause I know in the end (woo)
You dream about, I think about what (we could've been, baby)
We could've been
We could've been (oh, oh)
We could've (yeah, whoa-oh)
We could've been, baby (oh, yeah)
We could've been (oh, oh)
(Easy as hell)
