		  I just know that it get better with time
Just know that
I just know that it get better with time
I just know that
I just know that it get better with time

So blast it
You can tell him that you're mines still
I just know that it get better with time
So blast it

Don't hurt me
But I thought you were on my side
I need you here beside me
But you lost in my life
And I'm trying to make that fine
And I'm trying to call tonight
I know that you're sorry
But I don't need to find out why

I just know that it gets better with time
Just know that
I just know that it get better with time
I just know that
I just know that it get better

So blast it
You can tell him that you're mines still
I just know that it get better with time
I just know that

I want you to see me Fred, I'm here

Oh, it hurts me
It's just when your screen went black
But I still feel you above me
And you almost dragged me back
I see you fading, fading
But you saved me
All night, all night
But you break me
Alright, alright
(I'm here)

I just know that it gets better with time
Just know that
I just know that it get better with time
I just know that
I just know that it get better

So blast it
You can tell him that you're mines still
I just know that it get better with time
I just know that
I just know that it get better with time

I just know that
I just know that it get better with time
