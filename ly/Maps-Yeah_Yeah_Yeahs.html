		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pack up
I'm straight
Enough

Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Made off
Don't stray
Well, my kind's your kind
I'll stay the same
Pack up
Don't stray

Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait, they don't love you like I love you

Wait, they don't love you like I love you
Maps
Wait, they don't love you like I love you
