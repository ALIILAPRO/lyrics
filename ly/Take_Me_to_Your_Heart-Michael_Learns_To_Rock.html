		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mmh, hmm, yeah, oh
Ooh, ooh

Hiding from the rain and snow
Trying to forget but I won't let go
Looking at a crowded street
Listening to my own heartbeat

So many people all around the world
Tell me where do I find someone like you, girl?

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is, haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
It's easy, take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend

I don't need too much talking without saying anything
All I need is someone who makes me wanna sing

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand before I'm old
Show me what love is, haven't got a clue
Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever
We're only here today
Love is now or never
Bring me far away

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
It's easy, take me to your heart
(Take me, take me)

Take me to your heart, take me to your soul
Give me your hand and hold me
Show me what love is, be my guiding star
It's easy, take me to your heart
