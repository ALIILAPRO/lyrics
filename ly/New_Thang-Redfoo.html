		<p>
		  Yeah
Oh
Foo!
Let's go oh!

Ooh, the way that you pop girl
Makes me go cray, show me what you got, girl
You could be my new thang
Ooh, the way that you move
Makes me go cray, pick it up now drop girl
You could be my new thang

Aha
Aha
Aha

Get sexy, girl, get sexy
Get sexy, girl, get sexy (aha)
Get sexy, girl, get sexy

Ye, ah
Yo (aha)

I heard it's your birthday
Grab a drink if you thirsty
I can see that you need a OG
That could do you the best in the worst way (aha)
Pop it like a go-go (aha)
Drop it like a low-low (aha)
What's that? It's a Go-Pro?
So I can watch that back, HD, slo-mo

I don't care if it's the first date (ey)
I'll take you back to my place (ey)
We can skip first base
'Cause a player like me tryna slide into home plate (aha)
Clap clap, make it clap (aha)
Lights on, lights off, make it clap (aha)
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Santa, but she sittin' on my lap, oh

Ooh, the way that you pop girl
Makes me go cray, show me what you got, girl
You could be my new thang
Ooh, the way that you move
Makes me go cray, pick it up now drop girl
You could be my new thang

Aha
Aha
Aha

Get sexy, girl, get sexy
Get sexy, girl, get sexy (aha)
Get sexy, girl, get sexy 

Ye, ah
Yo (aha)

I heard that you single
Now you talkin' my lingo
Let's play casino
Bring four friends plus you, Bingo! 
Yeah ain't nothing but a flirt (aha) 
The way you bouncin' in that shirt (aha)
It's amazing how you drop it
Pick it up and still make it work (oh uh)

Yo body lethal
I might LA freak you
Goddamn, that booty fat, sittin' high up on your back
What the fuck, did they feed you? (Aha)
Clap, clap, clap clap make it clap (aha)
Lights on, lights off, make it clap (aha)
Yeah, make it clap
My name ain't Apple, but they call me the Mac, oh!

Ooh, the way that you pop girl
Makes me go cray, show me what you got, girl
You could be my new thang
Ooh, the way that you move
Makes me go cray, pick it up now drop girl
You could be my new thang

Hey bae I know we hardly met
And I like that
You're playing hard to get
And you're the type that
Makes me wanna do thangs
And that's why I'm tryna make you my new thang (aha)

Hey bae I know we hardly met
