		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now it's more than thirtyfive long years,  
 That on this Earth I had to be,  
 It's time to leave for another world,  
 And Gammapolis waits for me.  
  
 Goodbye my friends, I'm going on my way,  
 I tried to teach you how to see,  
 But I know I never make you understand,  
 That Gammapolis waits for me. 
  
 So long my love, you shared my earthly life,  
 You tried to make it good for me,  
 But you thought I was crazy when I used to say, 
 That Gammapolis waits for me.  
  
 When you gaze out at the midnight sky,  
 Far above reality,  
 And you can see with heavenly eyes,  
 For Gammapolis waits for me.
