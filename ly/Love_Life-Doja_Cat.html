		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
Life's like this
Love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
When my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I said, I love it when my life's like, yeah

I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my ice look crisp
I love it when my clothes smell fresh
I love it when my fans speak French
I love it when they like my fits
I love it, how up high my tits now
I love the way my man throw dick
I love his lips
I love it when my friends call back
I love showin' them brand new tracks
I love roasting 'em all
And hearin' them all roast me back
Y'all never had no friends like that
I love it when my waist look small and ass look fat
I love it when my fans ain't mad, when I look snatched
I love it when my mom cook food, she bake that mac'
I love hearing the roar when I go on the stage, on tour
They love when I embrace my flaws
I love it when they doin' the same
I love it when my fans love change
That's how we change the game

I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
My life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
When my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I said, I love it when my life's like

When life's like this I'm thankful
Warm sun, good vibrations
When life's like this, be grateful
One life, one chance, take it

They love it when I write like this
I love it when my team feel strong
And them deals flowin' in
I love that they don't fight like that
'Cause everybody know how to act because we tight like this
Not all of them be getting along
I hope that I can ease some the stress
Can I chime in?
I know I been the root of the cause
I know I've had a temper before
But still y'all don't quit
I understand you want me to win
I understand how hard that you bend
I understand the cause and effect now
Like dog eat dog and cat eat fish
I understand the jungle we in, now let me finish
We all gon' make mistakes and it's cool
I love how you grew
You offer me tools that make my life feel simple
I know it, that you lovin' me down
Man, I love y'all big
And I love it when my life's like this (yeah)

I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
My life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
Life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
When my life's like this
I love it when my life's like this
I said, "I love it when my life's like this"

When life's like this I'm thankful
Warm sun, good vibrations
When life's like this, be grateful
One life, one chance, take it
