		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's raining hard today
It's a bit too much for me
I know it will make you smile
So let ourselves 
Get wet inside the rain

The whole world 
Is getting filled with your scent
Hope this moment 
Is not a daydream

Calla
Someone said 
That your time
Will be over soon

But Calla
You can always grow back, oh

If you don't have enough sunlight
I'll blow the clouds away, Calla

Bloom yourself until the end
Whatever you are
I'll be there for you

My whole world 
Is filled up with your scent, hey
I hope this moment's not a daydream

Raindrops shines like the stars
Well, everything shines when 
I'm with you babe
Raindrops falls like comets
I'll make this moment 
Not to be a daydream

Calla
Someone said that your time
Will be over soon
But Calla
You can always grow back, oh
If you don't have enough sunlight

Calla
Someone said that your time
Will be over soon
But Calla
You can always grow back, oh

If you don't have enough sunlight
I'll blow the clouds away, Calla
