		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I didn't know that you'd be here tonight
Saw you again, think this must be a sign
Nothing you said, it was all in your eyes, oh
Can I get close, even for just one time?

It's the little things that get me high
Won't you come with me and spend the night?
Just a little thing for you and I
And if it's meant to be, then, that's alright
It's the little things that get me high
Won't you come with me and spend the night?
Just a little thing for you and I
And if it's meant to be, then, that's alright

With you, it's such a sweet escape
So, if we leave, will anybody notice?
If you don't want to play these games
Just tell me what you need and we can go there

Only here for the weekend
I've just stepped out with my friends
Don't tell me that you're leaving
Think I came at the right time
Do you know what's on my mind?
Can you stay for the evening?

It's the little things that get me high
Won't you come with me and spend the night?
Just a little thing for you and I
And if it's meant to be, then, that's alright
It's the little things that get me high
Won't you come with me and spend the night?
Just a little thing for you and I
And if it's meant to be, then, that's alright

Just the little things that get me high and keep me going
Just a little bit of you and I, nobody knows it
Just the little things for you and I
Just a little bit of you and I, nobody knows it
Just the little things that get me high and keep me going
Just a little bit of you and I, nobody knows it
Just the little things that get me high and keep me going
Just a little bit of you and I, nobody knows it

What time is it?
When the party start?
