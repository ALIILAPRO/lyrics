		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fifty, Nicole
It's just another one
Another number one

I'm complex, difficult to understand
I don't know if it's me
Or just to make a brother mad
I wanna it in the morning
Bright and early I want it
I rise as the sunrise
Baby now get up on it
Give it to me good
Shawty work it like you should
You follow instructions
Then I follow instructions
The ultimate seduction
More kissing and touching
Feels super natural
First chance I'm at you

Come here baby, hey be my baby
Hey be my baby oh oh oh
