		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, can I fuck you in the day time, day time?
Even though that pussy isn't mine
Know your man get off at nine
Girl, let's hurry up and make this right
Sweet, sweet peach
Know you wanna keep this thing discreet
Hear you calling through the streets
Oh, that pussy's calling me

Sneak, sneak, oh let's sneak
Sneak, oh let's sneak, sneak, oh let's
Sneak, sneak, oh let's sneak
Sneak, oh let's sneak, sneak, oh let's

Warm and gushy, always feeling right
She like rich niggas, I'm her type
Bored at the crib, she tryna pipe
Bored at the crib, she tryna pipe
Always down for an afternoon delight
But I can never crash and spend the night, oh
Save my number as one of your girls
I know your niggas is too insecure
You way too fine for this big city
It ain't his fault and it really ain't yours
So let's fuck on this furniture like it is yours
Supposed to be locked but I'm opening doors

Oh, can I fuck you in the day time, day time?
Even though that pussy isn't mine
Know your man get off at nine
Girl, let's hurry up and make this right
Sweet, sweet peach
Know you wanna keep this thing discreet
Hear you calling through the streets
Oh, that pussy's calling me

Sneak, sneak, oh let's sneak (sneak)
Sneak, oh let's sneak, sneak, oh let's
Sneak, sneak, oh let's sneak
Sneak, oh let's sneak, sneak, oh let's
Sneak, sneak, oh let's sneak
Sneak, oh let's sneak, sneak, oh let's
Sneak, sneak, oh let's sneak
Sneak, oh let's sneak, sneak, oh let's

Oh, that pussy's calling me, yeah
Sneak
