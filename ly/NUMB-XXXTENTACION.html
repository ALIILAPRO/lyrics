		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give, my friend
And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give, my friend

Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh
Woah, oh, woah, oh

And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give, my friend
Woah, oh
And every single year (woah, oh)
I'm drowning in my tears (woah, oh), I'm drowning in my tears again (woah, oh)
Woah, oh
I can't seem to forget (woah, oh) the pain I seem to give (woah, oh)
The pain I seem to give, my friend (woah, oh)
Woah, oh, woah, oh

And every single year
I'm drowning in my tears, I'm drowning in my tears again
I can't seem to forget the pain I seem to give
The pain I seem to give, my friend
Woah, oh
