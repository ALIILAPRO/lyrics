		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Putting all the vegetables away
That you bought at the grocery store today
And it goes fast
You think of the past

Suddenly everything has changed

Driving home the sky accelerates
And the clouds all form a geometric shape
And it goes fast
You think of the past

Suddenly everything has changed

Putting all the clothes you washed away
As you're folding up the shirts you hesitate
Then it goes fast
Think of the past

Suddenly everything has changed
