		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What could make me die?
What could make me live?
Keep me up all night
Make me wanna sleep in?
What could make me never wanna pick up a bottle again?
Nothing but the love you give

What could make me feel a like little child?
Swear to God it's heaven when I crack a joke and you crack a smile
What could find me down so low? Take me so high?
Nothing but the love you give

Nothing but the love
Nothing but the love
Nothing but the love
Oh, no, no, no, nothing but the love you give

What could heal the pain of a broken heart?
What could pick the pieces up and frame 'em like a work of art?
What could take a tired soul and make it restart?
Nothing but the love you give

Nothing but the love
Nothing but the love
Nothing but the love
Oh, no, no, no, nothing but the love you give

What if I told you I could die in your arms right now?
But no pressure, we could find some way, somehow
Hell, I know, people change, I guess all I'm really tryna say is
Would you stay here forever?

Nothing but the love (nothing but the love)
Nothing but the love (nothing but the love)
Nothing but the love (nothing but the love)
Oh, no, no, no, nothing but the love you give

Your love
Nothing but your love
Nothing but your love
Nothing but your love (there's nothing better than your love)
Nothing but your love
Nothing but your love
Nothing but your love (there's nothing better than your love)
Nothing but your love 

What could make me die?
What could make me live?
Mmm, nothing but the love you give
