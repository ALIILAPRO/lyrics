		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Breath you out where I let you in
Keeping every word you gave to me
No I deserve it

Shut me down and push me out
You were in a different story
I was still around
Yea I stuck around

But I saw through you
When I didn't want too

Show me love that hurts like hell
And I'll keep you warm
For someone else
We started off in heaven
Came crashing into earth

Oh maybe we had love in reverse
Maybe we had love in reverse

Lit your fire held you close
We were dancing in the flames till it turned to smoke
Fatal attraction

Couldn't help but let it burn
Why the hell is it the pain that gets my heart to learn
But we let it happen

And I
Saw through you
But I
Didn't want to

Show me love that hurts like hell
And I'll keep you warm for someone else
We started off in heaven
Came crashing into earth
Oh maybe we had love in reverse
Maybe we had love in reverse

What if I need you
What if I'm better on my own
What if I breath you
What If I'm dying to let you go
What If I just need myself right now
Cause even when I had you I still felt alone
Why do I keep asking what could happen
Even when I know

Show me love that hurts like hell
And I'll keep you warm for someone else
We started off in heaven
Came crashing into earth

Oh maybe we had love in reverse
Maybe we had love in reverse
