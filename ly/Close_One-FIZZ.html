		  Good God
You're in my kitchen
It's been so long
Don't we look different?

You said
Let's go dancing
Fall asleep in my room
Is this habit
Or something I shouldn't do? Mm

Yeah, that was a close one
Yeah, that was a close one
We were really going through it
Guess we dodged another bullet
We know that we're happier

Careful
Don't come any closer
You should go home
Or stay on the sofa

Fuck it
Let's go dancing
Fall asleep in my room
This can't happen
Guess I'll just see you soon

Yeah, that was a close one
Yeah, that was a close one
We were really going through it
Guess we dodged another bullet
We know that we're happier
Yeah, that was a close one
Yeah, that was a close one
We were really going through it
Guess we dodged another bullet
We know that we're happier

On our own
Let's go dancing
On our own
Let's go dancing
On our own
Let's go dancing, dancing, yeah

Yeah, that was a close one
Yeah, that was a close one
And we were really going through it
Guess we dodged another bullet
We know that we're happier alone, alone

Yeah, that was a close one
Close one
Yeah, that was a close one (we were really going through it)
(Guess we dodged another bullet, baby) close one
(We're happier) on our own
On our own
