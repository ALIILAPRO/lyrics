		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lean not on your own understanding
I don't understand 
(I don't understand)
Mind games mentally demanding
So many demands 
(So many demands)

Broken, open
Still hoping something will change
Growing, holding on
They're not the same
At least I know there was

Love
I know there was love
Once upon a time, I know there was love (love)
I know there was love
Once upon a time, I know there was love

We held each other near
Faced everything we feared
Who thought we'd ever be here?
The words we used to say
I thought that we could stay
Don't know if I'm wrong to pray for someday

Broken, open
Still hoping something will change
Growing, holding on
They're not the same
At least I know there was

Love
I know there was love
Once upon a time, I know there was love (love)
I know there was love
Once upon a time, I know there was love

(I know there was love)
(I know there was love)
(I know there was love)
(I know there was love)
