		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was twenty one years when I wrote this song
I'm twenty two now, but I won't be for long
People ask me "When will you grow up to be a man?"
But all the girls I loved at school
Are already pushing prams

I loved you then as I love you still
Though I put you on a pedestal
They put you on the pill
I don't feel bad about letting you go
I just feel sad about letting you know

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl
I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

I loved the words you wrote to me
But that was bloody yesterday
I can't survive on what you send
Every time you need a friend

I saw two shooting stars last night
I wished on them but they were only satellites
Is it wrong to wish on space hardware?
I wish, I wish, I wish you'd care

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

I don't want to change the world
I'm not looking for a new England
I'm just looking for another girl

Looking for another girl
Looking for another girl
Looking for another girl
