		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've rejected affection
For years and years
Now I have it and damn it
It's kind of weird

He tells me I'm pretty
Don't know how to respond
I tell him that he's pretty too
Can I say that? Don't have a clue

With every passing moment
I surprise myself
I'm scared of flies
I'm scared of guys
Someone please help

'Cause I think I've fallen
In love this time
I blinked and suddenly I had a valentine (be my valentine)

What if he's the last one I kiss?
What if he's the only one I'll ever miss?
Maybe I should run, I'm only twenty-one
I don't even know who I want to become

I've lost all control of my heartbeat now
Got caught in a romance with him somehow
I still feel a shock through every bone
When I hear an, "I love you"
'Cause now I've got someone to lose

The first one to ever like me back
I'm seconds away from a heart attack
How the hell did I fall in love this time?
And honestly, I can't believe I get to call you mine
I blinked and suddenly
I had a valentine
Valentine
