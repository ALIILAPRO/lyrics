		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Actin' like they killers, but them niggas just some hoes
We act like this a studio, this really just a trap
Everything we got, we had to whip it out the bowl
Before we shake your hand, we'd rather slap you with the strap
A million cash in hunnids, now they bring it to the door (racks)
Twenty K for a coat that I ain't even wore
This bitch so bad, I let her shop, I made 'em close the store
She think she trickin' me, but bitch don't know my pockets swole (the money)
Big bankroll, top floor South Beach (top)
Long money Gucci, ask your bitch 'bout me (ask)
Penthouse suite, four hoes, two weeks (yeah)
And all my shooters shootin' .223's 'bout me, Wop

Pick 'em with the AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga nose sweaty
But all the hoe shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

(Whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
(There's whores hoes in this house, there's some whores in this house)
You a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Pick 'em with the AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga nose sweaty
But all the hoe shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Boy, you been a hoe
I remember, hoe
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's friend or foe
Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a ho and she a hoe, now that's too many hoes

Boy you been a hoe since Arsenio
Fuck yo' bitch, put her in the figure four
Scope on the gun, better visual
Silencer make the bullets tippy-toe
I don't give a fuck, never gave fucks
Always knew that a better day'd come
Haven't been asleep, seven day run
Never knew how a Chevrolet run
Ice Cube, Eazy-E, Ren, and Dre
I am the new NWA
Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
Take lives like students took lessons
Jail time, felt like it took seconds
I'm a Goodfella, was a dope seller
All these hoe niggas must be Hoe-chella

(There's some whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
(There's some whores in this house, there's some whores in this house)
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four seven
You a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga nose sweaty
But all the hoe shit still so smelly
Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga's nose sweaty
But all the hoe shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

No bullshit, my nigga, I'm pushin' my triggers
They lookin' for niggas in bushes, my nigga
In the ocean, in the lake, in the woods, in the rivers
They skies was gray and the bullets was silver
Young Money on friend and my lady, my nigga
You front on your money, you quittin', my nigga
We kill you by breakfast and cook you for dinner
The lesbians say you a pussy-ass nigga, ol' hoe-ass nigga
I put some pressure on your hoe
Make her tell me what she know
Stop confessin' to that hoe
Stop confidin' in that hoe
Stop providin' for that hoe
You gon' die for that hoe
Suicide for that hoe

Boy, you been a hoe
I remember, hoe
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's for friend or foe
Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a hoe and she a hoe, now that's too many hoes

Nigga with a AK-47
Three-sixty five, twenty-four seven
Percocet got a nigga nose sweaty
But all the hoe shit still so smelly
Belch wrong, get your throat slashed
Nigga, broke ass, where's your cash?
Nigga, Santa Claus with no bag
Nigga, you a ho-ho-ho ass, nigga

Boy, you been a hoe
I remember, hoe
You ain't foolin' Weezy F, and that's for friend or foe
Tell them hoes in the house we kickin' in the door
He a hoe and she a hoe, now that's too many hoes
(There's some whores in this house)
