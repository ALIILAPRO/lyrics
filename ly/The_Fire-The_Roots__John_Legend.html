		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, the fire, the fire
Oh, the fire, the fire

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

Yeah, and if I'm ever at the crossroads
And start feeling mixed signals like Morse code
My soul starts to grow colder than the North Pole
I try to focus on the whole of where the torch goes
In the tradition of these legendary sports pros
As far as I can see, I've made it to the threshold
Lord knows I've waited for this a life time
And I'm an icon when I let my light shine
Shine bright as an example of a champion
Taking the advantage, never copping out or canceling
Burn like a chariot, learn how to carry it
Maverick, always above and beyond average
Fuel to the flame that I train with and travel with
Something in my eyes says I'm so close to having the prize
I realize I'm supposed to reach for the skies
Never let somebody try to tell you otherwise

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

One love, one game, one desire
One flame, one bonfire, let it burn higher
I never show signs of fatigue or turn tired
'Cause I'm the definition of tragedy turned triumph
It's David and Goliath I made it to the eye of the storm
Feeling torn like they fed me to the lions
Before my time starts to wind down like the Mayans
I show 'em how I got the grind down like a science
It sounds like a riot on hush it's so quiet
The only thing I hear is my heart, I'm inspired
By the challenge that I find myself standing eye to eye with
Then move like a wise warrior and not be a coward
You can't escape the history that you was meant to make
That's why the highest victory is what I'm meant to take
You came to celebrate, I came to cerebrate
I hate losing, I refuse to make the same mistake

Oh, the fire, the fire
Oh
(The fire)
There's something in your heart
(The fire)

There's something in your heart
And it's in your eyes
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn
You don't say good luck
You say don't give up
It's the fire
Inside you
Let it burn

Oh, the fire
Inside you
The fire
Inside you
The fire
Inside you
