		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe

Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe

And then here we are (here we are), in this big old empty room
Staring at each other, who's gonna make the first move?
Been doing our thing for a minute, and now both our hearts are in it
The only place to go is all the way

Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl no need to be nervous,
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooh, girl your my desire, your wish is my command
Treat you like a princess, ooh girl your so delicious
Like ice cream on a sunny day, gonna eat you before you melt away, yeah

Oh babe, Is that alright? Is that okay?
Girl no need to be nervous, no, no, no,
'Cause I got you all night, don't you worry about a thing no, no, no,
Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time

Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe

Don't it feel good babe, don't it feel good babe
'Cause it's so brand new babe, it's so brand new babe

Just go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
Go with it, go with it, go with it
And I will go real slow with it, slow with it
It's our first time
