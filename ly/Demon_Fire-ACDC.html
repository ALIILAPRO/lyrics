		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  He loves to drive 'em crazy with his evil lips
Great guns are blazing, what a deadly trip

Yeah, born of no family, born of no creed
Yeah, raised by a jackal, raised a bad seed

You better look around
Before you hit the ground
Give me no quarrel, life's all crime

Like a devil on a deadline
Gonna send you down

Demon fire
Is all you desire
Demon fire
Get closer, fire

Ooh, yeah

Seeking all power, gonna hunt you down
Follow along on the flash, gonna knock you out

You better look around
Hear that evil sound
Give me no quarter, all drenched in grime, huh

With all the bad intentions
Gonna send you down

Demon fire
Is all you desire
Demon fire
Get closer, fire

Demon fire
Flames burn higher
Demon fire
It's an all-out hellfire

Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, hey, hey

Hey, demon fire
Is all you desire
Demon fire
It glows sapphire

Demon fire
Flames burn higher
Demon fire
It's an all-out hellfire

Fire, demon fire
Fire, demon fire
Demon fire
