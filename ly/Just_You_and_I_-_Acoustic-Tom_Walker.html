		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Let's get drunk
I'll pour my heart out through my mouth
This year's been hard for us, no doubt
Let's raise a glass to a better one
Let all the things that we've overcome
Bring hope to us 'cause
Me and you we can hold this up
Only you understand how I'm feeling now, yeah

And I know I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening, yeah
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I could take over the world
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)

Let's get drunk
We'll reminisce about the days
We were broke, not getting paid and taking trips on the weekend
When I would drive down to see you
And we would paint the town
Too many shots, I'll be passing out
'Cause I can never keep up, quad vods, now I'm puking up

And I know, I can tell you anything
You won't judge, you're just listening, yeah
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)

Tired of chasing paper
Staring at this screen
Been saving up for weeks now
Just to get to you, my dear
And though you're far from my home
This ain't no weekend bar
And oh my heart grows fonder
Must be city love

'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)
'Cause my darling, you and I
Could take over the world
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)
'Cause you're the only one who brings light just like the sun
One step at a time, just you and I (just you and I)
Yeah, one step at a time, just you and I
Yeah, one step at a time, just you and I
