		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  With you it's always all or nothing
With you I know I'm in for life, oh yeah
With you I lay in this bed we made
With you it's ride or die

Cause when I'm alone I don't do so well
And on my own you know it hurts like hell
It cuts to the bone every time I leave
Without you next to me

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
What doesn't hurt just isn't real, oh yeah
The in between I learned to suffer
Reminding me how to feel

Cause when I'm alone I don't do so well
And on my own you know it hurts like hell
It cuts to the bone every time I leave
Without you next to me

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

We all need somebody
Somebody to love
Somebody to love
We all need somebody
Somebody to love

Cause when I'm alone I don't do so well
And on my own you know it hurts like hell
It cuts to the bone every time I leave
Without you next to me

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love oh

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone (Somebody to)
Everybody needs somebody (To give it all)
Somebody to love (To give it all)

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone
Everybody needs somebody
Somebody to love

Everybody needs somebody
Everybody needs someone (Somebody to)
Everybody needs somebody (To give it all)
Somebody to love
