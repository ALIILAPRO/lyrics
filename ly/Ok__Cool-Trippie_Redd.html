		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Woo-hoo, woo-hoo

Okay, cool
Okay, cool
Okay, cool
When I wake up, I count cake
She want her nails and hair done 'cause she my bae (woo)
I smoke out a pound to the face (ah, woo)
I ain't even tryna be cool (okay, okay, okay)

I can't go outside without that cooling kit (go outside, woo)
Won't catch me outside without that cooling kit (go outside, woo)
Actin' out your mind and you might lose that shit (woo)
Such a waste of time, you better move it, kid (pussy, bitch, woo)
Yeah, bangin' that fye, bangin' onside
Livin' in crime, devil may cry (woo)
Turn a two to a four, turn a four to a nine (nine)
Shawty brought lil' bro, lil' nigga, then slide
You niggas soft as pussy
You niggas wet like pussy (pussy)
I get you touched like pussy (pussy)
One thing, don't play 'bout pussy (pussy)
That's my ho, that's my bitch
That's my ho, that's my bitch (yeah)
I buy her clothes, I pay her rent (yeah)
I buy her clothes (clothes), I pay her rent (yeah)
She want Hermes, okay, cool (okay, cool)
She want Hermes, okay, cool (okay)

Okay, cool
Okay, cool
Okay, cool
When I wake up I count cake
She want her nails and hair done 'cause she my bae (woo)
I smoke out a pound to the face (ah, woo)
I ain't even tryna be cool (okay, okay, okay)
