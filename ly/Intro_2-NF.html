		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm back, did anyone miss me?
They said a second record could be tricky
Well that's kind of funny 'cause I am not tripping
My fans, they know what it is and they with me
Yeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semi
I came from a town with three lakes and no city
I've been doing shows for nothing but pennies
When I leave the stage, they never forget me
Mansion was a glimpse of my life
I let you see what it's like to be in my head
People ask me what I think I think I be doin'
If it wasn't music, I'd rather be dead
You heard what I said, that was like me at a 3, you don't want to see me at 10
Or maybe you do
I promise if that is the case, then that is what you're gonna get
If you're looking for music with watered down lyrics
I promise that you need to go somewhere else
And if you want somebody to tell you everything that you wanna hear I won't be any help
This flow is familiar, I think I heard it before
Oh yeah, I made it myself
I left the door open to come in my mansion but I never said it's a beautiful house
Some of ya'll sat on the porch
Looked at my windows and stared at my door
They ask me if I'm going to kill it this record
I laugh in their face and I ask 'em, "Do you see the blood on the floor?"
He's at it again, NF is crazy he's bad with the kids
He never talks about nothing but him
Yeah, my friends say, "He's kind of a diva"
Well, you need to get some new friends
I'm as true as it gets
'Til I get on the stage and flip on the switch
And I go to a place where nobody is
If you putting my name in the song, that's something that you won't regret
I'm not lying to you here
I remember the shows when no one was there
I remember the shows when nobody cared
Some people in front of me laughing like, "He isn't going nowhere"
It's funny now, isn't it?
This type of life isn't how I envisioned it
This type of life, it just ain't how I pictured it
I'm in the back of the tour bus, trying to face how my family is different
Not what you think it is
Write a review, tell me what you think of this
Give me three stars and call me and idiot
But to be honest, it don't make a difference
I know some people don't get it
But you have now entered the Therapy Session
If you don't like music that's personal
I have no clue what you people are doing here
Might as well throw out the record
I pull up a chair
I track through my music like nobody's there
Only person I judge is the one in the mirror
I'm lately he ain't doin' well
I don't need ya'll in my ear
I'm tired of hearing it
You call it music, I call it my therapist
Sick people telling me I have been carrying way too much baggage
I need to take care of it
I know she's right, but man it's embarrassing
Music has raised me more than my parents did
Take out a picture of us and I stare at it
Who am I kidding? You probably ain't hearing this
Show me an artist you want to compare me with
You put us both on a track, I'm a bury 'em
Give me this shovel, it's 'bout to get scarier
None of you want to attack what you staring at
I see you got beats, but where is the lyrics at?
NF is the logo, you know I been wearing that
Don't come to my show and be sittin' in the very back
I call you out in the crowd like, "There he is!"

I thought I'd be happy, It feels like I'm cursed
It's hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
You gave me this place to go when I'm hurting
I thought it'd get better, but it's getting worse
And I got nobody to blame when I work, like 24/7
I ain't been to church, and Satan keep callin' me, he tryin' to flirt
I hang up the phone, these are more than just words
I drive on that highway and listen to Mansion
I look up to God like, "When did this happen?"
Yelling with all of my fans to "Wake up!"
But feel like I haven't
I get emotional, I didn't plan this
I'm doing things I never imagined
I'm sorry but I gotta leave
I don't wanna be late for my therapy session
