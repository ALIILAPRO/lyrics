		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply, so absurd
In these times of doing what you're told
Keep these feelings, no one knows
What ever happened to the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45 (45)
Swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Send a message to the unborn child
Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high up on the shelf
Left for you, no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

What ever happened to the young man's heart?
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45 (45)
Swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Everyone's pointing their fingers
Always condemning me
And nobody knows what I believe
I believe

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45 (45)
Swimming through the ashes of another life (another life)
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45 
And I'm swimming through the ashes of another life 
There is no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45 (45), 45
Staring down the barrel of a 45
