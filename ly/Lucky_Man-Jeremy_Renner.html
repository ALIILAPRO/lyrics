		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Maybe it's the nighttime
When I face my demons I've been
Hiding for a lifetime
I start counting my mistakes

Had to learn the hard way
In the blink of an eye, it could all go away
I guess plans change
And it's out of my control

Now I know
It takes a little bit of faith
And a whole lot miracles
I know
I got more left to do

(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man
(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man

I would give it all back
Except for the things I can't replace
Never knew what I had
'Til it was almost too late

(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man
(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man

I was on my knees
I was beggin' please
Gimme one more day
I was almost dyin'
I swear to God
On my daughter's heart
Gimme one more chance
And I'll keep on fightin'

(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man
(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man

'Cause one day you just wake up
And finally realize
Life is so god damn beautiful
I ain't got nothin' left to lose
No, no

(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man
(Ooh) guess I'm just a lucky man

I was on my knees
I was beggin' please
Gimme one more day
I was almost dyin'
I swear to God
On my daughter's heart
Gimme one more chance
And I'll keep on fightin'

Now I know
It takes a little bit of faith
And a whole lot of miracles
I know
I guess I'm just a lucky man
I'm a lucky man
