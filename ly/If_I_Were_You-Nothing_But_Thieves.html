		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I were you
I'd treat them better
If I were you
I'd settle the weather
It's coming soon
Now pull it together
Yeah, get it together
It's a matter of time

If I were you

Oh, tell me how it feels
Conspiracy cadet
Wound up like a cassette
The tape about to shed
If chaos is a ladder
Hell is heaven sent
Keep pulling at the thread
While cashing in the cheque

No telling what I'd do
With my hands stuck on you
No telling what I'd do
With my hands

If I were you
I'd treat them better
If I were you
I'd settle the weather
It's coming soon
Now pull it together
Yeah, get it together
It's a matter of time

If I were you
I'd treat them better
If I were you
I'd settle the weather
You'll get what's due
I'd square the vendetta
Yeah, get it together
It's a matter of time

Think you're pretty wild
You're blowing up the sun
Confuse a loaded question
With a smoking gun
You move like Dunning-Kruger
Truth is overdone
A father like his son
Look after number one, yeah

No telling what I'd do
With my hands stuck on you
No telling what I'd do
With my hands

If I were you
I'd treat them better
If I were you
I'd settle the weather
It's coming soon
Now pull it together
Yeah, get it together
It's a matter of time

If I were you
I'd treat them better
If I were you
I'd settle the weather
You'll get what's due
I'd square the vendetta
Yeah, get it together
It's a matter of time

Some don't care about the ones they hurt
Some just wanna see the planet burn
They'll come for you, they'll come for you, they'll come for you
They'll come for you

If I were you

If I were you
I'd treat them better
If I were you
I'd settle the weather
You'll get what's due
I'd square the vendetta
Yeah, get it together
It's a matter of time
