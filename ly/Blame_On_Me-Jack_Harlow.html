		  Blame on me
Can't hold back
Holdin' on for a minute
Oh, oh (running)

Blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh

We grew up in the same household, for years, we were close
Throwing football in the yard 'til the lights turned on
Inside the lampposts, years go by
Somethin' changed when you got to junior high
Started hanging with them guys
Suddenly I meant nothin' to you, you wanted nothin' to do with me
You run with a crew that doesn't include any room for your little brother
I was destroyed, but I still loved you
I still wanted your approval, if I could get it, I'd cherish it
Embarrassing me any chance you got, but I didn't care
Because maybe if I was tough enough to take it, you would love me
Instead of lookin' at me like I'm disgusting
Like I'm nothing, like I'm not the person that you grew up with
I wanna reminisce and ask you if you miss those days
But I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I'm terrified to hear your answer, so I just don't touch it
I don't say nothing

Phases, running
Spaces, different faces
All we know is

Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh

We grew up in the same household, for years, we were close
One on one, I would dominate you in the post
Years pass, but the bond didn't last
And I hate the man above the sink lookin' at me in the glass
Treated you like I hated you, never needed you
Even if I had the same opinion, disagreed with you
Insult after insult, hoping they'd eat at you
Pokin' at your deepest wounds
My baby brother, I don't have an excuse
But I know you remember the way that dad would let loose
On me more often and way less you
He criticized and tested me, so I'd test you
I got so much wrongdoing to confess to
And you act like it never happened, God bless you
Huh, I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I'm terrified to even ask, so I just don't touch it
I don't say nothing

Phases, running
Spaces, different faces
All we know is

Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh

You grew up in my household, under my roof
Raised you with discipline and taught you life's truths
Lashed out at you for things you'd misplace
Reprimanding you in public 'til you're red in the face
Made you feel the weight of every single mistake that you made
My hot temper turned up full throttle
'Cause I needed you to be your little brother's role model
Everything that you do, he just gon' follow
Don't you understand?
It's okay, I understand
'Cause the way I parent you is how my mother did
And the way you treat your little brother's how my older brother did
And now I'm not even my brother's friend
There's so much I would do and say if I could have it done again
But I'm terrified of broaching the subject
I'm terrified to break down, so I just don't touch it
I don't say nothing

Phases, running
Spaces, different faces
All we know is

Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh
Put the blame on me
Put the blame on me, oh
