		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I think I kissed you bout a million times
Can’t tell the difference between now and last year
I say “I love you” but my stomach’s tied
Up in a knot, butterflies disappeared
Maybe it’s healthier to just be friends
Cause lately we have really let ourselves go
I hate to picture how it all ends
Am I getting used to you?
To all of the things we do
Or is it a bad excuse?
To hook up with someone new
It sucks that I can’t explain
Why all of these feelings change
I hate that there’s nothing I can do
While I’m getting used to loving you (loving you)
Am I getting used to loving you?
No longer text you when I’m waking up
I put my phone away, and I go back to sleep
I still miss you but just not as much
As I believe that you are missing me
Don’t have the guts to be what you deserve
I hate myself cause I put me first
And every day we talk a little less
Oh is this a test?
Am I getting used to you?
To all of the things we do
Or is it a bad excuse,
To hook up with someone new
It sucks that I can’t explain
Why all of these feelings change
I hate that there’s nothing I can do
While I’m getting used to loving you (loving you)
Why I’m getting used to loving you
