		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sing a song of love to me
As the shadows start to grow
And I won't be sad and lonely
Anymore

'Cause if you sing a song of love to me
I will always find a smile
That will warm my cold cold heart
Just for a while

Songs of love
I know so well
I've seen some days
And had some times
Lucky boy I can hear you say
You think my sun does nothing but shine

Sing a song of love to me
One more time before I go
And I won't be sad and lonely
No I won't be sad and lonely
Anymore
