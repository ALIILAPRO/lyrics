		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Swerve on your passenger
I fuck with scavengers
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker

I'm gone off Ferrari and I'm huggin' that carbon
I never say sorry
Put some dope in the cup
Go and order the truck 'cause the Bentley is comin'
The end of my sleeve is on plain Jane
Sippin' Codeine on the plane, man
Most of my niggas, they gang bang
Switchin' Moschino my name brand
Switchin' Moschino my name brand
Kilo for kilo, Young Future Pacino
These bitches, they treat me like Michael and Tito
Go ask your dame, I'm her man, I'm her amigo
When that dope ain't got cut on it, call that Gambino
I know the lingo and I know the real
I know a peon got more chains than Deion
I'm the one who put all them birds in the Neon
I made your lil' brother hang out a window
I had em shoot up the block like a chulo
I wake up everyday like I take photos
I pull up in that new foreign, it's four-door
I had that mouth in the house on the low-low
I got a stallion, pulled up like it's polo
I got that mojo, that mojo, I'm mojo
You bozo, you bozo, you nigga that no, no

None of this money ain't matter
All of my niggas they matter
I told you I got all the problems 
That come with this money, so fuck it
I fuck all the nonsense
I sip on that drink and it's muddy
I'm cruisin' the street with a .30
It's the good, the bad, and ugly

Swerve on your passenger
I fuck with scavengers
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker

My styrofoam muddy, my styrofoam muddy, my styrofoam muddy
Your bitch? That's my buddy
Your bitch? That's my buddy
Your bitch? She's some cutty
I'mma hustle for mine
I'mma get out and grind 'cause I know I deserve it
And I know how to work it
And I know I ain't perfect
And I know I ain't perfect
'Bout whatever I purchase
And I'm ready to turn up on ya
Hell, fuck it, nah, I ain't nervous
I don't be studyin' these lame, lames
I'm just gon' fuck on they main dame
Money is what I'm gonna obtain
Bitch you can fuck on my main man
If you on that loud I can smell it, it's octane
I hit the block when them blocks came
I chopped the rock like I'm Bigg and Dame
Jigga my nigga, I'm switchin' lanes
Back of the Maybach, my windows and curtains up
Got the bands and I ran it up way up
And these niggas they nothing but some traitors
Fuck these niggas, they never could play us

None of this money ain't matter
All of my niggas they matter
I told you I got all the problems 
That come with this money, so fuck it
I fuck all the nonsense
I sip on that drink and it's muddy
I'm cruisin' the street with a .30
It's the good, the bad, and ugly

Swerve on your passenger
I fuck with scavengers
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
