		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Play the guitar, play it again, my Johnny
Maybe you're cold, but you're so warm inside
I was always a fool for my Johnny
For the one they call, "Johnny Guitar"
Play it again, Johnny Guitar

What if you go, what if you stay, I love you
What if you're cruel, you can be kind, I know
There was never a man like my Johnny
Like the one they call, "Johnny Guitar"

There was never a man like my Johnny
Like the one they call, "Johnny Guitar"
Play it again, Johnny Guitar
