		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Father comes home from work and he's scared to death
Mother cries for the kid and a note she read
Father runs to the table, he said, "What's going on?"
Mother cries desperately, "Our little baby's gone"

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

She wrote that she is tired of step daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her
Just think that she's all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive?
She ain't got nothing to eat

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are, oh

Save me (from this living hell)
Save me ('cause I, I want help)
Save me (I'm tired and I'm mad)
Save me ('cause this is not a joke)
Save me ('cause I'm on the run)
Save me ('cause I don't wanna go home)
Save me ('cause terror inside)
Save me ('cause I, I want breathe)
Save me (hee, hee)

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl, that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there, they told
He's arresting this little girl, she's only twelve years old now

Do you know where your children are? (Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee)
Because it's now twelve o'clock (hee, hee, hee)
If they're somewhere out on the street (hee, hee, hee)
Just imagine how scared they are (hee, hee, oh)

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock (do you know where your children are?)
If they're somewhere out on the street (do you know where's your baby? Where's your, baby?)
Just imagine how scared they are (where's your, baby?)

Do you know where your children are? (Hee, hee, hee, hee, hee)
Because it's now twelve o'clock (hee, hee, hee)
If they're somewhere out on the street (hee, hee, hee)
Just imagine how scared they are (hee, hee, hee)

Do you know where your children are? (Where's your, baby?)
Because it's now twelve o'clock (where's your, baby?)
If they're somewhere out on the street (where's your, baby?)
Just imagine how scared they are (hee, hee, ooh)

Do you know where your children are? (Children are)
Because it's now twelve o'clock (where's your, baby?)
If they're somewhere out on the street (hee, hee, hee)
Just imagine how scared they are (ooh)

Do you know where your children are? (Where your children are)
Because it's now twelve o'clock (where your children are)
If they're somewhere out on the street (where's your baby? Where's your baby?)
Just imagine how scared they are (little girl, hee, hee, ooh)

Do you know where your children are?
Because it's now twelve o'clock
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are (yeah)

Do you know where your children are? (Hee, hee, hee)
Because it's now twelve o'clock (she's your baby)
If they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
