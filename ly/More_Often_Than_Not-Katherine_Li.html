		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hopeless romantic
Can’t you see
That I can’t fight it I know I’ll always believe 
In happy endings
Like on the screen
And I wanna be the girl who plays the lead

I want someone who can sweep me off my feet 
In the way I've always dreamed 
So I'm not sorry 

It might be my fault 
‘Cause I can’t tell if I’m just wrong about 
Me and you is something there
When we stare from across the couch 
More often than not 
It was less than I thought 
But I wanna know how it feels
I’ll fall even if it’s pretend 
Just to find something real 

All of my friends
Are so in love
And secretly they're who I'm jealous of 
I write my stories
So I don't miss out 
But finding love ain't something I forever wanna sing about 

I want someone who can sweep me off my feet 

It might be my fault 
‘Cause I can’t tell if I’m just wrong about 
Me and you is something there
When we stare from across the couch 
More often than not 
It was less than I thought 
But I wanna know how it feels
I’ll fall even if it’s pretend 
Just to find something real

Hopeless romantic
Yeah that’s me
And someday love won't be something I just make believe
