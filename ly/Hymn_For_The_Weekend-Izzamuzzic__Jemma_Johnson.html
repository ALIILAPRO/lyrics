		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh angels
I oh I oh I
La la la la la la
So high so high
I oh I oh I
La la la la la la
So high so high
Oh angel sent from up above
You know you make my world light up
When I was down
When I was hurt
You came to lift me up
Life is a drink
And love’s a drug
Oh now I think I must be miles up
When I was hurt
River dried up
You came to rain a flood
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
You came
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was hurt
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
You came
I was hurt
I was hurt with a
I was hurt
I was hurt
Oh angel sent from up above
I feel you coursing through my blood
Life is a drink
Your love’s about to make the stars come out
So high
I oh I oh I
La la la la la la
So high
So high
I oh I oh I
Feeling drunk and high
So high so high
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was
You came
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was
I was hurt
You came
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was hurt
You came
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was gonna light up light up
I was hurt
You came
