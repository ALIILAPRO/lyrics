		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  NO SIGN OF LIFE, CAN YOU HEAR MY HEART BEATING
NO SIGN OF PULSE, AM I STILL BREATHING
LIKE A FREQUENCY LOST IN A SYMPHONY
CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING
I’M FINALLY AWAKE
I CAN’T BREATHE
MY EYES ARE BURNING AND I’M DOWN ON MY KNEES
I FINALLY SEE THAT I’VE BEEN RUNNING FROM
WHAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
I CAN’T FEEL
I’M JUST A MEMORY OF WHAT I USED TO BE
I’M ON THE WAY TOWARDS A BETTER DAY
I MAY BE POWERLESS BUT I’M FINALLY AWAKE
BURIED ALIVE
BENEATH THE SKIES THAT TAUGHT ME TO CRY
NO SIGN OF LIGHT, IT’S LIKE I’M BLIND
BUT I KNOW IT’S NOT GOODBYE
GIVE ME A SIGN THAT I’LL SURVIVE
AS MY TWO WORLDS COLLIDE
I FEEL MY PAIN, IT BURNS AWAY
I MAY BE POWERLESS BUT I’M FINALLY AWAKE
NO SIGN OF LIFE, CAN YOU HEAR MY HEART BEATING
NO SIGN OF PULSE, AM I STILL BREATHING
LIKE A FREQUENCY LOST IN A SYMPHONY
CAN YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING
I MAY BE POWERLESS, BUT I’M FINALLY AWAKE
BURY MY SOUL
LIKE SOMETHING HAUNTING AND SO BEAUTIFUL
I FINALLY SEE ALL THAT I COULD NEED
WAS ALWAYS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME
‘CAUSE I CAN’T BREATHE
MY EYES ARE BURNING AND I’M DOWN ON MY KNEES
I’VE NEVER FELT SO FREE
I MAY BE POWERLESS BUT I’M FINALLY AWAKE
