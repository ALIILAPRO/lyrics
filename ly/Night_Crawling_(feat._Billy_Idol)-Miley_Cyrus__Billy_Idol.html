		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I'm good for nothing
Sometimes the best you've ever had
Sometimes I need your loving
Sometimes I stab you in the back

I found a meaning
Just what I needed
Cut on the bathroom wall
Midnight reflection
Craving attention
Under the disco ball

Night crawling, sky falling
Gotta listen when the Devil's calling
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yelling out my name, I chase it

Come on, come on
Night crawling
Come on, come on
Night crawling

Sometimes my thoughts are violent
Sometimes they bring me to the light
Sometimes I sit in silence
Sometimes I'm running for my life

I found a meaning
Just what I needed
Cut on the bathroom wall
Midnight reflection
Craving attention
Under the disco ball (yeah, yeah)

Night crawling, sky falling
Gotta listen when the Devil's calling
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yelling out my name, I chase it

Come on, come on
Night crawling
Come on, come on
Night crawling

Come on

Night crawling, sky falling
Gotta listen when the Devil's calling
Can't shake it, I'll taste it
When it's yelling out my name, I chase it

Come on, come on
Night crawling
Come on, come on
Night crawling

Come on
