		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If I scream into these sheets when I'm alone
Does it make some kind of sound
With no one here to hear it
Tearing through my throat
If I raise my eyes to see a silken robe
As dark as starless night
Do I still have a say in
When it's time to go
I just can't care anymore
Should my footsteps fall
Without pause towards the end
How sufficient was my love
More or less than final
Words between two friends
"You are a home to me" is what you always said
So in this quiet, empty place
All I can ask is if I stopped giving you that
Sorry I'm so absent
I'm just so scared anymore
Feels like someone's going to
Pull the fucking floor
Sorry I'm so quiet
I just can't talk anymore
Every word drives the blade
Deeper than before
I've been so scared of failing
I just can't care anymore
There is a point at which sleep
Is more for shelter than rest
I cannot speak any healing
Pummeled and out of breath
I cannot make you believe
That I love you to death
I cannot spread any hope
If I don't have any left
Light bursts from the side
When my hand stings my face
And it doesn't chase the darkness
I've created away
And it doesn't change the way
You will remember my name
I fucking promise it's me
I fucking swear I'm the same
Sat reclined, driver's side
And the rain understood
I can't be rid of my bad
I can't be rid of my good
I cannot choose which
Parts of me are misunderstood
I can choose which parts of me
Die underfoot, yeah
