		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Things in my brain that's why we take
Drugs to escape

I feel the rain it burns like pain
Alone again where are my friends?
I need to change things in my brain
That's why we take drugs to escape

The weather speaks to me
A different frequency gave you a piece of me
But you left so easily
I thought you needed me
You kept deceiving me
Think you mistreated me
What did you ever see in me?
I'm in a better place
I'm in a sweater space
Thumb holes a warm embrace
Takin' me to better days
I work to make a change
I work through all the pain
Distractions keep me sane
I may never be the same
Let me feel for a minute
Wait, I don't like that quit it
I'm a real big cynic
I don't really trust too much I limit
But when I do I'm committed
And when I do man I'm in it
I'm by your side till we winning
Ride or die I'ma always stay with it
Got my mind tangled in knots
Trying to hide from the painful thoughts
Crouching behind all the memories lost
The happy ones between the awful spots
I visualize a lot protagonistic thoughts
Antagonistic boss
I try to win, try to see the plot

I feel the rain it burns like pain
Alone again where are my friends?
I need to change things in my brain
That's why we take drugs to escape
But that don't change a fucking thing
I need some space it's not a phase
These sleepy days they keep me sane
I'll dream of rain that 'cause no pain

It's so cold outside why am I in this life?
Why am I here alive? The only point survive
But if we all just die
Then we all fail with time
No that cannot be right
There must be more to life
I wanna make a difference
I wanna be consistent i wanna be committed
That shit can be so addicting
I have some new convictions
I have some new conditions
I have some premonitions
That this time things will be different
I wake up now to a morning filled with sun
I wake up now and I finally don't feel numb
Got something in my life I really want
And I feel like the change has just begun
Look at me now oh, look who I've become
I guess with time you can get what you want
I look back on the things that made me run
They made me who I am
The reason for all I've done

I feel the rain it burns like pain
Alone again where are my friends?
I need to change things in my brain
That's why we take drugs to escape
But that don't change a fucking thing
I need some space it's not a phase
These sleepy days they keep me sane
I'll dream of rain that 'cause no pain
