		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Pretty, tell me I'm pretty
Even when I wake up without no makeup
Mornin' breath, still kiss me (mm)
Love me, tell me you love me
And even when I feel it, still need to hear it
'Cause your words really touch me (Yeah, yeah)

I'ma need a little more than you bein' present, I
Need a little more than you just givin' me presents, I need
Communication, affirmations, appreciation
So say it, say it, say it, ooh-ooh

Over and over, over and over
Over and over again
Over and over, over and over
Over and over again

Worthy, tell me I'm worthy
I'll be your peace and everything you need
Just promise not to hurt me (promise not to hurt me, no, no)

I'ma need a little more than you bein' present, I
Need a little more than you just givin' me presents, I need
Communication, affirmations, appreciation
So say it (say it), say it (say it), say it (say it), ooh-ooh

Over and over, over and over
Over and over again
Over and over, over and over
Over and over again
I wanna hear you
Over and over (say it), over and over (say it)
Over and over again (say it to me, baby)
Over and over, over and over (oh)
Over and over again

Yeah, yeah (baby, can you tell me right now?)
Really need to hear it like now
Tell me that you want me, tell me that you need me
'Fore I have to turn the lights out

(Turn the lights out, turn the lights out)
(Turn the lights out, turn the lights out)
(Turn the lights out, turn the lights out)
