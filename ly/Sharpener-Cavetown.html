		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sharpener's callin' me again
Tryin' to turn it into some
Thing I can draw into my skin
Make it a picture that I'll love
Instead of something that I wish
I could get in the bath and scrub right off

Why am I ashamed to look the way I do?
All 'cause an escape to me was just a sharpener to you

Big old pill to inch around
There's no copping out this time
Tried my best to get it down (get, get, get, get it down)
Sometimes seems like I'm still young
lookin' at the boy across the sink
Thinking, "What the hell have you just done?" 
(What the hell have you just done?)

Why am I ashamed to look the way I do?
All 'cause an escape to me was just a sharpener to you
Why am I afraid of things I let inside my room?
Just wanted some company, broke the sharpener in two

You say, why am I like this?
You mean, why am I stupid?
Guess you know you're not tryin' to fix it
You mean, why am I like this?
You say, why am I selfish?
Guess you know, honey, you can't help it
