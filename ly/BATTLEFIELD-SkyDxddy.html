		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been this way for centuries
So we must trust no man
Learn to read your enemies
Or they'll kill you where you stand
Soldiers man your stations
This is what you've waited for
Remember all your training
As we go to war

Defending someone's life is much bigger than a legacy
We don't need your distractions or your homicidal tendencies
It seems to me you're neck deep into one too many pleasantries
Gee it must be nice to be above all of this peasantry
Hesitate reluctant with your kindness and your chivalry
Could have fooled me twice but I can see what is in front of me
Don't know a damn thing bout this thing we all call loyalty
Who the hell just died and made you mother fuckin royalty
Bitch were not against friendly fire we will kill
Trying to play god doesn't play out very well does it
If you push our buttons then it's likely blood will spill
Yes if we find the need to slit your throat we fuckin will

It's been this way for centuries
So we must trust no man
Learn to read your enemies
Or they'll kill you where you stand
Soldiers man your stations
This is what you've waited for
Remember all your training
As we go to war

I am not your bitch
Fuck the congress
Fuck the legislature
I am not on earth
Just so I can be your incubator
AK47 assault rifles and a Glock
All are more protected than a woman screaming stop
If you want a fight you got it
Put em up let's see them hands
3.9 million women meaning you don't stand a chance
And this right here's my temple
I have every right to choose
And if you trespass on my body
I have every right to choose

Bitch were not against friendly fire we will kill
Trying to play god doesn't play out very well does it
If you push our buttons then its likely blood will spill
Yes if we find the need to slit your throat we fuckin will

It's been this way for centuries
So we must trust no man
Learn to read your enemies
Or they'll kill you where you stand
Soldiers man your stations
This is what you've waited for
Remember all your training
As we go to war

Our mothers did not sacrifice their lives so we could die
At some back alley abortion clinic
You have been denied
You took away our rights when we had nothing more to take
And you don't give a fuck about all of the lives you put at stake so

Bitch were not against friendly fire we will kill
Trying to play god doesn't play out very well does it
If you push our buttons then its likely blood will spill
Yes if we find the need to slit your throat we fuckin will

It's been this way for centuries
So we must trust no man
Learn to read your enemies
Or they'll kill you where you stand
Soldiers man your stations
This is what you've waited for
Remember all your training
As we go to war
