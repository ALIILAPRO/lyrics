		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Someday I'll be coming for you
You know what I'm wanting to do
I know the words to say
To draw you in so close to me

Over and over
We swore it was over
But just like wild clover
Love grows at light speed

Hang on 'til I see you again
I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end so hang on 
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)

This was just a very first start
There's more that I hold in my heart
I'm waiting for a chance
To show you how I long to be

Over and over
We swore it was over
But just like I'm solar
You warm up to me

Hang on 'til I see you again
I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end so hang on 
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)
Hang on 'til the break of the day
We'll cast all our troubles away
You know that this isn't the end so hang on 
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)

Sweet thing
As long as I'm breathing
And my heart is still beating
I'm gonna be coming for you

(Hang on, hang on, hang on)
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)

Hang on 'til I see you again
I'm going to be more than a friend
You know that this isn't the end so hang on 
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)
Hang on 'til the break of the day
We'll cast all our troubles away
You know that this isn't the end so hang on 
(Hang on, hang on, hang on)

(Hang on) Hang on 'til I see you again
(Hang on) I'm going to be more than a friend
(Hang on) You know that this isn't the end so hang on
Hang on
