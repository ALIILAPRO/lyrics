		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you dancin' right in front of me, yeah
I see you need some help tonight
I know that others see you smiling
But I see sadness in your eyes
Let's leave tomorrow as a mystery
Let's leave the past where it belongs
Let's let the sorrow out and give it wings
Let's watch it fly, let's give it love

I know you wanna let it out, just get it out and start flying
But baby, if you push it down, you push it down, it's like lying
So babe, you gotta feel it on, just let it go and start crying
And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you, go

You need a little bit of love tonight and baby, I got it
You need a little bit of hope and I, baby, I got ya
You need a little bit of eye to eye, and baby, I'm right here
We need a little bit of love tonight, a little bit of love tonight

A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love tonight
A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love tonight
A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love tonight
A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love to-

Fill up the emptiness inside of you
The angels come to those who seek
There's nothing out for you to do here
The only action is to be

I know you wanna let it out, just get it out and start flying
But baby, if you push it down, you push it down, it's like lying
So babe, you gotta feel it on, just let it go and start crying
And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you, go

You need a little bit of love tonight and baby, I got it
You need a little bit of hope and I, baby, I got ya
You need a little bit of eye to eye
And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you go

A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love tonight
A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love tonight
A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love tonight
A little bit of eye to eye, a little bit of love to-

And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you
Yes baby, I'll hold you close (you need a little bit of love tonight)
And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you
Yes baby, I'll hold you close (you need a little bit of love tonight)
And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you
Yes baby. I'll hold you close (you need a little bit of love tonight)
And baby, I'll hold you, yes baby, I'll hold you
Yes baby, I'll hold you close (you need a little bit of love tonight)

Need a little bit of love tonight, need a little bit of love tonight
Need a little bit of love tonight, need a little bit of love tonight
Need a little bit of love tonight, need a little bit of love tonight
Need a little bit of love tonight
