		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roll with me, feel with me
Healing me is your fee to me
I don't wanna know I don't wanna play
Feeling this way I dont really know how to keep self control
I can't hang up I don't want this to end
Manipulate
Poison was your given not like I had any choice in
Knowing what I've hidden making you feel like you tripping
Feeling like I'm tripping now that I know what youve hidden
Saying I'm your poison now that I know what you're missing
Roll with me feel with me
Healing me is your fee to me
I don't wanna know I don't wanna play
Feeling this way I dont really know how to keep self control
Poison was your given not like I had any choice in
Knowing what I've hidden making you feel like you tripping
Feeling like I'm tripping now that I know what youve hidden
Saying im your poison now that I know what you're missing
Rollin me pealin me seein me
How I'm feeling this pain
Torture myself as I decide how to handle the strain
Gave you my trust all you want is lust
Its love on the brain
Stuck on my mind you know that I'm weak
A permanent stain
Poison was your given not like I had any choice in
Knowing what I've hidden making you feel like you tripping
Feeling like im tripping now that I know what youve hidden
Saying im your poison now that I know what you're missing
