		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No god above us
Can we repent this sin?
No soul is innocent
Everybody wants to love

You walk alone into the darkest night
You'll never sleep until you're satisfied
You need love, you need one, you need him

You'll never get your mama's wedding ring
Father always said you ruined everything
But you prayed, begged and prayed
Heart unchanged

Don't be scared, little child, you're no demon
(You're no demon, don't be frightened now)
There's a god in the sky, don't believe him
(Don't believe him, god does love you now)
Don't be scared, little child of that feeling
You're in love
You found heaven

Your heart is breaking as you leave that door
You never meant to start this holy war
But you're trapped, pack your bags
And don't look back

Don't be scared, little child, you're no demon
(You're no demon, don't be frightened now)
There's a god in the sky, don't believe him
(Don't believe him, god does love you now)
Don't be scared, little child of that feeling
You're in love
You found heaven
(You're no demon, don't be frightened now)
