		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna watch you, I wanna stay like this
I wanna feel it all every time that we kiss
I want your mother to stay friends with mine
I want this feeling to pass in time
But you know my body now and I know yours
We put so many things between these walls
And every gift you buy me, I know what's inside
What do I do now?
There's nothing left to find

Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you

What if I cleaned up?
What if I worked on my skin?
I could scrub until I am red, hot, weak and thin
Too tired to run away
What do I do now?
There's nothing left to say

Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you

Into the darkness, or is it the light?
Should I be waking up
Or finding a place to sleep tonight?
Who will I be
Now that you're no longer next to me?

Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you

Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
Don't know how to keep loving you
Now that I know you so well
I just wanna keep loving you
