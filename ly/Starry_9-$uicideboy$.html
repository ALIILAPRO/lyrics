		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Players never)
(You did good, $lick)
(It's a Smash)

Shawty said to stop gaslighting but I keep on lighting gas
Puff a blunt, hit from the back while I ash it on her ass
I'ma nasty motherfucker, long lasting motherfucker
Grab her hair and make her pussy drip, I'm splashing in a puddle
Blanco been a pimp, no I ain't never been a sucker
All these fuckboys on my dick, you would think that I'm their mother
The one and fucking only no there won't ever be another
Me and Wetto verse the world I'll do whatever for my brother
Take one in the dome make it count 'cause I'ma shoot back
Pull up like a shadow always got 'em asking who's that
Blanco such a mystery I thought you bitches knew that
Why yo' man's such a liar? Swear he need a new cap
Two black hearses peeling off into the night sky
Shit I might cry, sitting back thinking 'bout my life
Let out a slight sigh
Shit always goin' wrong but I pop out on the right side
Reppin' 59

I see them fuckboys steady talking but they never get specific (Northside)
My pimpin' got her dripping like she walked the whole Pacific (Northside)
Scarecrow be the mythic how I break the laws of physics (Northside)
Choppa monolithic, paint your face like hieroglyphics (Northside)
Blanco busting Roxy's with the Amex with no limit
I might rob my local clinic, now it's methadone for dinner
Black coupe, hearse boy, whip look like a cursed toy
Switch it up the next day, pick a new one out the convoy
Sickest of the richest told my bitch we need some bitches (Northside)
Counting all these Benjis got my brain fucked up and glitching (Northside)
Itching off that fenty I made millions nodding off (Northside)
Jean Wetto Basquiat, Slicky fugue it like he Bach (Northside)
All my exes in the rearview, looking for a take two
Breaking hoes hearts on occasions turn 'em gay too
That one you can't replace boo, that pain up in your Swisher
Monet of the Grey, I up that K and paint a picture
