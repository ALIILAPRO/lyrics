		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Look beyond the Earth, heading set for the stars
Interplanetary, some are near, some are far
Terraform a new world, survival for mankind
Options but a few, we are running out of time

Should you climb aboard
A voyage, the first of its kind
Ready to explore
All that you've known left behind

Our Holy Grail
Now redefined
Our purpose, a thread 
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here, digital man

Alien, changed forever
Newfound world in the stars

Understand the meaning
Certain we'll extend the scale of consciousness
Woman, child, and man
Multiplanet species, out amongst the stars
Not stuck in and around who and what we are

Time to climb aboard
Countdown to take off on time
Systems are online (five, four, three, two)
Farewell to all humankind (one)

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand
Life beyond here, digital man

Alien, changed forever
Newfound world, here we are

Our Holy Grail
Clearly defined
Our purpose, a thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

Our Holy Grail
Read between the lines
One purpose, one thread
Weaving through time
Now with the means to expand

I am the alien
Out here in the stars
We'll search 'til we find
No matter how far
A far better world
For all human race
And beyond
