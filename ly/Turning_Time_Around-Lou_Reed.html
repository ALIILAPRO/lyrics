		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  She says, what do you call love
Well I call it harry
Oh, please I'm being serious
What do you call love

Well I don't call it family and I don't call it lust
And as we all know marriage isn't a must
And I suppose in the end, it's a matter of trust
If I had to I'd call love time

She says, what do you call love
Can't you be more specific
What do you call love
Is it more than the heart's hieroglyphic

Well for me time has no meaning, no future, no past
And when you're in love, you don't have to ask
There's never enough time to hold love in your grasp
Turning time around

Turning time around
That is what love is
Turning time around
Yes, that is what love is

My time is your time when you're in love
And time is what you never have enough of
You can't see or hold it, it's exactly like love

Turning time around
Turning time around
Turning time around
Turning time around
Turning time around
Well I gotta have it
I gotta-gotta-gotta have it

Turning, turning time around
Gotta have it, turning time around
Turning, turning time around
Turning time around
