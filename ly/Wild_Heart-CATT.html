		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I know you’ve been hurt
Feeling like carrying the weight of the world
You’ve seen them
You’ve tried to understand
Healed them all because you wanted to

Flowers raining on your hair
you can’t keep em off
even in despair
Golden light emanating in circles
when you dance
when you dance
do not try to comprehend

You never have to
heal your wild
clear your wild
still your wild heart anymore.

I know you’ve been doubted
nourishing the knowing deep down and
you’ve believed them
you’ve tried to understand
betrayed your faith cause you didn’t know

Flowers raining on your hair
you can’t keep em off
even in despair
Golden light emanating in circles
when you dance
when you dance

You never have to
heal your wild
clear your wild
still your wild heart anymore.

You never have to
heal your wild
clear your wild
still your wild heart anymore.

Wild Heart
Wild Heart
Wild Heart (you are seen you are here)
Wild Heart (you are seen we are here)
Wild Heart (you are seen you are here)
Wild Heart (you are seen we are here)

You never have to
heal your wild
still your wild heart anymore.

You never have to
heal your wild
clear your wild
still your wild heart anymore.
