		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Believer, took me over like a fever
'Caught ya hiding in the smoke, smoke, smoke
Like a meteor I glow, glow, glow

Ooh, lay your red hand on me, baby
Ooh, ooh, as I go

Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning

Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?

Well, I'll release her
From the bindings of her teachers
What they're hiding there is broke, broke, broke
Like the river sticks I flow, flow, flow

Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?

Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?
Whatcha gonna do when you get into the water?

Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
Into the sea, out of fire
All that burning
