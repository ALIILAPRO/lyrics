		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Alright everybody sit down 
Quiet down listen up
I brought you all here to recite the annual obituaries
Like every year we'll start with A and we'll end with Z
Alright is the band ready?
Ready
Alright hit it boils

A is Amber who drowned in a pool
B is for Billy who was eaten by ghouls
C is for Curt with disease of the brain
D is for Daniel derailed on a train
E is for Eric who was buried alive
F is for Frank who was stabbed through the eye
G is for Greg who died in the womb
H is for Heather who was sealed in a tomb

One by one we bite the dust
We kick the bucket and begin to rust
Give up the ghost when your number's up
We all fall down
Ashes to ashes bones to paste
You'll wither away in your resting place
Eternity in a wooden case we all fall down

I is for Isaac who lost his front brakes
J is for Johnny who was bitten by snakes
K is for Kimmy who was shot in the head
L is for Larry who bled and bled
M is for Marie who was burnt to a crisp
N is for Nick pummeled by fists
O is for Olive who lived life too fast
P is for pat who swallowed some glass

One by one we bite the dust
We kick the bucket and begin to rust
Give up the torch when the number's up
We all fall down
Ashes to ashes bones to paste
You'll wither away in your resting place
Eternity in a wooden case we all fall down

Q is for Quentin who turned the wrong trail
Are is for Rayna who rotted in jail
S is for Steve who was shot with a bow
T is for Tony who froze in the snow
You is for Urich who was trampled by hooves
V is for Vanessa who fell off her roof
W is for Will who was hit by a car
X is for Xavier who was sunk in the tar
Y is for Yessy who fell from a plane
Z is for Zach who simply went insane
