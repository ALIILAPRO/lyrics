		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  The cradle of civilization sparks my fascination
Truth ignites our generation to change what's been programmed
Inside my mind

Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye

Listen to me when i tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent

Rudiments of interpersonal communication
Truth will uproot and bring war's devastation to light

Don't you turn a blind eye
Change what's been programmed inside
Don't you turn a blind eye
Staying silent is a crime

Listen to me when i tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent

Change starts in your mind
Leave the past behind
Forget everything you know
Make a change, let go
Make a change, let go

Let go, let go, let go

Listen to me when I tell you
Feel the passion in my breath
Stay on top if they let you
Cause the change is permanent!
Change is permanent
Change is permanent
