		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's my first night out with you
Treat me right and buy me shoes
Let me be your fantasy
Play with me
I wanna be your girl
(Wanna be your girl, wanna be your)

Just give me some time, I'll be ready
Do my make-up, bathe in my perfume
Quick shower, won't take too long
I'll be done, just sing this song

So, wrap me in plastic and make me shine
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
Let's build a dog out of sticks and twine
I can call you master, you can call me mine

Wrap me in plastic and make me shine
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
Let's build a dog out of sticks and twine
I can call you master, you can call me mine

(Wrap me in plastic, wrap me in plastic)
(Wrap me in plastic, wrap me in plastic)
(You can call me mine)
(Wrap, wrap, wrap me in)
(Wrap, wrap, wrap me in)
(You can call me mine)

Move me, tell me what to do
If you're happy, I am too
Please, just show me what you like
Don't be shy
I wanna be your girl
(Your girl, your girl)

Just give me some time, I'll be ready
Do my make-up, bathe in my perfume
Quick shower, won't take too long
I'll be done, just sing this song

So, wrap me in plastic and make me shine
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
Let's build a dog out of sticks and twine
I can call you master, you can call me mine

Wrap me in plastic and make me shine
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
Let's build a dog out of sticks and twine
I can call you master, you can call me mine
(Wrap me in plastic, wrap me in plastic)
(Wrap me in plastic, wrap me in plastic)
(You can call me mine)
(Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap me in)
(Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap me in)
(You can call me mine)

Just give me some time, I'll be ready
Quick shower, won't take too long
Just give me some time, I'll be ready
Quick shower, won't take too long
Just sing this song

Wrap me in plastic and make me shine
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
Let's build a dog out of sticks and twine
I can call you master, you can call me mine
(Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap me in plastic)
We can make a dollhouse, follow your design
(Wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap, wrap me in)
I can call you master, you can call me mine
