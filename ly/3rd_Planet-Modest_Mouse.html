		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I've got this thing that I consider my only art of fucking people over
My boss just quit the job
Says he's goin out to find blind spots and he'll do it

The 3rd planet is sure that they're being watched
By an eye in the sky that can't be stopped when you get to the promise land
You're gonna shake that eye's hand

Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well outside naked, shivering, looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

Well, a 3rd had just been made and we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then, was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

Well the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Your heart felt good
It was drippin' pitch and made of wood
And your hands and knees
Felt cold and wet on the grass beneath
Well outside naked, shiverin' looking blue
From the cold sunlight that's reflected off the moon
Baby cum angels, fly around you
Reminding you we used to be three and not just two
And that's how the world began
And that's how the world will end

Well, a 3rd had just been made and we were swimming in the water
Didn't know then, was it a son, was it a daughter
And it occurred to me that the animals are swimming
Around in the water in the oceans in our bodies
And another had been found, another ocean on the planet
Given that our blood is just like the Atlantic, and how

Well, the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
And the universe is shaped exactly like the earth
If you go straight long enough you'll end up where you were
The universe is shaped exactly like the earth

Everything that keeps me together is falling apart
I've got this thing that I consider my only art of fucking people over
