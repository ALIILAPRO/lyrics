		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah
Fuck that, whoa, uh

Fuck that bitch, I changed the plan
Switch my style like I switch hands
Block the witness, take the stand
Fuck out the way bitch, back it up
Shit better get played in a palace (word)
I can't treat niggas like big deals
Why put up a front? I'm callous, bald (ha)
I look like Ray Allen (real)
These niggas make beats on big wheels
Yo' files is not a challenge (nah)
Boy, you can't rap for shit
Shuttlesworth blessed me with talent
Hairline proof God needs balance
Bald 
(Dwayne Wade, bro) Uh

look, I'm cashin' out
Young Darby I'm taggin' in
They gon' bring your casket out
I hope that you fit in it, ooh
What you doin', babe?
How you get caught with no Gat? (Yeah, yeah)
You niggas must got no pride
Peggy gon' give you no slack, for real
'Cause you pussy

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Keep my business off the 'Gram
Switch my style like I switch hands
Goin' to war on foreign land
Fuck out the way bitch, back it up
Shit better get played in a palace
Wait, uh

I can't treat niggas like big deals (yeah)
These toys don't come with no kid's meal
Been there, done that, done seen it
Not my girl but I fuck her like she is
They be fuckin' up my lyrics on Genius
And these pussy ass critics repeat it
Been the same since Even Stevens
Y'all niggas switch like the seasons (facts)
Y'all lives ain't got no meanin' (why?)
And them deals ain't got no freedom
I can't just loop it leave and it
Gotta smack it up, rip it up, and eat it (yeah, ha)
You can't feed your kid 'cause
You spent that shit on your car (you broke)
Tape my hands, I'm going over squares' heads like a VCR, ha

Bald
