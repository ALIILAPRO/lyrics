		  Welcome to the circus

Welcome to the shit show
Just another freak show
Hang your hat and hate at the door
It's a game of torture
Souls are made to order
Everything you wanted and more

You've gotta kill somebody to thrill somebody
Everybody's gotta reason to bleed
You've gotta fuck somebody to know somebody
That motherfucker ain't me

Am I the only one
That doesn't buy into the lies?
Am I the only one
That doesn't wear a disguise?
'Cause if I can't break it
And I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one
That isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus

Grab your favorite stones
They came for broken bones
That's what happens when you sign on the line
There's no need for excuses
Everybody loses
Only way you'll ever win is to die

You've gotta burn somebody to learn somebody
Everybody's got a Jekyll and Hyde
You gotta curse somebody to hurt somebody
Everybody needs a reason to die

Am I the only one
That doesn't buy into the lies?
Am I the only one
That doesn't wear a disguise?
'Cause if I can't break it
And I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one
That isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus

You gotta hide your face
(Sell them what they bought 'cha)
(Teach them what they taught 'cha)
You gotta hide your veins
(This is how they gut 'cha)
(Right before they cut ya)
You gotta hide your pain
(Ugly how they rule you)
(That's just how they screw you)
You gotta hide your rage
(Everyone has earned this)
(Welcome to the circus)

Tickey, tickey, tasket
Time to burn the casket
Time to burn this motherfucker down

Am I the only one
That doesn't buy into the lies?
Am I the only one
That doesn't wear a disguise? (Doesn't wear a disguise)
'Cause if I can't break it
And I can't change it
Then tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one
That isn't just here for the show? (Not just here for the)

Am I
Tell me, how will I know? (Tell me, how will I?)
Am I the only one
That isn't just here for the show?
Welcome to the circus
