		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna love you, and treat you right
I wanna love you, every day and every night
We'll be together, with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provide the bread

Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
I wanna know, wanna know, wanna know now
I got to know, got to know, got to know now
I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table

I wanna love you, I wanna 
Love and treat, love and treat you right
I wanna love you every day and every night
We'll be together, yeah, with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, yeah, oh yeah, of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
For Jah provides the bread

Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Is this love, is this love, is this love
Is this love that I'm feelin'?
Whoa, oh yes I know, yes I know, yes I know now
Oh yes I know, yes I know, yes I know now

I, I'm willing and able
So I throw my cards on your table
See, I wanna love ya, I wanna love and treat ya
Love and treat ya right

I wanna love you every day and every night
We'll be together, with a roof right over our heads
We'll share the shelter, of my single bed
We'll share the same room, yeah
Jah provides the bread
We'll share the shelter
