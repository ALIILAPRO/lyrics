		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When you close your eyes and go to sleep
And it's down to the sound of a heartbeat
I can hear the things that you're dreamin' about
When you open up your heart and the truth comes out

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep

When I hold you in my arms at night
Don't you know you're sleepin' in a spotlight
And all your dreams that you keep inside
You're tellin' me the secrets that you just can't hide

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep

When you close your eyes, and you fall asleep
Everything about you is a mystery

You tell me that you want me
You tell me that you need me
You tell me that you love me
And I know that I'm right
'Cause I hear it in the night

I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
When you're talkin' in your sleep
I hear the secrets that you keep
