		  It's looking like I'm right
I hope that you taking my side
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
Keep up

You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
Keep up

I'm always wanting what I just can't have
Butterflies in my stomach cause you're just so bad

Showed you wrong
I'm gon' shit on you
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now

It's looking like I'm right
I hope that you taking my side
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
You're too slow
Try and keep up with me now
