		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I spent all my money on a big old fancy car
For these bright-eyed hunnies
Oh, yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)
Yeah, you young wild girls
I always come back to you, come back to you

I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh, I still dream of simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist
When you live like this
That much I know, yes I know

All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long, all night long

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)
Yeah, you young wild girls
I always come back to you, come back to you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
Yeah, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

All you young wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young wild girls
No matter what you do (No matter what you do)
Yeah, you young wild girls
I always come back to you, come back to you
