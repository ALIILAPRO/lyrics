		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All eyes on me in the party
I'm still takin' risks like Armani G
GMD that's the army
I get sturdy but I'm not from Canarsie
Dead dream, Killy mash up punani
If I like her I might buy her a bag
Smokin' weed like Uncle Jehlani
Hit first time so I know it's a wrap
All eyes on me in the party
I'm still takin' risks like Armani G
GMD that's the army
I get sturdy but I'm not from Canarsie
Dead dream, Killy mash up punani
If I like her I might buy her a bag
Smokin' weed like Uncle Jehlani
Hit first time so I know it's a wrap

Hit one time, wanna do it again (uh-huh)
Really, I wanna fuck you and your friend
I love punani, I can't pretend
Pipe man's girl, now he wants revenge (hahaha)
Can't lie, fell in love with skengs
Same way I fell in love with- (shh)
My favorite mash got a beam on the end
Clip full up, full up, clip filled to the brim
Try and pull up, pull up, get burned with a-
High as a-, went straight to my head
Gang hop out there, start shakin' her dreads
Done her, done her, then I done up her friend
When I do it again, I don't know, it depends
Bang, boom, bye-bye, got somethin' for them
Shit then, this Russian's heavy again
Shengyeng, Killy Milly wan' give you the length

All eyes on me in the party
I'm still takin' risks like Armani G (Fivi')
GMD that's the army (paow)
I get sturdy but I'm not from Canarsie (paow)
Dead dream, Killy mash up punani (yeah)
If I like her I might buy her a bag (yeah)
Smokin' weed like Uncle Jehlani (aah)
Hit first time so I know it's a wrap (yeah)

No talkin', niggas know my Steelo (they do)
Fuck a bitch, and keep her on the D Low (I do)
In the cut, dodgin' all the RICOs (skrrt)
Shootin' everythin', this shit B Row (paow)
Don't offer your guns, I don't need those (nah)
I really got mines on reload (I do)
Up early mornin' like E-Bro (I am)
Take a Percocet and get (?) (paow)
I don't matter if we in the same city
Don't send the location, I don't wanna come
I'm a demon, I don't wanna have fun
You really love me? Give me one of them guns (paow)
I call up Russ 'cause he one of them ones
When I'm in this party I wanna get drunk
They only talk about me under their tongues
But they don't ask me 'cause they know where I'm from (from, bitch)
Every-everybody know Pop from Canarsie
I see a opp, I'ma flock up the party (grah)
And they know ain't no stoppin' the dawgies
Watch who you with 'cause they not sayin' sorry (no)
Fly shooters hoppin' out the 'Rari (skrrt)
Shots fired, now he wanna call me (grrah)
Off the Percocets feelin' gnarly (grrah)
With a bitch badder than the Barbie (baow)

All eyes on me in the party
I'm till takin' risks like Armani G
GMD that's the army
I get sturdy but I'm not from Canarsie (let's go)
Dead dream, Killy mash up punani
If I like her I might buy her a bag
Smokin' weed like Uncle Jehlani (paow)
Hit first time so I know it's a wrap (paow, paow, paow)
All eyes on me in the party
I'm till takin' risks like Armani G
GMD that's the army
I get sturdy but I'm not from Canarsie
Dead dream, Killy mash up punani
If I like her I might buy her a bag
Smokin' weed like Uncle Jehlani
Hit first time so I know it's a wrap
