		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You should know better now
To fuck it up and fuck around
See yourself through my eyes
You're so fake, it's all lies
Was she good? Just what you liked?
Did you cum? How many times?
Tell the truth, wait, nevermind

I can't forgive, I can't forget
I should have known you're full of it
I'm not upset, I'm fucking pissed
I spelled it out, you're illiterate
Did you do the things you know I like?
Roll your tongue, make her cum twenty times?
Don't tell me to relax or try to get me back
I'm packing up your bags

You should know better now
To fuck it up and fuck around
See yourself through my eyes
You're so fake, it's all lies
Was she good? Just what you liked?
Did you cum? How many times?
Tell the truth, wait, nevermind

Never listen to a monologue
Told by a lying fraud
I don't need to make sense
Of all your bullshit reasons
Did you listen to her heartbeat like you did with me?
Was it more than sex? Pure physicality
Don't bother giving me any more bad apologies

You should know better now
To fuck it up and fuck around
See yourself through my eyes
You're so fake, it's all lies
Was she good? Just what you liked?
Did you cum? How many times?
Tell the truth, wait, nevermind

She was a different kind, made you feel satisfied
Momentary happiness makes you feel alive
You had it all but you get be easily seduced by
The things that rip me apart
I'm a safe bet but you get intrigued
By uncertainty and mystique
Was I stupid enough to believe 
you would change that for me?
