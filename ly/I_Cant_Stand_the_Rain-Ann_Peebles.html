		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories

Hey windowpane, do you remember?
How sweet it used to be
When we was together
Everything was so grand
Now that we've parted
There's just one sound that I just can't stand

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain against my window
'Cause he's not here with me

Whoa, empty pillow
Where his head used to lay
I know you've got some sweet memories
But like the window, you ain't got nothin' to say

I can't stand the rain against my window
Bringing back sweet memories
I can't stand the rain
Against my window
Just keeps on haunting me
Hey rain, get off my window
Because he's not here with me
