		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I never wanted to be taken
But now I'm feeling so left out
So I don't care where I go
I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving

Got about a half a tank left
That could do but only if I'm lucky
But either way, I'm leaving, oh, I'm leaving

On my way to paradise
A little voice says, "Don't think twice
And don't look back if you want things to change"

Ah, ah, guess I'll have to love you from afar
Ah, it's okay, 'cause all I need's my car
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road I go

Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road

Takes about a week to get there
Maybe two if I stop to sleep it off here
But I can't sleep, so I'm leaving, yeah, I'm leaving

Keep on driving through the night
I find myself a slice of life
To show me that I'm heading the right way

And ah, ah, guess you'll have to love me from afar
Ah, it's okay, 'cause all I need's this car
Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road I go

Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road I go

Out on the road, out on the road (but with nowhere to go)
Out on the road, out on the road
