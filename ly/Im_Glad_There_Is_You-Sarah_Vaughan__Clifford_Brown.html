		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Said I, many times, love is illusion
A feeling result of confusion
With knowing smile and blazing sigh
A cynical so and so as I

I feel so sure, so positive
So utterly, unchangingly certain
That I never was aware of loving you
'Til suddenly I realized, there was love and you and I

In this world of ordinary people
Extraordinary people
I'm glad there is you

In this world of over-rated pleasures
Of under-rated treasures
I'm glad, there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me, beside me, beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where many, many play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad, there is you

I live to love
I love to live with you beside me
This role so new
I'll muddle through with you to guide me

In this world where many, many play at love, play at love
And hardly any stay in love
I'm glad there is you
More than ever, I'm glad, there's you
