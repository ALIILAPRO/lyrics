		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You ask me
Why it is I come to you
When someone else is just as good
I asked them but they said the same
Didn't even ask my name

Explain to me 
Just what it is you have to lose 
Take a minute in my shoes 
Don't you feel like you've paid your dues 
Already 

I'll show you
That all our fates are so entwined
Don't lose your faith in humankind 
Just don't forget my state of mind
Is fragile

Together
We can enjoy the taste of dignity 
As long as you believe in me 
I'll show you my reality 
I've seen a few

You ask me
Why it is I come to you
When someone else is just as good
I asked them but they said the same
Didn't even ask my name

There's another refugee 
There's another refugee
Oh oh there's another refugee
Oh oh there's another refugee
