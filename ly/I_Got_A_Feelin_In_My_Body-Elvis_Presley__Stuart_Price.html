		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When Moses walked the children out of Egypt land
He said now don't you worry, we're in the Lords' hands
He's gonna walk beside us, the time is coming near
He's gonna wash away our misery and our fear

I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way

When Daniel faced the lion there wasn't any doubt
We've got to be like Daniel and the Lord will help us out

I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way

Won't you lift your eyes up, children
Lift 'em to the sky
Heaven stands before you
Gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary
Comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil
Sweatin' on the street

I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way

Won't you lift your eyes up, children
Lift 'em to the sky
Heaven stands before you
Gates are open wide
Shelter for the weary
Comfort for the weak
We'll leave the devil's evil
Sweatin' on the street

I gotta, I gotta, I gotta
I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way

I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know right now
I wanna know
Yeah, yeah
I got a feelin'
I got a feelin'

I got a feelin' in my body
This will be our lucky day
We'll be released from all our sorrow
Leave it layin' along the way
