		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Baby, we'll be together when you come over
Ya, I need you to
Get you a ticket and I'll make you fly over
You won't make it through
I need some loving yet a little bit sober
Won't say goodbye
You won't regret when you're a little bit older
Because

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
We're over, you're under
You never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear
And that's the deal my dear
And that's the deal my dear

My mama's mad but I never cared
And babe, I don't regret it
I'm pretty sorry that you never met
But girl, I'll work on that
Even a million miles won't get me going
I'll meet you every night
In every dream I find your love
That makes me smile

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
We're over, you're under
You never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear
And that's the deal my dear
Ooh yeah 

I'll leave you with my fantasy
So, I won't leave you till' I die
Girl, you are my only remedy
If you go I won't survive anymore

Whenever, wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
We're over, you're under
You never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear

And that's the deal my dear, yeah yeah oh 
Yeah, we can always play by ear
And that's the deal my dear
