		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I ain't like no one you met before
I'm running for the front
When they're all running for the door
And I won't sit down won't back out
You can't ever shut me up
'Cause I'm on a mission
And I won't quit now

In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
Because the battle's already been won

I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to shout
I am sold out
I'm sold out
With every single
Step that I take now
With every drop of blood
Left in my veins
I'm gonna be making it count
I am sold out

This ain't just some temporary phase
You can't face this kind of grace
And leave the way you came
This is permanent with intent
And there won't be no stopping it now
I'm on a mission and it's heaven sent

In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
'Cause my soul is like a stadium

And I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to shout
I am sold out
I'm sold out
With every single
Step that I take now
With every drop of blood
Left in my veins
I'm gonna be making it count
I am sold out

No trials coming against me
Could put a dent in my passion
They're just an opportunity
To put my faith into action

In a world full of followers
I'll be a leader
In a world full of doubters
I'll be a believer
I'm stepping out without a hesitation
I ain't got nothing left to be afraid of

I'm sold out
I'm no longer living
Just for myself
Running after Jesus
With my whole heart
And now I'm ready to shout
I am sold out
I'm sold out
With every single
Step that I take now
With every drop of blood
Left in my veins
I'm gonna be making it count
I am sold out
