		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable

I'm dead, but you probably can't tell
Been scalin' the walls of the wishin' well
My head's in the sky, but I'm fallin' backwards, yeah
And night crawlin', I'm wide awake in my dreams
Wake up and I don't know what anything means
We're completely different people than the people we wanted

Have we outgrown this city? I'm so tired
Of wishin' I was somewhere different from where you are
With my eyes wide shut

I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
And no, I don't get high off you anymore

Smilin' into the mirror like a psychopath
Can't remember the last time you made me laugh
Dryin' tears with my lipstick
You're the first on my hit list

Have we outgrown this city? I'm so tired
Of wishin' I was somewhere different from where you are
With my eyes wide shut

I say I love you, but I don't
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
And no, I don't get high off you

Have we outgrown this city?
Wish I were somewhere different from where you are
Have we outgrown this city?
Or have I gone missing in the dark?

I say I love you, but I don't (but I don't)
I say I'm fine, but I'm miserable (I'm miserable)
Oh, 'cause I don't get high off you anymore
And no, I don't get high off you (I don't get, I don't get)
Anymore
