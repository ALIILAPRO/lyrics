		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you want to
I'll make you feel something real just to bother you
Now I got you
Under my thumb, like a drug, I will smother you
I'll be the one
Be the moon, be the sun
Be the rain in your song
Go and put that record on
If you want to
I'll be the one
Be the tongue that will swallow you

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh

Shame, shame
Shame, shame

Who? What? (Shame)
Where? When? (Shame)
Just move along, nothing wrong (shame)
'Til we meet again (shame)
I'll be the end (shame, shame)
I'll be the war at your door (shame)
Come and let me in (shame)
I'll be the one (shame)
Be the moon, be the sun (shame)
Be the rain in your song (shame)
Go and put that record on (shame)
If you want to (shame, shame)
I'll be the one (shame)
Be the tongue that will swallow you (shame)

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame

Another splinter under the skin
Another season of loneliness
I found a reason and buried it
Beneath a mountain of emptiness
Oh, oh oh, oh, oh oh

Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
Shame, shame
