		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away 
If he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walkin' 'cross the room
"Let it Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know
It's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again 
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away 
If he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night (ooh, babe)
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold (yeah, yeah)
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling
Or if it's true love that he thinks of
So next Christmas
I'm not all alone, babe

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again 
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away 
If he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me like oh-oh-oh
On the 25th by that fire place, oh-oh-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Ooh, baby
(Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
If he will be, if he will be here (Santa, tell me, Santa, tell me)
Oh-oh-oh

Santa, tell me if you're really there (Santa, tell me, 'cause I really care)
Don't make me fall in love again 
If he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me, tell me, boy)
'Cause I can't give it all away 
If he won't be here next year

Santa, tell me if you're really there (tell me, tell me, baby)
Don't make me fall in love again 
If he won't be here next year (if he won't be, if he won't be here)
Santa, tell me if he really cares (tell me, do you care?)
'Cause I can't give it all away 
If he won't be here next year
