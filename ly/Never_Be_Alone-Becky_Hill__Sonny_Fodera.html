		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've been stuck in the silence
Watching life passing us by
Slowly we lost our minds somewhere inside these walls
Did you forget the feeling?
Tryna find it staring at the ceiling
Slowly we lost our minds somewhere inside these walls, yeah

I ain't seen your face, we ain't spoke for days
Let me lift you up to restore your faith
It's all that I wanna do, yeah, if you let me

I wanna surround you with love
Can you remember that rush?
I know it's been hard, but now you'll never be alone
I wanna surround you with love
Nothing else matters but us
I know it's been hard, but now you'll never be alone

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's all that I wanna do, hey

I wanna surround you with love (lLove)
Can you remember that rush?
I know it's been hard, but now you'll never be alone
I wanna surround you with love (surround you with love)
Nothing else matters but us
I know it's been hard, but now you'll never be alone

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (never, oh, oh, ooh)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh (no, I'll never, I'll never)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
