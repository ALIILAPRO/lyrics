		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Not really sure but man it feels like the first (feels like the first)
A conversation where we don't need the words, ah
It's picture perfect when it all starts to blur
The focus stays on the way you lay

Under the stars is when I'm over the moon (over the moon)
Your body shines the darker it's in the room, ah
I count the hours 'til the sky fades to blue
'Cause the heart in me's only on my sleeve

In the night (in the night)
When it's just us here
In the night (in the night)
I can see so clear
Every time until you disappear in the light (in the light)
We only make sense in the night

Your shadow's dancing as the cities asleep (cities asleep)
I pull the shades and pull you closer to me, ah
This love gets harder when the day starts to breathe
And all I know is the world moves slow

With every morning that you're far away, I'm not okay
'Cause I wanna wake up with you by my side and feel alright
There's a hundred reasons why it's, it's never easy unless
Unless it's you and me, yeah, it's you and me

In the night (in the night)
When it's just us here
In the night (in the night)
I can see so clear
Every time until you disappear in the light (in the light)
We only make sense in the night (in the night)

When it's just us here
In the night (in the night)
I can see so clear
Every time until you disappear in the light (in the light)
We only make 

In the night
When it's just us here
In the night
I can see so clear
Every time until you disappear in the light

In the night
When it's just us here
In the night
I can see so clear
Every time until you disappear in the light
You and I, we only make sense in the night

Ah, ah, oh in the night, ooh
