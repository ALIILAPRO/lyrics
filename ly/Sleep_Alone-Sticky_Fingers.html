		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In all this catastrophe (got lost in the shade)
And you might've loved me alive
I'm out of your world tonight (I'm lettin' you go)
I'll give it another chance 'cause I don't wanna be alone

Bright skin, cinnamon
Chiller boy, make her grin
My medicine, a peace cloud
This sinner girl, she funny
Face down, we're crushin' now
Her taste, her deal, I'm fadin' now
Floatin' through phenomenon
We sleep alone

Why'd you run away for?
Fuck it what they say
'Cause I don't wanna break up
I made a mess, I changed
So I scribble somethin' down from the top of my head
'Cause this chiller boy won't feel no pain
I smoked my last cigarette, my tongue turned burnt
Like the smoke flowed OLA

Push me, I won't push you back
But don't front me like a punchin' bag
I'm sorted, I'm a clown, no sad
I take another one
Got cornered in your cul-de-sac
And there's no promises I'm comin' back
And there's no wonder that I feel so bad
I take another one

Bright skin, cinnamon
Chiller boy, make her grin
My medicine, a peace cloud
This sinner girl, she funny
Face down, we're crushin' now
Her taste, her deal, I'm fadin' now
Floatin' through phenomenon
We sleep alone

Why'd you run away for?
Fuck it what they say
'Cause I don't wanna break up
I made a mess, I changed
So I scribble somethin' down from the top of my head
'Cause this chiller boy won't feel no pain
I smoked my last cigarette, my tongue turned burnt
Like the smoke flowed OLA

In all this catastrophe, got lost in the shade
And you might've loved me alive
I'm out of your world tonight, I'm lettin' you go
I'll give it another chance 'cause I don't wanna be alone

And even when I stoop that low (give up, let go)
'Cause still every time, I seen that face

In all this catastrophe
(Can't sleep a night alone, can't sleep a night)
In all this catastrophe
(Can't sleep a night alone, can't sleep a night)
In all this catastrophe
(Can't sleep a night alone, can't sleep a night)
In all this catastrophe, got lost in the shade
