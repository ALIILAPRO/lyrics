		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I see you're driven by your detestation
Your every step is stoked with animus
You need a different type of motivation
Or there's no way that you can handle this

I know you're thirstin' for vengeance, Vaggie
You're out for blood
But you'll only stand a chance if you're out for love

Out for love, love
Think of who you care about
Protect them and be out
For love, love
You're gonna fight without gloves
Long as you're out for love

Fuel yourself with the fear of losin'
That somebody who's your reason to live
Harness your heart and you can't help choosin'
To fight with all you can give

I know you're thirstin' for vengeance, Vaggie
You're out for blood
But you'll only stand a chance if you're out for love

Out for love, love
Think of who you care about
Protect them and be out
For love, love
You're gonna fight without gloves
And when that push comes to shove
Yeah, you just might rise above
Long as you're out for love
