		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I can't wait to wanna brush my hair
I can't wait to wanna go somewhere
No motivation to leave this bed
I can't wait to feel like me again
I can't wait to wanna walk my dog
I can't wait to wanna put weight on
There's something broken inside my head
I can't wait to feel like me again

I can't wait to wanna not get high
I can't wait to wanna go outside
Even all of my plants are dead
I can't wait to feel like me again
I can't wait to wanna get dressed up
I can't wait to wanna be in love
I don't even wanna see my friends
I can't wait to feel like me again

Feels like I'll never
But I'll get better
Might take forever
But I'll get better

I can't wait to wanna be my best
I can't wait to wanna clean this mess
Don't know how I'm gonna get there yet
But I can't wait to feel like me again
