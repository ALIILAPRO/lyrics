		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch

But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath

Can the killer in me tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do

But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair

I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love

Can the killer in me tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do

Nothing ever comes like it did
When you were in it just a memory of a kid
Just a washed-out finish
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny
Cash middle finger
No shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner

Nothing ever comes like it did
When you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like
A stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like
A ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound
The sound is coming down

Hoping that you like
That you like how you're living
Relying on the kindness of strangers
That you will be forgiven how many times
How many times will you shit
On what you're given? How many times
How many times 'til you shut up and listen?

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound
The sound is coming down

Nothing ever comes, ever comes
Choking like a dog, like a dog
Open up your mouth
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound
The sound is coming

Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound
The sound is coming down
