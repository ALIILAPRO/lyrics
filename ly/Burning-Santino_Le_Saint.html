		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  On and on we go
Chasing tails and digging holes
That's all we know
We'd rather risk the scars
Than sacrifice a beating heart
That's who we are

Here we are waking up blood all on our hands
Fight for love fuck it up then do it again
Outta sight outta mind never stood a chance
But Truth be told we both know

We'll be burning
'Till the rain hits the open fire
Keep on turning
'Till the waves come and kiss the tide
What's the verdict
It's a story that's as old as time
We'll be burning
'Till the rain hits the open fire

'Till daylight steals the night
It's Acid rain and forest fires
That take the prize
Songs birds starts to cry
The clouds are falling out the sky
Like tears from yours eyes

Here we are waking up blood all on our hands
Fight for love fuck it up then do it again
Outta sight outta mind never stood a chance
But Truth be told we both know

We'll be burning
Till the rain hits the open fire
Keep on turning
Till the waves come and kiss the tide
What's the verdict
It's a story that's as old as time
We'll be burning
Till the rain hits the open fire
