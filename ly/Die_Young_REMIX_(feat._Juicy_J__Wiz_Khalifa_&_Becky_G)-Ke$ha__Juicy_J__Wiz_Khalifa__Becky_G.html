		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everybody know Juicy always turnt up
Tour bus smoked out, everybody purped up
9 to 5 grind and got the whole hood worked up
Ain't getting money then you better get your work up
Pull up in a Porsche drunk, back seat chauffeur
Taylor Gang in here, everybody know us
Hundred bottles, and there's more coming
Same shit tomorrow night, all I know is stunting
20 shot of Jager, I don't do chasers
White boy wasted, smoking out the vaper
Party with your girl, sweating out my pores
Becky so good, I had to thank the Lord
She won my heart and of course she go hard
Shake her ass and titties, I threw my card
Love California girls like David Lee Roth
You tell em that you love em, I say, 'take it off', 'take it off'

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

No changing us
Ball so hard, it's not a game to us
Pull up in the club throwing Taylor's up
Spending cuz money ain't a thing to us
But for the famous stuff, I wasn't the one to play with
Party all night, getting drunk and raging
Ball so hard, I think I'm gonna be sick
Wake up, roll a joint and do it all again
Yeah, I like to party
Got a cute face and I like your body
You leave sober and you might be sorry
Pour another shot then light the Marley
And what goes down, don't bring it up
Tell them broke niggas they can hang it up
Take six shots, feels like we're dying
Hit this once, feels like you're flying

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
We're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Won't stop cause it's my time, time
I'm staying on my grind, grind
You tryna take my shine, shine?
Step back, bye bye
When I rap, all the boys go cray cray
Every time that I jump on the stage
Oh, you like it when I'm in your face?
And if you don't, man, whatcha gonna say?

Looking for some trouble tonight (yeah)
Take my hand, I'll show you the wild side
Like it's the last night of our lives (uh huh)
We'll keep dancing 'till we die

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you're here in my arms
Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young (we're gonna die young)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young (we're gonna die young)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh like we're gonna die young

Let's make the most of the night like we're gonna die young
