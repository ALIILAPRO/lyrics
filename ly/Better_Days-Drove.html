		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  When Hope Goes Up In Flames
While Trying To Fight The Waves
I'm Losing Grip On My Escape
But I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
When Feelings Don't Feel The Same
And Shadows Start To Fade
I Close My Eyes To Drift Away
And I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
Reaching Out With Every Breath That I Take, Breath That I Take
So Far Down, But I Know There'll Be Better Days
But I Know There'll Be Better Days
(Aah)
(Aah)
(Aah)
I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
When Hope Goes Up In Flames
While Trying To Fight The Waves
I Close My Eyes To Drift Away
And I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
Reaching Out With Every Breath That I Take, Breath That I Take
So Far Down, But I Know There'll Be Better Days
(Aah)
(Aah)
(Aah)
I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
But I Know There'll Be Better Days
(Aah)
(Aah)
(Aah)
I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
When Hope Goes Up In Flames
I Know There'll Be Better Days
When Feelings Don't Feel The Same
I'll Keep Looking For Better Days
