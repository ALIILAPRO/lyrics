		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where to begin
I’ll play along if you pretend 
I’m in the wind
In a season that never ends 
A traveler
Drift in and out just like the air
Spectacular
It’s in the air like lavender

Find me
Off the coast of Italy
Hiding
Any trace of my history

Too long
I’ve been going anywhere but home
Too gone
I have always been a rolling stone

A traveler
Drift in and out just like the air
Spectacular
It’s in the air like lavender

Running
Always thinking home can wait on me
It’s funny
How this freedom really isn’t free

Too long
I’ve been going anywhere but home
Too gone
I have always been a rolling stone


Where to end
I’ll play along if you pretend
Indifferent
Went round the globe, back where I began
A traveler
Drift in and out just like the air
Spectacular
It’s in the air like lavender
