		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Um, it's a good time to say "Holy smokes"

You know it's Schemaboys to the motherfucking grave, bitch
Sxmpra stay the same, and you know I never take shit
I don't talk about it, I just spit and let the bass hit
You don't really wanna be the one to have to run up, turn and face it
Pussy motherfucker really wanna be the one to pull up on a brother
Wait a minute, better stand back
I'ma be the one to get a motherfucker jumpin' to the bass
Let it rip so quick, who that?
Do it alone, now gimme the bone, I'm takin' 'em on
When I pop off, let 'em fall flat
Let-let a man swing with a baseball bat
I don't need that, motherfucker, who mad?
Comin' from the underground, ain't losin' the sound
I'm tryna make my brothers proud, you know I'm doin' it now
These other rappers can't compete, they fuckin' hate when they down
I came from nothin', now they just can't keep my name out they mouth

They don't really fuck with the ones like us
And they gon' see us as a threat 'til we overcome
We tell 'em "Boy, you out of luck
'Cause the the clock has struck
And we gon' come to take the throne
Man, yo' time is up"
They don't really fuck with the ones like us
And they gon' see us as a threat 'til we overcome
We tell 'em "Boy, you out of luck
'Cause the the clock has struck
And we gon' come to take the throne
Man, yo' time is up"

They don't really fuck with the ones like us
I don't really fuck with the ones like them
Put 'em in a grave, bitch, eat my dust
Never gonna get away, bitch, where's my pen?
Writing down these lyrics, I'm igniting the paper
I guess it's safer to type 'em, I got the gods in my favor
'Cause I'm a cowbell warrior, boy, we ain't the same
You ain't spit the shit like this, I guess I drive 'em insane, ayy
Wait a minute, motherfucker really wanna buck up with a brother
Gotta put 'em in the gutter with the other motherfucker that tried to test my team
I guess I need to let 'em free
I'ma be what I've been, stay the same until I D-I-E
I'll rest in peace knowin' that I fuckin' backed my team
