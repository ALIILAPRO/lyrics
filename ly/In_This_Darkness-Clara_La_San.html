		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I get lonely when you're not here
And this darkness appears, leaving me stranded
My whole world shuts down
You never lived here
And I never found what I thought I did

There's a million things
There's a million things I could say
But you never really knew that
But you never really knew I felt this way
Wanna take it back
Wanna take it back to when we
Had it just like that had it right on track

And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up

I never had thoughts that controlled me
Until something bad left me so lonely
And I want it back, I want the old me
I'm trying to forget, but things just remind me

There's a million things
There's a million things I could say
But you never really knew that
But you never really knew I felt this way
Wanna take it back
Wanna take it back to when we
Had it just like that had it right on track

And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up

There's a million things
There's a million things I could say
But you never really knew that
But you never really knew I felt this way
Wanna take it back
Wanna take it back to when we
Had it just like that had it right on track

There's a million things
There's a million things I could say
But you never really knew that
But you never really knew I felt this way
Wanna take it back
Wanna take it back to when we
Had it just like that had it right on track

And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up yeah
And I keep falling in this darkness
And there's no one to light it up, to bright it up
