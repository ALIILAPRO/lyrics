		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Tell me you, never seen him now
I don't wanna know
And how he held you down
The places you will go
If he comes around
I'll give you a show
I might have to break him down
And leave here on my own

Babe I'm sorry, if I get too honest
But don't let them, break your heart
Babe I'm sorry, if I get too honest
You're an angel, from the highest

So lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me, babe
I'm feeling all that I can take

Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me, babe
And my heart will never break

So the love and pain, tears in the rain
Fear in your eyes, are you insane?
Are you alive? Can you be mine?
Can we rewind? I fucked this up
you know, I can be brave, I can be kind
I can be yours, just give me time
If you don't mind
I don't waste my last, skippin' the line
Let's get fucked up

Babe I'm sorry, if I get too honest
But don't let them, break your heart
Babe I'm sorry, if I get too honest
You're an angel, from the highest

So lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me, babe
I'm feeling all that I can take

Lie to me
Lie to me
Lie to me, babe
And my heart will never break

Lie to me
Oh, ohh-oh
Lie to me
