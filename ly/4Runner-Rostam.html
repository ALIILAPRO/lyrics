		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First time they took me down
I went down swinging
Second time, I didn't put up a fight
I take the keys down from the hook
I pick you up from work
We stick to the straight roads up the West Coast
And I feel a part of me slide

When the trucks drive by
I feel 'em sway us side to side
You're underneath a blanket on the backseat
I'm going station to station on the dial
Don't wanna be pretty like a girl
I think I'm pretty much your boy
You wear a baseball cap all the time
And keep a knife in the passenger door

Sleeping behind the wheel
Pulled over on the freeway
4Runner, stolen plates, long, long gone
Take off a shift for me
I'm waiting down the street
Take all the time you want to come, come, come

Last time we did it
We both felt it hit different
Lying down across the front seats
Used to leave you weightless and listless
When the trucks drive by
I feel 'em sway us side to side
I used to keep you up all night
You used to drive when I got tired

Sleeping behind the wheel
Pulled over on the freeway
4Runner, stolen plates, long, long gone
Take off a shift for me
I'm waiting down the street
Take all the time you want to come, come, come

I think we're getting close
I think we're getting closer
We got this 4runner
And we been good together

I think we're getting close
I think we're getting closer
We got this 4runner
And we been good together

Sleeping behind the wheel
Pulled over on the freeway
4Runner, stolen plates, long, long gone
Take off a shift for me
I'm waiting down the street
Take all the time you want to come, come, come

(whoa-wee, woo)
(whoa-wee, woo)

Sleeping behind the wheel (whoa-wee, woo)
Pulled over on the freeway (whoa-wee, woo)
4Runner, stolen plates, long, long gone
Take off a shift for me
I'm waiting down the street
Take all the time you want to come, come, come

Sleeping behind the wheel
Pulled over on the freeway (whoa-wee, woo)
4Runner, stolen plates, long, long gone 
Take off a shift for me (whoa-wee, woo)
