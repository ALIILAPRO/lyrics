		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  French Montana 
Became the scene of a mass shooting
That's right, right now the feds are involved, the ATF, the U.S. Marshals
As authorities are tryin' to figure out who opened fire

I'm a savage, I got wild habits
Corporate thuggin', stash a brick inside the fire cabinet (bah-bah-bah)
.40 blows sounds like cars crashin'
Word to Kim, they left his brain, it's on the car dash (woo)
Xannies to sleep, Perc', Addys to turn up
He gotta go, he witnessed the murder
My hands ain't free, I can't hold no grudges
If he a gangster and he told, it ain't no discussion
Came in the Phantom, left as a ghost
My bitch be gettin' high, gotta check her pulse
She said, "Bust me down, Frenchie, bust me down"
I went deaf on her, Foxy Brown
I wonder what goes on in the mind of a lifer
Million dollars for a show, started from a cypher

Come and talk to me
'Cause I got it for the low too
Can I talk to you
I really wanna show you

Biggs you took it too far, I go too hard
Corporate thuggin', I got killers on the Zoom call
Hustle too smart, and they don't do charts
Forty bricks distribution like it's TuneCore
We grindin' if you with it, everybody knew it was impossible
Until the fool came along and did it
Bottom of the rock to the top, grind, never fold
If waterdrops fall on a rock for years, it leave a hole
Comin' soon from the Mollys to the Percs
Now they takin' shrooms, helium balloons, still runnin' on fumes
You wonder what goes on in the mind of a killer
Coke Boys, Montana, it ain't nothin' realer

Come and talk to me
'Cause I got it for the low too
Can I talk to you
I really wanna show you

New details this noon after a mass shooting outside a restaurant in Miami Gardens
I asked for strength and God gave me difficulties to make me strong
I asked for wisdom and God gave me problems to solve
I asked for courage and God gave me dangers to overcome

(Coke Boy, baby)
