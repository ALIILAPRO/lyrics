		  (DY Krazy)
I got diamonds on my toes, all up on my nose
You know how it goes

I'm fresh as fuck, I tell that bitch I should've came in a hearse
I put Chanel on her ears, and on her neck, and her purse
I'm number one, my birthday should've been January the first
I got diamonds from my toes up to my top
I got pink toes running 'round the house
I thank God, I understand the way it go
She a damn crew hopper XO

I got diamonds on my toes, motherfucker
I got diamonds in my nose (I got diamonds in my nose)
I been rocking Kenneth Cole, motherfucker (rockin' Cole)
My bitch is clean as Pine-Sol, motherfucker
Pop a school bus, bitches tryna screw us (yeah)
Fuck you old school niggas ain't no schooling us
I let my son whip a Ferrari like his father Russ (ah)
I rock Herm√®s, I'm designer'ed up ('signered up)
Can't get rid of, I got hitters, drug dealers, good bitches
I got bitches going brazy, no Ritalin
I get money, ain't no shady for real bruh
You can't see, but I done the shit

I'm fresh as fuck, I tell that bitch I should've came in a hearse
I put Chanel on her ears, and on her neck, and her purse
I'm number one, my birthday should've been January the first
I got diamonds from my toes up to my top
I got pink toes running 'round the house
I thank God, I understand the way it go
She a damn crew hopper XO

I told my mama we ain't going broke 'cause we done been there before
Sleep on the floor until my arm hurt, now we dealing too long
We at the top right now, we came so far from the bottom
Now we ballin' Harlem Globetrotter, we ain't boring nobody
These niggas nobodies, they ain't got no bodies
Bet a half a mil in the trap, what you niggas know 'bout it
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, I feel like Cardi B
They say talk is cheap, so I put flawless on my teeth
Like my bitches boujee, still don't fuck a booster
Double CC, Gucci, Fendi, Prada, Louis, Givenchy shoes with the toolie
Rich nigga eating noodles, fuck on you call an Uber
Bet on me like a casino, baby, I'm number one like January

I'm fresh as fuck, I tell that bitch I should've came in a hearse
I put Chanel on her ears, and on her neck, and her purse
I'm number one, my birthday should've been January the first
I got diamonds from my toes up to my top
I got pink toes running 'round the house
I thank God, I understand the way it go
She a damn crew hopper XO

High speed chasing in that Lamborghini Turbo S
How come these niggas tryna tell me that they been fresh?
I got money tied up in Kidland, try not to let bygones be bygones and
Thinkin' I'ma lick it chopping off your tongue
Get over and na na na na
I can't seem to get over the sound of guns (brrt)
I'm a drug addict, I know I got dead lungs
I pop baddies, my diamonds black, Akon
I can't get over these hoes, I'm my mama's son
I keep it drastic, she can only stay or run
Fresh as a casket but YSL look alive
If I get mad, I promise they all done
I told the boy to behave, he a small guy
Brown diamonds chillin' no fries, couple green diamond apple no pies
I'm draining and straining my voice until I get it right
This money control us, yeah, one of us will pick a fight
I told all the ops every time I see 'em it's on sight
I caught your lil lady down bad and ride her like a bike
No cap, uh huh, no cap (hey)

I'm fresh as fuck, I tell that bitch I should've came in a hearse
I put Chanel on her ears, and on her neck, and her purse
I'm number one, my birthday should've been January the first
I got diamonds from my toes up to my top
I got pink toes running 'round the house
I thank God, I understand the way it go
She a damn crew hopper XO
