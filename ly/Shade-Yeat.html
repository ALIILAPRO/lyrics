		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, fuck off, fuck off
Can't be mad that I'm well off
Can't be mad that I did this shit
Can't be mad that I talk this, bitch
You a dumb motherfucker
You a dumb motherfucker, uh
You a dumb motherfucker
You a dumb motherfucker

You not full, but no amount could fit
Shit, why you always talkin' shit? (Why?)
'Cause those Balenciagas counterfeit
I just made the whole world my bitch (yeah)
I'm tryna see how much I could fit
I don't like to talk, I plead the fifth
And I'm praying that you make one wrong move
It's no telling what I might or might not do
Heard you say you won't fold, you won't bend
Let's all get high as fuck and pretend
I'll be wrong 'til I die, 'til the end
If I ask you if you lied, you say, "Yeah"
You say, "Yeah"
How could I make it up to you?
I say, "You can't"
Just get the fuck away from me
And it's more than that, and it's more than this
I'm just tryna imagine all the times I pissed
I'm just tryna imagine why you'd do that shit
But I couldn't imagine it (yeah)
And it's nowhere I'd rather be
On the beach with a tragedy
And she called me, "Your Majesty"
Making movies appear so magically
Yeah, and it's sad that you'd said what you wouldn't do
And it's sad to look back on what you wouldn't do
And it's sad, and it's sad
And it's sad, and it's sad (ah)
But I'm glad that you had your fun, you had your fun on it
But I'm bad for the things I say and the things I want on it
How you mad that I got this money that I never even asked for?
How you sad 'bout a slag, when you wasn't even up for it?

Wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up, wasn't up
I was broke, I was down, I was down bad, now I'm up, now I'm really up
Yeah, I was out sad (out sad) in the Bentley truck
I was out sad (out sad), we ain't give a fuck
I was out sad (out sad), I was in the mud
I was out sad (out sad), I was stuck up

(Yeah)
Is it bad that I serve but I couldn't dish it?
Is it bad that you couldn't finish?
Is it bad I lost every digit?
Is it bad when you? Is it? (Is it?)
Is it bad when you? (Yeah, is it?)
Is it? When you terminate you, yeah
Quit it (no), would you really ever
Tried to live it (no), even though you said you
Already did it (no), when you told that you
Really with it (no)
You a broke ass bum, just admit it (no)
I admit every time I'm a psychopath
I admit every time I cried and laughed
I remember the times we used to have
I remember the nights we used to have
Even remember times when it was bad
Even remember times we never had (yeah)
I can see all between the lines that you said that you wouldn't do
And times that you said that you'd come, but you never do
I heard planes, yeah, they fly, yeah, they fly 'til they never do
And we crash and we burn, turn a page, or another two
We can go back and do things that we said that we'd never do (yeah)
I say, "On God," but I never knew
I like to fly, yeah, I like to fly a few
Yeah, I already died, I already tried a few
Yeah, don't be surprised (yeah), you know my life too
