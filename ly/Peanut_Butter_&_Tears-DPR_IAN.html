		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunday morning karaoke
Forgot my bills on the stove
I left home so long ago
That my tooth's been wiggling for years

My peanut butter and your tears
Oh, why the sad face dear
I can't control all of my fears

It's 5AM and I have to go
The wind is tearing up my eyes
We know, we know
Friends tell me I look so dead
I think they're seeing through my disguise
They know
They know where I've been
I get so friendly with strangers
Ooh, yeah
The way I've been
I get so lost in my color
It took me some time

That my tooth's been wiggling for years
My peanut butter and your tears
Oh, why the sad face dear
I can't control all of my fears
Ooh, yeah
Soaked in glitter
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers
Look at me in my leather (undressed)
Soaked in glitter
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers
Look at me in my leather
I hardly do as I am told
I feel the magic in those times
We know, we know
I hate to see your tea get cold
From leaving the door open too wide
Where I've been
I get told I'm just a stranger

Ooh, yeah
But the way I've been
I've returned as your lost lover
It took me some time
And my world's been wiggling for years
My peanut butter and your tears
Oh, why the sad face dear
I can't control all of my fears
Ooh, yeah
Soaked in glitter
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers
Look at me in my leather (undressed)
Soaked in glitter
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers
Look at me in my leather (go)
Go
