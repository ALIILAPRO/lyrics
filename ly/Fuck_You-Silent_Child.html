		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Fuck You
Verse 1:
Am I wasting my breath on you
Feels like my words are never getting through
I’ve never said I hate you to someone
So much before
I’m light headed when we’re talking
And you shut the door
God damn
Like what are we still talking for yeah
Pre-Drop:
Oh yeah
Oh oh
Woah
Oh yeah
Oh oh
Verse 2:
I really hope you don’t see tomorrow
I tried to play nice with you
Cause all you ever do is try to fuck up my day
And you were successful
I know you don’t have anything
Better to do
Everything you ever loved
Has tried to escape you
So why would I want
Anything to do with you
Fuck you
Pre-Chorus:
I’ve had
A bad day
And it’s all because of you
Drop:
I’ve had
A bad day
And it’s all because of you
I’m not
Ok
After what you put me through
Woooh, woooh yeah
Woooh, woooh
You broke me
Fuck you
Outro:
Yeah, yeah
Fuck you
Woooh, woooh yeah
