		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Real human being and a real hero (hero, hero, hero, hero, hero)

Back against the wall at odds
With the strength of a will and a cause
Your pursuits are called outstanding
You're emotionally complex

Against the grain of dystopic claims
Not the thoughts your actions entertain
And you have proved to be

A real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being (being, being, being, being, being)

A pilot on a cold, cold morn'
One-hundred fifty-five people on board
All safe and all rescued
From the slowly sinking ship

Water warmer than his head so cool
In that tight bind knew what to do 
And you have proved to be

A real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being and a real hero
Real human being

Real human being (being, being, being, being, being)
Real human being
