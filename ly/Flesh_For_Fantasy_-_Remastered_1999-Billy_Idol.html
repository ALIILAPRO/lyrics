		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There's a change in pace
Of fantasy and taste
Do you like good music?
Do you like to dance?
Oh, yeah
Hanging out for a body shot at night
Ain't it strange what they do to feel all right?
Oh, yeah
So, when will you call?
I am experienced
Oh, yeah

Face to face and back to back
You see and feel my sex attack
Sing it

Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

It's after midnight
Oh, are you feeling all right?
Oh, yeah
Turn on the light, babe
Are you someone else tonight?
Neighbour to neighbour, door to door
Don't ask questions, time for it all
Oh, yeah

Face to face and back to back
You see and feel my sex attack
Sing it

Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

Ow
I sing for culture

Father, love his son
Mothers, daughters too
It's an old, old story
Cries the new world too

Flesh, flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
We want
Flesh, flesh for fantasy
You cry
Flesh, flesh for fantasy

Let's go down, let's go down
Let's go down, let's go down
Let's go down, let's go down

Do you like good music?
Do you like to dance?
It's nearly morning
Do you wanna risk a chance?
Neighbour to neighbour, door to door
Enjoy the crime, you do your time
Never been nothing before
