		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There are nine-million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like the fact that I will love you 'til I die

We are twelve-billion light years from the edge
That's a guess
No one can ever say it's true
But I know that I will always be with you

I'm warmed by the fire of your love every day
So don't call me a liar
Just believe everything that I say

There are six-billion people in the world
More or less
And it makes me feel quite small
But you're the one I love the most of all

We're high on a wire with the world in our sight
And I'll never tire
Of the love that you give me every night

There are nine-million bicycles in Beijing
That's a fact
It's a thing we can't deny
Like that fact that I will love you 'til I die
And there are nine-million bicycles in Beijing
And you know that I will love you 'til I die
