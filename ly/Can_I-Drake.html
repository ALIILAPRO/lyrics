		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
Yeah, can I, baby? Can I, baby?

Can I, bring you to the six where I really stay, baby?
Show you why I am the way I am
Can I, tell you what I think my biggest flaw is, baby?
I try to be consistent, but I can't
Can I, have an honest moment wit' you right now, baby?
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I, get an honest answer from you right now, baby
'Cause all we ever talk about is me
Can I, before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I, call instead of text you on the hotline?
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice
Can I, see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby?
Sorry, you don't really have a choice
Can I, ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby?
You do so much more than that for me
Can I, finally take the time and open up to you, baby?
'Cause that's the side you never get to see
Can I, before I turn the lights out?
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you wanna be

Can I, baby?
Can I, before I turn the lights out
Can I, baby?
Can I, baby?
Can I, baby?
Can I, baby?

Can I, before I turn the lights out
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Can I?
Can I, baby?
Can I, baby?
Can I, baby?
Can I? Before I turn the lights out
One more time
Tell me who the fuck you wanna be
Before I turn the lights out
