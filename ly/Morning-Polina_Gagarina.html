		<p>

Teardrop smiley good I must finish for me
You're lost in my mind my soul belongs to you

Morning, morning still call me morning
I just wanna touch you once again but there's nobody, only a...
Morning, morning still call me morning
I just wanna touch you once again but there's nobody, only a pain...
Pain, pain...

Morning, morning still call me morning
I just wanna touch you once again but there's nobody, only a...
Morning, morning still call me morning
I just wanna touch you once again but there's nobody, only a pain... 

Pain.
