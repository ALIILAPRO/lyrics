		  Hey, yo, Jason
Say somethin' to her
Holla at her

I got one question
How do you fit all that, in them jeans?

You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit

Patty cake patty cake
With no hands
Got me in this club making wedding plans
If I take pictures while you do your dance
I can make you famous on Instagram
Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head, and go ham sandwich
Woah, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit

Cadillac, Cadillac, pop that trunk
Let's take a shot
Alley oops that dunk
Tired of working that 9 to 5
Oh baby let me come and change your life
Hot damn it
Your booty like two planets
Go head, and go ham sandwich
Woah, I can't stand it

'Cause you know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit

Shake what your mama gave you
Misbehave you
I just wanna strip you, dip you, flip you, bubble bath you
What they do
Taste my rain drop, ok boo
Now what you're willing, what you wanting, what you may do
Completely sample rated, til my deeply penetrated
Then I take I out, and wipe it off
Eat it, ate it, love it, hate it
Overstated, underrated, everywhere I been king
You wiggle, wiggle for the D, O, double G, a king

Come on baby
Turn around (turn around, turn around, turn around)
You're a star girl
Take a bow (take a bow, take a bow, take a bow)
It's just one thing that's killing me
How you get that in them jeans?

You know what to do with that big fat butt

Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Just a little bit
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Now make it clap
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle
Make it clap
Now make it clap
Make it clap

Damn baby you got a bright future behind you
