		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Lets go ya'll

These people are running off at the mouth
Trying to convince me that I'm running on empty
Trying to convince themselves that the record with Jay was a fluke
That the record that I'm making is a mistake
And I can't take this
Let me tell you where I'm at with this
You bastards are gonna have to take back that shit
I'm not plastic and fake
When I make tracks I take facts and lay them out for the masses
You assholes are gonna see soon that I'm not playing
And start asking me the names that I'm not saying
But I'm trying to be bigger than the bickering
Bigger than the petty name calling
Under-the-breath talking
Rumors and labels and categorization
I'm like a struggling doctor, no patients
But you can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away

You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
I'm taking the high road going above you
This is the last time that I'm gonna trust you
You can say what you have to say
'Cause my mind's made up anyway
All that bullshit you talk might work a lot
But it's not gonna work today

Mike
You people are running off at the mouth
Trying to make me take myself off safety
Trying to make my friends turn their backs on the team we've built
Building up some mistaken information
And I can't take this
Let me spell it out plain for you
Angry groups complaining about the things we do
I'm not changing direction, I'm stepping my game up
Maintaining my name, same way that I came up
You're gonna see that I'm not playing
And start asking the names that I'm not saying
But I'm tryin not to mention the names of people who wanna siphon attention
You like the hype but pretending you're part of the picture won't pass
You're like a high school dropout, no class
You can say what you want about me
Keep talking while I'm walking away

Why does it always have to be
Somebody's always watching me
All I really need is some room to breathe
Is anybody out there listening
'Cause I can't stand to keep this in
All I really want I'll say again
