		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Damn, I'm still alive
Isn't it great? Sun's in my eyes
Sure, you need rain to make a rainbow
But I haven't worn my raincoat
In sometime, like, almost a year
Since I woke up covered in tears
Lately, my salt stays on the table
But I don't trust that the legs are stable

When I've got nothing left to fix
Can't help but think that it's a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile
When I've got way too much to risk
I'm terrified it's just a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Is it a glitch in the simulation?
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last

'Cause I don't wanna move in case it goes wrong
Too much I'm scared of losing
If this was a rollercoaster, I'd be over thinking the drop
Stuck at the top

When I've got nothing left to fix
Can't help but think that it's a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile
When I've got way too much to risk
I'm terrified it's just a glitch in the simulation
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last awhile

Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Is it a glitch in the simulation?
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last
Ah-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh-ooh
Is it a glitch in the simulation?
Oh, if it is, tell me how to make it last
