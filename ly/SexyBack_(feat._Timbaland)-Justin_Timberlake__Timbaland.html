		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm bringin' sexy back (yeah)
Them other boys don't know how to act (yeah)
I think it's special, what's behind your back (yeah)
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack (yeah)
Take 'em to the bridge (that's it)

Dirty babe (uh-huh)
You see these shackles baby, I'm your slave (uh-huh)
I'll let you whip me, if I misbehave (uh-huh)
It's just that no one makes me feel this way (uh-huh)
Take 'em to the chorus

Come here girl (go 'head be gone with it)
Come to the back (go 'head be gone with it)
VIP (go 'head be gone with it)
Drinks on me (go 'head be gone with it)
Let me see what you're twerking with (go 'head be gone with it)
Look at those hips (go 'head be gone with it)
You make me smile (go 'head be gone with it)
Go 'head child (go 'head be gone with it)
And, get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

I'm bringin' sexy back (yeah)
Them other fuckers don't know how to act (yeah)
Come let me make up for the things you lack (yeah)
'Cause you're burning up, I gotta get it fast (yeah)
Take 'em to the bridge (that's it)

Dirty babe (uh-huh)
You see these shackles baby, I'm your slave (uh-huh)
I'll let you whip me, if I misbehave (uh-huh)
It's just that no one makes me feel this way (uh-huh)
Take 'em to the chorus

Come here girl (go 'head be gone with it)
Come to the back (go 'head be gone with it)
VIP (go 'head be gone with it)
Drinks on me (go 'head be gone with it)
Let me see what you're twerking with (go 'head be gone with it)
Look at those hips (go 'head be gone with it)
You make me smile (go 'head be gone with it)
Go 'head child (go 'head be gone with it)
And, get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on (go 'head be gone with it)
Get your sexy on

You ready?
You ready?
You ready?
(Uh) yes

I'm bringin' sexy back (yeah)
You motherfuckers watch how I attack (yeah)
If that's your girl, better watch your back (yeah)
'Cause she'll burn it up for me, and that's a fact (yeah)
