		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm finding the truth
Between the lies that you use
To hold me down and abuse
Try to control me
I never wanted anything more
I never wanted to start a war

I search for the meaning
The scars and the bleeding that you left behind
I'm hopelessly hopeful that I'm finding my way
Without the faith that you took me from me

Let go, let go
Give a little bit
Oh no, oh no
I think I'm over it
Sleepless thoughts at night
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming? (Dreaming)
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?

Cinch around my neck 'til the memories start to fade away
Like secondhand smoke from the fire that we became
I'm counting every breath
But I've got nothing left
These broken hands of time won't wind
'Cause all these voices in my head
Are praying that my death 
Will find a way to bring me back to life

Let go, let go
Give a little bit
Oh no, oh no
I think I'm over it
Sleepless thoughts at night
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

Let go, let go
Give a little bit
Oh no, oh no
I think I'm over it
You gotta let me know
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

I can hardly breathe
And I can hardly see
I can't forget you
I can't forget you

I can hardly breathe
And I can hardly see
I can't forget you
I can't forget you

I can hardly breathe
I can hardly see
I can't forget you
I can't forget you

I can hardly breathe
I can hardly see
I can't forget you
I can't forget you

Let go, let go
Give a little bit
Oh no, oh no
I think I'm over it
Sleepless thoughts at night
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?

Let go, let go
Give a little bit
Oh no, oh no
I think I'm over it
You gotta let me know
Am I dreaming?
Am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
Am I dream-, am I dream-, am I dreaming?
