Da-da-da-da
Da

You and I talked about everything under the sun, and
I'm not sure at what point you figured this out on your own
So go reinvent yourself into a whole other person
But I know you better than anyone you'll ever know

Oh, you said that you needed space
Go on then, astronaut
And when you come back down to Earth
Bet I'll be the one you call
When you realize there's nothing out there
But matter and emptiness
And you let a good thing go

You could get one of those super-white suits
And bounce around how like my gravity isn't holding you
And the cruelest part of it is how you tell me that you love me still (yeah)
Like I'm supposed to wait here while you're figuring out just how you feel

Oh yeah, you said that you needed space
Go on then, astronaut
And when you come back down to Earth
Bet I'll be the one you call
When you realize there's nothing out there
But matter and emptiness
And you let a good thing go
Oh, yeah

Oh
I hope you find all you need, yeah
It hurts to know that's not me 'cause

You said that you needed space
Go on then, astronaut
And when you come back down to Earth
Bet I'll be the one you call
When you realize there's nothing out there
But matter and emptiness
And you let a good thing go
Oh, yeah, yeah

La-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da
Oh, da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da
Da
