		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Every single wish she made
From shooting stars to birthday cakes
Every lucky charm she'd saved
Was for the great escape

She crossed her heart and hoped to die
Said farewell and closed her eyes
Knew that there was more to life
In the great escape

She said
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

With every penny that she'd made
She took a bus to board a plane
Not a single plan in place
For the great escape

She's not wealthy but she's rich
Read all the books on how to live
And the final chapter said
This is the great escape

She said
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

She caught a falling leaf
And held it in her palms
And waited for the sun to shine
She caught a falling leaf
And held it in her palms
And waited for the sun

She said
Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Why don't we start from here?
Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go) 

Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go)
Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go)

Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go)
Why don't we start from here?
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(Let's go) ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
