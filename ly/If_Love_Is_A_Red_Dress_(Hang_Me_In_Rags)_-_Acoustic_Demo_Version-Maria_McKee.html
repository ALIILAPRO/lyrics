		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My heart is empty
Your eyes are dull
Once we were hungry
Now we are full
These ties that bind us
Can't beat these chains
If love is shelter
I'm gonna walk in the rain

You were my angel
Now you are real
So like a stranger
Colder than steel
The morning after
No one should brag
If love is a red dress
Well hang me in rags

Oh well, there goes the fairy tale
Lord, ain't it a shame
In all this comfort, i can't take the strain

If we played even
I'd be your queen
But someone was cheatin'
And it wasn't me
I played on the table
You held something back
If love is aces, gimme the jack
