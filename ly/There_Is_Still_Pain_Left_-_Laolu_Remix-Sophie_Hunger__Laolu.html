		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My love, my love
You say there is still pain left
Still glass that is not broken
There are still blows you kept from taking
Still trains you have not missed

There are still wars you've not applied for
Still accusations you've not made
Some parts are still alive

Kiss your nightmares everywhere, everywhere
You feel your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
You touch your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
Why, why can't you see
You should be kissing me

My man my man
You say there is still pain left
Still more wicked panic attacks
There are still some molecules intact
And there is still a darker black

You kiss your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
You feel your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
You touch your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
But why, why can't you see

You could bet it all on me

You kiss your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
You feel your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
You touch your nightmares
Everywhere, everywhere
Why, why can't you see
You should be kissing me
