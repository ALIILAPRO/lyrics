		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes I've got a hard time seeing the point to existing
Am I here for a reason or 'cause my parents were drinking?
Sometimes I've got a hard time, hard time believing in Jesus
If there's a heaven above us then why can nobody see it?

Same shit, different year
'Til I disappear

What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?

Sometimes I've got a hard time seeing the good in the chaos
If there's a meaning to my life then why the hell am I so lost?
Sometimes I've got a hard time believing dreams are worth chasing
When there's a ninety-nine percent chance that I probably won't make it

Same shit, different year
'Til I disappear

What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?

Stuck in a one-man circus
Trying to find some purpose
But it's unclear

What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?

Sometimes I've got a hard time
Am I the only one losing my mind?

What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?

Stuck in a one-man circus
Trying to find some purpose
But it's unclear

What the fuck am I doing here? (Same shit, different year)
What the fuck am I doing here? ('Til I disappear)

Stuck in a one-man circus
Trying to find some purpose
But it's unclear

What the fuck am I doing here?
What the fuck am I doing here?
