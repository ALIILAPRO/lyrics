		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
You can start me up
You can start me up, I'll never stop

I've been running hot
You got me ticking, gonna blow my top
If you start me up
If you start me up, I'll never stop
Never stop, never stop, I'll never stop

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry

Spread out the oil, the gasoline
I walk smooth, ride in a mean, mean machine
Start it up

If you start me up
Kick on the starter
Give it all you got, you got, you got
I can't compete with the riders in the other heats
If you rough it up
If you like it, I can slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, slide it up

Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry

My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy
She's a mean, mean machine

Start it up
Start me up
Ah, give it all you got
You got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up, woo 
Aw baby, just slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, never, never

You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry

Ride like the wind at double speed
I'll take you places that you've never, never seen
If you start it up
Love the day and we will never stop, never stop
Never, never, never stop
Start me up
Never stop, never stop

You, you, you make a grown man cry
You, you made a dead man come
You, you made a dead man come
