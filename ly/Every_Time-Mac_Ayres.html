		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Could you turn the lights out if I go?
Don't wanna fight 'bout this no more
Said if you got the time for that
You got time for something more
Said the wind is the way I go
I need two cigarettes and a casamigos
Been feeling like in spite of that
Oh, I been tryna keep things low

I said can somebody save me?
Save me from only myself
I said can somebody save me?
Can't keep on holding my breath, better get this off my chest, oh

It feels like every time I see you, I just don't really see you
I just don't really see you, I just don't really
It feels like every night I meet you, I just wanna believe you
I just wanna believe you, I just don't really
It feels like every time I see you, I just don't really see you
I just don't really see you, I just don't really
It feels like every night I meet you, I just wanna believe you
I just wanna believe you, I just don't really see it, no

Somebody tell me I could think things twice
Somebody tell me why it just feels like
I been up staying on my phone all night
Why's it always myself I fight?

I said can somebody save me?
Save me from only myself
I said can somebody save me?
Can't keep on holding my breath, better get this off my chest, oh

It feels like every time I see you, I just don't really see you
I just don't really see you, I just don't really
It feels like every night I meet you, I just wanna believe you
I just wanna believe you, I just don't really
It feels like every time I see you, I just don't really see you
I just don't really see you, I just don't really
It feels like every night I meet you, I just wanna believe you
I just wanna believe you, I just don't really see it, no
