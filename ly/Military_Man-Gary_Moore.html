		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Papa take a look at your boy
He`s a military man
Papa take a look at your boy
He`s crying
Papa take a look at your boy
He`s a soldier
Papa take a look in his eyes
They`re colder

Papa take a look at your boy
He`s a military man
Mama take a look at your boy
He`s dying
Mama take a look at your boy
He`s fighting
Mama take a look at your boy
He`s frightened

They have trained your boy to kill
And kill someday he will
They have trained your boy to die
And ask no questions why

Papa take a look at your boy
Take a look at your boy
Take a look at your boy
He`s a killer, yeah

Mama take a look at your boy
Take a look at him now
Take a look at your boy
He`s a soldier, he`s colder, he`s older, mama

Mama take a look at your boy
Obey the order
Mama take a look at your boy
Like a lamb to the slaughter

They have trained your boy to kill
And kill someday he will
They have trained your boy to die
And ask no questions why

One day, I will write for you a love song mother
As the children say, I love you, please hold me
And you and I, we will live our life together
Until that day when we die, I will love you mother
I will always love you

I`am writing from this war
Oh mama, I don`t know what I`m fighting for
And have you seen my children?
God bless them, kiss them
And tell them that I miss them

See I`m frightened in the dark
Mama, mama
The blood is ankle-deep
They have trained your boy to kill
And kill someday he will
They have trained your boy to die

Mama take a look at your boy
Take a look at him now
Take a look at your boy
He`s marching
He`s a soldier

Oh brother, oh mama
He`s on the street
He`s marching to the backbeat
