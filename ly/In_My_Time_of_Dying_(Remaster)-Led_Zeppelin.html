		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  In my time of dying, want nobody to mourn 
All I want for you to do is take my body home 

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy 

Jesus, gonna make up/out siviers 
Jesus, gonna make up my dyin' bed
Meet me, Jesus, meet me 
Oh meet me in the middle of the air 
If my wings should fail me, Lord
Oh please meet me with another pair 

Well, well, well, so I can die easy
Well, well, well, so I can die easy

Jesus, gonna make up
Somebody, somebody
Oh, oh Jesus gonna make up 
Jesus gonna make you my dyin' bed 

Oh, Saint Peter, at the gates of heaven
Won't you let me in 
I never did no harm 
I never did no wrong 

Oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn 
Oh, I never did, did no harm 

I've only been this young once
I never thought I'd do anybody no wrong 
No, not once 

Oh, I did somebody some good
Somebody some good yeah
Oh, did somebody some good yeah
I must have did somebody some good yeah
Oh I believe I did

I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces

And I see them in the streets 
And I see them in the field 
And I hear them shouting under my feet 
And I know it's got to be real 
Oh, Lord, deliver me 
All the wrong I've done 
You can deliver me, Lord 
I only wanted to have some fun

Hear the angels marchin'
Hear the' marchin', hear them marchin'
Hear them marchin', the' marchin' 

(Oh my Jesus)
It's got to be my Jesus
Oh, it's got to be, it's got to be my Jesus
it's got to be my oh
it's got to be my Jesus
Oh take me home
Come on, come on I can hear the answer, sing it
Oh, here they come
Here they come
Here they come
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Oh, feels pretty good, don't you?
Pretty good, I feel
(Oh, Georgina)

(Oh)
Oh, yeah
Oh, I see him
Come on
(Take it)

Oh, don't you make it my dyin', dyin', dyin'
Cough, "that's gonna be the one, isn't it?" 
"Come have a listen, then" 
Oh yes, thank you
