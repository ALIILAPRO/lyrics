		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was never one for singing what I really feel 
Except tonight, I'm bringing everything I know that's real 
Stars, they come and go 
They come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But it gets lonely there 
When there's no one here to share 
We can shake it away if you'll hear a story 
People lust for fame 
Like athletes in a game we break our collarbones 
And come up swinging 
Some of us are downed 
Some of us are crowned 
And some are lost and never found 
But most have seen it all 
They live their lives in sad cafes and music halls 
They always have a story 
Some make it when they're young 
Before the world has done its dirty job 
And later on, someone will say 
"You've had your day you must make way" 
But they'll never know the pain 
Of living with a name you never owned 
Or the many years forgetting what you know too well 
The ones who gave the crown have been let down 
You try to make amends without defending 
Perhaps pretending you never saw the eyes 
Of grown men of twenty five that followed as you walked 
And asked for autographs 
Or kissed you on the cheek 
And you never could believe they really loved you 
Some make it when they're old 
(Perhaps they have a soul they're not afraid to bare 
Or perhaps there's nothing there) 
Some women have a body 
Men will want to see, 
So they put it on display 
Some people play a fine guitar 
I could listen to them play all day 
Some ladies really move across a stage 
And gee, they sure can dance 
I guess I could learn how if I have it half a chance 
But I always feel so funny when my body tries to soar 
And I seem to always worry about missing the next chord 
I guess there isn't anything to put up on display 
Except the tunes and whatever else I say 
Anyway, that isn't really what I meant to say 
I meant to tell a story 
I live from day to day 
Stars, they come and go they come fast or slow 
They go like the last light of the sun, all in a blaze 
And all you see is glory 
But those who've seen it all they live their lives 
In sad cafes and music halls 
We always have a story 
So if you don't lose patience with my fumbling around, 
I'll come up singing for you even when I'm down
