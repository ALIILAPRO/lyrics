		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm afraid I don't know why I'm still here.
Haunted by all these fucking feelings that I have when I am thinking of only one thing
Come and
Please End Me

Please end me

From the bottom of the bottle to the top of the sky
Tell me why I shouldn't kill my life
End Me

I can feel my soul become a hole
Slit me up, Reach inside, Rip it, Spit it

I wish I could stop fucking it up
But I cannot
I will cut my fucking veins and let go of my blood

So I will cut my fucking veins and let go of my fucking blood

Motherfucker

I wanna be free, but the devil in me keeps on telling me that I should always agree with everything he is doing, everything he is saying

So please end me

Slit up my fucking body.
Reach inside of me
Rip it the fuck out and eat it

Please come
End me now finally
Please come
I need some help

I have a fucking problem.

Please come and end me.
