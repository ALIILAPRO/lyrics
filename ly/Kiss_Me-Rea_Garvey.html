		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Standing on the sand dunes waiting for the rain
I haven't got enough strength to dig my own grave
I started to kneel and I started to pray
You put your hands up and you started to wave

Falling through the front door then onto the dance floor
Knew that losing you would be like kissing death
I caught your smile as I was catching my breath
I put the coins in and pressed 22 F

Kiss me like you want me
Show me that you care
Hold me like you're hoping I'll stay here
Tell me in a whisper, look me in the eye
Cross your heart and hope to die

Kiss me like you want me
Show me that you care
Hold me like you're hoping I'll stay here
Tell me in a whisper, look me in the eye
Cross your heart and hope to die

Kiss me like you want me
Kiss me like you want me

Don't be afraid of what's been in the past
Hold on to time 'cause it's moving so fast
I know it's hard not to be like you
There's no need to lie just be kind with the truth

It doesn't make a difference if I heard it before
Yesterday was different, can I hear it once more?
Everything is casual, everything is cool
Everything is broken if I play by the rules

Kiss me like you want me
Show me that you care
Hold me like you're hoping I'll stay here
Tell me in a whisper, look me in the eye
Cross your heart and hope to die

Kiss me like you want me
Show me that you care
Hold me like you're hoping I'll stay here
Tell me in a whisper, look me in the eye
Cross your heart and hope to die

Kiss me like you want me
Kiss me like you want me

Kiss me like you want me
Show me that you care
Hold me like you're hoping I'll stay here
Tell me in a whisper, look me in the eye
Cross your heart and hope to die

Kiss me like you want me
Show me that you care
Hold me like you're hoping I'll stay here
Tell me in a whisper, look me in the eye
Cross your heart and hope to die

Kiss me like you want me
Kiss me like you want me
