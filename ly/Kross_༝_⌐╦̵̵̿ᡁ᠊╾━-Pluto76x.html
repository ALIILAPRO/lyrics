		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Why the fuck you gon stab my back
Yeah, I know I fucked up in my life, but I can't take it back All them fuckin' people that gon talk, now y'all can't eat my sack All them fuckin' pills that you be poppin', that shit ain't no flex He gon' try to preach to me, I don't need motivation She gon' ask me for some favors, tell that , Lil hoe see you later
Ayy, I just got some news about my brother, I cannot take it
I've been fucked up for a minute, I'm just tryna fix my wrongs
And I cannot find these reasons on why the fuck that you is gone

Shawty, I know you hear me, I know you listen to these songs
Promise, no, I can't do this, you can't keep dragging me along
Cause you ain't never give a fuck , on what I say or my perspective
And why the fuck you gon stab my back
Yeah, I know I fucked up in my life, but I can't take it back

All them fuckin' people that gon talk , now y'all can't eat my sack
All them fuckin' pills that you be poppin', that shit ain't no flex
You gon' try to preach to me, I don't need motivation
She gon' ask me for some favors, tell that lil hoe, See you later

Ayy, I just got some news about my brother, I cannot take
I've been fucked up for a minute, I'm just tryna fix my wrongs
