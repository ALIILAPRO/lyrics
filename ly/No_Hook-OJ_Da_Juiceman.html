		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Back at it, craftmatic, all I know is mathematics
On the stove, cooking chicken, right wrist, just did gymnastics
Acrobatic with the work
Like Houdini, do the magic
'Migo bring me kilos so I bust them squares up out the plastic
Get in traffic, 'bout to traffic, known to make that shit happen
Gotta use the razor cause the chickens in some turkey wrapping
After 15 years of trapping, now young Juice done started rapping
Blowing 93 OG from Freddy that he sent from Cali
American Deli swag cause my pockets on a caesar salad
Catch your girl, then I snatch her
Fuck her like a jack rabbit
Sliding in that 50, shawties looking like they tap dancing
Splash the tap water, meet my quota now I'm back at it

View my wrist take a risk
When I'm out here serving fish
Cook a brick, serve a brick, mix it with some remix
All these waves in my head, your girl got sea sick
Took her for some calamari, bitch done ordered cheese sticks
Million dollar nigga, but I stay up on some street shit
Hit a nigga line if you looking for some cheap bricks
I got gas I got swag
I done sold all kind of bags
I done had all kind of bricks, some were good and some were bad
All about the bowl game, cookies sold in sandwich bags
28 do 35, making zip go take a bath
Break my shit to the gram, that's how I see all the cash
Busting down 'bout 50 bales, now I got them Michigan
On my corner, hot as sauna
Tinted window, ran up on 'em
I ain't got shit to say go ahead and call my lawyer
Shout out to my jeweler, got me shining lookin' like some water
Shout out to my 'migo cause he just sent them bricks cross the water
