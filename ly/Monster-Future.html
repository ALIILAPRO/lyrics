		<p>
		  (808 Mafia)
Check, check, check, che-, oh I got it
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

All my niggas some junkies, they keep that bread on 'em dawg
Yo lil' hoe is a monkey, she got a head on her, dawg
Caught a flight outta London, I can't see nothin' but stars
It don't fuck with my conscience I serve my auntie that raw
Fell asleep at the gamblin' house with that heater right on me
And I got me some stripes like I keep Adidas on me
And I don't believe hype, all my soda get spiked
I shake the Codeine and Sprite 'cause that's just the way of life

I'ma monster on these hoes, I'ma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, y'all some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna give my dick a hickey
I'ma monster on these hoes, I'ma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, y'all some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna give my dick a hickey

And I say fuck all the rules, rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools 'cause I'm ready for that drama
And I know I'm a young gunner ain't worried about karma
And I'm just livin' my life and I'ma get me some money
What's happenin'?

I'm young Freddie Kruger, I promote prostitution
These niggas come up snoozin' 'cause they ladies out here choosin'
I know your dog hoes back in style
These hoes'll smash on one of your niggas and be very proud
Wow

I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'ma go pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trappin out the Ghost
Choppin' like Kung Fu
Used to wanna fuck 2, now I wanna fuck the crew
All bad bitches in the rear
Me and young Metro jumpin' out the Lear
Some fresh new gear made the bitch disappear
Some fresh pack of mollies make the bitch go to work
Some lean and the kush, I'm make the pussy squirt
I'ma fuck her throat when she get home from church
Some real good head, make a nigga call back
Chasin' that cheese, you ain't nothin' but a rat
Freeband Gang, nigga pull up on flex
Bitch got knocked up, then she got whacked
I'm talkin' 'bout murkin' that pussy like blaat

I'ma monster on these hoes, I'ma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, y'all some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna give my dick a hickey
I'ma monster on these hoes, I'ma monster
I can't be scared of none you niggas, y'all some snitches
I got some girls that claim they straight but now they kissin'
These bitches switchin', tryna give my dick a hickey

And I say fuck all the rules, rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools 'cause I'm ready for that drama
And I know I'm a young gunner ain't worried about karma
And I'm just livin' my life and I'ma get me some money
What's happenin'?

I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'ma go pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trapping out the Ghost
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'ma go pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trapping out the Ghost
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'ma go pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trapping out the Ghost
