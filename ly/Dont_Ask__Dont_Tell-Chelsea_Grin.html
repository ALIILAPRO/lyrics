		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm not too far from you,
I can't wait to see you,
Again and again.

Pick me up to the highest level,
And lay me down once.
I reach the clouds.
I'm not a fiend,
Just persistent in my being.

I've been living up the nights in white,
The storm keeps growing.
I can taste the bitter leaf,
The high,
The blood is flowing.

My lady winter,
Please come and take my soul.
So don't ask and I won't tell,
Just relax and let your heart swell.
Take this flask, and kick it back.
It won't be easy until she comes back.
So don't ask and I won't tell!

I will hold my breath until
You fill my lungs
I will never give up,
Anticipation is the itch to my crave.

Pick me up to the highest level.
Pick me up to the highest level.

I've been living up the nights in white,
The storm keeps growing.

Look in the mirrors the red
Is feeling in your eyes,
Your eyes.

You're getting lost in between the lines,
The lines.

I've been living up the nights in white,
The storm keeps growing
I can taste the bitter leaf,
The high,
The blood is flowing

So don't ask and I won't tell!
So don't ask and I won't tell
