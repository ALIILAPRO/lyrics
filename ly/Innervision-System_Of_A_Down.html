		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Well, I have a home, longing to roam
I have to find you, I have to meet you
Signs of your face, slowing your pace
I need your guidance, I need to seek my 

Innervision
Innervision

My pupils dance, lost in a trance
Your sacred silence, losing all violence
Stars in their place mirror your face
I need to find you, I need to seek my 

Innervision
Innervision
Innervision

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life, giving you force
It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life, giving you force
Vision

There's only one true path in life
The road that leads to all leads to one
There's only one true path in life (innervision)
The road that leads to all (innervision)
Innervision

Your sacred silence, losing all violence
