		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Everywhere I go
All I see is blue skies in lovers' eyes
Kissin' under city lights and
Don't they make it all look so easy?

I tried and I tried
To fake a smile, pretend that I
Won't be going home lonely tonight
Goddamn, I wish didn't feel so crazy

I wish I could be like happy
Happy people
I just wanna be like happy
Happy people, oh
But I'm suffering inside
Losing my mind
These smiles, they just make me cry every time
'Cause happy, happy people
Just remind me of you

Everywhere I've been, yea-yeah
All I hear is I-love-yous, vows renewed
Holding hands and jumping brooms
Man, they make it look so easy
And I tried (I tried) and I tried (I tried)
To tell myself, "Just give it time"
But these tears never ever dry (never ever, ever dry)
Good lord, I feel like I'm just fading

But I wanna be like happy
Happy people
I just wanna be like happy
Happy people, oh
But I'm suffering inside
Losing my mind
These smiles, they just make me cry every time
'Cause happy, happy people
Just remind me of you
You (oh-ohh, yeah)

'Cause night after night, I see your face
You opened my eyes and I can't look away
You stare back at me
You're staring back at me, yeah

Oh and time after time I've made my mistakes
Haunted by memories I can't erase
I just wanna be (oh, I wanna be), wanna be happy
Yea-yeah, ayy

I just wanna be, just wanna be
Mmm, I wanna be happy (oh no), happy (happy)
Yea-yeah

I wish I could be like happy (happy)
Happy people
I just wanna be like happy
Happy people
But I'm suffering inside
Losing my mind
These smiles, they just make me cry every time
'Cause just happy (yeah, happy)
Happy people (happy people)
Just remind me of you
You (you)
