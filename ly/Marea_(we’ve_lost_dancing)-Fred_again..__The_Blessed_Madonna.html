		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  We've lost dancing (lost dancing)
This year we've had to lose
Our space, we've lost
We've lost dancing (lost dancing)
All these things that
We took for granted
(We've lost dancing, lost dancing)

(We've lost dancing, lost dancing)

This year we've had to lose
Our space, we've lost dancing
We've lost
The hugs with friends and
And people that we loved
All these things that we took for granted (we've lost dancing)
(We've lost dancing, we've lost dancing)

If I can live through (we've lost dancing)
This next six months (we've lost dancing)
Day by day (we've lost dancing)
If I can live through this (we've lost dancing)
What comes next
Will be
Marvelous

(We've lost dancing)

We gon' make it through, through

Dance, lost, lost dance lost 
We've lost dancing, dancing, dancing, lost, lost dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost
We gon' make it through
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, dancing
Lost, lost dancing, 
Lost, lost, lost, lost, dancing, lost, lost, dancing
Lost, lost dancing
We gon' make it through

What comes next
Will be
Marvelous
