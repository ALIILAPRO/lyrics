		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Distant stars
Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head

They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
And dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

There's nothing you can say to him
He is an outer heart
And the space has been broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken
It's broken
Our love

Is it far away in the
Glitter freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they meet

It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising

There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken

It's broken
Our love
Broken
