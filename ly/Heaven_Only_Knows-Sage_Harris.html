		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  No good after midnight
Call me for the fast life
No good with the paper
Spent it on a good time
We don’t regret the past
Keep our money in our hands
Heaven only knows
We called it home
And we know we don’t regret
We don’t care who’s to blame
It’s a catchers game
Heaven only knows
We didn’t change
Just took back the souls we gave
No good after midnight
Call me for the fast life
No good with the paper
Spent it on a good time
We don’t regret the past
Keep our money in our hands
Heaven only knows
We called it home
And we know we don’t regret
We don’t care who’s to blame
It’s a catchers game
Heaven only knows
We didn’t change
Just took back the souls we gave
Why are we here
I’ve dry all my tears
I’ve given up on us
Given up love
A killer oh lord
And my life was what it cost
But your sitting on the dash wearing see through
Stepping on the gas when you come too
Bring up the smoke, we out of control, can’t let it go
We were on a high then we come down
But it never felt right when we came down
And you’re living to fast you should slow down
No good after midnight
Call me for the fast life
No good with the paper
Spent it on a good time
We don’t regret the past
Keep our money in our hands
Heaven only knows
We called it home
And we know we don’t regret
We don’t care who’s to blame
It’s a catchers game
Heaven only knows
We didn’t change
Just took back the souls we gave
