		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you think you're getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the groove
Hey, hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
Oh I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
There may be others
And so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so, and so
You'll just have to pray
If you think you're getting away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all the way
Stay another song
I'll blow you all away
Hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the groove
Hey, hey
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna turn this house around somehow
Murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
You'd better not kill the groove
Hey, hey
It's murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
You'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
Don't think you'll get away
I will prove you wrong
I'll take you all away
Boy, just come along
Hear me when I say
Hey
It's murder on the dance floor
You'd better not kill the groove
It's murder on the dance floor
You'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
It's murder on the dance floor
But you'd better not kill the groove
Hey, hey
It's murder on the dance floor
You'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
It's murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
You'd better not kill the groove
Hey, hey
It's murder on the dance floor (on the dance floor)
You'd better not steal the moves
DJ, gonna burn this goddamn house right down
Oh I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know (on the dance floor)
You'd better not steal the moves
Hey, hey
