		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Hi, are you looking for the other side?
Feel like nothing ever seems quite right?
Are you circling the drain pipe, getting off on pain like
You're corrupted?
I need to know where your loyalties lie
Tell me, are you gonna bark or bite?
Do you really want to twist the knife
In the belly of the monster?

Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system, and back the fuck up
You're a puppet when they cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back

Kingslayer
Destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer
Forevermore the apple of my eye
I'd sacrifice my life to find you
Angel of the flame
Kingslayer
Come and collect us from the night

暗い この見えない世界
まだ消えない未来
ただ手に入れたい another world
System failure
Life is encrypted, genome modified
Like a virus in a lullaby
Artificial 'til the day you die, silly program
You're corrupted

Get the fuck up, wake the fuck up
Wipe the system, and back the fuck up
You're a puppet when they cut your strings off
Don't come crawling back, you're on your own
さあ 時の
扉を開けて
行こうよ

Kingslayer
Destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer
I'll fight for you until I die

Kingslayer
Destroying castles in the sky
Kingslayer
Forevermore the apple of my eye
I'd sacrifice it all to guide you
Never have to battle alone
Kingslayer
Come and collect us from the night

This is your wake up call
We're going down the rabbit hole
Are you ready?
I can't feel you

Is this what you want?
This is what you'll fucking get
You motherfucking shit
