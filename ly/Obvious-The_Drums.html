		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  How obvious, how obvi-obvious

Oh, I remember last time I saw you
You were in my bed
You were kissing me all over my body
And I knew then
Oh, I couldn't admit it
Oh, I couldn't say right then
But you've changed my whole life

And now baby, your love is good as gold
And you deserve to be told
You deserve to be told

So next time I see you
I'll throw my arms around you on the street corner
'Cause everything inside me wants to hold you
And I realize it's obvious that I need you
How obvious, how obvi-obvious

Oh, baby
Forgive me when I hesitate
It's not that I want to
It just comes natural with a past like mine
Oh, baby, you did it
Your consistency has opened up my heart

And now, baby, your love is good as gold
And you deserve to be told
You deserve to be told

So next time I see you
I'll throw my arms around you on the street corner
'Cause everything inside me wants to hold you
And I realize it's obvious that I need you
How obvious, how obvi-obvious

So next time I see you
I'll throw my arms around you on the street corner
'Cause everything inside me wants to hold you
And I realize it's obvious that I need you
How obvious, how obvi-obvious

Last night it hit me
And boy, it hit so hard
So hard

So next time I see you
I'll throw my arms around you on the street corner
'Cause everything inside me wants to hold you
And I realize it's obvious that I need you
How obvious, how obvi-obvious

So next time I see you
I'll throw my arms around you on the street corner
'Cause everything inside me wants to hold you
And I realize it's obvious that I need you
How obvious, how obvi-obvious
