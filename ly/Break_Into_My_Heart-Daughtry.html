		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Been numb so long, I just wanna feel something
I used to be so strong, how did I forget?
Has the world gone cold, have I lost my soul? Feel just like forever
Oh, now there is nothing
I just wanna feel something

So break into my heart
Let me feel the blood rush in
Break into my heart
I need to feel the pain again
Tear it up and bruise it
Wreck it and abuse it
Let it cut beneath the skin
Break into my heart
And make me feel again

I spent most my life always chasing something
I wonder what it's like to have no regrets
Has the world gone blind, have I lost my mind, Lord, I can't remember
Oh, I just wanna feel something

So break into my heart
Let me feel the blood rush in
Break into my heart
I need to feel the pain again
Tear it up and bruise it
Wreck it and abuse it
Let it cut beneath the skin
Break into my heart
And make me feel again

Here I am bleeding, living and breathing
Looking for meaning, something to believe in

So break into my heart
Let me feel the blood rush in
Break into my heart

So break into my heart
Let me feel the blood rush in
Break into my heart
I need to feel the pain again
Tear it up and bruise it
Wreck it and abuse it
Let it cut beneath the skin
Break into my heart
And make me feel again
And make me feel again

So tear it up and bruise it
Wreck it and abuse it
Let it cut beneath the skin
Break into my heart
And make me feel again
