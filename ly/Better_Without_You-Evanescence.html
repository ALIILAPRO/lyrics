		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Stand in the front but shut up 'til I tell you to go
And don't get caught up in pretend 'cause you're not in control
'Cause this is my world, little girl, you'd be lost on your own
Just hating and waiting and saving up

I'll do you a favor and save you if you sign on the line
Don't worry your pretty little head about the future, it's all fine
Whether you're wrong or you're right, doesn't matter, you're not up to the fight
Keeping my head down 'cause they don't know what I know now

As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I'm better without you

Now look around and remember your friends if you can
Feeding the flames 'til there's no one to blame it's on your hands
Lost in your lies, pay the price with our lives, you've gone mad
And there's no way out 'cause we all know you're hollow

As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I'm better without you

Not enough, not enough
Not enough to throw it all away
We'd still be falling
We're fallen
Turn it up, turn it up
Never gonna shut me up again
Your time is over
It's over now

As empires fall to pieces
Our ashes twisting in the air
It makes me smile to know that
I'm, I'm better without you
