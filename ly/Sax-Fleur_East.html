		<p>
		  Give it to me
Give it to me

I met a boy last week tryna run that game
Made it sound so sweet when he say my name
I said, "Boy, stop, run it back
You can talk that talk, but can you play that sax?"
Met a boss last night buyin' out the bar
Said I can ride top-down in his Jaguar
I'm like, "Boy, stop, run that back
You can drive all night, but can you play that sax?"

Baby, baby, I've been waitin' for the one to blow my mind 
(Woo, ow, hey, give it to me)
Maybe, maybe you can get it if you got that thang I like 
(Hey, ah)

I need a straight up brother with a James Brown soul
That type of red hot love that got me freezin' cold
Say you can go all night the way you lay that track (yeah)
But if you wanna hear me sing, you better play that sax
Give it to me

You better play that sax, uh
Okay, play it
You better play that sax

I met a dude last week, honey, he's so vain
Yeah, he be lovin' himself more than Kim and Ye
I'm like, "Boy, stop, run that back
Goddamn, you fine but can you play that sax?"
Met a smart ass dude, mister Know-It-All
Think you got Fleur down to a formula
I'm like" Boy, stop, run it back
Pack a big IQ, but can you play that sax?"

Baby, baby, I've been waitin' for the one to blow my mind, all right
Maybe, maybe you can get it if you got that thang I like 

I need a straight up brother with a James Brown soul
That type of red hot love that got me freezin' cold
Say you can go all night the way you lay that track (yeah)
But if you wanna hear me sing, you better play that sax
Give it to me

Uh, okay, yeah
You better play that sax
Okay, play it
You better play that sax

No fancy cars or bass guitars
Fellas in suits smoking on cigars
Those little boys making all that noise
But you ain't gon' steal the show
No fancy cars or bass guitars
Fellas in suits smoking on cigars, uh
Just play that song I know
Take a deep breath and blow

Get loose, get right
Get a grip and rock me all night
Hold tight, lean back
Play what I want with that sax
Get loose, get right
Get a grip and rock me all night
Hold tight, lean back
Play what I want with that sax

I need a straight up brother with a James Brown soul (James Brown soul)
That type of red hot love that got me freezin' cold (oh)
Say you can go all night the way you lay that track (yeah)
But if you wanna hear me sing
If you wanna hear me sing
If you wanna hear me sing you better play that sax
Give it to me

You better play that sax
You better play that sax
Get loose, get right
Get a grip and rock me all night
Hold tight, lean back
Play what I want with that sax
You better play that sax
Get loose, get right
Get a grip and rock me all night
Hold tight, lean back
Play what I want with that sax
You better play that sax
Get loose, get right
Get a grip and rock me all night
Hold tight, lean back
Play what I want with that sax
