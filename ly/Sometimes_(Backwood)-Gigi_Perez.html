		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Roll me up
Smoke me like
I'm the last Backwood you'll have in your life
Take your time
Fuck me right

I know you've seen
A lot of things
That's why we get along so well my darling
And you know I hate to give you such a hard time
But you know I hate when people look at what's mine
What's mine
Ooh, what's mine

Tell me that you meant it when you said
There was no one else you were thinking of back then
And I know you said you didn't mean to make me cry
But I don't believe that sometimes
Sometimes
Sometimes

Sometimes
I wonder
Oh, sometimes
I wonder
Oh
It doesn't matter though
Sometimes
I wonder
Oh, sometimes
I wonder
Oh
It doesn't matter though
