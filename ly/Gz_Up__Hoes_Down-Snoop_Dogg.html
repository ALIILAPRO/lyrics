		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Hahahaha
Yeah, what's happenin'?
This one is dedicated to my niggas
All my niggas out there, Gs up, hoes down, yeah

The ladies and gents, playas and pimps, listen
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the mic, pay attention
One, two, oh, what shall I do?
I'm slippin' on my khaki suit (which one?)
The blue one, gun by my side as I mob through the beach
On a mission and I'm fishin' for my DJ Warren G
Now I as I look for the bud sack
And see where my loves at on the lake where the doves at
Cognac is the drink that's drank by Gs
Saggin' like a motherfucka, khakis to they knees
Bitch, please, you know how we do the undercover
I'm Snoop Doggy Dogg, not your average motherfucker, see

Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin' you crazy
Now as you groove to the beat and you groove to the sound
I'ma hit you up with Tha Pound, Gs up, hoes down

Will all the real Gs, please stand up
And all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rollin' with the Row

Back with the one, two, three, and to the fo'
It's the S-N, O and to the O, P
(Why am I so fly?) I don't know, but
(Why am I so high?) It's the indo

I don't fuck with the pocus, everybody knows this
Fuckin' with the chronic, 'cause the chronic give me dopeness
Now focus your eyes on these
Follow me as I take ya rollin' with the real OGs
East Side is the motherfuckin' place, known as home
Doggy Dogg with my bone in my hand, twenty grand and

Some of you don't know about the G thang, baby
It's the smooth gangsta shit that be drivin' ya crazy
Now as ya groove to the G-Funk, and move to the sound
I hit you up with Tha Pound, Gs up, hoes down

Will all the real Gs, please stand up
And let all be accounted for
And if you don't give a fuck about a bitch
Then you're rollin' with the Row

Hell yeah, you know what I'm sayin'?
This is strictly for the Gs, you know what I'm sayin'? 
Fuck that bitch
Niggas always handcuffin' they hoes
When a nigga like me step in the place
I don't want that ho, I don't love that ho
I'm caught up with my greens
Collard greens, indo and the cash flow
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Peace, Gs up, hoes down
