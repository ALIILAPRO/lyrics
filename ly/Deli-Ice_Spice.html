		  (Grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
(Grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
(She a baddie, she showin' her panty)
Stop playin' with 'em, RIOT

She a baddie, she showin' her panty
She shake it like jelly (damn)
Hunnid bands in Chanely
But I'm still shakin' ass in the deli (grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady
He like him a wetty
He want the WAP but I just want the fetty (grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty (grrah)

Call me that bee while he eatin' my honey (damn)
You know niggas love bitches with money
I get a lot (I get a lot)
Takin' her spot (grrah)
If you ain't cookin' then get off the pot
My name Ice but I always stay hot
Passenger princess, he pass me his knock (grrah)
Baddest lil' bitch from my block
Me and baddies be gettin' along
So they always be singin' my song
Steppin' outside, I'ma put that shit on (like)
Three hundred and then I perform (damn)
You know I'ma get to the bag
All the hatin' bitches to the back (to the back)
Too much to lose so I cannot react (damn)
Damn, bitches be goin' out sad (grrah)

She a baddie, she showin' her panty
She shake it like jelly (damn)
Hunnid bands in Chanely
But I'm still shakin' ass in the deli (grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady
He like him a wetty
He want the WAP but I just want the fetty (grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty (grrah)

Feelin' a smooch and I'm showin' my coochie
PJ to Emilio Pucci (damn)
I love white bitches like shoutout to Lucy
If she bad then I let her seduce me (damn)
I'm the shit, I'm that bitch, I'm Miss Poopie
Juice in my cup got me feelin' real loopy
Forty-inch, middle-parted
He got all my pics hearted (grrah)
They all like, "Damn, Ice, your flow be the hardest" (like)
I'm not a regular artist
Grrah, grrah
Go Ku and I'm just gettin' started
Baddies on baddies, they know how to move
'Ooters on 'ooters, they know how to 'oot
Bussin' that pack, goin' straight to the moon (moon)
Off the juice, actin' loose

She a baddie, she showin' her panty
She shake it like jelly (damn)
Hunnid bands in Chanely
But I'm still shakin' ass in the deli (grrah)
With my bitch gettin' deady
He like him a wetty
He want the WAP but I just want the fetty (grrah)
And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty (grrah)

(And I'm baggin' his partner, I'm petty)
(But I'm still shakin' ass in the deli)
(Grrah, grrah, grrah, grrah)
