		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I started in a guarded place
I was young
Full of faith
No one even knew my name
But still I chased, ran the race
Do you know what I've been through
I felt forsaken with love's truths
Do you know what I've been through
Do you know what I've been through

Oh I can taste triumph
With the heart of a lion (lion)
Oh power still with giants
'Cause I can taste triumph (triumph)
(Triumph)

I started in a guarded place
The more I pushed
The more I gained
Do you know what I've been through
I've felt forsaken with love's truths
Do you know what I've been through
Who I've been through
Who I've been through

Oh I can taste triumph
With the heart of a lion (lion)
Oh power still with giants
'Cause I can taste triumph (triumph)
(Triumph)
(Triumph)
(Triumph)

Woah

'Cause I've been through it all
Seen every giant fall
I can face some more
Yeah, I can face some more

I've been through it all
Seen every giant fall
I can face some more
Yeah, I can face some more

I can taste triumph
I can taste triumph (triumph)
I can taste triumph
Oh I'm trying
Oh I'm trying (triumph)
Oh I can taste triumph
(Triumph)
Oh I can taste triumph
(Triumph)
(Triumph)
