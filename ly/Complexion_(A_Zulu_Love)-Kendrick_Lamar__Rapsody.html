		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm with this

Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooh complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

Uh
Dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin' sun
Give a fuck about your complexion, I know what the Germans done
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master listenin', cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooh, complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

Uh
Dark as the midnight hour, or bright as the mornin' sun
Brown skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your mama can't run
Sneak (dissin')
Sneak me through the back window, I'm a good field nigga
I made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill with you
You know I'd go the distance, you know I'm ten toes down
Even if master's listenin', I got the world's attention
So I'ma say somethin' that's vital and critical for survival
Of mankind, if he lyin', color should never rival
Beauty is what you make it, I used to be so mistaken
By different shades of faces
Then Whit' told me, "A woman is woman, love the creation"
It all came from God, then you was my confirmation
I came to where you reside
And looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
Let the Willie Lynch theory reverse a million times with

Complexion (two-step)
Complexion don't mean a thing (it's a Zulu love)
Ooh, Complexion (two-step)
It all feels the same (it's a Zulu love)

(Uh)
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it
You like it, I love it

Where the homegirl Rapsody at?
I need you to speak your mind real quick, loved one!

Let me talk my Stu Scott, 'scuse me on my 2Pac
Keep your head up, when did you stop, loving thy
Color of your skin? Color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay's baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don't mean you smart, bein' dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain't talkin' "Woo-hah!"
Need a paradox for the pair of doc's they tutored
Like two Todd's, L-L, you lose two times
If you don't see you beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, uh that's the context, yeah, baby, I'm conscious
Ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain't no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain't talkin' Jay hm-hm, I ain't talkin' Bey
I'm talkin' days we got school watchin' movie screens
And spike your self-esteem, the new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain't a thing

Barefoot babies with no cares
Teenage gun toters that don't play fair
Should I get out the car?
I don't see Compton, I see something much worse
The land of the landmines, the hell that's on earth
