		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm tired of talking about feelings
I'm stuck in a loop, I gotta get out now
Tunnels and walls, there are no ceilings
Always looking for you, I just keep my head down

I always say I'm the happiest sad girl you'll ever meet
Hey, hey, hey
I think that maybe I'm gonna just need you closer to me
You could say

The floor is lava, we die today
Be my lover, let's run away
Call me over, twist the knife
Pull me closer, and I'd be like

Okay okay, okay okay
Okay, whatever you say
Okay okay, okay okay
Okay, whatever you say

I am see-through when I'm with you
I've been doing overtime keeping it together
Could convince me of anything
This is matter over mind, make me feel better

I always say I'm the happiest sad girl you'll ever meet
Hey, hey, hey
I think that maybe I'm gonna just need you closer to me
You could say

The floor is lava, we die today
Be my lover, let's run away
Call me over, twist the knife
Pull me closer, and I'd be like

Okay okay, okay okay
Okay, whatever you say
Okay okay, okay okay
Okay, whatever you say

The floor is lava, we die today
Be my lover, let's run away
Call me over, twist the knife
Pull me closer, and I'd be like

Okay okay, okay okay
Okay, whatever you say
Okay okay, okay okay
Okay, whatever you say
Whatever you say
Okay, whatever you say
Whatever, whatever you say
Okay, whatever you say
