		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yea, yea
Mmm

Look, I just wanna get my mom a crib and I'll be straight
I just wanna get up off a jet, hop in a lake
Tell me I can't have it, bitch, I bet I chase
They don't know where we from but we lived in the base
Brothers came from nothin'
Made into somethin'
The circle is buzzin'
I feel it comin', okay
She used to be so sly
Bitch, got respect on my neck 'cause I stay focused
Worked that nine-to-five, had my head low
Lookin' for the money, was a no-show
Pop up crew, walkin' through a funeral
Like big dance six 'cause I'm big, oh
To be honest, won't live long
But while I'm here I bet they feel me on these songs, huh
While I'm here I bet I'll rage, rage, rage
So liberatin', give a damn what you say 

Please stand by
I love it when my bitches get high, yea (get high)
Please stand by
Said, I love it when my enemies die, yea (enemies die)
Please stand by
We gon' hit the fuckin' sky, yea
Please stand by, woah
I'm about to catch this flight, yea, yea
Please stand

Geek time, geekin' (geek)
Rollin' every goddamn weekend (yea, yea)
I'm dealin' with the meds in the trash (yea)
Pop these pills in secret (secret)
See I'm 'bout to fly out to Houston (oh)
I don't take drugs, I abuse them (oh)
No, I do not fuck with you losers (nope)
You turn up the sad excuses
If it's droppin' then it's up, uh (it's up)
Play with me and get you stuck (no-no)
I did not play with that pussy (please)
If she fucks with me, I fuck (roll)
I'm rollin' out, yea
I'm rollin' out. Yea (I'm rollin' out)
Pay back to see me on stage
Playin' after the shows like I'm fuckin' up

Please stand by
I love it when my bitches get high, yea (get high)
Please stand by
Said, I love it when my enemies die, yea (enemies die)
Please stand by
We gon' hit the fuckin' sky, yea (yea)
Please stand by, woah
I'm about to catch this flight, yea, yea

I'm gon' get tired of fuckin' and rollin' (ayy)
But you are my vibe, love when she talkin' (hell yea)
The city go high 'at two in the mornin'
Can't fuck with my vibe, can't fuck with my homies (oh yea)
Lil' mamacita got it goin'
If she fuck with me, she like them foreign
Kawasaki, flip it like a hornet (oh yea)
If they ain't licked, that shit borin'
You don't fuck with me but got a liter (oh)
Drippin' sippin' like a margarita
Fuck with me, you can't die broke
Fuck with me, you can't die, oh

Please stand by
I love it when my bitches get high
Please stand by
Said, I love it when my enemies die
Please stand by
We gon' hit the fuckin' sky
Please stand by
I'm about to catch this flight
