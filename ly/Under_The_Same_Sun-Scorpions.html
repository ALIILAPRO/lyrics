		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I saw the morning
 It was shattered by a gun
 Heard a scream, saw him fall, no one cried
 I saw a mother
 She was praying for her son
 Bring him back, let him live, don't let him die
 
 Do you ever ask yourself
 Is there a Heaven in the sky
 Why can't we get it right
 
 Cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why, why can't we live as one 
 
 I saw the evening 
 Fading shadows one by one
 We watch the lamb, lay down to the sacrifice
 I saw the children
 The children of the sun
 How they wept, how they bled, how they died
 
 Do you ever ask yourself
 Is there a Heaven in the sky
 Why can't we stop the fight
 
 Cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why, why can't we live as one 
 
 Sometimes I think I'm going mad
 We're loosing all we had and no one seems to care
 But in my heart it doesn't change
 We've got to rearrange and bring our world some love
 
 And does it really matter  
 If there's a heaven up above
 We sure could use some love
 
 Cause we all live under the same sun
 We all walk under the same moon
 Then why, why can't we live as one 
 Cause we all live under the same sky
 We all look up at the same stars
 Then why, tell me why can't we live as one
