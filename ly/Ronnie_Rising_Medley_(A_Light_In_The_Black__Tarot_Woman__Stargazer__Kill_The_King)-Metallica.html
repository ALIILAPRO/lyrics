		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna go
Something tells me no, no, no, no
Traces in the sand
Lines inside my hand go, go, go?

Beware of a place
A smile of a pride shiny face

I'll never return up to your love
Tarot woman
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

She can take you there
The answer's to the fear
Mine, mine, mine

Like a carousel
And cast a magic spell
Fly, fly

Beware of a place
A smile of a pride shining face

I'll never return up to your love
Tarot woman 
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

High noon oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides
He's lighter than air
Oh I see his face
Where is your star
Is it far, is it far, is it far
And when do we leave
I believe, I believe yes, believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We built a tower of stone
With out flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
Oh but don't know why
Now where do we go

Danger, danger the queen's about to kill
Stranger, stranger and life about to spill
Oh no move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the wind
No pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Tear him down
Kill the king
Yeah strike him down
Power, power it happens every day
Power, devour all along the way
Oh no, move me out of harm
I need a spell and a charm
And fly like the wind
No pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king

Strike 'em down!

Treason, treason, the specter looms again
Treason, reason, the realm is safe and then
Oh no, move away from harm
I need a spell and a charm
Fly like the rainbow
No pawn, so be gone, speed on and on
Kill the king
Yeah tear him down
Kill the king
Yeah take his crown
Kill the king
Go take his crown
Yeah yeah kill the king
Shout him down
