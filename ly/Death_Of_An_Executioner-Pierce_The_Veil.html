		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Headlights on your back tonight
Kill the weight now we're fast and light
Please don't cool my war machine
Performance high and deafening
Blood dries on the sparkling lead paint
Kill the competition, I bleed your fuel I'm siphoning
The soul left out, I

Hold my breathe and drive
Staring at the sky
Luminous and bright
Running out of time

Blood red moonlight
Gaining 'til you're over me
Beautiful as everything is crumbling
The flames dance off your eyes

Cigarettes on a dark, bent highway
Follow you from a distance like
Demons in a death machine
I feel your stomach tightening
Power lines from above see nothing
So, tell the world what I want I'm gonna get
I pray for bones to break and mirrors to shatter, I

Hold my breathe and drive
Staring at the sky
Luminous and bright
Running out of time

Blood red moonlight
Gaining 'til you're over me
Beautiful as everything is crumbling
The flames dance off your eyes

(Blood red moon)
(Blood red moonlight)
(Blood red moon)

Blood red moonlight
Gaining 'til you're over me
Beautiful as everything is crumbling
The flames dance off your eyes

Blood red moonlight
Gaining 'til you're over me
Beautiful as everything is crumbling
The flames dance off your eyes, oh

Blood red moonlight
