		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My goldfish died today
Little heart in a bubble
Ray of light in my kitchen
The only livin piece of my mind
Since you crossed the line
Mister K mister K
They told me not to be sad
It is just a matter of time
What if you had stopped time
What if I'm stuck on yours
Mister K mister K
State of mind
Not really united any more
But one thing is for real a fish is a better friend
Than a human
And that’s for sure
My goldfish died today, my goldfish died today
Mister K mister K
I named it Jack the ripper
Psycho under water
The only livin' memory
Showing how, you stabbed me
