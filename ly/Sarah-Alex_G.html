		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sarah runs
To feel the burning in her lungs
And clear her head
Do you know what Sarah meant?

When she said, you, be my guest
And keep the pace to save your face
You'll never make the place
Why do you even run the race?

I can't be what you need
I am stuck in a dream
I am stuck in a dream

Don't you know
She's been here all along?
In a dream
She belongs in a dream

Every day
I'll make promises that plague
Sarah's heart
So I can watch her fall apart

'Cause I know when I break her down
We'll spit on all the happy clowns
That live around this sunny town
She loves me like a dog
And when we mess around
I'll let her know the truth I found
In my own hopeless hate
And every time I wake
I second guess the game I played
Did I make a mistake?
