		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  To whom it may concern
And all the tragic we've been through
No matter where I go
I keep on running into you

Blink of an eye
Feels like forever
Same as it ever was
Same as whatever

Before the yellow fades to blue

I'm shaken
I'm shaken
I'm shaken
I'm shaken

Can't bring myself to cut ties
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake the shadow

Paradise lost in your eyes
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake

I'm shaken
I'm shaken

Found the key but couldn't open the cell
This selfishness was part of saving myself
From you now I hold the disease
Planted the poisonous seed
Tried not to eat from the tree
Will I survive?
It's so hard to tell

Can't bring myself to cut ties
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake the shadow

Paradise lost in your eyes
I know you better than anyone
Blessed with this curse my whole life
Won't let me shake

I'm shaken
I'm shaken

I'm shaken
