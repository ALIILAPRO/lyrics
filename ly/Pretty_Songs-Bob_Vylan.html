		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  One, two, one, two, three, four

I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
It might be nice
I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
That's alright, but I'd rather fight

I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
That's alright, but I'd rather fight
And watch you bleed
I'd rather watch you bleed
Sing a song, a pretty little song
That's alright, but I'd rather fight

I'm violent when I need be
You got a problem, come see me
Black lives have always mattered
You were just never told so on TV
White folks love quote Martin Luther
'Cause he held hands and prayed when they bombed his building
Good for him but the times have changed
And don't forget white folks still killed him

I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
That's alright, but I'd rather fight
And watch you bleed
I'd rather watch you bleed
Sing a song, a pretty little song
That's alright, but I'd rather fight

Who the fuck are you?

I'm no pacifist, I'm smashing fists
At every single racist prick I meet
I'm not having it, there's no "Kum ba yah"
To be found 'round here, no groovy beat
No liberal lefty cunt
Is gonna tell me punching Nazis ain't the way
If you wanna hold hands and sing
Go do it over there while the big boys play, okay

I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
That's alright, but I'd rather fight
And watch you bleed
I'd rather watch you bleed
Sing a song, a pretty little song
That's alright, but I'd rather fight

I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
It might be nice
I could do this all day long
Sing a song, a pretty little song
Blah blah, rah rah rah
That's alright, but I'd rather kill you
