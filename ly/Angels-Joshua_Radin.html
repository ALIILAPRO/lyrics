		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  It's been a long time that I've been on my own, and I can't take no more
But these winds are changin'
They'll blow me through the storm until I see the shore
And I'm prayin' for someone to show me I'm not done
Sometimes I see your face

You've got everything I need
When I'm lost, it's only you I seek
You've got wings to set me free
When I doubt, you're makin' me believe
That angels can fall, angels can fall

And I'll cross the ocean
I'll walk the desert sand
I'll find those hills to climb
And I'll keep on searchin' 'cause I know you want to land
Into these arms of mine
On this road that I'm walkin', I hear you talkin'
I know I'll find you soon

You've got everything I need
When I'm lost, it's only you I seek
You've got wings to set me free
When I doubt, you're makin' me believe
That angels can fall, angels can fall

I've been hurt and I've been left on the floor
You're the light that lifts me up through that open door

You've got everything I need
When I'm lost, it's only you I seek
You've got wings to set me free
When I doubt, you're makin' me believe
That angels can fall, angels can fall
