		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've seen the devil
Down sunset, in every place, in every face

Yeah, yeah
Tell me, do you see her?
She's livin' her life
Even if she acts like she don't want the limelight
But if you knew her, yeah, she lives a lie
She calls the paparazzi, then she acts surprised

Oh, ooh, I know what she needs, oh-oh
She just want the fame, I know what she fiends, oh-oh
Give her a little taste, running back to me, oh-oh
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Every night (every night) she prays to the sky 
Flashing lights is all she ever wants to see

Begging on her knees to be popular
That's her dream to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Popular, just to be popular, uh-huh
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular

Money on top of me, money on top of her, uh-huh
Money on top of me, money on top of her, uh-huh
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular, uh-huh
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular

I know that you see me
Time's gone by
Spent my whole life runnin' from your flashin' lights
Try to own it
But I'm alright
You can't take my soul without a fucking fight, oh

Ooh, I know what she needs, oh-oh
She just want the fame, I know what she fiends, oh-oh
Give her a little taste, running back to me, oh-oh
Put it in her veins, pray her soul to keep, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Every night (every night) she prays to the sky 
Flashing lights is all she ever wants to see

Begging on her knees to be popular
That's her dream to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Popular, just to be popular, uh-huh
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular

Money on top of me, money on top of her, uh-huh
Money on top of me, money on top of her, uh-huh
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular, uh
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular, uh
Money on top of me, money on top of her, uh-huh
Money on top of me, money on top of her, uh-huh
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular, uh-huh
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular

I'm getting money and I'm keepin' it
I'm getting cash and I'm keepin' it
Money on top of me, money on top of her
Shawty fuck with me 'cause she know I'm popular

Pop-popular, born to be popular
She in debt, twenty mill', but she run it up
She can never be broke 'cause she popular
Turn the webcam on for the followers

Begging on her knees to be popular
That's her dream to be popular
Kill anyone to be popular
Sell her soul to be popular
Popular, just to be popular, uh-huh
Everybody scream 'cause she popular
She mainstream 'cause she popular
Never be free 'cause she popular
