		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ayy, yeah, in her feels
Bitch, my bread hurt, I just bought a crib in the Hills
Lil' shawty sucked me up, she in her feels
I'm a kickstand off this drank, bitch, I step in heels

God, my head hurt, I been poppin' so many damn pills
Now my bread hurt, I just bought a crib up in the Hills
Got a big body, Tonka, matte black, Forgi' wheels
All this shit got slight, I got right, I got big bills
All these diamonds bite, yeah, they fight, they got big meals
Got my money up by myself, fuck a big deal
All these shawties wan' fuck now that I'm up, I'm a big deal
We some rockstars livin', we do all pills
Bitch, this drank I got it's real, I just cracked the seal
Bitch, you ain't touched a mil', you don't know how I feel
I just turned down a deal, I make money still

Yeah, oh, they sayin', "Why you talkin' bout big bodies?"
Bitch, I live 'bout what I talk 'bout
This bitch pulled up on me and she wildin' with her top off
It ain't shit for one of my twizzy to bring the mop out (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just hit LV with a twenty, I got zero now
I just took a pill, this Perc' is twenty, I can't feel now
I get numb 'cause I'm dumb, hey
All my brothers rich, still all we got is hundons
I can't even sign for less than a mil' 'cause I want one, yeah
I just bought a building 'cause I want one
Told that bitch to Bob the Build that booty if she really want one
I don't got the Perkies, got me moody, bitch I want one

God, my head hurt, I been poppin' so many damn pills
Now my bread hurt, I just bought a crib up in the Hills
Got a big body, Tonka, matte black, Forgi' wheels
All this shit got slight, I got right, I got big bills
All these diamonds bite, yeah, they fight, they got big meals
Got my money up by myself, fuck a big deal
All these shawties wan' fuck now that I'm up, I'm a big deal
We some rockstars livin', we do all pills
Bitch, this drank I got it's real, I just cracked the seal
Bitch, you ain't touched a mil', you don't know how I feel
I just turned down a deal, I make money still
