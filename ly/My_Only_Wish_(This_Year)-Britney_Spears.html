		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

Last night I took a walk in the snow
Couples holding hands, places to go
Seems like everyone but me is in love
Santa, can you hear me?
I signed my letter that I sealed with a kiss
I sent it off, it just said this
"I know exactly what I want this year"
Santa, can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby (ooh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
He'll be all my own in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

Ooh, yeah
Yeah, yeah

Christmas Eve, I just can't sleep
Would I be wrong for taking a peek?
'Cause I heard that you're comin' to town
Santa, can you hear me? (Yeah)
I really hope that you're on your way
With something special for me in your sleigh
Oh please, make my wish come true
Santa, can you hear me?

I want my baby, baby (ooh)
I want someone to love me
Someone to hold
Maybe, maybe (maybe, maybe)
We'll be all alone under the mistletoe

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year (ooh)
And all I want is one thing
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here
Santa, that's my only wish this year

I hope my letter reaches you in time (oh, yeah)
Bring me a love I can call all mine (oh, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I have been so good, so good this year (oh)
Can't be alone under mistletoe
He's all I want in a big red bow

Santa, can you hear me?
I have been so good this year
And all I want is one thing (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me my true love is near
He's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here (oh, yeah)
Santa, that's my only wish this year

(Ahh) oh, Santa
(Ahh)
Can you hear (ahh) me? Oh
Oh, Santa (ahh)

Well, he's all I want, just for me
Underneath my Christmas tree
I'll be waiting here (oh, yeah)
Santa, that's my only wish this year

Santa, that's my only wish this year
