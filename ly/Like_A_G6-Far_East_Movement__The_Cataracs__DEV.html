		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

Gimme that MoÃ«t ('et)
Gimme that Crystal ('stal)
Ladies love my style, at my table gettin' wild
Get them bottles poppin', we get that drip and that drop
Now, now, give me two more bottles 'cause you know it don't stop

(808)
Hell yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me they be actin' like they drunk

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

Sippin' on, sippin' on sizz', I'ma ma-make it fizz
Girl, I keep it gangster, poppin' bottles at the crib (crib)
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

(808)
Hell yeah
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me they be actin' like they drunk

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

Yeah, it's that 808 bump, make you put yo' hands up
Make you put yo' hands up, put yo', put yo' hands up
(You can't touch this)
It's that 808 bump, make you put yo' hands up
Make you put yo' hands up, put yo', put yo' hands up
(You can't touch this)

Hell yeah
Make you put yo' hands up
Make you put yo' hands up
Put yo', put yo' hands up
(You can't touch this)
Hell yeah
Make you put yo' hands up
Make you put yo' hands up
Put yo', put yo' hands up

Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink, we do it right gettin' slizard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride (in my ride) like Three 6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
