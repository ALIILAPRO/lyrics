Pop a perky just to start up

Pop a perky just to start up

Pop a perky just to start up

Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up

Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up

Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up

Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)

Hey, hey, hey tater tot
Fuck niggas on my radar watch (watchin')
Crocodile hunter, turn 'em to some gator shots (urr)
Iced out watch (ice)
Ridin' round ten o'clock (ten)

Ridin' round, geeked up, damn, think it's three o'clock (three)
Four o'clock (four)
Five o'clock, six o'clock (five)
I'm gon' pop, if I don't I'm back to the pot (whip)
I got rocks (rocks)
Big bales, big arms (bales)
Tommy gun, come out and play, let's have fun (yeah)

Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up

Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up (two cups, drank)
Pop a perky just to start up (pop it, pop it, pop, it)
Two cups of purple just to warm up
