		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  There she goes
There she goes again
Racin' through my brain
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she blows (there she blows again)
There she blows again (there she blows again)
Pulsin' through my vein (there she blows again)
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
She calls my name
Pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
But I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes
There she goes again
Chasin' down my lane
And I just can't contain
This feelin' that remains

There she goes (there she goes again)
There she goes (there she goes again)
There she goes (there she goes again)
