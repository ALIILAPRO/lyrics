		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static, and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I'm pretending to be where I'm not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
Even though you're so close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor, the rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn't real
Now I'm trapped in this memory
And I'm left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
So, even though you're close to me
You're still so distant, and I can't bring you back

It's true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if you're not with me

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I'm with you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, no matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we've come
I can't wait to see tomorrow
With you

You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You now I see
Keeping everything inside (with you)
You now I see
Even when I close my eyes
