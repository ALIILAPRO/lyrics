		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got words on my mind that I'm too scared to speak
And a burden that's grown these last couple of weeks
But I'm too scared to tell you what's been on my mind
'Cause it's you that's been crossing it from time to time

You're the only structure that's keeping me up
You're my bones, take my heart, break my ribcage apart
'Cause I'm already broken, these last couple years
Have torn me and I have shed blood, I've shed tears

I've shed my old skin
I've grown something quite rough
I've grown something that shields from what people call 'love'
And I know that you've grown this rough skin like me too
'Cause I've seen you shed blood and shed tears crystal blue

I've got words on my mind that I'm too scared to speak
And a burden that's grown these last couple of weeks
But I'm too scared to tell you what's been on my mind
'Cause it's you that's been crossing it all the time

You're the only structure that's keeping me up
You're my bones, take my heart, break my ribcage apart
'Cause I'm already broken, these last couple years
Have torn me and I have shed blood, I've shed tears

I've shed
