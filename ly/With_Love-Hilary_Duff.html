		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't mind you telling me what's been on your mind lately
I don't mind you speaking up
I know sometimes I can be all wrapped up and into me
I can be in such a rush

Just slow me down, slow me down
Tell me, tomorrow, everything will be around
Just slow me down, slow me down
You're the one who keeps me on the ground

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love

Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love

I can take your honesty
All your words weigh heavily
Listening to you all the time (all the time)
I wanna be there for you the way you've been there for me
Always help me walk the line (walk the line)

And slow me down, slow me down
I know you will always be around

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love

All this time we finally know each other
Now that I've been leaning on your shoulder
I can tell you, baby, that
You're right when you're right
You're wrong when you're wrong
And I can be weak 'cause I know you'll be strong

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love

Baby, you can be tough
Say enough is enough
You could even be blunt
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Tell me I'm wrong
That I'm coming on way too strong
Don't think I'll be crushed
Just do it with love, love, love, love

Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love, love, love, love
Just do it with love

Just do it with love
