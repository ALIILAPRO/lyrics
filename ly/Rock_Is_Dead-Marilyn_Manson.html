		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All simple monkeys with alien babies
Amphetamines for boys, crucifixes for ladies
Sampled and soulless, worldwide and real webbed
You sell all the living for more safer dead

Anything to belong
Anything to belong

Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all that we're fed
So fuck all your protests and put them to bed

God is in the TV
Rock! La, la, la, la, la, la
Rock! La, la, la, la, la
Rock! La, la, la, la, la, la
Rock! La, la, la, la, la

One thousand mothers are praying for it
We're so full of hope and so full of shit
Build a new God to medicate and to ape
Sell us Ersatz dressed up and real fake

Anything to belong
Anything to belong

Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all that we're fed
So fuck all your protests and put them to bed

God is in the TV
Rock! La, la, la, la, la, la
Rock! La, la, la, la, la
Rock! La, la, la, la, la, la
Rock! La, la, la, la, la

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la

Rock is deader than dead
Shock is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all that we're fed
So fuck all your protests and put them to bed
Rock (rock) is deader than dead
Shock (shock) is all in your head
Your sex and your dope is all that we're fed
So fuck all your protests and put them to bed
