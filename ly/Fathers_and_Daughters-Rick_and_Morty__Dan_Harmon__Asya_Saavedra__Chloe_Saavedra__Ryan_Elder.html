		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've got a doodoo in my butt
And I don't know what to do
With the doodoo in my butt
But I know that a father should say to you
That he's proud of you

Every daughter is a doodoo from a father's butt
Biologically speaking, the butt is a nut
And every father father's wrong
And there isn't a song that can change that

I've got a doodoo in my butt
And I don't know what to do
With the doodoo in my butt
But I know that a father should say to you
That he's proud of you

Every daughter is a doodoo from a father's butt
Biologically speaking, the butt is a nut
And every father father's wrong
And there isn't a song that can change that

(Change that, change that)

I've got a doodoo in my butt
And I don't know what to do
With the doodoo in my butt
But I know that a father should say to you
That he's proud of you

Every daughter is a doodoo from a father's butt
Biologically speaking, the butt is a nut
And every father father's wrong
And there isn't a song that can change that
