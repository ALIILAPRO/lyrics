		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If our dreams fall out to outer space
Then my love will bring you back around
If we run too far and lose our grace
Then my love will bring you back around
If you lose me swimming out to sea
Then just call out, I will hear your sound
'Cause we know that what will be will be
Yeah, my love will bring you back around

Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you back around

Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you back around

Here we go, bring you back, back around
Here we go, back around, back around
Here we go, bring you back, back around
Here we go, back around, back around

If our dreams fall out to outer space
Then my love will bring you back around
If we run too far and lose our grace
Then my love will bring you back around
If you lose me swimming out to sea
Then just call out, I will hear your sound
'Cause we know that what will be will be
Yeah, my love will bring you back around

Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you back around

Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you
Yeah, my love will bring you back around

Here we go, bring you back, back around
Here we go, back around, back around
Here we go, bring you back, back around
Here we go, back around, back around

Here we go, bring you back (yeah, my love will bring you)
Back around (yeah, my love will bring you)
Here we go, bring you back (yeah, my love will bring you)
Back around (yeah, my love will bring you)
Here we go, bring you back (yeah, my love will bring you)
Back around (yeah, my love will bring you)
Yeah, my love will bring you back around
