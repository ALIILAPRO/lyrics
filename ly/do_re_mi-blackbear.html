		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Do, re, mi, fa, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Do, re, mi, fa, so
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, if I could go back to that day we met
I probably would just stay in bed
You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or bitch, it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder
Next time I'ma stay asleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep, oh

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya, it go like

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, baby
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

If I could go back to that day we met
I probably would've stayed in bed
You wake up everyday and make me feel like I'm incompetent
Designer shoes and Xanax tabs
Compliments your make-up bag
You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime

And you got me thinking lately
Bitch, you crazy
And nothing's ever good enough
I wrote a little song for ya, it go like

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, baby
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh)

(And you got me thinking lately, yeah)
(Bitch, you crazy)
(And nothing's ever good enough)
I wrote a little song for ya, it go like

Do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, girl
So fuckin' done with all the games you play
I ain't no Tic-tac-toe
Send the X and O's on another note
I'm do, re, mi, fa, so fuckin' done with you, baby
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

(So send the X and O's on another note, I'm)
Do, re, mi, fa, so (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So send the X and O's on another note, I'm ghost
