		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  What I want, I want now
And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow"
I wanna fly, fly a fountain
I want to jump, jump, jump, jump a mountain

I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
But it seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no
Evil

I get ideas, I get a notion
I want a nice little boat made out of ocean
I get your point, you're so sharp
Getting good reactions with your evil talk

I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
It seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no
Evil

Don't say unconscious, no, don't say doom
Well, if you got to say it, I've got to leave this room
'Cause what I want, I want now
And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow," get it?

I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
It seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no
Evil

I'm running wild with the one I love (I see no evil)
I'm going crazy with the one I love (I see no evil)
I keep on dancin' with the one I love (I see no evil)

You control the feelings of the one you love (I see no evil)
You control the feelings of the one you love (I see no evil)
You can feed the fires of the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
You pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
