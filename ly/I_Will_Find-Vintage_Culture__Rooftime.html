		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My only peace of mind
Please, tell me
By your side

Do you know someplace where I can hide?
From all of the highs
And all of the lows?
The place where I will find
My only peace of mind
Please, tell me
It's by your side

My only peace of mind
Please, tell me

Do you know someplace where I can hide?
From all of the highs
And all of the lows?
The place where I will find
My only peace of mind
Please, tell me
It's by your side

My only peace of mind
Please, tell me
By your side

My only peace of mind
Please, tell me
By your side
