		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  All I wanna say
Girl I wanna say
I'm saying that I'm sorry

Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh

August 4th, we were chilling at the house
Said I'm done, I told you to get out
Didn't mean a word that I said
Cause I was hoping you would come back

'Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
And I tried to fight and I cried to god
Oh please let it just work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
'Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this, baby I want this
Say baby I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry

You wanna know if I was moving on without you
I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you
To tell the truth I've thinking bout you lately
I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you

Christmas day, you said you had a ring
But you changed your mind
Too caught up in the streets
Boy your truth is hard to believe
Why are you really scared of me

'Cause I tried and tried
And I cried and cried
Up late at night and I hurt
'Cause I put in mine,
And worked all the time and you never put in your work
And I'm going crazy with you
You got me so confused
'Cause you walked away, and I walked away
And we should've stayed baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this, baby I want this
Say baby I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry

You wanna know if I was moving on without you
I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you
To tell the truth I've thinking bout you lately
I miss you, miss you, miss you, I miss you

I miss the way you hold me
The way you touch me
I miss the way you kiss me yeah
All I wanna do, do, do, do, do
All I wanna do
Is say that I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
So sorry baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry
And I'm in love with you
Baby I want this, baby I want this
Say baby I'll do what it takes
And I will be here all the way baby

All you have to do is say that I'm sorry
Baby I'm sorry

You know I think about you sometimes
I wonder how you are
Are you happy
You see I know
What we had was special
And I know you know it too
I miss you
I really miss you
