		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Reach out for me
Reach out and see me through
Tell me where I am
And who we are
And where to go 
Will I be lost
Will I find the way to you

Cause every time I try
Every time I fail to see
All that's you and I
And every time I need
I need you
I need you

Too many stars
On my way back home
Too many things that caught my attention
And the thought renew my fear
Will I be lost
Or will I stumble upon a way out of here

Too many things that gets to my mind
Every second every hour
Every day and every night
The sun and the moon
The wind and the rain
Everything to everyone
Every second every hour
Reach out for me
Reach out for me

Every time I try
Every time I fail to see
All that's you and I
Every time I need 
I need you 
I need you
