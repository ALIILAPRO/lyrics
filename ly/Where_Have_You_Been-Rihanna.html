		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, babe

Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (oh), yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where have you been
All my life? All my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, baby

Where have you been?
'Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (oh), yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Where have you been
All my life? All my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?
Where have you been all my life?

Where have you been all my life?

You can have me all you want
Any way, any day
Just show me where you are tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah (ohh), yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah-yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (ohh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you, babe
Looking for you, babe
Searching for you, babe
