		<p>
		  Yeah, yeah
Bang, bang
Let it bang, let it bang
Let it bang, let it bang

The way I throw it up, throw it up
You like the way I throw it up
Boy, you like the way I throw it up
The way I throw it up

Roll up on your love like a drive-by
We doing it everywhere
Holding on, baby, like I'm gonna die
Laying in this bed like I've been shot
Love the way you give it to me, can't lie
And I don't care, I don't care
I don't care what anybody thinks about it
When I'm with you, I don't think about it

We go on and on and on and on
Do this all night long, night long, night long
In my zone, my zone, my zone, my zone
We just let it bang
Underneath the covers
No colors, just lovers

Throw it up
Baby, just hold it up
You like the way I throw it up
We just let it bang
We just let it bang
Throw it up
Baby, just hold it up
You like the way I throw it up
We just let it bang
We just let it bang

It seems every night I get initiated
Crazy thing is I initiate
On your body like daylight
Under your body like goodnight
Go ahead, baby
Sweat it out, sweat it out
He like "Go ahead, baby"
Just wet it out, wet it out

You go on and on and on and on
Do this all night long, night long, night long
In my zone, my zone, my zone, my zone
We just let it bang
Underneath the covers
No colors, just lovers

Throw it up
Baby, just hold it up
You like the way I throw it up
Let it bang
We just let it bang
We throw it up
Let it bang
You like the way I throw it up
Let it bang
You like the way I throw it up
We just let it bang
The way I throw it up

Baby, I've got loving you on my mind
And I tell you all the time
You've been gone, I need retribution
And your love is my resolution
I wanna feel you in my spirit
I wish everybody could feel this
Everybody but God should feel this, feel this

Throw it up
Baby, just hold it up
You like the way I throw it up
We just let it bang, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bang
