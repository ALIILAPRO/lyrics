		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Ooh ooh) Here we go, found my position
Let's hit the road (Ooh ooh)
Came alone, now my people here with me
 I'm in my zone (Ooh ooh)
Been around the block a time or two
I tell you where to go
I tell you how to move (Ooh ooh)
I got longitudes and latitudes
Keep it movin', that's my attitude
(Ooh ooh)
Lookin' back, I know they probably doubt me
Now the city on my back, I wear it proudly
(Ooh ooh) i'm a hero in the makin', huh
If I'm dreamin' you can't wake me
(Ooh ooh)

I think I'm destined to win it
They playin' games, I ain't in it
(yeah, yeah) i took the message and sent it
Feel likе I was born for this minute

This is my time
I'm seizin' thе moment 'cause I gotta
Go 'fore the time's gone (Gone, gone)
Ain't scared of the dark
'cause I'm bringing
The light when the night's long i shine on
See it comin', I don't need a sign
(yeah, yeah)
This the moment, I'ma make it mine
(yeah, yeah)
This is my time (This is my time, yeah)
My time, my time now
(This is my time, this is my time, yeah)
My time, my time (This is my time)

Shoulda known from the beginnin'
I was put on Earth to win it (Ooh ooh)
What a tangled web we live in
Anyway you try to spin it
(Ooh ooh, yeah, yeah)
Hero's lookin' at me in the mirror
Couldn't tell but now I see it clear
(Ooh ooh)
Got the confidence to make the moments
Matter even after all the interference
(Ooh ooh)

I think I'm destined to win it
They playin' games, I ain't in it
(yeah, yeah) i took the message and sent it
Feel like I was born for this minute

This is my time
I'm seizin' the moment 'cause I gotta
Go 'fore the time's gone (Gone, gone)
Ain't scared of the dark
'cause I'm bringing
The light when the night's long (Long)
I shine on
See it comin', I don't need a sign
(yeah, yeah)
This the moment, I'ma make it mine
(Get it, get it)
This is my time (This is my time, yeah)
My time, my time now
(This is my time, this is my time, yeah)
My time, my time (This is my time)
