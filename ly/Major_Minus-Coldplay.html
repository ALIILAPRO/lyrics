		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful who it is you're talking to
They got one eye watching you
One eye on what you do
So be careful what it is you're trying to do

And be careful when you're walking in the view
Just be careful when you're walking in the view

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on

They got one eye watching you
And one eye on what you do
So be careful 'cause nothing they say is true
D-don't believe a word, it's us against the world
And we just got to turn up to be heard

Hear the crocodiles ticking 'round the world
Hear those crocodiles ticking, they go ticking 'round the world

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and
You could hear them climbing the stairs
I got my right side fighting while
My left hides under the chairs

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Got one eye on the road and one on you
