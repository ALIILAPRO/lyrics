		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Even when you feel low, you can still go
Even when you feel slow, you can still go
Even when there's no hope, you can still go
I never answer to no man, I still go

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go (yeah)

Hustle hard, hustle every single day
I'll be making moves 'til I'm buried in my grave, ah
Screw the system, I don't wanna be a slave
I be doing shit my way, uh, or the highway

And in the driveway is a nice Range
'Cause I grind through the climb, I invite pain
You'll never hear me, bitch, nah, I don't complain
Just gotta flip a switch and you can go and obtain
Anything you want, anything you need
Your mind's got the key ingredient, it's belief, uh
They'll deceive with their negativity
but I just slide right by that energy, uh

Even when you feel low, you can still go
Even when you feel slow, you can still go
Even when there's no hope, you can still go
I never answer to no man, I still go

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

You got a mind, but even that can change
You can flip the gray matter like some batter in your brain, uh
That's why they say, fake it 'til you make it, ay
And if you play that game then you just might make a change
Rearrange all the bad to okay
Take the worst thoughts and turn 'em to a game
Take the best thoughts and put 'em on display
On repeat in your brain 'til you're feeling no more pain, uh

Never slow yourself down, you can do some more
Push past all the pain and you'll find a door
Open it up and finally explore
Everything that you thought, you could never do before, uh
Even when you feel low, you can still go
Even when you feel slow, you can still go
Even when there's no hope, you can still go
I never answer to no man, I still go

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Even when you feel low, you can still go (go, go, go, go)
Even when you feel slow, you can still go (go, go, go, go)
Even when there's no hope, you can still go (go, go, go, go)
I never answer to no man, I still go (go, go, go, go, go)
