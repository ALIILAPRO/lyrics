		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  download my conscious it can't sit up ill in my brain
i see them watching they plotting up ill on my name
this shit be nonsense got no cents dollars or the k
i get my profits abolished sleeping the rain

They keep me callous fuck out my palace out my lane
switching my list up till they got mist up in they veins
said picture my system delete my shit like every day
I will not miss em i can't relate we ain't the same

my lungs can't breathe round you
got no trust on higher views
keep that dirt up in my sleeves
tangled sheets and lsd
broke my screen it staying blue
static stabbing in my view
making bread to break your being
i stay fed on guillotines

paint it black while i od
strapped full of chemicals
passed the cemetery
now i'm back ephemeral
addict with leaves
in the trees where i stay
we just casualties
left my keys in the gate said

pessimist distance me from everything
(yea aye no way)
masochist slits his wrist and its heavenly
(no light on snow days)
