		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please don't go, let's talk about it
No need for wildin'
Just another fight, what's goin' on?
Know I did you wrong, I can't deny
Don't tell no lies
Look into my eyes, you can read the signs
Our souls align
Say give it time, don't wanna hold you up
Down on my luck
I'm sittin stuck, please find me
I'm waiting, no hiding
Gotta get you, babe
No bullshit, I'm trying (trying, trying)

Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything
Word to me
Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything
Word to me

Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything
Word to me
Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything (ooh)
Word to me, mh (ooh)

Every night, in the memories
Can't escape you if I tried
You stay with me
Ain't no use, I'm mesmerized
Your so comforting
Come with me don't question why
My lovely, mh-mh
Since I met you, no, I never wanna let you go
Can't forget you
Days I'd sweat you, so you'd know
I'm lost in your awe
Ain't forgettin' this dream
Can you help me out?
Don't you see?

Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything
Word to me
Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything
Word to me

Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything
Word to me
Can't shake her, shake her
I'ma dream you later
And I love it, you are truly everything (ooh)
Word to me, mh (ooh)

(Shake her) can't shake her now, can't shake her now
(Can't get away) can't get away, no, no, no
(Can't shake) can't shake her, no way, shake her, no way
(Get away) can't get away
