		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Can you hear me say your name forever?
Can you see me longing for you forever?
Would you let me touch your soul forever?
Can you feel me longing for you forever, forever?

I know the light grows darker down below
But in your eyes it's gone before you know
This is the moment of just letting go

She said, if you had life eternal

Can you hear me say your name forever?
Can you see me longing for you forever?
Would you let me touch your soul forever?
Can you feel me longing for you forever, forever?

We dance once more
I feel your hands are cold
Within your heart, a story to be told
This is the moment of just letting go
This is the moment of just letting go

(This is the moment of just letting go)
(This is the moment of just letting go)

Can you hear me say your name forever?
Can you see me longing for you forever, forever?
Would you let me touch your soul forever?
Can you feel me longing for you forever and ever?

Forever, forever, forever (forever, forever, forever)
Forever, forever, forever (forever, forever, forever)
Forever, forever, forever (forever, forever, forever)
Forever, forever, forever (forever, forever, forever)

Forever, forever, forever (forever, forever, forever)
Forever, forever, forever (forever, forever, forever)
If you had life eternal?
