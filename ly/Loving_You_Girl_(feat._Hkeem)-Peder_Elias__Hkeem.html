		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Loving you girl is such a lonely feeling
Whatever I say or do
I'll always be lost in you
When you told me forevermore
I must have been dreaming
This picture of you and me
Oh, wasn't it meant to be?

Jump into a cab on 59th street
I say to the driver, "Make a right"
I stare into the rain outside the window
'Cause I don't know
But I wish I knew
Baby, where you are tonight
(I miss you)

Loving you girl is such a lonely feeling
Whatever I say or do
I'll always be lost in you
When you told me forevermore
I must have been dreaming
This picture of you and me
Oh, wasn't it meant to be?

We used to play house way out in Brooklyn
In the middle of July we had a fight
Now I'm looking at this little dent on my pillow
And I don't know
But I wish I knew
Baby, where you are tonight

Loving you girl is such a lonely feeling
Whatever I say or do
I'll always be lost in you
When you told me forevermore
I must have been dreaming
This picture of you and me
Oh, wasn't it meant to be? (Yeah, ay, ay)

Girl, let me know, I'll go anywhere
We can fly, fly, fly, we go anywhere, oh
You and me we're unstoppable
Ain't no one like you, you're unswappable, oh
Do you recall, we were happy?
From the start, girl you had me
Like a bumblebee burning slowly
'Cause loving you girl got me lonely, oh

Loving you girl is such a lonely feeling (is such a lonely feeling)
Whatever I say or do
I'll always be lost in you (I be missing you, yeah, ay)
When you told me forevermore
I must have been dreaming (must have been dreaming)
This picture of you and me (yeah, ay)
Oh, wasn't it meant to be? (Ohh, meant to be)

Loving you girl is such a lonely feeling
Whatever I say or do
I'll always be lost in you
When you told me forevermore
I must have been dreaming
This picture of you and me
Oh, wasn't it meant to be?
