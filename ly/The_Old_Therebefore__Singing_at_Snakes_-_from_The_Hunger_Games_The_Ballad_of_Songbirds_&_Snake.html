		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You're headed for heaven
The sweet old hereafter
And I've got one foot in the door
But before I can fly up
I've loose ends to tie up
Right here in the old therebefore

I'll be along
When I've finished my song (Dr. Gaul, she won)
When I've shut down the band (it's over, let her out)
When I've played out my hand
When I've paid all my debts (why aren't they attacking her?)
When I have no regrets, right here (must be the singing)
In the old therebefore (it's calming them) (she can't sing forever)

I'll catch you up
When I've emptied my cup
When I've worn out my friends
When I've burned out both ends
When I've cried all my tears
When I've conquered my fears
Right here 
In the old therebefore
When nothing is left anymore

I'll bring the news
When I've danced off my shoes
When my body's closed down
When my boat's run aground
When I've tallied the score
And I'm flat on the floor
Right here 
In the old therebefore
When nothing is left anymore

When I'm pure like a dove
When I've learned how to love
Right here 
In the old therebefore
When nothing is left anymore
