		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sometimes it's soft as a misty rain
That gently touches my soul
It cools the fire that burns in me
And I simply lose control
So just

Rain down (on) on me
Let your love just fall like rain drops
Rain on me
So just rain down (on) on me
Let your love just shower me
Just rain on me

Full as a dam at cumpacity
My passion's about to explode
I can't explain, it's surrounding me
I'm caught in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from

Rain down (on) on me (down on me)
Let your love just fall like rain drops (down)
Just rain on me (oh)
So just rain down (on) on me (uh, uh)
Let your love just shower me (uh, uh, uh uh)
Just rain on me (rain down, on, oh)

Fall down, fall down on me
Let it fall down, fall on me
Fall down, fall down on me
Let it fall down, fall on me
So just rain down (on) on me
Chill me with your loving touch
Rain (rain) on me
I wanna feel your love is real
So just rain down (on) on me
Me
Rain (rain) on me
Oh

Rain down (on) on me
Let your love just fall like rain drops
Rain (rain) on me (every little drip, drop)
So just rain down (on) on me (on me)
Let your love just shower me
Just rain (rain) on (on) me
