		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I made a promise
To distance myself
Took a flight, through aurora skies
Honestly, I didn't think about
How we didn't say goodbye
Just see you very soon

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm

So I didn't call you
For sixteen long days
And I should get a cigarette
For so much restraint
No matter how long I resist temptation
I will always lose

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

I've done the math
There's no solution
We'll never last
Why can't I let go of this?

So I broke my promise
I called you last night
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
If it weren't for the sight of a boy
Who looked just like you
Standing out on Melrose Avenue

It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you, mmm
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you
