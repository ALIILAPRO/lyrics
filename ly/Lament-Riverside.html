		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  ""Where have you wandered my only child Why are you not coming back? Your mother is crying her eyes out And I in my dreams hear your voice  \""Father will you take me away Father will you take and save me from my fate Father will you take me away Father will you take and save me from my fate\""  Wanted to go look for you a hundred times But I couldn't leave her alone The end of the world ruined our home Yet didn't destroy our hope  Acid rain is pouring down On the caravans of shadows Once they used to be humans Dying of too much choice  Devoid of trust and empathy They were passing each other Now together with raised hands In tears they call out at the sky  \""Father will you take me away Father will you take and save me from my fate Father will you take me away Father will you take and save me from... my fate\""  \""Father will you take and save me from... my fate\""""
