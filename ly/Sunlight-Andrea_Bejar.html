		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sunlight peeking through my window
Showering light in pools upon my floor
I might let her creep in for a while 
Washing away the layers I've outgrown 

Some days
You're on my mind
Been thinking about the girl I used to know
brave but  and terrified
I've been learning to love the time it takes to grow  

Sunlight seeping through my window 
maybe today she'll show me where to go 
My love sigue el camino
come with me now and make this place a home

Some days
You're on my mind
Been thinking about the girl I used to know
brave but  and terrified
I've been learning to love the time it takes to grow  

And at times I recall when you'd put on a show 
Oh, It was ages ago
I feel her sometimes even though that doors closed 
But its niceTo know she still roams
