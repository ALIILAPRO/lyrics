		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  First comes the blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real
Who can you trust?
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

Statues and empires are all at your hands,
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turnin' stale and its cold,
Oh you'll no longer fear when your heart's turned to gold
Who can you trust
(Who can you trust)

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)

I'm dying to feel again,
Oh anything at all,
But oh I feel nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin' at all

When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)
