		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Please, let me sit down beside you
I've got something to tell you, you should know
I just couldn't wait for not another day
I love you, for more than words can ever say 
Honey living without you is so painful
I was tempted to call it a day
You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand 
I love you baby, for more than words can say
I just can't sleep, when I lay down in my bed
The thoughts of you babe, just linger in my head
Living without you is so painful
I was tempted to call it a day
You've got me in your hand, why can't you understand 
I love you honey, for more than words can say
I love you honey, for more than words can say
Yes, I do
