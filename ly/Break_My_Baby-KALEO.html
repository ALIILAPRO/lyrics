		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sun is down on east side
While we all turn a blind eye
You know I've got your back
But would you ever do that for me?
For me? For me? For me?

Billy boy, he's gifted
You know you can't deny it
Don't leave us empty handed
'Cause you know we don't deserve that from you
From you, from you, from you

I want to break my baby
You know she loves to fake it
I want to break my baby, yeah
Hold her down
Bring her down now
Oh, now

They'll take you in and spit you out
You're only worth how much you sell
You've come too far, we both agree
Just give the people what they need

Will you turn away
Or will you take my place?
Does it start to show
Now that the pressure is on?
Will they call my name
When it all goes up in flames?
Oh, will you be by my side?

I want to break my baby
You know she loves to fake it
I want to break my baby, yeah
Oh, hold her down
Oh, break it down now

Oh, break down
Woah, hold my love
Woah, hold my love
Woah, hold my love
Woah

Break my baby (break my baby)
Break my baby (break my baby)
Break my baby (break my baby)
Break my baby (break my baby)

You know she loves to fake it
Break my baby
