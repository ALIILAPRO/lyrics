		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Felt like regret
Now it feels like relief
Forgive and forget
It's what I believe

Flying high you decided to land
What you abandoned, you understand

That I don’t mind it
Anticipating
What lies ahead so illuminating

Clearing my mind
I gather together
All that you failed to see

I hope you realize, realize
How it’s supposed to be
You realize, realize
How good it could have been

Somebody to love
Somebody to hold you
How it’s supposed to be
You realize, realize
How good it could have been

Maybe you thought I’d be fighting for you
So much to cling to
So much to lose

You should have known
That for all that I am
I’d always stand up tall
In the end

So I don’t mind it
Anticipating
What lies ahead so illuminating

Clearing my mind
I gather together
All that you failed to see

I hope you realize, realize
How it’s supposed to be
You realize, realize
How good it could have been

Somebody to love
Somebody to hold you
How it’s supposed to be
You realize, realize
How good it could have been
