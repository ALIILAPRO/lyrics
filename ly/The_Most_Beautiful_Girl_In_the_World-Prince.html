		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  This is for the ladies
Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
When the day turns into the last day of all time
I can say I hope you are in these arms of mine
And when the night falls before that day I will cry
I will cry tears of joy 'cause after you all one can do is die, oh

Could you be the most beautiful girl in the world?
Could you be?
It's plain to see you're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are

How can I get through days when I can't get through hours?
I can try but when I do I see you and I'm devoured, oh yes
Who'd allow, who'd allow a face to be soft as a flower? Oh
I could bow (bow down) and feel proud in the light of this power
Oh oh

Could you be (singing, come on) the most beautiful girl in the world?
Meant to the girl
It's plain to see (come on) you're the reason that God made a girl
Oh, yes you are

And if the stars ever fell one by one from the sky
I know Mars could not be, uh, to far behind
'Cause baby, this kind of beauty has got no reason to ever be shy
'Cause honey, this kind of beauty is the kind that comes from inside

Could you be (singing) the most beautiful girl in the world?
So beautiful, beautiful
It's plain to see (plain to see) you're the reason that God made a girl

Oh yeah (oh, yes you are)
Girl (could you be?)
You must be, oh yeah
(Could you be?)
You're the reason, oh yeah
(Could)
(Could)
(Could)
(Could)
