		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Mm, mm

Ain't been okay since you went away
And now every day, it feels like it's rainin'
Strangers to lovers, lovers to strangers
Ridin' 'round town with an open container

Tryna get gone 'cause, girl, you're gone
Tryna smoke some of that, moving on
Thought I'd be alright, but I was wrong
And you know that

I ain't never been hurt before
'Til my world crashed down to the sound of a slamming door
I ain't never felt pain for real
'Til the words came out that you don't feel what I feel
I miss you more than a little, but it's not the hardest part
It's you don't even have a broken heart
No, you don't even have a broken heart

Don't understand it, maybe you're bluffin'
I'm feeling stranded, you're feeling nothing
New kind of problems, new kind of demons
Drunk on a Wednesday, girl, you're the reason

Tryna get gone 'cause, girl, you're gone
Tryna smoke some of that, moving on
Thought I'd be alright but I was wrong
And you know that

I ain't never been hurt before
'Til my world crashed down to the sound of a slamming door
I ain't never felt pain for real
'Til the words came out that you don't feel what I feel
I miss you more than a little, but it's not the hardest part
It's you don't even have a broken heart
No, you don't even have a broken heart

Mm, mm
I miss you more than a little, but it's not the hardest part
It's you don't even have a broken heart
No, you don't even have a broken heart
