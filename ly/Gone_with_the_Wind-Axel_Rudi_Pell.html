		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Where are you, where have you been
I´m waiting all day , running to see you
The train arrives, the hope's on the rise
Doors are open, but you are out of sight

I hope and I pray, that someday you will return
Still hear you calling my name remembering better times
The signs on the wall, a relict from the past
Your name on the gravestone, but hope dies last
 
Will I ever realise
You´re never coming back
There is no compromise 

Gone with the wind
Tears are falling
When I think of you and I
Gone with the wind
Heaven´s crying
Why did you die

Can´t stop crying, I feel like dying
Good times to remember, but now I will surrender
I loved you so much but you left me alone
Never felt a stone in my heart, living on my own

I loved you so much
Gone With The Wind
