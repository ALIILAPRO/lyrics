		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You have my heart
We'll never be worlds apart
May be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, 'cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath and I'm stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because

When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath and I'm stick it out 'til the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella

Ella, ella, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, ooh, yeah
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

(It's raining)
(Ooh, baby, it's raining)
(You can always come into me, come into me)
(It's raining)
(Ooh, baby, it's raining)
(You can always come into me, come into me)
It's raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining
You can always come into me, come into me
It's raining
Ooh, baby, it's raining
You can always come into me, come into me
