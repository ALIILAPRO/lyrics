		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I miss you, but I never really knew you at all
Forget you, here's to all the years with no calls
Run through all these thoughts in my mind
Fuck you, I love you at the same time

I love you, but it's fuck you, never really trust you
Another fuckin' birthday, I ain't heard from you
Tighten up my loose ends, clean the drugs from my head
Wake up feeling sick, I sleep with demons in my bed

Blank stares, blank chairs at every single table
Times we never shared that made me unstable
Wishing you were here because I need you now
You promised me that you would come around, yeah

I miss you, but I never really knew you at all
Forget you, here's to all the years with no calls
Run through all these thoughts in my mind
Fuck you, I love you at the same damn time

Whoa, whoa
Fuck you, I love you at the same time
Whoa, whoa
Fuck you, I love you at the same damn time 
(Love you at the same damn time)

I love you, but it's fuck you, never really come through
Pieces of my heart, fallin' apart and coming unglued
Heard you in a better place, only God could judge you
I love you, but it's fuck you (I love you, but it's fuck you)

Blank stares, blank chairs at every single table
Times we never shared that made me unstable
Wishing you were here because I need you now
You promised me that you would come around, yeah, yeah

I miss you, but I never really knew you at all
Forget you, here's to all the years with no calls
Run through all these thoughts in my mind
Fuck you, I love you at the same damn time

Whoa, whoa
Fuck you, I love you at the same time
Whoa, whoa
Fuck you, I love you at the same damn time

Erase the parts of me I wish would die
The memories I made when you were alive
Now the only thing that really gets me through is knowing
That I'll be a better man than you
And if you wanna know the truth, then too late

I miss you, but I never really knew you at all
Forget you, here's to all the years with no calls
Run through all these thoughts in my mind
Fuck you, I love you at the same damn time

Whoa, whoa
Fuck you, I love you at the same damn time
Whoa, whoa
Fuck you, I love you at the same time
