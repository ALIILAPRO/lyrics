		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  So many times
Said it was forever
Said our love would always be true
Something in my heart always knew
I'd be lying here beside you
On my own
On my own
On my own

So many promises never should be spoken
Now I know what loving you cost
Now we're up to talking divorce
And we weren't even married
On my own
Once again now
One more time
By myself

No one said it was easy
But it once was so easy
Well I believed, I believed in love
Now here I stand
I wonder why

I'm on my own
Why did it end this way
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to be
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again

So many times
I know I could have told you
Losing you it cut like a knife, hey
You walked out and there went my life
I don't want to live without you
On my own
This wasn't how it was supposed to end
On my own
I wish that we could do it all again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone

By myself
On my own, I've got to find where I belong again
On my own
I've got to learn how to be strong again
On my own
I never dreamed I'd spend one night alone
By myself by myself, by myself
I've got to find out what was mine again
On my own
My heart is saying that it's my time again
On my own
And I have faith that I will shine again
On my own
I (on my own) have faith (on my own) in me
