		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Galaxy, galaxy
Won't you be my consolation
I need someone to kiss my hands and my feet
And make me feel complete, oh, yeah
Mysterious universe
I know you're unrehearsed
But I see the light in your hands
You're the man with the plan, oh, yeah

But it feels just like I'm falling all the time
(Falling all the time)

High as a pretty star
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't put me out
Show me what it's all about
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't you break it, no
Don't you break it, no
Don't you break it, faded heart

Fantasy, fantasy
You got me howling like a dog in the heat
I'm trying not to put up a fight
But I can't lose another night, oh, no
So call me your Romeo
I'll show you the way my Thunderbird sings
You in the suede backseat is all I'll ever need

But it feels like I'm running out of time
(Running out of time)

High as a pretty star
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't put me out
Show me what it's all about
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't you break it, no
Don't you break it, no
Don't you break it, faded heart

I'm searching for a sign
Been looking way too high
Heart in the trenches, head in the heavens

High as a pretty star
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't put me out
Show me what it's all about
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't you break it, no
Don't you break it, no
Don't you break it, faded 

High as a pretty star
Don't you break my faded heart
Don't put me out
Show me what it's all about
Don't you break my faded heart
