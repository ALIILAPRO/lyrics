		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Money makes the world go 'round
See the boys all over town
Honey makes the world taste good
Can't see the trees for the wood

Not much rain in California
Yeah, we need water
This great escape got here too late
These bonds you can break
I come from disorder
I come from disorder

May your love be pure
I try to breathe you in
I live for
May your love be pure
When you come
May your love be pure
When you come

Russian Roulette in overdrive
Casinos of the mind
Everyone wants but nobody knows
Where do we go when the ship's called home?

We're on the run to nowhere
Into the void, into thin air
We're not lost, we're found
This merry-go-round
I will not go down
I come from disorder
I come from disorder

May your love be pure
I try to breathe you in
I live for
May your love be pure
When you come
May your love be pure
When you come

And I fly through the clouds
'Cause I wanna get into your sky
Oh, colors collide into spray paint
Of you and I, I fly

May your love be pure
I try to breathe you in
I live for
May your love be pure
When you come
May your love be pure
When you come

When you come
When you come
