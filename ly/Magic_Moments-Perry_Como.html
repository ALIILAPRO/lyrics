		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Magic moments, memories we've been sharing

I'll never forget the moment we kissed
The night of the hay ride
The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
While takin' a sleigh ride

Magic moments, memories we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The telephone call that tied up the line
For hours and hours
The Saturday dance I got up the nerve
To send you some flowers

Magic moments, memories we've been sharin'
Magic moments, when two hearts are carin'
Time can't erase the memory of
These magic moments filled with love

The way that we cheered whenever our team
Was scoring a touchdown
The time that the floor fell out of my car
When I put the clutch down
The penny arcade, the games that we played
The fun and the prizes
The Halloween hop when everyone came
In funny disguises

Magic moments filled with love
