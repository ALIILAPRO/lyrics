		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I must confess
How hard I tried to breathe
Through the trees of loneliness
You, you must confess
How hard you need to see
Through the heart beating out my chest

Feel like we've been falling down 
Like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let winter come
Don't let our hearts freeze

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold

Dark as midnight sun
Smoke as black as charcoal
Fills into our fragile lungs
'Cause when our demons come
Dancing in the shadows
To a game that can't be won

Feel like we've been falling down 
Like these autumn leaves
But baby don't let winter come 
Don't let our hearts freeze

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold

We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats and they can throw their stones
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

We're the underdogs, in this world alone
I'm a believer, got a fever running through my bones
We're the alley cats and they can throw their souls
They can break our hearts, they won't take our souls

If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
If the morning light don't steal our soul
We will walk away from empty gold
We will walk away from empty gold
