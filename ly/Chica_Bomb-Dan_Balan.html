		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I have to turn the fan on
The heat is getting stronger
I know I'm not the only one
I'm sweatin' I'm sweatin'

I start to take my clothes off
And hope that I feel better
I put in a thermometer
I'm burnin' I'm burnin'

And then I looked around,
My head was spinnin' round,
Before I looked around, it hit me
Before I looked around, it hit me

Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
And then I
My head was
Before I looked
It hit me
It hit me

I better call my doctor
Tell him about my fever
I know he'll fix my temperature
I'm burnin' I'm burnin'

And then I looked around,
My head was spinnin' round,
Before I looked around, it hit me
And then I looked around,
My head was spinnin' round,
Before I looked around, it hit me

Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
And then I (Chica bomb)
My head was (Chica Bomb)
Before I looked (Chica Bomb)
It hit me
It hit me

Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
Chica Bomb
And then I (Chica bomb)
My head was (Chica Bomb)
Before I looked (Chica Bomb)
It hit me
It hit me
