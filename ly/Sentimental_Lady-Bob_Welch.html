		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You are here and warm
But I could look away and you'd be gone
Cause we live in a time
When meaning falls in splinters from our lives
And that's why I've traveled far
'Cause I come so together where you are

And all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very

Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

(All I need is you)

Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

Sentimental lady

Yeah all of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very

Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

(All I need is you)

Sentimental gentle wind
Blowing through my life again
Sentimental lady, gentle one

(All I need is you)

All of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very (all I need is you)

All of the things that I said that I wanted
Come rushing by in my head when I'm with you
Fourteen joys and a will to be merry
And all of the things that we say are very
