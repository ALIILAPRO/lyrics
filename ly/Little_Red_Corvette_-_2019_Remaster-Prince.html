		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I guess I should've known
By the way you parked your car sideways
That it wouldn't last
See you're the kinda person
That believes in makin' out once
Love 'em and leave 'em fast

I guess I must be dumb
'Cause you had a pocket full of horses
Trojan and some of them used
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "what have I got to lose?"
And honey, I say

Little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast, oh
Little red Corvette
You need a love that's gonna last

Guess I should've closed my eyes
When you drove me to the place
Where your horses run free
'Cause I felt a little ill
When I saw all the pictures
Of the jockeys that were there before me

Believe it or not
I started to worry
I wondered if I had enough class
But it was Saturday night
I guess that makes it all right
And you say, "baby, have you got enough gas?"
Oh, yeah

Little red Corvette
Baby you're much too fast, yes, you are
Little red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last, ah, ah

Ooh, ooh

A body like yours oughta be in jail
'Cause it's on the verge of bein' obscene
Move over, baby
Gimme the keys
I'm gonna try to tame your little red love machine

Little red Corvette
Baby, you're much too fast
Little red Corvette
You need to find a love that's gonna last

Little red Corvette
Honey, you got to slow down (got to slow down)
Little red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna run your
Little red Corvette right in the ground

Little red Corvette
Right down to the ground (honey, you got to slow down)
You, you, you got to slow down (little red Corvette)
You're movin' much too fast (too fast)
You need to find a love that's gonna last

Girl, you got an ass like I never seen, ooh
And the ride
I say, the ride is so smooth
You must be a limousine, ooh

Baby, you're much too fast
(Little red Corvette)
You need a love, you need a love that's, ah, that's gonna last
(Little red Corvette)
Babe, you got to slow down (you got to slow down)
Little red Corvette
'Cause if you don't, 'cause if you don't
You gonna run your body right into the ground (right into the ground)
Right into the ground (right into the ground)
Right into the ground (right into the ground)

Little red Corvette (oh)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
