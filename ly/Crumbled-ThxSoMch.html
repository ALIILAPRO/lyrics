		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  God damn, oh, if only
When we lock eyes, is that your way to taunt me?
And said "I do what I want"
That's fine, just lay it on me
Cut me now, cuss me out
Burn me down

Last night, you looked so content
That's why

I crumbled again
Last night, last night, last night, last night
Yeah, you looked so good with him
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Motherfucker I crumbled again
Last night, last night, last night, last night
Yeah, you looked so good with him
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Motherfucker I crumbled again

I crumbled again
I crumbled again

I can't resist, wipe the dirt off of my lip
Girl cut me open will you, baby, I don't care
And if there's blood on the ceiling, oh well
It wasn't for anybody out there

Your hair, my hair
Your hand, my hand
Oh well, oh well, oh well, oh well

Last night, last night, last night, last night
Yeah, you looked so good with him
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Motherfucker I crumbled again
Last night, last night, last night, last night
Yeah, you looked so good with him
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Motherfucker I crumbled again

Last night, you looked so content
That's why
One, two, three, four

Last night, last night, last night, last night
Yeah, you looked so good with him
Inside, inside, inside, inside
Motherfucker I crumbled again
Last night, last night, last night, last night
Yeah, you looked so good with him
That's why, that's why, that's why
Motherfucker I crumbled again
