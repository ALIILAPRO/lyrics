		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

She a loyal bitch, you gotta pay for those
She a spoiled lil bitch, I bought her all her clothes
You know I treat you good, I don't wanna meet your hoes
I took you out the hood, I took you to my shows
We took a lot of pics and now we look like goals
We tried some new things, we fucked a couple hoes
You changin' mood swings, you've got me on those
We gettin' back in, walked through the back door
You had some surgeries, but it's a fact though
You like the cash, girl, you helped the cash grow
You drivin' Lambos, with some leg room
Girl, I'm waiting on you, bring that bag home (ooh)

Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

She don't play with bitches, she don't play with hoes
Yeah, she wit the shit, she might kill a hoe
FS by young Carti, yeah my bitch on go
When she on that molly, anything goes
She was in Miami, on a fuckin' boat
With some ball players she left them niggas broke
She said "text my phone", tell me I'm alone
I respond back, "When you comin' home?"
She respond back, "I was in my zone"
The money kind of on, the money kind of on
Hold up, what you talkin' bout, come here
Girl, I'm waitin' on you
Bring that bag home

Ooh, yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home
