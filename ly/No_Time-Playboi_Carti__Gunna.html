		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  (Yeah)
Wake up in the mornin', know I gotta do this shit
Ay, let's do it
(Cannon)
Yeah, hey, heyo, hey, hey yeah

We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind?
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame
We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind?
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame

Four, five, six, seven bitches keep callin' my line
Ya cap like Mitchell and Ness lil' nigga stop lyin'
Check, they was talkin' 'bout lil' ma live my life
Chop that chicken and shrimp cut in my rice
Spanish bitch come and pipe me I can make my wife (my wife)
She want new Versace, put Medusa on her eyes
Me and Cash Carti got them sisters
'Bouta put 'em on a flight (put 'em on a flight)
Diamonds in my Cartier lens
You can see 'em at night (see 'em at night)
Call Balmain, ask 'em why my jeans so tight
Trippin' off lanes, I don't think you really wanna ride
Guns don't want mine on you, you not my kind
I say something ain't worth it, ain't wastin' my time

We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame
We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame

My bitch fine
You in line
My big bank
These niggas been mine
But my diamonds keep bitin'
These hoes be bitin'
These niggas be bitin'
Wish on a bone yeah (fillet)
Got a bitch on the line right now
Say she got Molly, yeah
Syrup, I don't do syrup
A-w-g-e you know me
Cold outside I need another sleeve
Yeah, ballin' on yo hoe like Kobe
Dunkin' on yo' hoe like no D
Bald head like Gin√≥bili
Piru, watch my nose bleed
That boy dead
Arm and a leg
AK
Turnin' your head, take yo bag

We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame
We ain't got time
I draw my demons out
Where my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch
Seein' diamonds
All these niggas they cappin' right here
They stay lame
