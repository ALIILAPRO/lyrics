		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Shouted to the wall
Shouted to the sea
But all I get is
boredom out of it
All I wanted was a shock
Just wanted to be free
I just got
on the train of freedom
Running away
I just kept on running on
I just kept on laughing on
I thought that is
what freedom is all about
But then when I looked around
and there were just peoples
With eyes like dead fish just
floating in the sea
Licking each others wounds
All I had in my hand was sand
All I had in my hand was shade
But the train of freedom
kept on rolling all the way
What is freedom?
What the hell is
life means to me anyway?
I was so a shame
I couldn't cry to save my day
Ahh... The sunset shined
in my eyes painfully
The birds flying in the sky
The bugs in the woods
The burning sunset
Looked all free
Is it only me?
I shouted 'til I lose my voice
Actually
I Knew there's no freedom
from the beginning
(There's no freedom)
But it broke my heart so bad
But the train of freedom
kept on rolling all the way
What is freedom?
What the hell is
life means to me anyway?
I was so a shame I couldn't cry
to save my day in anyway
Ahh... The sunset shined
in my eyes painfully
But the train never stops
