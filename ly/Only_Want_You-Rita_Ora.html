		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I don't wanna another night
Trying find another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress, a potential problem
I don't wanna spend the night at someone's place
And fill the space that you used to walk in
I don't wanna know the number in my phone
To wanna hold at three in the morning

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you yeah
Don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just in need, just in need, just
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you yeah

I know I'm the one who ruined everything
And made you think that it was all your fault
And I know the story's only just a word
But, when it hurts, it isn't that simple
But, I know that if you look me in the eyes
You can't deny there is something different
And I know I'm drawn looking for your kiss
Someone's lips to know that I miss ya

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you yeah
Don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just in need, just in need, just
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you yeah

I don't wanna another night
Of trying find another you, another rock bottom
I don't wanna wear another mini dress
To impress, a potential problem

I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you yeah
I don't want somebody brand new
I only want you, I only want you yeah
Guess I had to leave, had to leave, had to leave ya
Just in need, just in need, just
I don't want somebody like you
I only want you, I only want you yeah
