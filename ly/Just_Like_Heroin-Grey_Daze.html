		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Just like heroin

It can't be me
Bring us to our passage
Show me my new skin
So I can see what I've let in

Standing here with my thoughts
Low and sound, hard to understand
No one could ever
Bring everyone to see

Just like heroin
Just excuses
Just like heroin
Just excuses

Standing here with my thoughts
Low and sound, hard to understand
No one could ever
Bring everyone to see

Just like heroin
Just excuses
Just like heroin
Just excuses

Just like heroin
Just like heroin

It's my time to fade
Dying on the floor
See myself as I am
Excuses are

Just like heroin
Just excuses
Just like heroin
Just excuses
