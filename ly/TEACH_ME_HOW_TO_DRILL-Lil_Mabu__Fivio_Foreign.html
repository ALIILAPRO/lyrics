		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, nigga
We gon' pop out, we gon' go to the hood
You see a nigga, you shoot a nigga
Watch out for the cameras, watch out for the police, nigga
And don't tell nobody what you do when you do it
Finish what you're doing, nigga
Grrt, baow
It's a movie, viral, baow, yeah

Pull up, let me show you 'round this place
See 'em little niggas on that gate? (Right there)
Yeah, should I punch him in his face?
Chill, lil' bro, you gotta wait
Then he better look the other way, huh, 'fore I put him on a chase
Damn, this lil' white boy laced
He 'bout to make us catch another case
You don't wanna be in no jailhouse
You don't wanna be with no jakes
Watch what I do, listen what I say
Copy my moves, follow my pace
Gotta take notes what's around you, so you never make mistakes
My fault, Fivi', I'm new to this place
Yeah, huh, yeah

Baby, welcome to the hood
If you with us, you good
Yeah, Stichy, huh, woo'd up
Backpack full of rulers
Yeah, I got a white shooter, huh
And no, I ain't shootin' no schools up
Yeah, I feel like the drill tutor
Wait, can I do a hit on a scooter? (Baow, grrah)

Teach me how to drill
Let me flock, grab the wheel
I see the opps, nigga, chill (baow)
Don't let 'em know we on his heels (baow)
Fuck (huh), did I fuck it up?
Nah, you good Mabu, just keep it hush (shh)
Let me pop this Perc' so I can focus up
Bring a demon outside with me at night (baow)
They gon' know who did it when the face white
Yo, Fivi', pass me the trigger
White boy, but you my nigga (my nigga)
Yo, Mabu, lift 'em
If you play with his pops, you a victim
I walk in any hood, I'm good, huh
'Cause I'm with the dogs that'll stick 'em

Baby, welcome to the hood
If you with us, you good
Yeah, sitchy, huh, woo'd up
Backpack full of rulers
Yeah, I got a white shooter, huh
And no, I ain't shootin' no schools up
Yeah, I feel like the drill tutor (I do)
Wait, can I do a hit on a scooter? (Grrah)

He looked like a singer, but white boy get up on 'em
He can't say the word, I'ma say it for him
You not the biggest, I'm bigger
You just a broke lil' nigga
And I'm young and I'm richer, huh
Five bands on a fit, hah
Five bands on a fit, but your pillow looking like a tea bag, nigga? (Huh)
See that nigga by the gate? (Yeah)
That's my rich homie, Drake
Oh shit, almost shot him by mistake (what?)
Ayo, bro, you need a break
It gets spooky when it's late (huh)
Just keep a Glock, fuck the mace
Haha, yo, Fivi', you really my, chill, that's a word you can't say
Oh, shit

Baby, welcome to the hood (hood)
If you with us, you good (you good)
Yeah, sitchy (sitchy), huh, woo'd up (woo'd up)
Backpack full of rulers
Yeah, I got a white shooter, huh (I do)
And no, I ain't shootin' no schools up (he not)
Yeah, I feel like the drill tutor (I do)
Wait, can I do a hit on a scooter? (Grrt, baow)

Uh-uh, slide through (slide through, uh)
Don't let the opps find you (stop, uh)
Keep your eyes behind you (skrrt)
Get a chop 'bout you (skrrt)
Just know, they try me if they try you (baow)
And the whole gang will stand beside you (no cap)
Right or wrong, it's a lifestyle, lifestyle

Baby, welcome to the hood (hood)
If you with us, you good (you good)
Yeah, sitchy, huh, woo'd up
Backpack full of rulers (baow)
Yeah, I got a white shooter, huh
And no, I ain't shootin' no schools up (he not)
Yeah, I feel like the drill tutor (I do)
Wait, can I do a hit on a scooter? (Baow, baow)

Huh, you know what's going on, nigga
After that drill, you come home, you eat that meal
Throw that gun away, take the gloves off
And don't bring 'em back to home, nigga
And don't tell nobody you went on a drill, nigga
And don't tell nobody who taught you how to go on a drill, nigga
Grraow
Organized Crime (YGA, YGA)
You did that, huh?
Felt like I brought my Italian roots back (yeah)
Mob shit
Grrt-baow
Shoutout my YGA niggas, it's Fivio Foreign
800 Foreign Side to YGA, nigga
Fivio Foreign, Mabu, nigga
(YGA, YGA)
Hahaha (YGA, YGA)
