		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  For a second there I thought you disappeared
It rains a lot this time of year
And we both go together if one falls down
I talk out loud like you're still around, no no

And I miss you
I'm goin' back home to the west coast
I wish you woulda put yourself in my suitcase

I love you
Standin' all alone in a black coat

I miss you
I'm goin' back home to the west coast

And if you shake her heart enough she will appear
Tonight I think I'll be stayin' here
And you never did like this town
I talk out loud like you're still around, no no

And I miss you
I'm goin' back home to the west coast
I wish you woulda put yourself in my suitcase

I love you
Standin' all alone in a black coat

I miss you
I'm goin' back home to the west coast

(Come on everybody)

Lalalala, lalalala
Lalalala, lalalala

So pack up the bags to beat back the clock
Do I let her sleep or should I wake her up
You said, we both go together if one falls down
Yeah right, heh
I talk out loud like you're still around, no no

And I miss you
I m goin' back home to the west coast
I wish you woulda put yourself in my suitcase

I love you
Standin' all alone in a black coat

I miss you
I'm goin' back home to the west coast

(Lalalala, lalalala)
I'm goin' back home to the west coast

(Lalalala, lalalala)
I'm goin' back home to the west coast

Lalalala
Lalalala
