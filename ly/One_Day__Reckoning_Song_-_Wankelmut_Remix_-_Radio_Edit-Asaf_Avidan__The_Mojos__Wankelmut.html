		  One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told 

(One day)
(One day)

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
Oh baby, we'll be old (old, old, old, old)

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
Oh, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby we'll be one

(One day)

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
And think of all the stories that we could have told

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
Oh, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby we'll be

One, day baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old 
Think of all the stories that we could have told

One day, baby, we'll be old
Oh, baby, we'll be old
And think of all the stories that we could have told
