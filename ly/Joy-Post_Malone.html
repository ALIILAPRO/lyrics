		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Joy is the coldest lover I know
Only because she never comes
I was the coolest dude I know
Guess I was born too close to the sun

The harder I try, the more I become miserable
The higher I fly, the lower I go, oh no
Is what we want who we are? Ah-ooh
Pray for me, I don't wanna be, ah, miserable

Joy is the coldest lover I know
Some reason I keep comin' back for more
I crashed my car, the paint job was off
La, la, la-la-la
Will I even know if it's too much? Mm

The harder I try, the more I become miserable
The higher I fly, the lower I go, oh no
Is what we want who we are? Ah-ooh
Pray for me, I don't wanna be, ah, miserable

The harder I try, the more I become miserable
The higher I fly, the lower I go, oh no
Is what we want who we are? Ah-ooh
Pray for me, I don't wanna be, ah, miserable

Miserable, miserable
Miserable, miserable
Miserable, miserable
Miserable, miserable
