		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary 'til the death of me
Yeah, I'm trynna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressin' me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressin' me
I'm trynna stay focused, I guess that's the Lord testin' me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waitin' 'til the time's right
Smilin' at my mom's like
Smilin' at my mom
Smilin' at my mama
MoÃ«t what we sippin' now, we was never trippin' now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we trippin' now
'Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facin' my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers

I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

They said I couldn't do it
Back when I was broke goin' through it
'Til I got a deal, now they talkin' 'bout, "I knew it"
But you wasn't there in the beginnin'
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winnin'
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimmin'
I do it 'cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-
And the whips with the rims still spinnin'
I been at it since the beginnin'
All these girls screamin', "Logic!"
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man
Y'all act like I'm Superman but I can feel pain
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shinin' what's bling to us?
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm ballin' like a sphere

I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me)
Shut the fuck up, ho, let me get my mind right
'Cause this is for the fans
Who truly understand
Real all the time, all of y'all my fam
Shootin' for the stars and I ain't finna land
Givin' everything I can
While they tell me I'm the man
Makin' music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
'Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off, infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothin' to fear
'Cause the whole team here
And everybody shoutin' (what they shoutin'?)

You the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
