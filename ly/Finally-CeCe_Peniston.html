		  Dum-dum-mh, day-day-mh, yeah-yeah-mh, ow

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Meeting Mr. Right, the man of my dreams
The one who shows me true love or at least it seems
With brown cocoa skin and curly black hair
It's just the way he looks at me, that gentle loving stare

Finally, you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew, the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

It seems so many times, you seemed to be the one
But all he ever wanted was to have a little fun
But now you've come along and brightened up my world
In my heart I feel it, I'm that special kinda girl

Finally, you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew, the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it
Finally, oh finally yeah yeah
Oh oh, dum-dum-mh, day-day-mh, yeah-yeah-mh, ow

Dum-dum-mh, day-day-mh, yeah-yeah-mh, ow
Dum-dum-mh, day-day-mh, yeah-yeah-mh, ow
Dum-dum-mh, day-day-mh, yeah-yeah-mh, ow
Dum-dum-mh, day-day-mh, yeah-yeah-mh, ow, dum-dum

Finally, you've come along
The way I feel about you, it just can't be wrong
If you only knew, the way I feel about you
I just can't describe it, oh no no

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
And I just cannot hide it

Finally, it has happened to me, right in front of my face
My feelings can't describe it
Finally, it has happened to me
