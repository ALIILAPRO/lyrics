		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I used to be such a burning example
I used to be so original
I used to care, I was being cared for
Made sure I showed it to those that I love
I used to sleep without a single stir
'Cause I was about my father's work

Well, take me out tonight
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

I used to pray like God was listening
I used to make my parents proud
I was the glue that kept my friends together
Now they don't talk and we don't go out
I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed
Now I've made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it

Well, take me out tonight
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

Well, throw me that lifeline
This ship of fools I'm on will sink
I'm my own stone around my neck
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give

Never hit their brakes
There was no time to see
He just ran out in the street
Anybody know his name?
I think I recognize him
He sure as hell paid for that mistake

Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Whoa

(I used to be such a burning example) well, take me out tonight
(I used to be so original) this ship of fools I'm on will sink
(I used to care, I was being cared for) I'm my own stone around my neck 
(Made sure I showed it to) be my breath
(Those that I love) there's nothing I wouldn't give 

(I used to pray like God was listening) well, save my life tonight 
(I used to make my parents proud) this ship of fools I'm on will sink 
(I was the glue that kept my friends together) I'm my own stone around my neck 
(Now they don't talk) be my breath 
(And we don't go out) there's nothing I wouldn't give
