		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You find yourself in the benefit of the doubt
The prospect of a change both
A blessing and a curse

These are the consequences that you
Might have to bear
To make it all come true it's
Just one step to take

On days like this, you feel your desires
I know that you care and you see
What this world is about to unfold

Fear not this is not the end of this world
Step close to the edge to believe the absurd
The wind in your hair is the freedom we share
A tear in your eye proves
At least that you try

This man has lived in grim diversity
Uncertain and in doubt
If his choices were ideal

A lifetime feeling torn the king
Of nowhere never home
And now about to find a new philosophy

The silence we breathe has the
Soul of a thief
