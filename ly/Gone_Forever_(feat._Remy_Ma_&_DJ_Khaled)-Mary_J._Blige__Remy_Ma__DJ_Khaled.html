		<h2>Lyrics</h2>

		  Ohh, oh
Another one
Oh, oh
Mary J. Blige

Played yourself again, oh, damn
Move to the left again, oh, damn
Wishing that you had this
I know you're wishing that you had this, oh
Played yourself again, that's tragic
Gave you my heart, baby boy, you should've kept it
Wishing that you had this (had this)
I know you're wishing that you had this
I done turned up on you, whoa
I done turned up on you one time
Told you it would take only one time
You, you, you, you thought that I was lying
When I told you that I can't be no side bitch, oh
I know you want that thing back
You want that love, you want that kiss, you want that sex
Oh, now you wanna make it last

But when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever (oh)
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever (wrong)
You did me wrong forever
'Cause when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever (forever)
(We the best music)

Had, had a real bitch by your side
Riding like a Glock .45
Now, now you're lonely when you slide 
(we could've been here together)
Tell me what money do, if it don't by honeymoons
I'm sweeter than honeydew
But I caught you sipping strange fruit (strange fruit)
You turned me into a dog, I'm barking, woof
Told you just to keep it hundred proof
You made me promises that you couldn't ever keep (keep going)
Said you was just fucking them and you would get back to me

But, baby, when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever (oh)
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever (wrong)
You did me wrong forever
'Cause when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever (forever)

You did me wrong
When a good girl gone, she gone forever
When a real bitch leave, you gon' wish you never met her
And I'm a real bitch, don't make 'em like me no more
Before I share my bed, I'll sleep on floors
I told you, I'm a wife, I can't be your whore
We different prices, I don't go for what she go for
Please keep your keys, I'm changing all these locks
'Bout to find a new nigga and give him all this box
Tryna bring me down, I'll give him all this top
See, I got some money, boo, I do what I wanna do
And I've been a hundred proof
You turned me to a dog, I'm barking, woof
Now I'm gone, nigga, poof

Baby, when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever (oh)
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever (wrong)
You did me wrong forever
'Cause when a good girl's gone, she's gone forever
She's gone forever
Now you gotta deal with the fact you did me wrong forever
You did me wrong forever (forever)
