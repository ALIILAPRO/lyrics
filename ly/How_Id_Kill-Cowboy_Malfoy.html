		  How i’d kill

to see you again



Love’s a game

I played the fool

I was wasted

on your perfume

Yeah you turned me into a mess

But I must confess

That I’ve never felt so alive



Well that’s a lesson learned

(You showed me love)

No, you taught me how to hurt

Was it worth it? No



Cause now I’m coast to coast alone I roam

searching for solace and comfort

and I don’t know if I can carry on



They called me crazy

and they’re right



I had a multitude of sickly dispositions

you didn’t mind



Instead you taught me how to dance

but not alone

If love is a game

then I only played

to lose



Because empires will rise and fall

like tides and I’ll live through it all



But it won’t mean a thing

without you
