		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I
Ride for you, I

Look alive, life too short, mine is built with the reports
Speakin' 'bout me and you, since they got me off the porch
I been beaten black and blue
Story of my life, tell me something' about you
Where you from? Did you stay or did you run?
You ever thought about a daughter or a son? No
You lookin' for a Jason Lyric or a Love Jones?
I know you prolly sick of love songs, but

I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down them if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love

I still remember when we used to all pretend
Afraid to be in love, afraid to just be friends
I still remember when you used to call me up
Was broken-hearted young, that nigga dogged you, huh?
Baby, don't hold no grudge, you know I'll hold you down
And if they ever try, I got a hundred rounds
Until the day we die, and then we in the sky
Forever loyal in the moment, or immortal

I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down them if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love

She my forever thing, baby, you more than great
I never say a word, it's First 48
Look I remember when we started poppin', yeah
You stole my eye, I stole your heart down at the county fair
Now if worst come to worst, I left a note in your purse
Remember me from this verse, I'm turnin' myself in
I can't pretend, we both goin' down the road
I need you to have my seed, set the legacy in stone

I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down them if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love
