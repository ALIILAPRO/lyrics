		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  If you had a room, he'd paint it white
Avoids the day, prefers the night
Build sight
Got a head for figures
No time for bickerers
Or so he says
prefers the company of a woman
One-two-three four
Finds it more physical
That's an important word
Always seen first then heard
Such a rare bird

With praise he glows, with change he grows
He finds that important
Hates waiting, it's not stimulating
Can't understand why that is so funny
That is sex
