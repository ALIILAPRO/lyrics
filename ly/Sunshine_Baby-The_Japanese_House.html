		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I wanna be a part of it, I want to sing along
The feeling when the windscreen wipers line up with the song
Perform my stupid rituals
Everything is cyclical
Hold on to this feeling 'cause you won't feel it for long
You won't feel it for long

I don't know what's right anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Sitting in the back seat
Driving with my sunshine baby
Well I've gone a little crazy 
Surely someone's gonna save me now

I miss my dog and I miss falling in love
I miss the feeling that you get
When someone fits just like a glove
I can't help but question
Maybe, this just isn't helping
To be putting off the end
'Cause in the end, it always does
In the end it always does

I don't know what's right anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Sitting in the back seat 
Driving with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy 
Surely someone's gonna save me
Now we're right where we were
I don't wanna fight with her
Sitting by the seafront
Lying with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy 
Surely someone's gonna save me now

(Back seat driving with my sunshine baby)
(Well I've gone a little crazy)
(Surely someone's gonna save me)
Sitting in the back seat 
Driving with my sunshine baby
Well, I've gone a little crazy 
Surely someone's gonna save me

I don't know what's right anymore
I don't wanna fight anymore
Sitting in the back seat 
Driving with my sunshine baby
Well I've gone a little crazy 
Surely someone's gonna save me now
