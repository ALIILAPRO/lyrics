		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Green eyes match the hillside
Snow falls when your tears dry, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Summertime ain't a long time
I'ma meet you on the northside, whoa-oh, oh

Trip, I fall over the sun just to touch the stars
Passenger seat of my boyfriend's car
Windshield too cracked, I can't see

Look at where I am, I miss that place
Looking for a home I can't replace
Even though I got a little more cake, I can't change
Promise to my mom I'm still the same
Never change my number, 608
Running from the problems I can't face
Scared of change

Trip, I fall over the sun just to touch the stars
Passenger seat of my boyfriend's car
Windshield too cracked, I can't see (see)

Communication is fading with my patience
A tear falls when I think of home, I'm alone

Trip, I fall over the sun just to touch the stars
Passenger seat of my boyfriend's car
Windshield too cracked, I can't see (see)

Trip, I fall (miss that place, looking for a home I can't replace)
Over the sun just to touch the stars (even though I got a little more cake)
Passenger seat of my boyfriend's car (I can't change)
(Promise to my mom I'm still the same) 
(Never change my number, 608) windshield too cracked, I can't see 
Running from the problems I can't face (see)
