		<p>
		  Well, I wonder what's going on
Same old stuff suppopse
Not quite right that
Stuff's the same, but seems different to me
Seems like the cancer in the city has got to be terminal, I
Haven't got it through
Incidentally where are you?
Thought you lived there
The bright lights have got you
I'd rather be a sprat than a mackerel (mackrel)
You can slip through the net
It's set
It also takes one to catch one
