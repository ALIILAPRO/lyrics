		  Fleek of the week...

Bitch I'm the fleek of the week...
My bitches pull up we deep...
Niggas they watch and they geek...
We come to fuxx Up the streets...
Bust down the bust patek... bitches is mad and weak...
I got the baddest fasique... fleek of the fleek of the week...

My bitches holden the crown... queen
We gonna pull up and shut it down down
Girl you's a nobody in the town girl Nah
Bitches talk on the net but they not around ghost
They cannot come to this section... dub 
I got me some haters for flexing yeah
I got me a trophy finessing... flex
Fleek of the week and they stressing damn
I done got tired of Balmain Gucci
Fuxxing his head up I'm all game ooh
Treat these niggas according they all the ok same
Bitches broke tryna kick it like lukang
I hope  u stay up in yo lane. unh
We hop in foreigns in switch lanes skrrt skirt
Flew to Dubai wit my new flame, yah
He dropped a house on my risk game bag
Fleek a the week bitch I'm bad 
Hop out the Jeep Barbie
I'm in my birk I'm in my bag hoe u sleep. I'm in my birkin
He wanna touch he wanna taste all u can eat meow meow 
I️ put him right on a leech
I️ want his peiece and kapeech

He just want a freak and a dime piece freaky 
Made him drop 30 on my time piece filthy
Bitches is late Bitches is late 
Quarter to 8. Quarter to 8
Give me a break give me a break 
We do not date scurttttt
