		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Sorry it's late, I know I missed your call again
Been tryna change, got stuck in my ways again
I been feeling faded, disconnected lately
Missin' what money can't buy
All I wanna do is be brand new
I swear I'd give it all up just for you

And I would sink my house down underwater, ooh-ooh
I would trade all my gold for dirt
Let me tell you right now
I would walk through fire just to hold ya
Whatever gets me closer to you
Whatever gets me closer to you

Ah, ah-ah-ah
(Closer to you)
Ah, ah-ah-ah

Sick of the game
Never holdin' on to what I start
Hell of a shame
I almost got the life I want
Got no one to take to Paris, France
To understand the man I am
I feel like I'm runnin' out of time
Well, tell me why our stars just don't align

I would sink my house down underwater, ooh-ooh
I would trade all my gold for dirt
Let me tell you right now
I would walk through fire just to hold ya
Whatever gets me closer to you

Whatever gets me closer to your church, your love
I want it all too much, I'm cryin'
I'd give my shirt off my back just to get you back
Baby, baby, now I'd lie in the eye of a hurricane just to have you comin' back
To when you still believed in me
Will you believe me?

I would sink my house down underwater
And I would trade all my gold for dirt
Let me tell you right now
I would walk through fire just to hold ya
Whatever gets me closer to you
Whatever gets me closer to you

Oh, yeah yeah
Closer to you
Oh, a little closer to you
Closer to you
