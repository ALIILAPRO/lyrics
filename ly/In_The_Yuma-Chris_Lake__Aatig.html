		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down

I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
I, I feel so good
Don't bring me down
Bring me down, bring me down, bring me down, bring me down
