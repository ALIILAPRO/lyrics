		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Such a shame to believe in escape
A life on every face
And that's a change
'Til I'm finally left with an eight
Tell me to relax, I just stare
Maybe I don't know if I should change
A feeling that we share
It's a shame

(Such a shame)
Number me with rage, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change
It's a shame

The dice decide my fate
And that's a shame
In these trembling hands
My faith tells me to react, I don't care
Maybe it's unkind that I should change
A feeling that we share
It's a shame

(Such a shame)
Number me with rage, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste (such a shame)
This eagerness to change
Such a shame

Tell me to relax, I just stare
Maybe I don't know if I should change
A feeling that we share
It's a shame

(Such a shame)
Number me with rage, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Number me in haste, it's a shame
(Such a shame)
Write it across my name
(Such a shame)
This eagerness to change

Such a shame
