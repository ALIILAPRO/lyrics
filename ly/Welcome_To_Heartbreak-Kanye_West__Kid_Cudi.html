		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all I could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card (card)
And all I got was a brand new sports car
Uh

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo

Dad cracked a joke all the kids laugh
But I couldn't hear 'em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone
Where did I go wrong?

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo

I seen it, I seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before
I've seen it, I've seen it before
I seen it, I seen it before

My God-sister gettin' married by the lake
But I couldn't figure out who I want to take
Bad enough that I showed up late
I had to leave 'fore they even cut the cake
Welcome to Heartbreak

And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
And my head keeps spinning
I can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo

Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo

And I, and I can't stop
No, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
Can't stop, I can't stop, I can't stop
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, oh-whoa
No, no, I can't stop

No, can't stop having these visions
I gotta get wit' it
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo
Ooh, ooh-hoo
