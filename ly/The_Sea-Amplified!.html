		  Oracle of Truth                                      (Grogean/Grogean)            A min        82 BPM       @2023   
  
VS 1
When you walk thru the darkness
Remind yourself of what you knew
To be true
In the light, Of the world
When you love the unlovely
Better days you will find
Don't be blind
Like so many, In this world

PRE-CHORUS
Oh, Oracle by the Sea
The wise once said to me
The truth will simply set you free
The peace it washes over me
Harness the wind, Blue Therapy

CHORUS
When you're standing on the edge
You'll finally find your soul
When you're pushing passed the red
You'll set yourself free




VS 2
As you search for the answers
Of the deepest mysteries
Possibilities
Clouds will lift, to an open mind
Mindless dangers lie beneath
As the waters pull you deep
Waves so steep
Sil above, Find the peak

PRE-CHORUS
Oh, Oracle by the Sea
The wise once said to me
The truth will simply set you free
The peace it washes over me
Harness the wind, Blue Therapy

CHORUS
When you're standing on the edge
You'll finally find your soul
When you're pushing passed the red
You'll set yourself free
Outro
You've got the power
You've got the strength
You've got to set yourself free
You've got the power
You've got the strength
You've got to set yourself free
