		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Now what if I never kiss your lips again
Or feel the touch of your sweet embrace
How would I ever go on?
Without you, there's no place to belong
Well, someday love is gonna lead you back to me
But till it does, I'll have an empty heart
So I'll just have to believe
Somewhere out there you're thinkin' of me

Till the day I let you go
Till we say our next hello, it's not goodbye
Till I see you again
I'll be right here remembering when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry on down the road
There is one thing I can't deny, it's not goodbye

You think I'd be strong enough to make it through
And rise above when the rain falls down
But it's so hard to be strong
When you've been missing somebody so long
It's just a matter of time I'm sure
But time takes time and I can't hold on
So won't you try as hard as you can
To put my broken heart together again?

Till the day I let you go
Until we say our next hello, it's not goodbye
Till I see you again
I'll be right here remembering when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry on down the road
There is one thing I can't deny, it's not goodbye
It's not goodbye

Till the day I let you go
Until we say our next hello, it's not goodbye
Till I see you again
I'll be right here remembering when
And if time is on our side
There will be no tears to cry on down the road
And I can't deny, it's not goodbye

(Till the day I let you go)
(Till we say our next hello) it's not goodbye
Till I see you
I'll be right here remembering when
And if time is on our side
No more tears to cry on down the road
And I can't deny, it's not goodbye

Goodbye
No more tears to cry
It's not, it's not goodbye, goodbye
