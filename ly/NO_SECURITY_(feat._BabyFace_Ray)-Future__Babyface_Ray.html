		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Yeah, Pluto
ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob

I'm cut off from a different cloth from niggas, that's a Fendi fact, yeah
And I'm strapped up with that mini-MAC, yeah, yeah
Fuckin' up a chinac I'm already millennium
Takin' flicks with junkies and I'm ridin' 'round with Eminem
It's some robbers and killers 'round here, that's where I'm at
They make drug deals, pop pills, that's where I'm at
They got dog food 'round here, that's where I'm at
I'm the king of the trenches, no security guards (yeah, yeah, yeah)

We get triple in your town, nigga, that's where I'm at
Fuck around and grab a crib, shit, I'm never comin' back (mm-hmm)
It's a ruler on the glizzy, bag me up when I laugh
Man, these internet niggas never fucked with a bag (nah)
Eleven in my pants, I can't even get it out
I ain't had shit, ask me how I'm livin' now (ask me)
I done, done, done it all, did a lot (did it all, nigga)
Watch him run, run just like Ricky, spin the block (shit)
Fuck it, nigga, spin again (ooh)
"Fear Of God" on me, I don't fear a man (Fear Of God)
Lot of niggas fumin', they get up there on that stand (lot of niggas fumin')
I been livin' toxic, fuck one bitch then fuck her friends

I'm cut off from a different cloth from niggas, that's a Fendi fact, yeah
And I'm strapped up with that mini-MAC, yeah, yeah
Fuckin' up a chinac I'm already millennium
Takin' pics with junkies and I'm ridin' 'round with Eminem
It's some robbers and killers 'round here, that's where I'm at
They make drug deals, pop pills, that's where I'm at
They got dog food 'round here, that's where I'm at
I'm the king of the trenches, no security guard

Big barbarian, nigga, just check my body weight
I get first stab at these bitches in or out of state

Ain't no trippin' off no twat that I made very important
They launderin', they prayin' on you, they land on you, extortion
Good thing I was known, finesse before I had anything
Good thing, I never played with sake, I played magazine
Posted on the block when the sunlight was up, yeah
Hundred sacks of hard, and got my gun in the cut
Fendi on my body, garment lookin' like a ninja
Play me like a Urkel, bitch, you know I'm 'bout to suspend her
I hold out my arm, you could tell I'm a winner
'Posed to live in Vietnam, I'm with all the hitters

I'm cut off from a different cloth from niggas, that's a Fendi fact, yeah
And I'm strapped up with that mini-MAC, yeah, yeah
Fuckin' up a chinac I'm already millennium
Takin' flicks with junkies and I'm ridin' 'round with Eminem
It's some robbers and killers 'round here, that's where I'm at
They make drug deals, pop pills, that's where I'm at
They got dog food 'round here, that's where I'm at
I'm the king of the trenches, no security guards

It's some robbers and killers 'round here, that's where I'm at
They make drug deals, pop pills, that's where I'm at
They got dog food 'round here, that's where I'm at
Yeah, that's where I'm at
