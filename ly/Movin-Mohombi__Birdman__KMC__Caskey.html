		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  Ya, this is the RedOne|With KMC, yeah!|Sitting on this tough flow|Flyer then ever, landed on the rooftop|Let's get it!|||Do you feel like movin', movin'|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Everybody put your hands in the air!|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Everybody put your hands in the air!|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Do you feel like movin', movin'|Everybody put your hands in the air!||I'mma spend it all on you like it's my payday, girl|Have you sipped your finest, 'cause it's Thursday, girl|Let's hit the club, let's hit the club|Let's hit the club, let's hit the club|So, I'mma make it look like it's your birthday, girl|Keep it up, don't keep it on the low|Bam-ti-bam the party on the floor|All my people on the there, come|There's a party over here, say||(Daddy keep the party)||Do you feel like movin' movin'|Do you feel like movin' movin'|Do you feel like movin' movin'|Everybody put your hands in the air!|Do you feel like movin' movin'|Do you feel like movin' movin'|Do you feel like movin' movin'|Everybody put your hands in the air!|
