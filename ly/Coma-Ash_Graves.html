		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I'm a victim of a story 
But the plot twists bore me
Am I afraid that they'll ignore me
Is this thing recording
Cause I got a lot on my mind but no time
to deal with these issues the shit that I went through
I want a high I can't find
And I just need to stop
Tell me where to go
I've been losing consciousness it's out of my control
And i'm slipping away
Can't tell if i'm awake 
Suffering is easy when i'm sleeping through the pain
Keep me in a coma
Keep me in a coma

Please don't pull the plug
Just pump me full of drugs
Let me dream forever cause its better when i'm numb
Leave me in a coma

Feeling nothing make it easy
For me to slip away into the madness
Barely breathing
I let it all surround me
I lose my mind maybe run out of time
To deal with these issues the shit that I went through
I want a high I can't find
I just need to stop
Tell me where to go
I've been losing consciousness it's out of my control
And i'm slipping away
Can't tell if i'm awake 
Suffering is easy when i'm sleeping through the pain

Please don't pull the plug
Just pump me full of drugs
Let me dream forever cause its better when i'm numb
Leave me in this state
I'm better off this way
A danger to myself every second i'm awake
Leave me in a coma
Keep me in a coma

And I don't wanna settle down
Feeling like i'm gonna drown 
Never wanna come around
Leave me in a coma

Please don't pull the plug
Just pump me full of drugs
Let me dream forever cause its better when i'm numb
Leave me in this state
I'm better off this way
A danger to myself every second i'm awake
Leave me in a coma
