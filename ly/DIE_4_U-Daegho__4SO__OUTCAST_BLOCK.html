Ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

We could waste all our time together
Vibes right when I'm with you
This life don't last forever
I'm tryna spend mine with you
I been filling my mind with you
If it came down to it then baby I swear I'd die for you
I would die for you
Ooh
Got me like 
Ooh
Die for you
Ooh
Got me like 
Ooh 
Die for you

These days I know you got options
On God you hold my heart hostage
Sometimes I swear you're so toxic
Late night, studio locked in
As of lately
Swear you walk around town like you hate me now
And I know a few people they tryna take me down
So if I ever lose you who gon' save me now?

Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na

Ooh na-na
Ooh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

We could waste all our time together
Vibes right when I'm with you
This life don't last forever
I'm tryna spend mine with you
I been filling my mind with you
If it came down to it baby I swear I'd die for you
I would die for you

When I'm with you baby it feels like I'm floating
Get lost in your eyes, I get lost in the moment
When you smile, the world stops in slow motion
But to know that you're the chosen one, I got ask you

Would you die for me like I'd die for you
Would you sacrifice yourself
If it came down to it and they caught me
Would you stay or would you let go?
Roll the dice of life, yeah I know
Love's a dangerous game on your soul
Take a chance on me
I'll take a chance on you
And let the universe take control

Ooh nanana-na-na-na-na-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh na-na-na-na-na-na-ah
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na
Ooh na

I can't keep myself away from your love, my obsession
Can't get enough, you're sent from heaven
I'd die for you baby, would you die for me?
