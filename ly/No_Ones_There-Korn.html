		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  You and me, we have no faces
Soon our lives will be erased
Do you think they will remember?
Or will we just be replaced?

Oh I wish that I could see
How I wish that I could fly
Far from things that hang above me
To a place where I can cry

So why can it be?
No one hears me call
Echoes back at me
No one's there

To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life
To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine
You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind
I know it's time to leave these places far behind

You and me, we have no faces
They don't see us anymore
Without love as they had promised
And no faith for what's in store

Oh, I wish that I could see
How I wish that I could fly
Far from things that hang above me
To a place where I can cry

So why can it be?
No one hears me call
Echoes back at me
No one's there

To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life
To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine
You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind
I know it's time to leave these places far behind

Where are all these feelings hiding? Dancing in and out my mind
Burning up all that I long for, feeding me to my decline
Where are you? My soul is bleeding, I am searching, am I blind?
All alone and bound forever, trapped inside me for all time

To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life
To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine
You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind
I know it's time to leave these places far behind

To all these nameless feelings I can't deal with in my life
To all these greedy people trying to feed on what is mine
You've got to fill your hunger and stop fucking with my mind
I know it's time to leave these places far behind
