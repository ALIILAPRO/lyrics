		  Ride for a ride, kill for a kill
Yeah, my bitch off a pill (pill)
I don't do no chill (no)

'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill?
My bitch got Chanel (Chanel)
Ride up dolo wit' a steel (yeah)
Glock made of steel (steel)
I don't do no deals
Shut up, ho (shut up, ho)
Shut yo' mouth, keep it sealed (sealed)
I count me up one mil' (one mil')
That's your shorty? I'ma drill (drill) (what up?)
Range Rover, Jansport
Walk up out the airport (what up? What up?)
I feel just like a plane 'cause
Bitch, I'm fly as shit (what up?)
My bitch fly as shit (what up?)
My car fly as shit
My gang fly as shit (oh)

'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Wait)
'Cause since when did we chill? (Huh)
My bitch got Chanel (Chanel)
Ride up dolo wit' a steel (yeah)
Glock made of steel (steel)
I don't do no deals
Shut up, ho (shut up, ho)
Shut yo' mouth, keep it sealed (sealed)
I count me up one mil' (one mil')
That's your shorty? I'ma drill (drill) (what up?)
Range Rover, Jansport
Walk up out the airport (what up? What up?)
I feel just like a

Biohazard motherfucker pull up with a hazmat (okay)
All these boys selling stock from the NASDAQ (what's up?)
Leave your ball wit' yo' bitch on the damn bat (okay)
If she cums, she ain't neva gonna come back (what's up?)
A thousand degrees
Have a bitch from Berlin that say she never will leave
Travelin' like a nomad, partin' the seas
Shoot him in the wave 'til I part his seas
Scratching at the wound like the part itchy (okay, okay)

What the fuck you niggas talkin' 'bout?
Tie 'em up, put the gun in his dirty Goddamn mouth (what?)
What the fuck these niggas barkin' 'bout?
Got range, got aim like I'm raised in the damn South (what?)
Make it pop for the movie
Just ran through, takin' pictures with the groupies (okay)
Car bulletproof, totin' motherfuckin uzis (okay)
If you got a problem, nigga, come and fuckin' shoot me (okay)

'Cause since when I did not kill? Did not drill? (what?)
Since when I rode my wheels (what?)
Skirted off, then I peel (damn)
Need more kills
Since when I did not kill?
'Cause since when I did not kill? Did not drill? (what?)
Since when I rode my wheels (what?)
Skirted off then I peel (damn)
Need more kills
Since when I did not kill?
