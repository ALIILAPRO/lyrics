		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		<p>
		  I was with my friends
We missed the last train
Ran into your friends
And they pretended
Like nothing had changed
Like everything's alright

I should've texted
Before I called you
I sent you a message
Maybe you missed it
Or it never went through
But it's been one of those nights

Oh, I know it's late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it's foolish but

I don't wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you've been lately 
I don't wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we'll ever be together someday and
I don't need anything from you
And I know it's a little too soon
But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once
And I just wanna see you

Nobody said this
Would ever be easy
The way that we left it
Would have such an influence on me
Wish I could turn back time

Oh, I know it's late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it's foolish but

I don't wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you've been lately (I do)
I don't wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we'll ever be together someday and
I don't need anything from you
And I know it's a little too soon (too soon)
But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once
And I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you, yeah
I just wanna see you

Ooh, I know it's late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it's foolish but

I don't wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you been lately (I do)
I don't wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we'll ever be together someday and
I don't need anything from you
And I know it's a little too soon (too soon)
But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once
And I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
